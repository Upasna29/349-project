NOT. BUY. THIS.\n\nThere have been performance issues since the very beginning and not a single thing seems to have been done about it except constant "well it works on our pc's" and a single patch that noone who was complaining about issues seems to find did a damn thing. Dev responses have dropped to literally nothing on most. Oh but they will respond to anyone new asking how the game runs and then tell them that their have been no complaints after this first patch WHEN THE COMPLAINTS FROM BEFORE IT ARE STILL VALID AND HAVE YET TO BE FIXED.\n\nIf you already bought this game, I advise you to request a refund from steam. Do NOT give a developer who is this distant and clearly doesn't give a damn your time or your money. Anyone who has been complaining along with me for the few months, supposedly steam is giving refunds for older titles with special consideration. I suggest giving them a shot. I personally won't because even though I feel ripped off I still will accept the bad purchase I made.\n\nHopefully this stops people from being burned.","June 9, 2015","false","0.8"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","39","44","4","0"

The poor optimization, not-so-fluid animations, and the constant crashing made me quit the game five minutes in.  When the developers decide to fix the game and make it playable, I'll be happy to revisit it.  For now, it's most certainly not worth $15.  Play the free game that came before this (One Late Night) on Desura instead.\n\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/one-late-night\n\nEdit: Gave the game another go after being informed of a patch.  The crashing as stopped and the average FPS went from 20-30 to 30-40, so the game has improved some.  I still find the animations to be a bit mechanical (not fluid or natural) and the headbobbing while running makes me extremely dizzy.  Both Amnesia and Outlast have better graphics, clock in at $20, and provide 4-8 hours of gameplay, so I'll hold off on further judgement as far as worth is concerned until I can determine how long this game actually is.\n\n---\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYATQoLfsm0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWNrfJZ0fp4","December 31, 2014","false","1.0"," 64 of 91 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","64","91","6","12"

Just tried playing more to  give this game another try. Still ♥♥♥♥. the graphics even on the highest setting are atrocious and glitchy. the lights blink in and out of excistance depending on the angle you look at them. items spawn only right as your about to bump into them, and the lighting looks like someone borrowed the bloom out of oblivion and then doubled it. Running is worthless, it is actually the first game to get me motion sick, as when you run your vision locks straight a head aside from some sharp V bobbing.  When you go to get a soda from the machine or use a keycard it just seems to choose a random position and then flail around. directions for the game are almost non-excistant, "Find out what the scream was" or some other objective. first thing you find is a locked door and you need a keycard. opened every stupid drawer, door, cabinate and whatever else with no luck before i quit.\n\nThe design just doesnt look good either. Sinks in counter tops, when  you open the cabinate under them the cabinate is empty. Not even showing the sink sticking down into it, pipes, or anything, so evidently the water just pours into another dimension. In the halls pillars stand in the middle of the walk way, meeting rooms are more cramped then closets, and for some reason, several of the bathrooms have the toilets blocking the door.\n\nThe controls are dreadful, as mentioned with running, they are clunky and clumbsy otherwise, the mouse at times seems to drag as if the batteries are dying, or zip about like a humming bird on cocaine. trying to select something means getting it EXACTLY int he middle of the screen, which is harder then it sounds as your just sort of guessing and fighting the mouses grand maul seizures.\n\nI'll admit, i quit after only a while as it was unplayable, in the controls were horrible, and even worse IT WAS BORING!! So hearing of how its suppose to be scary, (the only thing that i saw was one of the hallucinations from System Shock 2, a much more interisting, tense, and scary game thats only 10 dollars here on steam) i went and watched some videos. Ghost hunters has more scares.\n\nNow, i dont mean to rag on the developer, took a risk and put a game out. Just seems it needed a bit more polish and planning. But in all truth and honesty, i cant suggest getting the game.","December 31, 2014","false","0.8"," 40 of 59 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","40","59","5","3"

Activating "keycard scanners" zooms your view straight into the nearest wall (I guess the "idea" was to zoom the view to the keycard scanner, but welp), and the elevators simply do not work (the first one I tried seemed to have a wall in front of it, the other one just spit me out in the middle of the lobby, as if I glitched through a wall and a floor). This absolutely kills whatever interest the moody (and actually fairly-well voice-acted - a nice surprise) opening helped ignite.\n\nIt's absolutely unfathomable that a developer would consider a game in this state "ready for release" - and beyond that, actually insulting to me as a consumer. Definitely would recommend avoiding Black Curtain Studio's further games.","May 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

The camera zoomed in and crashed into his head a la Goldeneye 64. After the AI walked into the building for me, I was in control. My objectives told me that I was to go to my office. I sprinted to the third floor. I say sprinted, but running in this game is the speed of slow walking and walking is the speed of an elderly person recovering from hip surgery.\n\nUpon reaching my office, I picked up a paper from the desk and spent the next 5 minutes walking around the office trying to figure out how to fax it to the client. Eventually, I figured out that I wasn't standing in the exact place I needed to be while clicking the fax machine and it wasn't registering.\n\nWith that objective complete, I went to make some coffee. Coffee machines function as save points. However, in order to save, you must watch the coffee brew in real time. It's great standing in one spot for 30 seconds, unable to move, while a fresh, hot cuppa joe brews for you. As I was about to take a sip, I heard a scream from the second floor. What could be wrong?\n\nI plodded to the second floor and stepped through a door, wandering the hall full of pitch dark offices, searching for what made the sound. Oh no! A spooky witch! Oh, it's gone. Back to walking. I'm getting tired. I'd better go drink some soda. Oh, the door is locked and I can't get back to the vending machines. I spent the next 10 minutes searching random desk drawers, each step slower than the last until I finally passed out from exhaustion and died. Fantastic.\n\nPros:\n+ Nobody is forcing you to play this game.\n+ Characters have noodle arms\n\nCons:\n- Terrible framerate\n- Mouse sensitivity is either way too high or way too low.\n- Pop-in loading and invisible objects abound\n- The worst lighting I have ever seen in any game\n- Everything else\n\nAvoid this game at all costs.","May 8, 2015","false","1.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","0"

One Late Night was amazing, I loved it, so when I heard they were making a sequel, I was really excited. Then one day I saw it had released and immediatly bought it.\n\nBut it wasn't what I expected.\n\nHorrific frame rate, menus I couldn't close, unclear objectives, everything. I very rarely say this, but this game was bad. I tried to be optimistic, but the game is so broken I just couldn't deny the truth. This game would not, and could not, live up to the predecessors potential.\n\nIf you do read this, Black Curtain, I do have something good to say. The voice acting and story (as much of it as I could find) was great, so why did you focus on story only? This would have been better as a book, because books don't glitch out or skip load times into a level you already passed. Maybe if you remake the actual gameplay, so that it's functional, I would consider playing this game again, but for now, this is quite literally the worst game i've ever played. WORSE than Ride to Hell: Retrebution or Air Control, because those game are hilariously bad. This is just...\n\nDepressingly bad.

I studied Game Development and during my time as student, I have seen first year students create better game prototypes within 6 months (some of them even in Unity) then BCS did here. So the “small team/no budget” card is no excuse for me.\n\nOne Late Night Deadline ask for nearly as much as Outlast, which is an indie title developed by AAA veterans who are able to deliver a certain quality level. Even if BCS would have managed an at least bug free, stable FPS version of One Late Night, the overall quality would not even be near to a title like Outlast (with production costs of 1,4 millions of dollar).\n\nAs already mentioned, the FPS is a clear no go in this game. Even on lowest settings the game does not run smooth, but this was already mentioned over and over.\n\nWhat is another major killer for me in this game, is the whole game design. I have played the free prequel which had some issues as well, but at least it was able to transport an interesting and scary atmosphere. Just to boost things up and create a bigger environment does not create a better overall experience. Most of the time, I really had no idea what to do, and if I knew, what, I did not know "why".  I would recommend the developer to study some game designing techniques first and get a good grasp of how to create a more enjoyable experience for the player before asking for money.\nMost people like indie games for their brave and unusual ideas and mechanics, but One Late Night Deadline does not offer any of this. The whole project was set up far to big and ambitious without the knowledge of even the most important basics in nearly all areas.\n\nIf Black Curtain studio would have invested their time to take the prequel game and polished it’s content and features and then sell this version for around 5 to 10 dollars, I am pretty sure, they would have been able to create a very fine and enjoyable game.\n","March 12, 2015","false","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First, I would like to point out that I originally gave this game a positive review because I thought several graphical issues like low FPS would be fixed in update 1.1. However, this does not appear to be the case. While many things were changed in update 1.1, there are still several issues with this, like being able to fix the vending machine BEFORE you find the phone (which, there is no objective as far as I know to getting the phone before you go to the room in which it is in, so it is already hard to find), which completely messes up the storyline and what the heck you are doing. Also, I am almost certain I save in a certain spot, and it takes me all the way back to where you first get coffee on the third floor. (Though I could be wrong.) However, that being said, 1.1 also brought many new elements to the game, like the scary man appearing in new places. However, the lady constantly appears in the office when I try to use the fax machine, which can get annoying. All in all, the game is NOT bad. However, it needs to have several things be fixed and tweaked, along with the graphics issues fixed. Until then, I would wait for this game to be fixed.\n\nThis next section only applies to the people who are giving this game lots of hate.\n\nWhile I am dissapointed with this game in several ways, I am also dissapointed to the way people have reviewed this game. For example, reviews such as: "Just Nasty!" (Yes, that is a quote.) are offensive to the developer of this game. Yes, while he does need to work on several things on the game, it doesn't give anyone the right to be rude about it. (To be honest, the "Funny" review function on Steam was a mistake.)","February 1, 2015","false","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
