As one who played the original Cabela's Dangerous Hunts, I was disappointed in the lack of any free style hunt, purchaseable weaponry/clothing/tools, and the lack of variety in how the animals act toward you. The predators become relatively predictable, and your character can become nearly immortal just by dodging every single lion that jumps at you like it's no big deal. Not very realistic. Not very pretty. Not all that fun. Not a game one should buy.","December 10, 2013","false","6.7"," 119 of 136 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","119","136","0","4"

It makes the worst hunting simulator I've ever experienced.  You'll start the game off following Dad and Brother through some ugly woods, trying to track a bear that's been giving you trouble.  You'll get attacked by unrealistic wolves, have a cut-scene fight with your whiny brother, and eventually watch a melodramatic moment of a bear attack. Of course, not before you learn the hotkey for some bizarre Xray vision they called "Hunter's Eye," or something along those lines.  The next chapter leads you through this wild ride through Africa that gave me so much secondhand embarrassment that I called it quits then and there.  I couldn't handle the absurdity of it.  Honestly, if you're looking for a good giggle, you should Youtube the gameplay to see what I'm talking about.\nI like the idea of having an actual plotline, as opposed to other hunting games in the past that simply teach you the trigger button and leave you to your own devices.  It's just that the entire gameplay, from the controls all the way to the unimaginitive ambiance, makes it so poorly mediocre that I even wonder why I'm taking the time to tell you what I liked about it. The dislike heavily outweighed everything else.  At least, it was on sale when it was purchased.

Aiming feels jumpy and uncontrollable. So far every "hunt" seems to involve responding to an attack by an animal or group of animals.

Firstly, the graphics are atrocious. Secondly, this is not a hunting game, this is a first person,"kill everything you see regardless of what it is" type of game. Thirdly, with bad voice acting, a minimal at best storyline, and a grand total of 4 usable weapons, it can be concluded that this game is simply not worth 30 dollars. This game is worth, at most, half of its actual price, especially considering the campaing takes just two hours to complete. I have heard positive things about Cabela's Pro Hunts, so explore that option, but not this one.","October 13, 2014","false","2.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RisingHigh/recommended/218860/","RisingHigh","Maise Potato-Head Williams","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RisingHigh/","229 products in account","I purchased this game because when I was young I played the Dangerous Hunts series on PS2. Those games were pretty terrible, and my friends and I would laugh and joke the entire time while running over deer in our ATVs and watching mooses fight grizzly bears. Expecting a nostalgiac bad game I couldnt wait to play this.  What I discovered upon playing it was not that it was terrible, but somehow several times worse than the previous installments.\n\nThe game opens with a story background about how your brother and your dad hunt together and some zombie bear kills your dad. For what its worth the voice acting is exceptional given the rest of the game. Truly the people hired for this deserve some credit. Anyway the first thing I noticed was that your default weapon is a deagle and there were health pickups laying around. The scopes are unusable, the AI is horrible, all the enemies are reskins of eachother. When a 'boss' hyena spawned it was scaled up with noticable pixelation and a red filter over its textures like something youd see on an octorock from the original zelda game. To top it all off animals despawn instantly when killed, you fight droves at once and for the first two level of the game the mouse sensativity on the X and Y axis were different causing loads of control problems, but this along with the graphics fixed themselves after the beginning levels. I dont know anything about game design but id like to know exactly how that happened.\n\nWell the game is horrible sure, but why am I recommending it? Well the game is so ♥♥♥♥ing abyssmal that it transcends why you would play a game. Its like watching Troll 2 or Birdemic. You dont want to give money away for those but they are just so horrible that you must witness it yourself. You need to find out how something like this could come to exist in the first place, why people were payed to create it.  I personally believe that this particular game was commisioned by Cabela's and Cabela's was going to pay a low sum to the company. The company accepted the low bid, or Cabela's backed out and changed what they'd pay after the company began work. What resulted in this game was a joke by the developers in response to the low payout.\n\nWhat you get is a game where packs of hyenas attack you at the same time as water buffalo, hippopotamus boss battles and health packs. You find fire bullets to load into your twelve shot desert eagle. The mission i left off on was - I kid you not - A flashback story mission where I had to save my brother's life from a pack of wolves that got stuck outside of their spawn location thus breaking the 'boss battle' and forcing me to restart the level. Anyway I just couldnt find the energy to replay the level so I've yet to progress further..\n\nNow to summarize my reccommendation, this game isnt good. However that is percisely why its great. Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013 is such an abject disaster that I personally think it should be given to sick and dying people of all ages. Those young and without hope will be able to laugh and rejoice at even with their limited knowledge the game is nothing like real life. The eldery who may have many regrets about accomplishments will be able to play the game and rejoice, knowing that regardles of what they've done in their time on this Earth they have not created this game.\n\n9/10 score overall, I found myself smiling throughout the entire playthrough. A wonderful satire of video games and I suppose hunting as well.","July 7, 2014","true","1.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

If you run out of ammo or get tired of shooting at running animals just turn your back at them, they CANNOT attack you if you don't face them. Then repeat until they're all dead (for now).\n\n\nSPOILER\n\nIt was cool to see the game add a lot of emotional backstory with your family/main character as you hunt the animal that killed innocent people which turns out to be a mythical animal.\n\n\nGreat graphics for it's time and also being a Cabela's game, I really enjoyed it!\n\n9/10","September 2, 2015","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You and your brother, Justin Bieber, were out hunting with your dad when suddently he gets killed by a giant bear or something.  Because of this, you are now in africa to take revenge on every single one of God's creatures, like lions and elephants armed with a Desert Eagle, an excellent weapon for hunting and 143091814814u431287 magazines of ammunition. There is also some stuff later on about a BLACK lion who kills humans, but I haven't bothered playing so far yet. There are also rail shooting parts where you shoot 100s of animals from a car because thats how every respectalbe hunter does.","September 19, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

Don't think I would have paid for Dangerous Hunts but as far as the action shooting goes it's good. No need to run just walk and shoot with your infinite ammo. Hit "V" to auto spin to face Dangerous animal, shoot brain or heart as they leap for you. Pump rhinos full of lead.

It is made as an arcade type of gameplay, I can just imagine this inside an arcade machine with two guns attached for 2 players.\nTha`s why I gave it thumbs up, it is just that and no more.
