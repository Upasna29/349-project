There has been a model for standard FTP games to gain revenue and this game is no exception to that rule.  I'll try to break the game down as best as I can though and then you can make your own decision whether to give it a go:\n\nPositives:\n- The gameplay is actually fun and addictive, I had never played Rise of Mythos or Kings and Legends so a card battle game where you place the card based characters on the battlefield in lines marching against each other is fun as hell and addictive.\n- The art is actually really nice so kudos to whoever draws and designs the card characters.\n- A full chat system and guild system gives you the ability to make friends to challenge card dungeons and share battle tips.\n- The leveling system on cards is interesting - as you play you use the mats you obtain to level up the cards stats using the Alchemist and level up your own weapon and health using the Blacksmith.\n- There are a few different classes much like Hearthstone:  Priest, Mage, Rogue.. etc.  So if you've played a CCG like Hearthstone before it plays somewhat similarily.\n- PVP 1v1 with rankings and PVP 2v2 are available.  There is also a training mode that you can go in with guildies to practice and hone your skills.\n\nNegatives:\n-  Unfortunately, because it is FTP you can Pay To Win Faster.  You will eventually be able to get the same cards even if you don't pay but you will have to play much longer.  This will make doing the daily for PVP to get gold coins a bit more difficult when you haven't sunk real cash and that's a huge turn off for a lot of people.  If you dump some cash into the game you will probably have a few max level rares and legendaries in your deck over the beginning player which will give you an advantage.\n-  The launch and first couple of days of this game the Servers were perpetually down in the day so there have been constant black screens. Very bad for US audiences.  I don't want to jinx it but as of 3/27/2016 it has been stable the past few days so this seems to be one negative that has been resolved!\n- There have been complaints in the community about people putting money in and not getting gold.  Devs are aware of the issue and have updated that they are working on fixing the problem.\n\nNow comes the hard part - Yes or No.  For me I've been enjoying the actual game and there isn't anything like it on steam so I'll give it a yes.  I'd really love to see a game like this that was fair with a flat fee.   This game is dangerously close to No because of server instability, PTWfaster, etc.","March 23","true","69.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

If you like CCG.\nDoes micro transactions make this game pay to win? - Yes..... kind of..... thing is if you are all about being nr1 in pvp than yes nolifers vs moneybags = moneybags win. Usually top 1-30 are buyers and top 2 guilds are filled with buyers. But as game is kinda forcing you to join guild to compleate all dailys etc than as long as you find or create guild with active members you wont be bored and even more with good teams you can kick ♥♥♥ of buyers as well not often but every time you do that it is a pleasure.\n+ teaming up can boost your ranking especialy if u can play when online is relatively low so top 10 isn't impossible with good friends.\n\nOverall game is worth to try. Really important in how good guild your gona join and how active friends u can make as thats like 60% of game here. Sad ofcourse that buyers are so OP most of the time as it ruins a bit of fun in pvp.\n\n","March 25","true","24.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Then you have different classes with different abilities, spells and so on. And you use ingredienses to upgrade your cards, and the games has a lot of PVE if you don't like PVP.\nMany opportunies and many ways of building your deck.\nYes this is a pay to win, but do you really need to use money to become good? No or that depends on your skills. Everyone can get EVERY card, the money just makes it easier and faster that is all.\nSo yes in PVP you will sometimes meet some really strong players with many strong cards who will crush you. But luckily that is only a handful who are the real pay to win guys, so if you have no craving for becoming the top 1 player in PVP and spending no money, then there should be no problem for you. :)\n\nI highly recommend this game even though it is a pay to win and somewhat browser like game. The game still has some bugs and there was especielly in the beginning but the devs are working on that and there are NO blackscreen anymore besides when the server has maintance :)\n\nAlso which I must say is really good about this game especielly if you are in a dungeon with your guildmates and you have to be AFK, well there is a autobutton where the AI will play on your behalf :) (of course the AI is quite stupid but it mostly get the job done and better than you are not playing any cards at all :P)\n\nIf you want to know more, just write to me here on steam or find me ingame UnholyLight :)","March 30","true","252.2"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

"Hurr Durr! P2W!! All games should be free!! Me no like energy bar! Game plays on Iphone and FAceBOok! Games should be only on STEAM!! RAWR!" You get the idea. I've played many CCGs from Kingdoms, to Hearthstone, to Infinite Wars and more, and the truth is after giving this game a fair shake its not nearly as bad as many say it is.\n\nLooking at the card quality ladders, and the means of attaining epic and rare cards, yes, people who pay money will ADVANCE FASTER then people who don't, but that's hardly unexpected when the game has to actually make money in order to stay viable. Rare, Epic, and Legendary cards can still be attained without money through standard coin packs, frequent events, arena, and through grinding. Also, in order to keep common cards vialble in the late game, you are able to upgrade them to very effective cards relatively early on wihout the need to pay any money. It's all a matter of how you utilize your time, resources, and the strategy with your decks. That being said, there is a VIP system, as there is in almost ANY card game like this, but again, its to help people advance faster than it is to help them win. And seriously, if you end up likeing the game, why wouldn't you pay five dollars? I've paid more for single player games which don't engange me nearly as much.\n\nAs for many of the claims of the developers failing on launch. Yes, they had a very rocky start in trying to optimize this game for steam, but they are on top of it and working with the player base in an attempt to make the game better and more approachable. Having just aquired the hosting rights to this game from R2 games, the current content is a bit bare bones, which is where R2 left it, but the developers have already promised expanded content in the future.\n\nThe game itself is simply fun, and much of the community is quite open and considerate (you'll always have the trolls though, there's no escaping them). Even if you feel every game should always be free, this game costs nothing to try and promises a good amount of fun if you do. If you end up not likeing it the worst you'll suffer is an uninstall and a mildly entertaining lunch break.","March 28","true","63.7"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","0"

This game was made for PC and Browsers back before Mobile gaming even had moved to Touch Screen Devices at all.\n\nIt's both silly and irritating when people are claiming that Mobile is some "Patient 0" type of thing that is infecting PC games.  Pay to Win was invented on PC games.\n\nThe Mobile games that do look and work like this one were made to follow in the footsteps of the PC and Browser games created like this.  They didn't make these trashy games that then came to PC, they just copied the trashy games that were already on PC and clueless people who had no idea that hundreds of online games existed outside of the few they played think these are coming from Mobile now.\n\nThis very specific game engine and same exact game with very minor changes existed in three different forms on PC and Browsers first and foremost.  I'm sure the clueless people who think this comes from Mobile will really enjoy downvoting this review, but it doesn't change the fact that this is from a PC and Browser game.\n\nOn to the game itself - other than the facts of where it comes from that people are getting wrong, they are very right about what kind of game it is.  This is general pay to win with timers, VIP levels, and things like buying card draws that greatly affect your strength (but are usually weak unless you spend a great amount of money).  This game was created at the height of Pay to Win on "Free to Play" Browser games.  While you may get a fresh new server here, it's still the same pay to win formula.\n\nYou can have some fun with free but it's more about buying cards than any strategy placing them.  The game will trick you at first and make it seem like it has to do with strategy, but it changes to be based on having high tier pay cards later on.\n\nThis specific version here is even worse than the old Browser versions as it gives you a nice big black screen instead of launching a lot of the time.  You should probably consider yourself lucky if you're getting that black screen - you just had some time and frustration saved.\n\n*If* you are a Whale however that likes Pay to Win and spends thousands of dollars on them (there are many many of those people out there) - then yes I highly suggest this game to you and you'll probably absolutely love the system here.  As for the general player I'd not really suggest it and that's why I'm having to downvote, but if you are a whale go right ahead and enjoy the game.  It's definitely made for you suckers who pay out the nose in order to come out on top.","March 21","false","0.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

(bear in mind the hours shown are 'Steam' hours and are mostly me logging in, doing 45seconds of stuff and tabbing out to play a different game)\n\nYes, it is pay to win. You can start a new account, jump the mandatory newbie stuff, drop money on the game and literally buy your way to pvp victory.\n\nHowever.\n\nThey've made the paywall as hideously scummy as possible. If you want to pay real money to buy stuff, YOU the player do not choose how much you pay. There are VIP 'levels' each on is locked by an amount of Real World $$ you spend.\nExamples...\n\nYou would like to automatically use gold to purchase missing components to upgrade your weapons in the blacksmith. Even if you have saved up 1,000 gold (~$7.50) you cannot use that feature unless you have first paid $20.00 to achieve VIP 3 status.\n\nYou would like to buy missing dust/gems to enchant a card (you're missing 2 dust from the 1,800 cost?) excellent, you need to have first already have paid $70.00 for VIP 5 status or you could just re-do the level 1 tutorial mission and get 5 dust for free.\n\nWould you like to buy some in game currency? (silver coins)  Sure thing, that'll cost 240 gold to buy 10,000 silver (so about $2.40). Okay, that's the most basic thing of ALL pay 2 play games. As long as you spend $10.00 you will gain the right to purchase in game currency.\n\nThis game is not Pay to Play. It's Pay to have the ability to Pay to Pay to Play.\n\nThe free part of this game is not bad, the cards are fun (and totally unbalanced, everyone uses exactly the same core cards) The system of upgrading and boosting cards is really good, but very slow, unless you spend ~$70-90 to unlock the ability to purchase the upgrades flat out.\nThe battles are good and move well.\n\nBut... It's a flash game in a flash window. No feedback if there is server maintenance or if they're down. Randomly disconnects you (on the plus, when you reconnect you don't 'lose' your battle, you just rejoin)\n\nDon't get this game unless you want a slow paced Collectible Card Game.\n\n\n{{ORIGINAL REVIEW ON RELEASE : A half made Flash game, they haven't even bothered to take out the default comments in the flash config files.\n\nBut if you need a blank black window to run Steam Overlay in, this is the app for you.\n[EDIT] They resolved the black screen issue.\n\nThen while I was trying to give it a fair shake of the stick, they announced a server shutdown, (scrolling text along a tiny bar at the top) and before the text "We regret ...." the servers disconnected and booted players.\n\nI'm really trying to give this game a fair go, but so far it's a poorly coded Flash Air game that would be better suited to Kongregate or Android Google store, where games do not pass quality assurance.}}","March 21","false","91.9"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greywardenrogue/recommended/426970/","greywardenrogue","trivan_23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greywardenrogue/","204 products in account","This game was originally a browser-based CCG called SUMMONER'S LEGION, and from what I've seen of this version so far, they've changed very little beyond the loading screens. (Some of the card packs still faithfully read "Summoner's Legion" instead of "Age of Magic".) Despite that, I'll say that my friends and I very much enjoyed my time with it when it was a browser game.\n\nThe gameplay is traditional, but your cards are constantly moving towards your opponent like they're on a treadmill. It means quick games, interesting strategy, and some fun PvP/PvE if you have a friend to play with. It has a lot of the familiar F2P trappings, but I actually found the permanent benefits for any cash purchases to be fair in comparison to other CCGs I've played. (Though, the fact that there are benefits for people who spend upwards of $100,000+ is absurd.)\n\nHowever, SUMMONER'S LEGION was abandoned without a word for it, and I've seen little indication that any of the many improvements that it needed as a browser game have been made for its Steam release. I would've expected, at the very least, a graphical overhaul now that it's free of browser limitations.\n\nSo while I would say that the game is definitely addicting, just beware. The last iteration of this game was cast aside, and it's essentially a browser game being dressed up like a full release.","March 21","true","0.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

There are four classes with different advantages and 6 weapons each. You need to tweak out, which cards are good for both your class and its weapon (I recommend priest for newbies). You will find new cards around every corner in the begginings. All have their tactical use and offers fun for a long time. You can enjoy team battles, dungeons, arena, 2vs2 arena and probably more in the future.\n\nIt means, it is generally common card game with something new and better and something old. It requires trying to find out, whether this common style fits u.\n\nIt has some negative sides as well. I won't judge, whether it is p2win or not. I will just tell facts:\n- there are many events, which offer you to gain gold currency\n- there is all fusing material available and easy to harvest\n- people who are VIP (at least 1, it is permanent and costs a bit) will gain double rewards for daily login\n- people who are VIP may get 2 unique cards\n- rewards for reaching bigger grades of VIP are strong cards, but are fully available to anyone\n- VIP can buy unique clothing in the shop, which gives them 2 more HP (clothing bought for free currency give 3 HP in total, so it is much better)\n- there are many events allowing you to get extra cards for free\n- I was strong enough to beat anyone on the servers of R2 (and servers of developer itself are not going to be different)\n- VIP people can Blitz campaigns, which makes them replay the level (or dungeon) just for stamina and get rewards. You will get better rewards if you finish achievements, which is not possible through blitzing.\n- stamina prevents you to play whole night. It will seem awfull in the beginning as you have small stamina poll, but you will have stamina enough later (it will take more than day to refill it on the latest level). Everyone can buy first extra 50 stamina for gold. VIP can buy it more times, but for extra times, which does not worth at all.\n\nI reckon developers have their own way to gain money to sustain servers and develop games, but does no give you a huge advantage. If you pay these 5 dollars for VIP1, you will get enough of everything in my opinion. If you don't, you can become powerfull player as well, but it will take a time.\n\n\n\n\nI will change review if something goes different and won't be the same as I expected and have known. But, these are my experiences.","March 21","true","236.6"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","14","31","3","9"

If you compare this game to Hearthstone, then by the "free to play" definition it is free.  You just need to play/grind longer to catch up to a paying customer.\nhttps://youtu.be/Ckv8padNGGs\n\nPROS:  This has raid battles, while Hearthstone does not.  Battles may seem cooler to some people.\nCONS: Blank screen indicates servers are down.  There is no indicator unless you go to the official website.  Lots of people are complaining that servers are down.  Uh, Hearthstone servers go down too...\n\nAnyways, I will update this review as I play this game more.  I just started recently.\n\nUpdate 3/20/2016:  The blank screen is due to server side lag, or log in problems.  I believe after adding to steam, they did not predict their game would be this popular.  It's currently being overloaded and if you spam logging in.  It will eventually work...  I don't know if that's good advice or not.\n\nUpdate 3/21/2016 :  The Developer admits to server log in problems and gives compansation for our trouble.  This is proof that they care about their customers.

I this 2 weeks steam clocked me 60h and I enjoyed most of it.\n\nI'm not completely sure the experience of new joins "now" will be the same as first week had some really rewarding hot events with goodies to those on early rush. Also the stuff distributed for compensation due to all kinds of issues helped progress.\n\nThe dev team seems producing the usual chaos, the last major patch got rewerted immediately with several hours extra down time, but they definitely shell out a ton of effort across the board. I see hope they learn from all the mistakes too.\n\nThe game itself has a ton of fun elements, way more than I noticed at first glance. I suggest to grow to 10-14 level (probably can happen within a week) as new buildings get unlocked.\n\nThe arena felt massively P2W but in practice turned out not bat really at least no problem to manage the 3 daily wins to fulfill devotion. Paying is not needed for progress and directly buyable stuff is not really relevant unless you drop a shipload of cash. But if you feel for the game I can suggest dropping a few bucks.\n\nI invested in the $10 pack that gets VIP2 level. That is enough to buy the "gold mine" providing 143 gold x 30 days; add 20 daily free blitz possibilities that is good for progress and resources, and doubles daily login gains. Probably $6 for just 800 gold and VIP1 would be enough too. I don;t play paying anything in the future unless there will be some huge benefit (not likely).\n\n--- old review from early days with thumbs down\n\nOver 90% of the time since launch the servers are down and all you get is a black screen. Dev team looks hopelessly incompetent as they wasted an update to not fix either the server issue or even a proper reporting.\n\nIn the small time I had chance to actually play the game was not impressed really -- the base idea is interesting but with multiple players playing it's no longer really turn based, cards don't look very balanced, when you play with or against AI, it's not bright enough.\n\nSo my suggestion is to stay away, there are other ccg/battle games around that actually work.","March 22","true","224.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The biggest issue is to overcome the first steps with "bad" cards and getting a guild best would be one of the top 5. As this game dont have a huge population you would need to be in one of them to make sure you can run most of the dungs and do the daylies. I would recommend to keep playing investing only little money... That keeps the frustration of getting crushed in the arena low. You also can spend huge loads of money ... if you dont have better things to spend your money but that is the point i have most doubts. This game is a game for some time and not for all the time. Spend some time a day on it then close it and do something else dont worry to much if you are not the best on day 1 because there are players playing much more time than you... unless you are a GOD its impossible to beat people that are playing this game much longer than you. The game mechanics are fine and some dungeons have challenginjg Bosses. I would give it a shot to try out if you like it... the best part its free to play.

On one hand, I know that the energy barrier is going to become a big enough of an issue that I'll simply lose interest. On the other, it's actually a pretty well designed and entertaining game for the moment.\n\nIf you want a free to play game with a pretty good PvE experience, Age of Magic is quite satisfactory on the PvE front. There's a few options to choose from including the campaign (which amounts to basically 'fight this. Now fight this. Now fight this.'), dungeons (quite enjoyable with bots or other players as allies), and. . more fighting to farm for stuff.\n\nIt plays like a lane defense game with cards. You have 2-3 lanes that you play cards into, then they walk toward the opponent with little to no consideration of their survival while smashing everything along the way. Special abilities (all of which are passive effects) can alter how a unit works. Legendary cards are more eccentric and have game changing effects, but are fairly difficult to get from the get go. You get one free legendary after playing for a day or two, and you have to scrap together shard pieces of the others to get them. Unless, of course, you buy packs.\n\nOnce again, the energy restriction is actually more of a deterrent than the farming itself. While this game doesn't rob you of your energy as readily as some have in the past, you'll still run out, and you'll still have to go off and find something to do while it's regenerating. But, this is a game that's best in short bursts anyhow, more of a time waster for a lunch break than a game to dedicate your time to.\n\nIf you want to join along for the PvP, well. . You're probably going to be pulling your hair out. Be prepared to have a cadre of basic cards and go up against people with a fairly well rounded card collection. Including legendaries. Lots, and lots, of legendaries. So unless you want to dump lots of money into the game for the sake of having cards to PvP with, I highly suggest playing something else. The PvE does provide a steady stream of general purpose cards, but if you're playing for free, you're going to have to get the cheese grater ready for your face, 'cause you're going to be grinding 'til the break of dawn for the interesting cards.\n\nFor what it's worth, it was an enjoyable waste of my time, for what little I experienced it. I played as a free to play player for seven hours and had a good time. Perhaps others will play more in the long term than I have.\n\nImportant!\n-----------\nSomething to bear in mind is class selection at the beginning. Do research on the classes before you choose one, because that's the class you're going to have for a while. You have to unlock the others with in game currency with a substantial increase in cost with each class unlocked.  This is just silly, and is really the only thing I absolutely find irritating about the game. It'd be easier to know which one you want to play before you even begin, to save yourself the time and trouble.\n\nI started as a priest and unlocked ranger roughly four hours in. The next unlock doubled in cost. Bear in mind that I used many of the newbie bonuses for achievements and the like to unlock ranger, so all that extra currency is now gone.\n\nI didn't like ranger. Oh well.\n\nFollow Up\n--------------\nAs I had suspected, the energy barrier is impactful in a very negative way. The cost for actions scale upward the further in you go, making the fact you have more energy completely negligable. Also, I see no point in spending money on a game that not only restricts classes behind an in game currency barrier, but also may lock the money I spent behind an ever increasingly tight energy barrier. While my initial thoughts are still valid for those looking for a casual experience, I'm afraid I have to withdraw my recommendation for this game. As long as the energy barrier remains, it will be another money grabbing mobile game not worthy of an average gamer's time.","April 16","false","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

The music is bad (super compressed) and I cannot turn it off.  I cannot go full screen.  In this insufferble tutorial, all you can do is hit the button it tells you to.  It makes me want to break my keyboard and never play this game again.  Multiple matches, on and on, can only hit the button it tells you to.  Then, if you try to do something else, this tilting womans voices tells you to 'Just follow the instructios'.  I learned nothing.  I just wanted to get to a point where I was playing the game.

I've played the R2game version for several years and have 3 high level accounts and our guild used to compete for top 1 spot in pvp until lack of updates killed the population.\n\nThe game will eventually let you be competitive (which cards are locked via paywall depends on publisher; there are several, but while free gold is less available here and costs are higher than R2, you can buy racial packs without being VIP so that's a plus - also R2game version is pretty much dead and unsupported). Just do your daily devotion, join an active guild, do the hot events and learn which quests/dungeons to farm and you'll be fine.\n\nNow for new players, rushing is about the easiest way to go about it. Focus on getting Lupes (1-2 mana), Lyons (3-5 mana), Aves (backstabbers for defense, 2-4 mana) and whatever class cards you have. Add in extra 1-2 mana monsters to round off your deck. I suggest starting as a Ranger or Priest. Rangers can directly damage the enemy player and priests can heal themselves. These two classes are also fairly competent in PvP.\n\nLater on you can branch out to other decks and builds but make sure you have your rush deck handy for minimal headaches while going through the early parts of the game.","June 2","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So im gonna give it a go and give you my thoughts. And also explain why i wont recommend this game to anyone at the moment.\n\nThe gameplay is really fun and addictive, nothing to complain about here. You construct a deck and fight others or NPCs. Together in dungeons or alone in the Campaign. Simple right?\nBut the problem arises the 1v1 arena. At a low level (arena ranking based) balance issues will occur due to high level differences and straight up Deck power. But at higher levels im beginning to see a very big difference in HOW the game is played.\n\nRight now there are two major types of decks played:\nRush decks, and control decks. This does not bother me at all, because games like these always tend to have some strategies that are better thah others. But here comes the reason why this game is not any fun to play, brace yourselves!\n\nTHE DEVS DONT CARE.\nThats right, in other games cards are updated, classes are balanced and tweaked, new cards are added. But in this game? Nope! Nothing of the sort. You heard me right. Since i started playing this game, not ONE change has been made to the\n-Classes (No nerfs, no buffs.)\n-Cards (Like in general, nothing new, no balances, nothing.)\n-Maps (Like sizewise lanewise etc.)\n-The Campaign (No new Campaigns.)\n-The Dungeons (No new dungeons.)\n\nRight about now you must ask yourself, what are the devs doing then!?\nWell right now the only \"new features\" i\'ve seen are some events. And mostly centered around the pay to win part of the game. And that is why i will not recommend this game at the time. I will of course change my review if the devs get of their asses and create some new content. But in my past experience with these games. Not going to happen.\n\nTL;DR:\nDevs are money hungry, dont make new content, 1v1 players (The only content which is fun at the moment is 1v1.) are one trick ponies, and no new cards are coming out to counter the one trick.\n\nI rate the game\n2/10","June 1","false","338.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
