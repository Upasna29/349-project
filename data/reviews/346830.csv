"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joesutton72/recommended/346830/","joesutton72","carpark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joesutton72/","64 products in account","I want to start by saying that I really, REALLY wanted to like this game--and for the first few hours, I really did! Final Fantasy IV was my first (main series) FF game, and therefore one of my favorites. I hadn't played the After Years because I didn't have a system or phone capable of playing it, so I was excited when it was announced on Steam and even pre-ordered it.\n\nThere are quite a few things I do really enjoy about the game, but unfortunately the flaws outweigh the positives.\n\nAs you know, this game has an episodic format. I like how you'll play through each character's own tale--you get to piece together events plaguing the world from each character's perspective. This makes the game's plot intriguing, as you'll want to know "how did this character end up there?!" at the climax of each scenario. And because each character has ample time in the spotlight, they're fleshed out more this time around than the original game. For example, I found Palom and Porom to be much more interesting in this game than FF4, as you get to see how they've grown and changed--and learn about their respective insecurities as much as their ambitions. As others have said, the plot is pretty much fan-fiction tier--but the characterization and development, I think, is really good.\n\nThere is a problem with the episodic format, though: a good 75% of the game is exposition. While it's great to watch events from so many perspectives, and is certainly interesting at the start of the game, 10 hours in you'll be thinking "okay, but where will this all LEAD to?" Once you reach the climax of someone's tale, it ends--which means starting fresh with a new character elseware. While characters will unite later--MUCH later--you spend the majority of the game feeling as though you aren't actually progressing.\n\nI wish they paced the plot differently: have the first 3 or so tales be expositon, the next few "in the middle" of it all, then the last few being a little more climactic. But instead, you play maybe 8 tales that are all happening at the same time before you can progress through the timeline/plot.\n\nAlso, and this might be a spoiler! You don't actually learn anything very significant, plot-wise, until the very end. I'll save you the trouble by saying the antagonist is generic, has no compelling backstory, and you won't learn the enemy's motive until seconds before the final fight. I don't mind that the plot is fanfiction-y, but I do mind that there just isn't a real payoff at the end.\n\nAnd then there's the dungeons. At first, I didn't mind that almost all the dungeons are recycled from FF4. In fact, I kind of like that they didn't change the world too much; after reading others' reviews, I decided to think of this more as an "expansion" than a sequel, knowing that the world would be mostly untouched but with new scenarios. You might care much more than I do about the recycled dungeons, but you probably already know about that.\n\nWhat I didn't know, and what made this game ultimately frustrating, is that within this game alone you will go through certain dungeons over and over and over. I can't tell you how many times they make you go through the underwater passageway--5 or 6, with 3 of those in Edward's tale alone (and back to back, too!). There's also the Lunar Subterraine, but I won't talk about that too much since it might be spoilery to--but let's just say you'll have the layout of that memorized by the time you're finished playing as well. Taking stuff from FF4 and putting it in this game was ok enough, but the way this game makes you do the same exact tasks over and over as different characters (or within the same tale) is unforgiveable and lazy.\n\nThe endgame is also incredibly grindy. Once you're able to form a party with all the characters you've played as, you'll find that they're terribly underleveled, even though they were leveled fine in their respective tales. Grinding + the endless rehashing you'll find in the final dungeon makes this game difficult to win--not because enemies are too tough, but because you'll simply become too bored to want to go any further. It becomes very clear by the end of the game how a great deal of it exists to drag out the length, rather than deliver any interesting playing experience.\n\nSome little "pro" points:\n+ I loved the bands feature, which adds an extra little thing to battles while also making characters' relationships more interesting.\n+ The lunar phases were a neat idea, though I'm not sure they made much of a difference--though I could be wrong.\n+ You'll have different parties in different tales, which means you're always expected to come up with new strategies. For example, you might not have a healer in one tale. Or maybe you have no magic user at all. This might seem annoying, but it can be good to switch things up.\n\nLittle "cons":\n+ Because you begin as a new, low-level character at the start of each tale, you'll spend a good chunk of the game only being able to attack or use the lowest-leveled magic. I spent most of the game with "auto battle" on, because you simply don't have many choices in fights, since no one really has good abilities. And you can imagine that the enemies in the first half or so of every tale are pushovers until the endgame.\n\n\n","June 8, 2015","false","31.4"," 110 of 125 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","110","125","2","0"

Originally released on the wii in episodic format. You would play each part or "tale" following one of the many characters, all of which follow the same story leading to a climax in which everyone will reunite to save the world yet again.\n\nThe release on ios & steam was tossed on the cutting board and sadly it loses most of it's charm in the process. Challenge dungeons that ended each tale were removed from this version. Which leaves you very underdeveloped and geared by the time you reach the final chapter. In episodic format they encouraged you to farm until the next tale was released to the public. But instead of adding a fix they just decided to cut them from this version.\n\nThe second huge disappointment from the steam release is after playing nearly 30 hours through the 9 character tales. You enter the final stages of the game, In which if you have watched any trailers for the game you will see the many many bosses and optional bosses that the game offered you to challenge. In the original release you could fight 12-15 optional bosses in the final dungeons. Which encouraged you to level your party to max level. Some of those included past final fantasy bosses such as Lich (FF1) Kraken (FF1) even Ultima weapon (FF6). All of these have been removed from the game, leaving the final dungeon quite barren.\n\nA good handful of achievements from this game are also luck based and require you to literally farm for potentially hundreds of hours for items that are obsolete and not necessary since the optional content was all removed.\n\nSo even after all that, I leave the game with a positive review only because of the nostalgic strings it pulls, I enjoyed my playthough. But if you want to experience the game in it's entirety I suggest you purchase a copy of Final Fantasy IV The Complete Collection on PSP or Vita.","December 13, 2015","true","60.1"," 67 of 80 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","67","80","0","9"

It's not great, but it's not terrible either. I ultimately decided to give it a positive rating because I want players to focus on the good (which it has loads of) and not the bad (just a few things). Ultimately, it's Steam. If a game has questionable ratings/reviews that make you hold off on taking the plunge and purchasing the game, just wait for a sale. They happen pretty often. With that said, let's move on!\n\nFinal Fantasy IV: The After Years is a continuation/sequel to Final Fantasy IV that was originally released as a downloadable title for the Nintendo Wii. Since then it's had a few other releases on various platforms. Taking place 17 years after the events of Final Fantasy IV, it's a great sequel, although it has some major pacing issues. The majority of the game feels like a huge slog, and it really takes a lot of patience to get through. However, once you make it to the last couple of chapters (called Tales), the story payout is huge and the game really starts to shine.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nThis game is much the same as FFIV, however it is episodic. Not episodic like TellTale Games titles, but more like it plays out in chapters. Each chapter (Tale) centers on a different character and the other characters they join up with, and in the very last Tale they all unite into one huge group that you are able to choose from to tackle the last sections of the game. The biggest draw of this game is the continuation of the story from IV and how each of the original characters has changed and moved on. Some of them have had children, and other characters that crop up are completely new.\n\nThe After Years utilizes the same battle system as IV, and it works wonderfully. Don't fix what isn't broke, right? Aside from the pacing issue I mentioned, my only other problem with The After Years is that it's missing a sizeable amount of content from previous versions. Final Fantasy IV Complete for the PSP (includes FF4, FF4 Interlude, and FF4: The After Years) had Challenge Dungeons at the end of EVERY Tale, and over a dozen extra cameo bosses in the final dungeon of the last Tale. While the Challenge Dungeons weren't too too much, and just served as a more efficient way to level your characters in preparation for the last Tale, the extra cameo bosses are a huge loss. The fights featured bosses from other entries in the series, such as the 4 fiends from FF1 (Lich, Tiamat, Marilith, and Kraken), and these fights were a lot of fun. They could probably throw up a patch to add these if they really wanted to, or even add them as DLC, but it's most likely not going to happen.\n\nAnother complaint is that most of the game is going through the same areas found in FFIV multiple times. And while this is true, they are all tied into the story to an extent. Each time you run through them with a different set of characters you'll run into different events (as well as refilled and different treasures!!).\n\nA new feature The After Years utilizes is the Moon Phase System. The Moon has 4 distinct phases, and each phase affects certain abilities directly by changing their attack power or effectiveness...which can drastically alter the difficulty of battles. Some rare monsters also only appear during certain Moon phases.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nFeaturing the same 3D graphics as FFIV (they both use the same engine), The After Years looks just as good as its predecessor. This is an upgrade from the 2D graphics the PSP version featured. The new characters that were added look just as good as the original characters as well.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nFrequent readers of mine have probably figured out that I love video game music, and that I like pointing out particularly good tracks in a game's soundtrack. The After Years has one particular track that stands out to me thats used in particular battles against a certain foe.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3ZRtaQzc04\n\nAmazing. Most of the game reuses tracks from FFIV, but it adds a few new tracks that were composed by Junya Nakano. While different from Uematsu, Nakano has managed to pump out a few memorable tracks that really stand out and fit the game very well. The track above, in particular, manages to capture the wrongness and desperation of the situations it plays in PERFECTLY, and I cannot praise him enough for that.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThe After Years runs on the same engine as FFIV, and as such runs more or less the same. FPS isn't a huge issue for an older classic game like this, and I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs or glitches. I played with a controller the whole time and found it very comfortable. Not much to say here.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nOne of the extremely rare sequels in the franchise, Final Fantasy IV: The After Years delivers a great continuation to a beloved story, although it does suffer from a couple of glaring problems with the gameplay itself. Despite this, fans will undoubtedly find something here to enjoy even if it takes some work and a lot of patience to reach. If you have never played The After Years before but have played FFIV and would like to see what happened to the beloved characters, this would be a great version to try out. If you've played or already own the PSP FFIV collection...stick with that one.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/gOt6vIDDGS0\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\n\nNOTE: Special thanks to my friend Liroku for the gift :)\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 9","true","45.6"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","26","36","0","0"

If you haven't played FF4, finish it first before starting The After Years.\n\nThe After Years is most of all a nostalgia trip to 20 years ago, and those of us fortunate enough to have played FF4 back in the early 90's will shed tears of joy playing this game and reliving those golden memories. The storyline folds masterfully together, although not everyone will appreciate breaking it into multiple tales and having to level from scratch every time around. And in that vein, a word of caution is in place: nightmares about Underground Waterway may occur!\n\nThe PC port, as mentioned by other reviewers, lacks some content that's present on PSP and WiiWare versions, but if they are out of reach for you the PC version holds its ground just fine. There are a few dialogue hiccups, and twice the game simply has crashed upon entering battle, but thanks to the autosave feature you can pick up right from where things went wrong. Multiple save slots per tale (as opposed to 3 slots for the whole game) is also a very welcome feature.\n\nIf FF4 is a 10/10 game for me, The After Years deserves a 9¬Ω/10.

I have played it so many times, that I can dream it. So it is hard for a sequel to live up to that.

Story wise, I thought it was pretty good as well, especially for a sequel. Of course the story isn't so compelling as FFIV but I wasn't expecting that.\n\nWhile the gameplay didn't differ too much, I found the new characters often unbalanced at the start, and you have to make an effort in each chapter to grind some characters that you will not use later on. The moon phases are a nice touch, but I don't see how you still can be affected by them, when you are on the moon itself ;) Some minor details I found a bit annoying, like having parties without healers for a large part of the game and almost no money at the start of each new chapter.

The peace is broken when the previously defeated evil of the Moon has returned above the Blue Planet once more...Ok, seems good so far. Chapters are used for gameplay, with each main character and a suporting cast with them. This can be a little off-putting for some players of Final Fantasy, as you will not get free exploration in these tales. It's very straight lined for you, and the only 'optional' exploration would be to wander various dungeons in said tales. I personally enjoyed this feature, however, it did soon come with a flaw. The tales of each character... They're not really an original story. It seems SE sat down and thought: 'Hey, Final Fantasy X-2 was good. We made a trilogy from Final Fantasy XIII. Why not sequel the only game we've remade about 500 times! Success guaranteed!'\nThe story might as well have just been Final Fantasy IV all over again, as most of the Tales seem to just copy the events from the previous game. This was a little depressing, as you would expect a new original story. That's not to say the story isn't a good playthrough, as it did have some good cliffhangers and reveals. But in my personal opinion, the story only started to get GOOD at Chapter 8 (Kain's Tale). And then, it just decided to go back down hill. Upon hitting Chapter 10 (Final Tale), the game recycled Final Fantasy bosses. I mean, sure, they COULD have given more background on WHY they appeared, but no. It just seemed like a way to fill in the space between Point A to B.\nPersonally, I would recommend this game, as I have enjoyed it, despite it's lacking orginal storyline plot. On the other hand, I would say buy with caution. If you loved Final Fantasy IV, then you will most likely enjoy this game.\n\nAs a quick note, take note of how many times one character must yell someones name.

I see a lot of other negative reviews talking about how it's just a bad port with missing content, but the problems are much deeper than that.  This thing is 90% padding and could easily be 30 hours shorter without any loss of significant content.  The story could be summarized in less than a paragraph but takes 10 episodes to unfold.  If you do not absolutely love grinding and have a backlog of TV shows you've been meaning to watch, don't play this thing.  Easily one of the worst FF games I've played, and I've played most of them.\n\nORIGINAL POST\nIt's the video game version of those direct-to-video Disney sequels to beloved animated movies but  It doesn't even reach the Return of Jafar level of quality.\n\nI'm only on Episode 4 of 10 and I can pretty much tell the game isn't about to improve anytime soon.  Nostalgia isn't enough to recommend a boring, fanfic story with tedious gameplay mechanics.\n\nMost of the game involves you redoing things you did in FFIV but in a different order and different characters.  You literally fight all the same boss battles again, often in the exact same location.  If you were hoping to see what happens 17 years after FFIV ended, it's really not that much.  The world is basically the exact same only now you occasionally play as carbon-copies of the original characters, usually their children.  The story in FFIV was always pretty simple but it at least felt like a plot you could follow where characters had consistent motivations.  Here, I often get to a place my character was whining about, reach the center of it, do **** all that does nothing to accomplish that original goal, walk back out, and then the episode ends on some cryptic BS you know is never going to get explained in a satisfactory way.\n\nGameplay is the same as old school Final Fantasy but they added some moon-phases that make some of your attacks weaker/stronger depending on what time it is in the in-game clock.  The problem, at least with the first several episodes, is that you often don't have a mixed party with a variety of abilities, so usually there's a phase where your entire party of 5 monks (????) is just flat out weaker than normal.  You also restart your leveling at the beginning of each episode since you switch characters, so get ready for a lot of "Press A to win" style fights for the majority of your play time.\n\nWhen the most gratifying moment I had playing your game was when I found the auto-battle function, yo' game got problems.","May 3","false","42.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

As a result, you have to do some serious grinding to overcome several of the bosses at the end.\n\nThe graphics are meh, but then again, Final Fantasy games are traditionally desired to story and gameplay.\n\nThe score is not very original, but then again, this is aimed at FFIV fans so of course they would re-use music for the characters.\n\nThere is not much in the way of replayability, however, the game will easily take up 40+ hours.\n\nOverall I'd say a solid 7.5/10","June 6, 2015","true","57.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Oh where to begin.\n\nFirst off, I've played every version of FFIV out there (I still have my original SNES cart!) with the exception of the PSP complete collection edition (Which is just the GBA version of FFIV, which I have played, and the Wii version of After Years, which I have on my Wii and some interlude chapter that takes place between the end of FFIV and the After Years, which I could care less about).  I also played the After Years on the Wii, and the only chapter I did not buy at the time was Yang's.\n\nTo start, I really do not understand why people are mad at the removal of the bonus dungeons.  The bonus dungeons only purpose was filler in between chapters, because when the game originally came out, we had to wait a month or so between chapters.  So what did we do?  Farm stuff!  There is no point to the dungeons when all the chapters are available unless you really wanted to farm for Admantite.  So this did not bother me.\n\nWhat bothered me was the complete recycle of the FFIV's story.  Considering that FFIV ended pretty well on it's own, I was really shocked that a sequel was announced.  And curious too.\n\nThe After Year's story could be summed up like this;  Take FFIV's original plot, throw it in a blender, add in a few of the main hero's kids plus the dwarf princess and a few ninjas, and bam.  You have After Years.  Almost every thing that happens in the After Years has happened in the main game.  From someone getting Desert Fever to fighting Mombomb to a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• poor redemption plot that reflected Cecil's redemption from the original.  And we top off with a big reveal that almost mirrors the horrible Star Ocean 3 reveal.\n\nWhat the heck happened to the designs of some characters too!?  Why is Rydia running around in a leotard all of a sudden?  What the heck happened to Porom!?  So much freaking pink!  And what's with Rosa's robes too???  Definitely liked the original designs of the characters better, especially Rydia's.\n\nGameplay wise, it's only okay.  This version is easier than the Wii version.  I rarely had to grind in chapters, though the last chapter, you'll definitely have to grind, especially if you want characters that may be lagging behind in levels.  The Bands are a nice set up, but half the time, I rarely used them.   Summons and Black Magic and certain character's abilities I found worked just as well.\n\nThe Moon phase is a neat idea, but is easy exploitable and you can work around it by abusing tents.  Depending on your setup or an upcoming boss, a moon phase is better than another, but again, easy to work in with tent abuse.  The only way this doesn't work is a balanced party, and even then, it's not that much of a deal.\n\nThis game really needed the VA FFIV for the DS did, but Square got lazy and gave us the phone port, which had no VA.  Not a deal breaker, but it looks weird in the intro.\n\nI am kinda disappointed but not surprised that a lot of the bonus bosses were taken out.  Though really, the bonus bosses were really only there as a nod to older FFs.  Not a deal breaker for me.\n\nOverall, if you absolutely have to play the After Years, get the PSP version.  If you're an old school FFIV fan though who enjoyed the original story, stay away from the After Years in general.  It spits on the original story, and this is coming from someone whose favorite character in the original story was Kain (There's a reason for me saying that, but I wanted to keep this review spoiler free.  Then again, if you played the original game, you are spoiled for the game anyways).  Just stick to FFIV and pretend the After Years doesn't exist.","August 15, 2015","false","35.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

When they made this sequel to it, albeit with the modern 3D graphic polygon style, I felt it was worth the price. Well...\n\nI hate to say it, but this game isn't much fun and it isn't designed any better than someone's starter game on RPGmaker. The paths are linear, recycled, and it's mainly just a rehash of just about everything from FF4, from the plot to the dungeons.\n\nNotably, the fight balance is just awful. You get pre-designed teams that consist of FF4 characters and relatively disinteresting new characters, but the problem comes down to it that the team compositions just stink. For example, the twins from FF4, Palom and Porom, each get their own story episode in this. And apparently they thought it was a great idea to pair mages with other mages, leaving your team in these annoying glass cannon scenarious where lucky hits basically end your adventure and there's nothing you can do but reload and hope it doesn't happen again. And I'm not talking about boss fights, but basic encounters. The enemy's speed for turns is this game is ridiculous. I notice they get about 1.5 to 2 attack actions for every one of mine. Why do basic enemies need to be this quick? Couple this with the fact you almost never have full groups (FF4's combat system worked in that everyone was different and it was almost always a 5 man group) and you're basically playing long dull scenarios with a broken party design.\n\nCrummy battle system aside, the game is just boring. Outside of the team up attacks of the band system, this is just cobbled together left overs of what was a better first title. It doesn't even do FF4 lore any justice. Rydia gets her summon spells removed by the plot so she's just a generic black mage. Porom's story is more about the people around her, than much about herself. And the best one... they turned the dwarf king's daughter into a ganguro girl who doesn't look anything like her people or anyone else in the world. Huh?? These design decisions are nonsensical.\n\nThis is a really weak entry in the FF series and it doesn't work any front. The tight forced perspective and the ugly polygon graphics don't do it any favors either. You can easily find better indie RPGs for five dollars or less on here. This painfully generic title has nothing going for it beyond the FF brand slapped onto it. It's a lazy cash grab game that should be avoided and nothing more.","March 17","false","15.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The question is, is it any good?\nWell, the short answer is yeah, it was pretty decent. More detailed rambling follows:\n\nFirst of all, as The After Years is a sequel for Final Fantasy IV, I will assume that you have played at least some release of the original. Otherwise you might want to consider getting that one first.\n\nThe After Years is set 17 years after the events of Final Fantasy IV. Story starts with Ceodore, son of Cecil and Rosa, leaving the town of Baron for training. Meanwhile, Baron and various other locations are invaded by a mysterious girl who is after each nation's crystals for an unknown reason.\nWhat is unique about The After Years compared to any other Final Fantasy game is that story is actually told through ten separate Tales, each told from different character's point of view. As the game progresses, these separate stories start to gradually connect with each other and the main story starts to get clearer. I actually quite liked this way of doing things because it was something different from what I was used to with other Final Fantasy games. The story and writing in The After Years are also actually fairly good, and in my opinion actually better than in Final Fantasy IV.\n\nAlong with the original cast of Final Fantasy IV, The After Years introduces a fairly huge roster of new characters, and many of those new characters are actually quite likeable and well written. Many old familiar characters such as Kain, Edward, Parom, and Polom (hey, those two are 22 and not 5 now!) also receive more welcome character development.\nAdmittedly when an RPG has such a huge character roster as The After Years does, there is almost bound to be some throwaway stock characters, such as bunch of ninjas from Edge's Tale in the After Years.\n\nWith the addition of Band abilities, skills performed with two or more characters together, the combat system of The After Years is your same old turn-based ATB gauge system you know from many other Final Fantasy games, so there is really nothing more to say about it. It's good, just don't expect any huge changes to the original like you might have seen in Final Fantasy X-2 for example.\n\nWhat about the port and cut content? Well, the Steam release is a quick Android port. What this means is that you are still stuck with your 30 FPS (and 15 FPS in combat, just like in the Steam release of Final Fantasy IV), uglier UI, and missing content when compared to Wii and PSP releases of the game. Visually it looks like a PS1 era game, which honestly is something I personally don't really mind but I realize that there are people for whom that is a problem.\nMissing content includes challenge dungeons for different characters and an extended final dungeon with cameo bosses from other Final Fantasy games. While this is regrettable, I must say that even the current final dungeon drags on so darn long and frankly, I was quite sick of it towards the end, so I was just glad that it was not an even longer version of it. But it is still missing content and especially people who have played that content before will most likely miss it if they decided to pick up the game here.\n\nSo, did I like it? Well, yeah, I did. While not perfect, The After Years does lot of things right and it was fairly enjoyable. However, while I liked it, I never got that "Oh man, this game is amazing!" feeling I usually get when I pick up a Final Fantasy, and I can't really pinpoint why that was the case. Maybe it is because it still felt like your same old Final Fantasy IV and therefore really didn't feel like a whole new game, aside from the story.\n\nWould I recommend the game? Well, yes, but only if you are either a huge fan of Final Fantasy IV and really want more of the same or if you have played every other Final Fantasy game available on the platforms you own and really want more. If you just want a Final Fantasy game, or any JRPG, to play, pretty much every other Final Fantasy game available on Steam for roughly the same prize would probably be a better choice than this one. Not that The After Years would be a bad game, it is just that there are better games available out there.","May 25, 2015","true","38.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

And while i would recommend this game, I would also give the full disclaimer that if you have the chance to play the PSP or WII copy instead you should 100% do that over the PC port. The reason being is since this was the IOS Android port, a LOT of the content was cut from the dungeons to a lot of the bosses in the final areas of the game. Still though, if you enjoyed FF4 on PC and don't have any other method to pick this up i would still say it's worth the money and can still be a very fun game. Having level 70+ main party and picking up and doing everything possible put my playtime in the 45-50 hour range.","May 22, 2015","true","51.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I think they are some of the most powerful stories ever told, and some of the most enjoyable and well-made games that I've had the pleasure to dump hours of my life into.  I have hardly gone a single year of my life since these games came out without re-playing them.  I love them that much.\n\nWhich is why I had such high hopes for this game... Unfortunately, it feels too much like a cash-grab by Square-Enix.  All the familiar characters are there, all the familiar places, but they didn't bother to come up with a story beyond, "Hey, you know all the stuff that happened years ago?  It's happening again!"  Ugh...  This would be bearable if it weren't such a *tedious* game to play.  Even with auto-battle on and the fastest battle settings, grinding through four or more hours per tale to get, "Yep, the Tower of Babil is back" is kind of a slap in the face to players.  Grinding was acceptable in the original games because one felt a sense of progression.  There is a humungous difference between being at level one and level twenty; not so much in this game.  Every level up is such a microscopic improvement to your character that you have to gain 25-30 levels to even be competetive against the bosses at the end of each tale (read: not get killed by their first attack).  Rydia's tale has been particularly painful to play, as you are not given anyone with the ability to heal, making you rely on potions for dungeons that beat the crap out of you until you are above the mid-twenties in level.  This game really feels like a job, which is just sad.","September 8, 2015","false","14.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It was OK at best.  The game is split up into 10 tales, the last tale taking me about 15 hours.  The other 9 take about 2 hours each.  Each tale has pretty much the same crap happening over and over just with different characters so it got kinda boring.  I also didn't care for all the new characters they added (Edge's new team of ninja's for example).\n\nI also felt like the story was a complete mystery until the WAY end.  Nothing made sense at all until the end...which to me is lame.  I want to at least have some kind of direction or idea of what I'm doing WHILE I'm playing the game.  Through most of the game, all I knew was some green haired lady was taking the crystals for no reason.\n\nThe last tale really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off.  It was hard as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.  I had to grind for hours and get all the best gear just to beat the last guy.  Fighting lunarian behamaut was not fun.  I grinded until my guys were level 65 before I could take him down.\n\nThey did add a band system where multiple team members would be a single move.  Some of those moves broke the 9999 barrier (which is basically how I won).  I had to do a band move that took cecil, kain and rosa but drained about 30,000.\n\nMaybe I'm just getting old, but I just didn't feel this game.  Unless you are a die-hard fan of FF4 AND you still love JRPG (read, grinding and running around in caves/dungeons on silly quests), then you might enjoy this.

The concept of breaking the game into "Tales" doesn't really work for Final Fantasy, since the self-contained stories aren't particularly interesting (when they run out of ideas, they just rip off the original FF4), the characters shallow, and the gameplay wanting. Gameplay is, well, it's FF4 with the "Band" (combo attacks) option added and a lot of repetitive random encounters. Playing RPGs when you're controlling low-level characters with basic equipment fighting scrubs that die in one hit is usually the part of the game players try to get past as quickly as possible, but with the "Tales" system FF4:TAY makes you do it 10 (or so) times!\n\nAlso, the "Challenge Dungeons" that appeared in some other releases of this game have been removed.","December 29, 2015","false","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While trying to get through the first 7 tales I feel like i'm playing a new game 7 times.  Was not enjoyable and engaging at all.  A problem for me especially was that the dificulty switch from ff4 to ff4 after years is so dumbed down that I find myself on auto-pilot half the time.  Just mashing next at long verses of text and slow interaction between the characters.  Bands is a pretty cool concept (combos being executed between different characters) but I find them to be way too overpowered compared to other moves hence I just spam these on bosses till there dead.  The moon system where different commands are stronger at different times was interesting but again the bands command made this irrelevant to overall gameplay.","January 12","false","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only downside to me is really the fact how most things are borrowed from FFIV, same/similar bosses, same/similar dungeons and so forth. Some people will complain about a 15FPS cap during battle but really, it doesn't make too much of a difference for me when it is basically just flipping though menus so that is more your opinion there, but overall, it is still good, decent story, music is always good and game mechanics are good.","November 1, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have been faithfully playing my PSP/Vita copy on my Vita with all the challenge dungeons and extra stuff. I was glad to hear that you can buy all of those extra arms that you get from those extra bosses at the final dungeon area. The only con is that you can't fight Omega and Shinryu in this ver, but still like the achievements and cards.

The music is preserved beautifully, and the feeling of the original seeps through. The graphics have been updated, and follow the similar design of the other remakes that appeared on the 3ds and PC ports.\n\nThe playthrough is episodic, and provides a very quick journey through each of the characters realms.  Even the characters seems to retain the sense of humor they had from the first game, while introducing new children and followers that serve as the protagonists in the new game.\n\nThe game suffers from a few flaws on the PC, notably controller issues which saw my cursor scrolling uncontrollably. The refresh rate of the graphics appears very low when played in Big Picture, though its not nearly as noticeable on the smaller screens.  The interface is classic, which can also be read as "cumbersome."  The dungeons appear to be traversed quickly, but it could have always been that way and I'm not remembering correctly.\n\nOverral, I am enjoying the game, but a lot of that is due to having Final Fantasy 4 as my favorite of the series.\n\n","January 17","true","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can't tell it apart from its predecessors in regards to gameplay, it's not worth a good review, or any comment for that matter. That's why I had to stick up for this one, especially since FF4, this game's prequel, was markedly less interesting.\n\nFor one, the episodic nature of the game (not in the present-day sense of splitting up games needlessly into multiple cashgrabby installments) gives the story surprising depth. Each character is cast as a protagonist in their own 'tale', left to interpret and respond to the overall game's events differently. They have their own strengths, challenges, and settings that make adapting enjoyably difficult. And to make it all worthwhile, in the endgame you can reselect your favorite combinations to take on the final struggles.\n\nThe combat system saw a subtle revamp that considerably smoothed gameplay compared to FF4. The newgame+ feature was also buffed enough to give the game actual replay value, and for once you got the refreshing feeling that nothing was truly missable. Except maybe summons. It's definitely worth at least a single playthrough anyway, and experience with the first game is not required as many of the main plot points relevant to After Years are covered in cutscenes.","January 26","true","139.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killaya/recommended/346830/","killaya","Wreckromancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killaya/","52 products in account","Having never played the original release of The After Years, I was disappointed to hear about the amount of content that was cut from this version. However, with FFIV being one of my absolute favorites, I enjoyed my playthrough all the same, mostly because of being able to revisit the world and the characters. Unless you're going for the tail achievements, you probably won't have to do a whole lot of grinding, which for me was a positive. I spent a few hours in the final dungeon leveling up, but nothing too outrageous. For the most part, all of my playtime was spent advancing the story.\n\nOn the negative side, some of the episodes were tedious either because of party compisition (long stretches of time with no white mage is really quite unfortunate) or because of the flow and design of the quests (looking at Edward's tale here in particular- "Hey, you know that dungeon you just came through? Yeah, you need to turn around and go all the way back, and then turn around and do it a third time. Fun!") In addition, there are quite a few areas of bugged dialogue (such as guards in Baron beginning all of their sentences with "Baron ____"  during one of the later episodes). Doesn't affect gameplay, obviously, but it seems like kind of a silly oversight.\n\nAlso, if I ever have to set foot in the Ancient Waterway again, I'll scream.\n\nOverall, I'd suggest it for anyone who played FFIV.","January 13","true","43.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
