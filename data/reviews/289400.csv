There's quite a bit of space in this game, and the landing and moving about on the planets is quite unique (and quite well done to boot)! Let me say that I am a big fan of the X series (X Beyond the Frontier, X2, X3r, X3TC & X3 AP), and while is ain't X, nor is it ment to be, the fact remains that I find this game just about as interesting and enjoyable (and in some ways more maybe even).\n\nAll in all this is an interesting take on a space sim.

In the game players will get an opportunity to explore a vast universe, visit different planets, their satellites, huge space stations and immense space destroyers. Players can do this in the cockpit of a spaceship, inside a tank or just with a laser rifle in hand. Gamers will have to fight against multiple enemies in outer space, on planets' surface, inside military bases or even in the debris of some ancient civilizations.The first thing that you will immediately notice about Parkan II is that it is really quite easy on the eyes. Granted, there are titles that have engines capable of higher degrees of detail and flashier special effects, but Parkan II’s graphics have a high degree of cohesiveness overall, thanks to consistent art design. There will be a large variety of ships to choose from in Parkan II, ranging from small fighter craft, larger assault craft, freighter ships, all the way up to your capital ships. The universe of Parkan II is based on what is essentially a story-driven sandbox mode where you can follow the main storyline or wander off on your own whims and have fun that way. There are many factions in the title, and while no specifics are available, it was mentioned that doing missions for or attacking the property of a faction will raise or lower your rep with them accordingly. Parkan II effectively combines two genres into one game, and if the other features were more polished, the game would be a complete success. By themselves, the space or land combat would be disappointing, but together they produce a fairly entertaining game. Even though the missions are repetitive and the universe is not that dynamic, space adventure fans will find enough to keep them occupied in the game, especially for the lowered price.","September 15, 2014","true","2.9"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","35","41","0","0"

I started my first mission, landed on my first planet and still didn't know what was going on.\n\nAfter actually reading and listening to a bit of AI that speaks to you within the game, she gave me some good pointers to go look at my mission log book. The game is pretty cool, and reminds me of Star Trek Online way before it was even a thought. Parkan goes as follows, you have a ship that can be modified in many different ways. The suit you use when you transport to worlds can also be customized and weapons changed. The game is a FPS/RPG type game where you are able to build diplomatic ties with certain factions.\n\nThe gameplay itself is first person in the ship and first person on the planet. The ship controls are done with the keyboard and mouse and provides for a decently rewarding firefight. This game provides it's own unique approach to FPS/RPG. It's not FULL OUT customization on the ship and suit (colors, decals... bla bla) but shooting rockets or lazers, go ahead and go nuts choose which one you'd like to shoot.\n\nWould give it an 8 if it was substantially different but due to it's age :\n\n\nRATING : 6.95/10\n\n\n\nGameplay	C+	Story / Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C	Overall 	C+","August 14, 2014","true","2.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","22","24","3","0"

While all aspects of open world spacegame are present none of them are done in the right way. Space combat is very disorienting and mechanicly flawed, planet combat is a basic shooter with few options not counting minor item customization and overall world design is dull .\n\nThis game expects you to learn a lot of things and tutorial does not cover all of them but if you don't skip tips you should be ok .You will stumble here and there but with the game so ambitios I am not suprised that they failed to provide solid tutorial overall.  I don't think its a bad game but you have to be willing to put 1 hour just learnign controls and have some toleration toward old 3D graphics .\n\nUnlike 2D Space Rangers 2 this game is striped of all the style and atmosphere that made Space Rangers great .

I'm running windows 7 with a decent system and haven't had a crash yet. I haven't gotten to the open world part yet so far its been pretty much guiding me along but its been a ton of fun.\n\nThe story doesn't make a lot of sense so far. The movie seems sort of confusing but I think I got most of it. The voice acting while not great is horrible either. The little messages telling you want to do and explaining the game can be vague and sometimes you will get three or four of them right in the middle of a fire fight and don't have time to read them. Thankfully they save them all so you can go back and read them. All in all it did a pretty good job of teaching me how to play it a short amount of time. If you've played freespace or anything like it you should pick up the dog fighting quick.\n\nYou start out fighint some pirates and then land to secure some data from a crashed ship and get your first taste of FPS combat. So far it seems passable. Nothing new or awesome but seems to do the job. There are ports that you will be able to take over and then defend agaist pirate attacks which seems like it could be cool.\n\nYour ship seems like it will be pretty upgradable. There is atleast four different systems you can change out also four gun spots and four missile spots. You can only have one gun spot and one missile spot active at a time but can switch between them at anytime.\n\nAlso they have a energy system that I remember having fun with back in the x-wing/tie fighter days. You can switch power between your systems(shields, weapons, engines, and I think the last one was sensors).\n\nOver all I've had a lot of fun so far and will keep playing.

It has a lot of issues.  The voice acting is abysmally bad, and the game play gets very repetitive.  Each planet has one of a few prerendered environments and some cloned base layouts.  The game is open ended, but often it just feels like running in a hamster wheel, redoing some of the exact same things over and over.  Additionally, there is a steep learning curve, and a wide array of little nitpicky aggravations that aren't worth really getting into.  Despite this, the game is fun, really really fun.  It manages to be challenging in the right ways, and comes together as a coherent whole, even if it doesn't do so with the most style.  It won't win any awards, but you won't regret playing it.\n\nBottom Line: It's only $3.99, that's a small price for a fun game that will give you hours of fun.","October 25, 2015","true","24.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I want to love this game so much, it has, at least in theory, everything I want in a space game. Spaceships that you can walk around in, planets you can visit, multiple factions you can join, a free roaming (but sometimes limited for story reasons) sandbox universe... It even has in-ship fighting where you can get boarded by enemies or board enemy spacecraft to comandeer it yourself.\n\nThe game is a few years old, and the mileage doesn't give it any compliments. It has aged, and it hasn't aged well. It most likely wasn't even very visual-heavy back when it was first released back in 2007 either. But that can be forgiven. The real problem with this game is how the awesome concept is being executed. It's executed poorly. I walk around, doing stuff, going, "Ah, wow, this would have been cool if they had made it like that," or "this is kind of amazing, I wish they had expanded on that" etc. Also, the planets and stations feel copy pasted and empty, defeating the purpose of being able to visit them anyway.\n\nIn short, though it has many features, none of them feel fleshed out, and some are flat out stupid in their lack of polish. The story isn't anything to write home about either, possibly due to poor translation and sub par voice acting. Want to spend 5-8 hours tops fooling around in a semi open sandbox space sim thingy? It's 5 Euros or your regional equivalent. Is it worth it? Your call. I bought it, played it for a bit, kinda liked it, it was average. But I left it feeling unsatisfied. I would recommend waiting for another game that does this but better.\n\nPros:\nGreat concept\nA few hours mindless fun\n\nCons:\nPoorly executed concepts\nIt ain't no looker\nFeels empty","January 11, 2015","false","2.5"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","35","60","0","0"

I was happy when I discovered it on Steam during a sale.\nParkan II is a game in which you become a space captain with your own spaceship and a universe to explore.

By wonkiness I mean for instance that the default control settings make it impossible to play the game. Make sure to go to the settings and click 'default' to return the controls to a playable setting.\n\nParkan 2 is an open world hybrid game. After a fairly lengthy intro segment of the game you are set loose on the world and can do as you like. However, you are given a series of missions which push the story forward and ultimately lead to a relatively linear and singular objective. The game itself is broken down into three main parts. Space segments where you fly around and dogfight against other ships or space stations, landing segments where you fight against machinery and humanoids, and indoor segments where you fight only against humanoids.\n\nThe game is much greater than the sum of its parts. The individual components of the game are all relatively mediocre, but they actually work together to create an enjoyable and engaging experience. I had a great time upgrading my ship(s) and battle suit while progressing through the game. The downside is that the game lacks any sort of exploration incentives. It may boast hundreds of sectors but by the time you've seen 10 of them you've seen all of them. The translation job on the game was also a low level of quality with incoherence and typos more the rule than the exception. This is made even more frustrating given that the story is actually quite interesting and thought provoking.\n\nIn spite of its flaws it's a game that somehow will keep drawing you in for more if you can fight through the intial learning curve.","August 18, 2015","true","59.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You have a some freedom as to how you operate and what you do, but there were still some things missing. The ability to fly to asteroids and mine them for instance is an example, but I can accept that as this game is more a combination of a spaceshooter and fps.\n\nThings that really bring me down about this game is the bad English used, and how that creates some confusion about some missions. Nobody apparently looked over item and object descriptions before or after publishing the game, as it is full of spelling errors and wrong choice of words. This is weird, because the actual spoken text sounds (and with subtitles on, read) a lot better.\n\nSome thing that really worried me during installation from Steam was the download and installation of regedit.exe....a very dangerous tool that shouldn't be installed by a game, especially concidering you can make changes to the registry from C++ / C# (not sure where this was written in). Each and every Windows version can then make sure only certain parts of the registry can be changed, much more secure. And once I turned on fullscreen and full resolution the resolution bar stated 666 as the only available resolution. Probably a dev-joke, but definately something you might want to worry about.\n\nThe game itself shows a pretty good attempt to combine different genres, but feels repetetive quite fast and therein lies its greatest drawback.\n\nA product of interest for people that like games outside 'normal conventions', but other than that it has suprisingly little to offer. Concidering myself such a person, I will still recommend this.","January 17, 2015","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To be honest I think it is because it is presented as this epic story driven saga when really your just going from planet to planet collecting stuff.... I thought it would be fun because of the open exploration when really most of my time playing was doing what the tutorial wanted me to do for a way longer time than I felt it should of.... The trailer shows mostly free exploration and combat when really I was left with less combat and more traveling around endless boring planets.","December 23, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Their strategy seems to be "throw everything in".  Sometimes, this works, as in the case of "Space Rangers" and "The Precursors".  In the case of Parkan 2, it doesn't.  What you get here is an open-world sci-fi thing that combines both a poor, repetitive space shooter/trader, and a really poor FPS.   Combine that with low-budget, constant asset reuse, and remarkably bad translation and voice overs (the same guy literally voices over multiple characters, and it's beyond terrible) and you have a real dog.  If you really want something like Parkan, head over to Gamer's Gate and pick up "The Precursors" -- while it has a similar lack of polish typical to Russian games, it is far better at doing what Parkan 2 tries to do, plus there's a community patch that fixes most of its problems.","August 14, 2014","false","5.7"," 16 of 43 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","16","43","0","2"

So long as you understand this represents an earlier but still ground breaking innovation to space games; it is still fun.  This game takes the old idea of Frontier First Encounter; where you can explore a universe or land on a planet.  Takes a bit from privateer; and adds in elements of Battlecruiser.   Games like this influenced more modern games like Mass effect, Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, Even planetside a little. With this in mind understand that it /is not those games/ merely inspired elements of them.\n\nBasically you can fly your ship, walk around your ship, attack other ships, or board and raid them.  You wear an upgradable battle suit, and whatever space ship your find yourself on can be upgraded too.\n\nOn top of this you can build a squadron of drones, to act as wingmen in space, or mobile combat platforms in the style of x-com  for ground based missions on planets.  Although not critical you can ignore the plot and trade for a while to upgrade ships or weapons.\n\nThe space combat works, but the temptation to simply board each ship steal their cargo and kill everyone on board is usually too great - particularly as the faction missions often need items you steal from enemy ships.\n\nOverall i dont regret buying this game, but dont be expecting star citizen or no mans sky in this game, take it as it is, an example of the progression of detail in virtual universe games.\n\n","September 8, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the game is pretty okay and even the graphics being a bit antiquade it doesn't make it worse.\nThe voice acting is average, some is okay, some is awful, but at least you see most of them trying, so it is a good job\nThe controls of the spaceship also works fine and you can control it pretty easily, although, the major flaw of this game, and also the reason that I can't recommend it, is the aim system.\nOnce you automatically aim at them, your missiles will reach the enemy, which is ok, but your main weapon, the laser/gatling gun, won't be automatically aimed at them and you will need to manually aim at them and shoot. Which is really horrible, it is not precise, it doesn't have a good hitbox, it doesn't even show you that well if your shot was good, you can see, but it is not that good. It is awful, and it is the main objective of the game, so, not recommended because of it.\n\nIf you want any more reason, well, it also tends to crash sometimes, so you'll be at risk playing this game if you don't save often.","January 2","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
