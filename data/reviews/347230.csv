Getting PAW sound to work in DOSBox could be a real bear.\n\nSo, for the game itself:\n\nThis is a an old classic for Microprose game collectors, old flight-sim grogs (like myself), and the like.  As with all of these retro releases, there is very little here that modern gamers or folks not fond of this genre will find interesting.  (Truth be told, however, I'd rather fly this old sim than, say, later efforts such as MSCFS 2 or Pacific Fighters!)  But for the graphics -- which are that lovely mid-90's smear of big textured pixels -- PAW's flight model is surprisingly good (if actually a little too punishing), the enemy AI is challenging, and there are many scenarios to choose from.\n\nHighly recommended with the caveats I've mentioned above.\n\n(Note: use CTRL-F12 to increase the DOSBox cycles -- 3000 isn't nearly enough!)\n\n","April 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 95 of 100 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","95","100","5","5"

(enemy ships of course)\nFor the flight sim fans this is a must have, get it now it is on sale!\n\n1 thing i noticed is that the steam store tells there is no multiplayer,\nBut according to the manual and in game options there is. But it is called Modem flight or something. Not sure how to do that. I tried to take a look but if you figure around a bit it should maybe be possible to use.","July 13, 2015","true","1.4"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

I bought this one for .94 cents.  Which means, I can't complain.  When this game came out I was in my mid 20's.  And, I loved it.  For that time, it was cutting edge WWII fun.  I don't know why more sims aren't covering this genre and theater of war.  The Yorktown, Enterprise and Hornet...against Akagi, Kaga, Hiyru and Soryu.  Sorry if I tore those spellings up Japan.  But I loved this game.  So, when I downloaded I thought that I would get the same buzz I did off it in 94-95.  And......drum roll.....well, I didn't.  Its fun to poke around in the game.  But you have to realize this is a 55mb game.  They did allot back then, but you have to remember we were still loading with 1.33mb floppies.  Compressed this was a 5 disk load!  Graphics set u back, thats the main thing, its just not fun because of it.  It's like looking through a fish bowl.  So buy the game for a buck and tool around for nostalgia's sake, but don't get it if your expecting IL-2 pacific wars graphics...but the campaign is better than IL2!!  I still have to recommend it for a buck!","July 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

It definitely would be a game for Nostalgic gamers who want to relive their youth playing DOS-based games they grew up with. Visually, it obviously doesn't hold up to the standards of todays games, but you don't expect a 20-year old game to and if you do, you have unrealistic expectations. What I like about 1942: The Pacific Air War is that there are two main parts to the game, the top down overall command and control, and then the 3-D combat engagements. This was ahead of it's time. The game is still fun if you are familiar with the era of gaming, otherwise you might be disappointed.","September 10, 2015","true","0.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","1"

If you want to enjoy the game: look the game instrution manual up online (so many complex functions you have to control), dont expect a AAA game (amazing graphics, surround sound, etc.) and dont expect to be a one man army.\n\nAll in all, pretty good game... considering its age.","August 5, 2015","true","6.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
