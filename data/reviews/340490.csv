In Subterrain you play as Dr West who has woken up to find himself in the abandoned detention centre of the afore mentioned underground city. You were only recently transferred to Mars after the man behind the city, Jeff Murray, invited you so you could continue to work on a cure for Alzheimer's review. After you find your way out of the detention centre and in to the rest of the city you soon realise the entire station is devoid of human life and now you share the city with a number of strange creatures all trying to kill you. Ultimately your goal in Subterrain is to survive long enough to find a way of Mars while completing missions and discovering what has happened to the city.\n\n+Cool graphic style\n+Fantastic atmosphere which creates a sense of immersion\n+Already a lot of items, weapons etc.\n+Good variety of weapons, ranging from hammers to plasma pistols\n+Quite a few different enemies already\n+Large map to explore\n+Once you've left the detentention centre you're free to do whatever you want\n+Good crafting system which not only allows you to make items from components but also allows you to break down items into components\n+Good animations\n+Quite a lot of environment interaction such as being able to drag chairs and tables around\n+Interesting research system which allows you to create chemicals to enhance yourself\n+Very friendly dev who is active in the game's forums\n+Simple controls\n\n+/-The UI is hard to get used to but once you've gotten used to it it's good\n+/-No permadeath, since it's described as a "hardcore survival game" on the store front I would have liked to see\n\n-Combat is repititive and pretty boring\n-There's no map for the different parts of the city and it's very difficult to figure out where to go next at times, as of 03/05/2015 this is now implemented\n-Quite a few spelling/grammatical errors in the text\n\nWorth a mention:\n-Currently there's quite a few placeholders in the game but of course they'll be removed as the game progresses through development\n\nVerdict:\n7\n\nA fun top down survival game with cool graphics, a fantastic atmosphere. a large map and a lot of items already in the game.

If it weren't for the occasional small bug or fairly common typo, I'd think it was a complete game that steam had mistakenly labeled as early access. My first moment with this game was spent wondering whether or not the opening cutscene was supposed to have audio dialogue or not. My second moment was spent getting accustomed to the fairly simple controls and flipping through the brief and fairly straightforeward explaination of the games systems. After that, I spent some time wandering around the facility (in the wrong order because I wasn't paying attention, and noticing that your oxygen supply runs out in an amount of time I'd call "♥♥♥♥ all." Your oxygen tank will run out looong before your thermal will. It's an incentive to find and replace the broken filters/fuses in each sector and promotes a sort of "scouting" gameplay where you have to carefully plan your excursions until you get the filter/fuses replaced. I'm not sure, but I believe the filters/fuses can be destroyed or burn out. These filters/fuses are also vital not just for your genral survival, but also to push back the diseased hordes. The contagion that runs them doesn't like a warm, oxygen rich environement. The lower the entire facilities "infection" level, the safer you'll be. You also have to keep an eye on the facilities reactor, which will, apparently, be attacked by monsters occasionally. During that part of the game, it becomes a sort of tower defense. You can collect a wide array of "junk" items that can be broken down to obtain materials to create items you can actually use, and you can take items you have and research them to obtain the blueprints for that item, and the next most powerful version of that item. It's a very easy to use system.\n\nI've gone to many game forums and seen many requests/recommendations. No game of this kind (sandbox/survival) have I ever seen where someone did not ask for the ability to take a ♥♥♥♥. It's well executed in subterrain, and is a far less persistant need than I thought it would be, considering a lot of games with defecation/urination often make you do it all the time. In the five hours I've played at the time of this review, the need for the character to take a ♥♥♥♥ has come up a grand total of once. Once. I thought when I got this game that it would be just another of the many pressing needs that had to be managed. It's not exactly tasteful, but it isn't nearly as distasteful as it was in any of the other games i've seen it in. It isn't really worthy of being a selling point though.\n\nOverall, this is a good game, and as an early access game, it is a definete exception to the rule of early access games being garbage.","December 22, 2015","true","7.6"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","38","41","3","0"

Buy this game. Out of 125+ titles I've bought, this is my first review.\n\nWhile the graphics and sound aren't superb, there's enough to offer a decent amount of atmosphere. The directional lighting adds to that further. The best thing about the game is the pacing element. The threat of overall infection is the "bad guy" constantly breathing down your back. This gives a constant state of urgency about the game, since the world isn't just waiting for you to gear up and fight the big bad - it's fighting back!\n\nI've had more fun with this game than with many AAA titles. Many of them are just "fun" and have mild interest to wind down after a long day. This one... is dangerous. Instead of winding down I'm left with an adrenaline spike that makes getting to sleep difficult afterwards. Gotta go faster. Gotta beat down infected areas. Need better weapons. Infection getting worse. Enemies getting more numerous.  Need to find the escape data or I'll lose the game. Enemies are getting stronger. Run. Heal as best you can. Base invaded. Forget healing, need to run. Forget looting, need to beeline for where the clues tell me the precious data is. Invaded again. Faster! Aaaagh! Crap. Learn from mistakes. Try again. This is a great ride.\n\nThe developers appear to be continuing to improve the product even though it's fully released.","February 5","true","74.1"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","31","32","0","0"

However, I still defend my position by not being involved with Subterrain at the start. The game has improved a bit since I first started playing it, and many aspects of the gameplay have changed considerably based on player feedback. The gunplay is faster, there's an in-game minimap to help players navigate, randomization was expanded and a big chunk of content was added to the game. Even with all these drastic changes, Pixellore managed to preserve what made the game special in the first place. The changes were successes all around, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI love this game, and I'm proud to have contributed. It's not perfect and it's not going to be for everyone, but if you're looking for a top-down survival horror game with a bunch to read and a bunch to shoot, look no further.\n\nThe demo is a little out of date, so while you might get a "feel" for the game, keep in mind that weapons are much faster in the final game.\n\nOld Review: Subterrain is a top-down survival horror game where you have to manage the health, hunger, thirst, infection level and tiredness of Dr. Albert West while exploring the ravaged MPO Mars base. After escaping their prison cell, players need to research and develop guns, armor and other equipment to bring parts of the base back online while fighting the infection that's taken over while you were in confinement. It doesn't take long before you're thrown into the thick of it!\n\nIt takes a bit to get familiar with all the mechanics, but they aren't overly complex and are rather forgiving if managed properly. Dr. West is a rather capable fighter, able to dodge and block while using shotguns, pistols, SMGs, grenades and melee weapons to clobber all sorts of twisted horrors roaming Mars in the various districts with the goal of escaping Mars. To do this, players need to explore districts by connecting them back to the power system and taking a tram to the district of their choosing (similar in design to a dungeon). Unfortunately for the survivabilty of Dr. West, most districts are lacking working oxygen and thermal systems, requiring players to keep an eye on their oxygen and thermals while collecting materials, schematics and gear.\n\nThere's a rather robust crafting element to the game, in which players break down items to research them and develop better items as they improve their technologies. Crafting, material producing stations and research systems all have upgrades to expand their range of item creation.\n\nSuberrain offers a bunch of difficulty levels, including one that disables menu saves and has permadeath, but also offers easier difficulty levels (though maybe too easy- stick with at least normal or above!) for those not wanting to weep over their keyboard when their character dies.\n\nOver the course of a month the game has gone through a bunch of stable and impressive changes since I bought it; the developers are very responsive and are invested and proud of their product (as they should be!) and seem to be invested in continuing to update the game as time goes on and players continue to add feedback.\n\nAs an ARPG top-down shooter, or as a survival horror game, Subterrain is easily in the top running for both those lists. It's extremely enjoyable, and while there's a goal of escaping Mars, the game is fun enough to attempt to survive as long as possible.","January 2","true","219.8"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

And you'll die a lot in the process.\nI found that the best approach for me was to clean out one of the areas and set up a base there - with crafting and research stations, power generator and some lockers for storage.\nHaving access to power generator is probably one of the most important things in the game - not only does your battery powers your flashlight, but it's also used by your guns.\nYou do have an option to use a melee weapon, but in my opinion melee combat is just not very good at the moment - you get staggered a lot, there's no way to evade enemies attacks, so it's just turns into a clicking and endurance test.\nUsing guns are a bit more fun - you get to run away from attackers while shooting back, but that's about it. As I mentioned earlier - combat is not the strongest point of the game.\nAfter gathering enough things you can craft new gear (including modular pistols), research parts of the monsters you was able to gather, synthesise cure and prepare for your next trip.\n\nNo major bugs, issues or crashes were encountered during my playtime.\nGame does have some small user experience problems (e.g. ESC doesn't closes all menus, no hotkey to pickup all from container - you need to click, no tooltips for items in hotbar) - but they are insignificant and will most likely be fixed (since it's quite easy to do so).\nOne of the biggest things for me is the fact that there's no manual save game. I do understand that the game wants to be "hardcore", but would prefer an option to save more and try out different things.\nIf that sounds OK - go for it. There's plenty of content and enough stuff to do for hours.\n\nSo, just to sum that up - if you are looking for combat oriented game, better look elsewhere.\nBut if you want a survival and exploration game that's quite challenging - you're probably gonna have a lot of fun with Subterrain.\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ClOvH8TRMA","May 7, 2015","true","6.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

This rogue-like/rogue-lite gem will truly test your ability to adapt and survive, whilst fighting off infected monsters, in an underground base on the inhospitable planet we humans call Mars.\n\nYou will need to scavenge for food and water. And when you do eat/drink, you will eventually need to ♥♥♥♥/piss. Yeah that's a thing in this game. But the game doesn't force it upon you every 5 minutes like some games would. In about 5 hours of play I only had to find a toilet once or twice if I recall correctly.\n\nYou will also need to scavenge materials for crafting. You can craft weapons, clothing, and better basic gear(oxygen, thermal, power.) to increase your odds against the infected hordes you will no doubt face eventually. Crafting is also used to build the components necessary to repair critical systems like heat, oxygen and power to various areas of the underground base. If the infected creatures don't get you, the infection itself will. Finding or crafting enough anti-infection drugs to keep your blood clean will become a priority.\n\nIf the infection don't get ya, the cold just might get ya. You'll need to carry a thermal canister(basically a glorified heat pack) in areas that don't have a working temperature regulator. If you can survive the cold, you'll still need to worry about stocking up on food & water. This game's system for hunger/thirst/temperature/sleep/etc may be the best I've seen yet. These needs don't turn you into a walking baby who needs to be fed and burped every 5 seconds(cough cough, DayZ).. It doesn't feel like you have to watch it every second for fear of passing out or something horrible like that. Instead, it keeps you moving, and searching for supplies, because that's the only way you'll survive more than a day in this cold, dark, and forgotten base on Mars.\n\nThere are also elements of tower defense in the game, when you must defend the main power reactor for the entire base from advancing infected hordes. But I have not yet survived long enough to be attacked in this way.\n\nThis game includes varying difficulty levels, from a normal mode where you are able to manually save, to permadeath hardcore mode, with no manual saves, where damage taken is greater and survival needs are much less forgiving. There's a difficulty for everyone here.\n\nAll in all, if you love survival, zombies, and sci-fi horror, give this game a try! You won't regret it.\n\n\nI should mention that I have not finished this game, and this recommendation is of a pre-release build.

One of the more unique elements is that each area's difficulty and the overall difficulty increases over time (listed as infection level in-game). The player can reduce the infection level of an area simply via fighting or reduce the rate at which it increases via various mechanics.  Global infection is affected by the infection level of each area. When combined with the survival elements this makes for a tense experiance.\n\nWhile still early access the game feels quite solid and I have encounted only a few very minor bugs.

Subterrain really perfects that play-in-the-dark feel that keeps you on your toes at all time. I find the survival aspect to be one of a kind, it forces the player to make choices ( and sometimes really tough ones) given the available resources.  I'm not a big fan for Indie games and therefore do not expect the game to be really good as they advertise, especially when the Devs aren't really committed to their community. The Devs for Subterrain do a really good job responding to the community's feedback and even implement some ideas from the players. I would recommend this game if you're looking for some REAL survival-horror gameplay and enjoy playing in the DARK!!!","September 24, 2015","true","27.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","0"

Find your own way through as you take on dangerous mutants and scavenge for any parts that may seem useful.  Though this game does have a bit of a learning curve at first, once you learn it, the game becomes fairly addicting.\n\nHere are a few negatives:\n\nI found that farming the materials and constantly going back and forth a bit repititive.  I wish that it was basically all in one place instead of being spread out.  However I understand the need to do this as the enemies respawn and can and will surprise you when you think it is safe.\n\nYou have to rummage through every bin and look in every corner because if you don't you could potentially miss something extremely important (like a key to the next area).  I almost stopped playing because I was wandering around for over an hour looking for the key to engineering. Luckily I found it.  There should be an indicator or flash or something telling me that something important is in there.\n\nI played this on 2 separate computers and the game jumps frames at times.  I think it was associated with the materials being created or completed when the pop ups occured.\n\nAnd here are a few positives:\n\nWhen I figured out that all I needed to do was make an oxygen and thermal filter so that I didn't have to keep going back to Central I cried out in excitement.\n\nThe crafting system is well done and the upgrades are all worth getting.\n\nDiscovering what is out there and scouring the area for anything useful.  Every dark corner I wondered if it would be my last.  This game succeeds in capturing a survival horror theme while exploring.\n\nHere's my gameplay review if you want to know more:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XDKFL8C9W-E","February 3","true","29.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","1"

I went into this game, wanting to hate it. Early-Access, top-down shooter, zombies on Mars... Basically every trope that we're supposed to rally against so that not all games devolve into uninteresting garbage.\n\nBut, as much as I wanted to hate it, I can't. This is an -incredibly- well-made game. Every death I've suffered feels like my fault. The controls are snappy, and the fighting mechanism is solid. I was dying a bunch until I realized that it's actually -easier- to play with no armor on, rather then having the most advanced, kickass armor you can reasearch. Does it do anything new, or amazing? No - but the gameplay is solid.\n\nI've only played around 10 hours as of writing this review, so I can't comment for story. But what I've seen is, at the very least, servicable. Truly, it doesn't -really- matter, but it seems good enough for this type of game.\n\nWait till this game goes on sale, but absolutely pick this one up.

Reminiscent of System Shock 2 in a lot of ways.\n\nThe survival mechanics are well done and lend a sense of urgency and purpose without feeling tedious (so far).  There's a feeling of accomplishment as you get O2 and thermal regulators running in various sectors and get more of the base under control.  The atmosphere is really well done.  The pacing seems good.  I like how the story of what happened is revealed through finding logs and such, similar to SS2.  Gives a feeling like you're uncovering a mystery.\n\nOverall I'd give it an 8 or 9/10.  The relatively minor issues I have with it:\n\nSome of the maps feel a bit unnecessarily large.  Meaning, 5 floors for an area that doesn't feel like it needs to be that big based on the content in it.\n\nThe combat isn't bad but it's pretty basic so far.  I know there is a lot I haven't unlocked so I'm expecting it to get better.\n\nIt's still an easy buy at $15 if you like sci-fi nerdery.","January 21","true","16.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

As it strongly deserves the recommendation here it goes.\n\nShort Version: 9/10. Even being a serious cheap-♥♥♥, it's a total steal at the full price of $15.\n9/10 is comparing it with all of the games I've played.\nJudging it for what it is, a $15 indie game, 10/10 doesn't cover the rating it deserves.\n\nAwesome survival game. The atmosphere of the game is, if anything, a little too good. You won't just know that things are lurking around corners, or sneaking up behind you unseen in the dark, because you've seen them doing it already and know that's how it works in these types of games, you'll feel it. I'd never experienced immersion in a top-down game before, but this one has it in spades.\n\nDifficulty (easily configurable) ranges from challanging but easy enough if you stick to it and pay attention, to brutal as hell in a manner that doesn't make it feel that it's only difficult because the computer cheats. From reading a recomendation in another review I started on the easiest mode to get used to the game and how everything works, and then started over with the difficulty cranked up, and I've been loving the hell out of this game ever since. Now if only I had more time to play it...\n\nFor the game's various systems (crafting, research, needs/fulfillment, enemies, combat, etc.), there's nothing I'd say is ground-breaking about the game, each of the pieces have all been done before in other games. Sometimes better, usually worse. The greatness of this game comes from how well all of those pieces have been carefully chosen and pieced together into a seamless whole that will have you firmly embedded into the survivor's desperate attempt to escape before the things that lurk in the dark manage to catch you and feast on your succulent flesh or have you join them in an eternity of hunger and shadows (game-over at that point, might be great for sequel/DLC: play "patient zero" at the very beginning of the story).","January 22","true","50.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I honestly wasn't expecting a game with these types of graphics to actually scare me but it managed to very well. The whole concept of this game is a nice one, there are many zombie games out there but this one tries to be different by being set entirely underground. My impression of the game changed after the intro, when I actually got a chance to dive into the gameplay I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics and gameplay are similar to that of the SAS Zombie Assault series, but of course this is not a tower defense, it tells a nice story where you must learn what happened and how to escape the enemy. You also have to use a little strategy when playing because you must collect food and conserve ammo and not blow it all on one enemy.\n\nThere currently seems to be minimal instruction in the tutorial, I found myself basically thrown into the wild with no real clue what to do in the beginning. Also I find that the rate of which you become thirsty is slightly too advanced and can perhaps be slowed down a bit.

It is very well done already and it is only going to get better it seems!\nPros:\n.Tense dark environments\n.Tons of crafting and scavenging options\n\n.Plenty of monsters to kill and loot\n.Random gen is done well, plotting issues aren't a problem so far (And don't seem to ever be)\n\n.The energy is ammo system is both unique and exciting. Which will save you, light or gun?\n.Exploration is thrilling and rewarding (If you survive)\n\n.The plot is secretive and interesting\n.Plenty of customization for weapons (Guns)\n\n\nA few issues:\n.Food is a too bit rare considering how often the PC needs to eat/drink, and need to sleep is a bit to often\n\n.No indicator of how dangerous station is before you arrive (Perhaps a security terminal could list stations emergency levels?) Can get killed very quickly at the start. Fortunately you can usually make a mad dash to the train car to escape.\n\n.Melee is powerful, but too percise it seems. A swing should hit enemies in a small arc, but it only hits on the pixel you point at. As well you have the same reach as an unarmed infected, even though you are using a weapon (Typically)\n\n.The temperature system of rooms and stations is a bit wonky, changing drastically at times with no seen reason, going from 40+ to -15 in seconds. The character claiming 26 C is cold (When it is actually warm) this is especially dangerous when you sleep somewhere and this happens.\nBut other than these there are no other note-worthy issues.\nI would recommend this game to friends easily a 8.5 or 9.5/10 especially for an indie game.","September 1, 2015","true","49.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It needs a little more balancing as starting and ending is too easy and mid-level can be crazy difficult. After my first death, it seemed I kept dying no matter  what I did and I had to be even more careful to the point that grinding became a necessity and a pain.\n\nVariety of ennemy and location impacted my experience as well. I found that there are too many floors to explore that  look so similar with very similar loot.\n\nSome feature were not exploited , In particular you learned to move stuff to find secret passage but it never becomes useful as ther are no secret passage , which is a pity.\n\nThe story was a bit disapointing as well, mostly because of the writting and I had to force myself to finish the game.\n\nOverall, it was still fun but mostly at the beginning; Likely a few more balancing and bug fix are to come to fix some of those issues but  It would have needed a few more month of development to add some feature and improve the storyline in my opinion.\n\n\noriginal review:\n\nSo far, after an evening playing with it, I am very pleased and again,  went to bed too late...\n\nI like the atmosphere and the sense of danger lurking around when in fact the difficulty has been so far quite acceptable ( the lighting helps a lot with that and hearing before seeing a nearby threat still gets me)\n\nI thought initially it was a roguelike so I was ready for a tough start but in fact I have not died yet and more so you can save. A good compromise is that there is only one save so I did not have any surge or reloading the game yet, which is a usual temptattion with me who like to fetch and explore everything and explore different outcomes.\n\nCrafting and researching have been one of the most fun I've seen in games.  Looting to find  scraps that you can recycle and loosing you item for research means that I can focus on exploration and everything becomes useful, Backpack management has been a bit tedious at time but in fact adds to the sensation to have a "base camp" from where you explore remote places.\n\nStory is light but I am eager to discover what happened,\n\nIt's not a fast paced game so I see it more like survival and exploring games where you carefully plan your progression instead of rushing to danger.\n\nAnyway, I'll update the review at some stage but I like it!","January 25","true","88.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Central control and its hub are cleared out.

Most were no problem but when those big SOBs showed up I wished I'd taken a crap before heading down there! Now what? I thought I had a enough thermal and oxygen left but with my leg broken now it's gonna take me longer to get back to the tram and central. WIll I make it? Should I keep looking for the power switch for the elevator? I'll never find the regulator stations in time..that's for sure..."\n\n"Barely made it back to central when the reactor overload warning kicked in. Gotta see if I have enough composites to fix  up the gen. Either that or I shut down power to the plaza or hotel. No power means infections rates in those places increase.

Survival, non-linear, crafting, exploration (and more) game that doesn't hold your hand showing you step-by-step what you should do. It's not completely open-ended since the beginning and ending are (I imagine) the same between players. It's figuring out how to get to that ending (and survival) that makes this game great.\n\nIt's not easy. I play with perma-death off and auto-save on. This means a lucky hit by a monster won't finish the game for me but not looking after my health and status could. Just hardcore enough for me. I've restarted twice. You may think/play otherwise.\n\nI have had zero crashes and only one very minimal of bug (with the UI). Not sure what CONs I would list for this game. Maybe that, at times, a lot of the game can center around scavenging and blasting through monster hordes. Some may love this more or less than others.\n\nAt the very least, try the demo!

Yet across the blackened horizon, Subterrain is that blinking light that demands a closer inspection, and with just a few seconds of your time, you realise that this MAY be the game that rises above the rest.\n\nSubterrain is an engrossing and extremely in-depth experience that will grip you by the balls and won’t let go. As a lone survivor aboard a massive space station you must explore, scavenge for food and materials to ensure your survival, plus research and develop powerful new equipment to aid your struggle against the ever growing infected that aims to devour the entire place, with you included.\n\nA blend of Alien Breed, System Shock 2, Dead Space and Project Zomboid. With LOTS of backtracking required and micromanaging of your base of operations, Subterrain is not a casual game and requires a great deal of patience and perseverance to enjoy. It has a few issues with game balancing and pacing. Yet despite this, it’s extremely enjoyable and fun to play and discover for yourself.\n\nKiddie Steam reviewer verdict: “day 23. Lvl 4 suit and shotgun. Explored the Casino district with 50% infected rate. Ran through the corridors, grabbed a vital data chip, killed 50 zombies. Nearly made it to the exit, but ran out of oxygen. Suffocated to death. 8/10 would asphyxiate again.”\n\nLong ReviewNote: I’m playing the game on normal difficulty without reading any guides. I suggest you do the same for that fresh virgin experience and sense of discovery.\n\nGraphics and soundGraphics are very good and suit the game perfectly, with a 2D presentation that pays homage to top down titles of yesteryear, yet with a silky smoothness added that lets us know it’s running on modern tech. The game is fairly dark, but the colours and lighting have been used to great effect, contrasting yet subtle enough as to remain faithful to the horror theme portrayed. Newly explored areas appear spooky, with a faint mist and coldness to them, whilst areas you've conquered are bathed in sterile warmth.\n\nThe sound is well done but quite minimal: there is no spoken dialogue and only the effects of items, machines, (overly loud) guns and growling monsters play out in the world. The music is a bit too overpowering for my tastes, so I’ve had to turn it down a fair bit. Sadly, there's a lack of ambient noises, so you won’t be greeted by the bleeps of a computer console or a menacing grumble of a dark corridor. Hopefully they can add this in the future as it will greatly add to the already stellar atmosphere.\n\nExplorationWith 15 main areas to visit (some including multiple levels to explore) you can move freely between them and your main base. There’s plenty to see and discover, however it gets extremely tiresome as you constantly need to go back and forth to replenish supplies. It doesn’t help that the levels themselves are fairly large and randomly generated, some rooms leading to dead ends for logical reasons only a computer would understand. Walking simulator springs to mind.\n\nStill, exploration is fun as you’ll need to power up elevators to ease travel plus install oxygen and thermal regulators to make areas inhabitable. As well as scavenging for food and supplies, you need to look out for keycards and dossiers that point you towards shiny new technology, essential for late game survival.\n\nKey item locations are hinted at in journals you find throughout the game world, not only rewarding you with a sense of discovery, but also giving an incentive to move onwards. Items can still be hard to track down thanks to the massive unwieldy level design, but once you know the placement patterns it does become less tedious.\n\nR & DThe key aspect of the game is improving your equipment and facilities to help fight against the ever evolving infected, and it’s done in a neat way. In order to improve something, you first need to lose your current item in order to research the upgraded version of it (as well as manufacture the original).\nThis presents a dilemma: do you sacrifice that powerful new weapon you just discovered to research, forcing you to rely on that puny pistol for a real time hour? Or do you hang onto it, hoping you’ll stumble into another copy to sacrifice to the research altar? Not only that, do you have the required facility upgrades and materials in order to construct said item? Subterrain is a game that requires you to think not just about the now, but about the future.\n\nYou can also mine your own materials and harvest your own food, each in turn can be broken down for valuable resources to aid production of equipment. You can also recycle obsolete equipment, so now you don’t need that single crate full of lvl1 weapons “just in case.” Recycle that rubbish!\n\nYou also need to balance your power output by switching off electricity to unneeded areas, replacing burnt out generators and defending them against invasions with turrets. Neglect your power levels and your generator can overload...\n\nSurvivalWith most survival games, you need to eat, drink and sleep (plus ♥♥♥♥), as well as quell contamination, stem bleeding and repair broken limbs. It’s all done with great restraint, so rest assured you won’t need to eat every 15 minutes or repair a broken leg after an infected so much as farts in your general direction. Now this is a basic needs system other survival games should scrutinise - present but subtle, not "eat every x seconds or die".\n\nDespite this, I found LOADS of food, drink and medical supplies in my current playthrough, so I never really felt like I was pressured to survive like I would have done in say, Project Zomboid. This does need some balancing as it seems impossible to run out of food and water.\n\nYour suit, weapons and electric generators lose durability over extended use, so it’s vital you pay attention to their stats and repair/replace them when necessary. Equipment can only be repaired up to a certain amount (say 50%), so you have to decide whether it’s worth repairing them, or replacing them altogether (note that you can recycle degraded gear to get back some materials in order to build a new one!).\n\nFinal WordsCurrently played about 13 hours and nowhere near completion (in fact I fear I may have to start a new game) but I have been blown back by the gameplay and how engrossing it is, plus how unintrusive the survival aspects have been done.\n\nThere is LOTS of time spent running back and forth, micromanaging your home base, plus exploring the often too large levels hoping to find a key item to progress the game, only to find jack ♥♥♥♥. With time against your side as the infection grows stronger and stronger, it’s possible to come to a point where progression becomes virtually impossible and you may need to restart all over again, especially since you only get 1 save slot. Not for the faint of heart.\n\nSimple enemies are bullet sponges, even with upgraded weaponary. Later on, levels are teeming with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and it's quite a tedious affair engaging and evading them as they can mob you and pretty much ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ in seconds.\n\nWith multiple difficulty modes and randomly generated levels, replayability is strong with this one.\nThere are some minor bugs and balancing issues to be found (as well as a memory leak) however the developer seems to be on the case and frequently acknowledging player feedback. With a few minor bug fixes and some more tweaks, Subterrain is already a fantastic title that stands out from other survival games and looks to have a bright future. Highly recommended.","January 30","true","22.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Deeper than you'd expect (crafting, research, exploration) and with a distinct sense of pressure...your generator power is constantly dwindling, infection rates are always going up, etc...\n\nCombat is satisfying if simple - the crafting of weapons and suits is done well and there is a marked difference in weapons as they increase in power. You can dodge and power up your melee attack\n\nExploration is tense, not much light/visibility. And your weapons and flashlight share the same power source, too.

For a top down game I am having a blast working my way through the areas and the story as well as discovering how everything works in the crafting and resource area. I wouldn't call it horror but the clever use of lighting can create suspense and make you more cautious than you need to be. The contamination system seems to work really well and will keep you on your toes as you juggle management tasks. There's a lot to take in when you first start but the very short tutorials do the job in guiding you in the right direction.\nAll in all a good game so far, I may add to this once I am further along in the story depending on how it turns out. If your on the fence then grab the demo and have a crack and see what the game has to offer.

A mix between Darkwood and System Shock. You wake up on an abandoned Mars colony and have to figure out what to do to survive and eventually escape. No hand holding, like it would be if you actually woke up in a devastated Mars colony in real life. You'll have to figure out most of the stuff for yourself (although there is a great tutorial that explains the different game systems you'll be challenged with).\n\nIt is a very stable game. My only disappointment so far is that, although it's supposed the be compatible with controllers, the controls with a gamepad are very buggy so you'll probably just end up using keyboard and mouse like I did. It'll probably be fixed eventually, though.","December 24, 2015","true","10.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Think top-down System Shock 2. Perhaps it's not as creepy or as deep, but it's a very fun survival game.\n\nYou have to worry about food, drink, biological needs (think toilet!), tiredness, broken bones, bleeding and your own infection. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Without spoiling it, the game will do a good job of making you think like you're always on borrowed time, edging you to explore further, do it faster.\n\nYes, a lot of it is repetitive. Same-y looking corridors can become somewhat boring but the gunplay is fun and killing enemies is satisfying. Surprisingly, for a game of this genre, there isn't THAT much inventory management because of a few storage/production facilities you get.\n\nOh, did I mention there is a lot of possible research? And production of various things? The tech tree is quite extensive and you always know there's something new to discover as far as items go.\n\nBut what's perhaps even better is that the developer really is on top of everything. Since release, there have been very frequent updates, fixes and quality-of-life additions (which means the developer is listening to feedback).\n\nIf you like survival games and don't mind a little bit of repetitiveness (and don't require an amazing storyline), this game will keep you coming back for more.

The idea that sets Subterrain apart is that player has to manage all aspects of the colony to keep it running smoothly and survive, since the people who would normally handle those jobs are either a) dead or b) now trying to make you dead.\n\nIt's surprisingly engaging, and it's clear that a lot of time and effort has gone into making this an enjoyable core gameplay element and not just a tedious gimmick: Mining for resources and growing medicinal plants is almost fully automated and is as simple as telling the respective parts of the base what to do, leaving the player free to run around fighting and exploring while they faithfully deposit resources in Engineering, ready for refinement in their respective machines, whereupon they can be used to make all manner of murdery implements. Research and construction are similarly automated, meaning you can be crafting yourself a brand-spanking new gun while simultaneously queueing up a fresh batch of veggies to seed or pummeling an enormous mutant spider in the face with a police baton on the other side of the colony. Air and heat are also important, with most of the base being uninhabitable until you repair the filters on the oxygen and temperature control devices for the area - something which then drastically reduces the spread of the infection, at least so long as the area remains powered.\n\nAt time of writing, there's only one ending and no real time limit, although you may find yourself getting overwhelmed if you take too long to get it; the mutants become progressively stronger and the reactor is damaged, meaning that without regular replacements your power supply will quickly dwindle away to nothing. Not only that, but if left alone to grow to a sufficient strength, the mutants will attempt a sortie to destroy the generator entirely, leaving you to deal with a catastrophic meltdown and a soon to be very cold, very airless colony.\n\nThere are minor niggles, such as the occasionally odd translation, the annoying tendency to make areas dark as midnight even when fully powered, and a few rather juvenile attempts at humour that break the immersion somewhat (a torn-apart corpse amidst a pile of food having left a message that it was 'totally worth it' to be horribly eaten alive in exchange for getting to eat a bag of his favourite snacks, for example) but for the most part they're just that; minor niggles that you can easily overlook in favour of all the things the game does right.\nDon't play it if you don't like backtracking through the same areas a lot, though. Seriously. There is an absurd amount of it, especially at first.\n\nOh, and hoard recyclables that give electric resin like they're made out of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gold, because you need it for ♥♥♥♥ing everything.","February 16","true","14.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The map is huge and you can win the game and escape at this point, which is nice in an EA game. I definitely recommend giving this a try if you like survival horror games; it's great roaming through the truly massive base scrounging for gear and supplies, all while trying to avoid the shambling hordes wandering the halls.\n\nPros:\n- Crafting is simple but has a lot of depth\n- Changing your gear changes your appearence\n- Many different weapons, from ranged to melee to explosives\n- Solid art style that fits the dark theme of the game well\n- Hunger, Thirst and infection system is fun to play with, from growing your own food to producing vaccines for yourself\n\nCons:\n- Some areas of the map are still under construction and are unavailable\n- Melee combat can be a little clunky since at times it devolves to just sprinting backwards swinging\n- This is more a personal complaint, but the ranged weapons share energy with your batteries that power a lot of other things, like your flashlight\n","June 13, 2015","true","6.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Ok, so maybe it's my fault. That's just fine. However, I think some fault lies with the developers. Namely, the save system in combination with the insane bleed effect and not being able to (for god knows what reason) fix a fractured leg while you also fix your bleed is infuriating. This is not the only place ive ruined my save game. Other times ill go down the stairs nearly dead just to find out there's absolutely no way i can save myself. That's part of life (i guess?) but, im not here to play Life: A Game of Fighting Auto-Saves and Ridiculous Bleed Mechanics. I'm here to escape life. So, 9/10. Cause really, that's the only gripe. Honestly, this is why Bethesda started putting multiple autosaves on their games. Cause people think they have time to fix things, don't realize where their hp is at when they're running and gunning, and all manner of mistakes. It's difficult to balance a game that allows you to save anywhere. Only, on a Bethesda game, getting out of a sticky situation is about 10x less punishing. I play Dark Souls when I want punishment.\n\n9/10- add a second autosave and this'll go up.","February 20","true","22.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I feel that the Dev deserves praise for a great efort he has placed into this, and more importantly how active and approachable he is. He even helped me to recovery a save file, so that i could continue my game.\n\nThe game is immersive, and brings a lot of different elements to the table. Crafting, base management, exploration, and a smat of survivability. I really liked the design of the plot and the antagonists of the story. the lighting was realy special, and always made me think there was somthing lurking in the backround. Learning the game will get you killed....alot, but after about ten hours you get the hang of it. What i liked most of all was the feeling of impending doom, and the  feeling that  the game world was realy going to s**t, s the virus takes hold of the colony.\n\nOfcourse there are some negative elements to the game, but i understand to be the dev not having an AA budget. These included repetitive level design, and difficult progress pathing with data chips that you have to find, to open up new options. But most of all i hope the story progresses,and the story of how the colony goes to hell is expanded, because bar two cut scenes and some dialogue there wasnt much story after the intro.\n\nEven with the limitations of the game design and the lack of story progression, this is a great game and i would play it again, if there were some updates and modifications to the story.","February 21","true","107.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

But now, after 8 hours of play, I wonder why there are practically no negative reviews up for this. I don't really mind the micro-managing (facility power and maintenance) but after having explored 6 of the 16 something areas now,\n\n- crawling through the samey dark corridors and\n- being stuck on the same level of research with the same crappy guns,\n- fighting the same enemies and always in the same manner,\n- having to flee to HQ every 5 minutes to refill O2 and heat,\n\nI begin missing serious progression of any sort. Ultimately, you have very little influence over research and developpment, since it's all tied in to you finding data chips at the end of the explorable areas to upgrade your 4 R&D-levels. And I already know that exploring the next area for a solid 2+ hours, being subjected to the same rinse and repeat formula listed above, I am only gonna get a pointless upgrade for mining level 2 Ore.\n\nSubterrains basic gameplay and different concepts are really well put together but it commits one of the most egregious crimes against its players: wasting your time.","January 17","false","8.2"," 51 of 98 people (52%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","52","51","98","6","11"

Steam advertises indie games to me and like the good little consumer I am, I put my hand in my wallet without thinking "Am I wasting money on another piece of ♥♥♥♥ that will get uninstalled within an hour?".\n\nWell, this is one of those rare occasions where this has been money well spent!   Although this is a 16 bit retro looking piece it has grabbed my attention!    I won't go into too much detail because (a) I'm lazy and (b) I've got other stuff to do but for a simplistic top-down interface there's SO much stuff to do!  It will keep you occupied - the initial challenge is in gaining access to areas which will allow you to research, create and harvest materials for better gear (a bit of a "hunt the key" thing, which can get a little irritating I admit).\n\nEach area (aside from the tutorial and core areas) are also devoid of heat and oxygen so you'll have to ensure that you're well stocked with both or gtfo before they run out.  Alternatively, you can replace broken components for the heat and oxygen generators for a slightly easier life.  This will also somewhat slow down the infection rate for each area.  Quite what effect this has on gameplay, I'm not sure.  I've played for a while but have had to restart my progress several times.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, you have to manage power across each area from a fusion reactor which has decaying power cores.  Happily enough though, you are able to craft new ones - and even research upgraded versions.\n\nThe final element of challenge is with the mobs which I would describe as "Sort of Space Zombies", "Big Bugs with Little Bugs" and "Floaty eyes with little tentacles".  Thus far I have not seen much variety in the mobs but I'm far from the end game I suspect.\n\nI have only found 1 bug so far - for some reason I was not able to enter the escape menu after alt-tabbing in and out but luckily enough I was near a manual save point (I've only found one, which is in the core area).\n\nI'd highly recommend this game, if you like the creative element of crafting, the curiousity of researching better gear, managing resources and enjoy having a tentacled eye up your bum in the dark (the environment is, er... quite dark and situational awareness extends only to what you can see... unless you take recreational in-game drugs :)","January 28","true","109.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now why does that sound familiar?\n\nIn all seriousness though, that is pretty much the only similarity between Subterrain and Doom, minus your reliance on the flashlight if you count Doom 3...\n\nSubterrain is a survival horror game with an empathsis on the survival part: You'll need to maintain your daily needs of food, water, rest and toilet visits, whilst also contending with a space station that's crumbling alongside its former inhabitants. Power to the different places on the station is limited, and that's including your base, so don't leave all the lights on everywhere, because you'll be using every scrapt of electricity to travel and survive.\n\nLuckily, you'll have the basic equipment necessary for surviving soon after you escape your prison cell, including weapons, a power pack, and containers of oxygen and heat for when you delve into the broken station. Run dry on any of these and you'll soon wish you'd planned ahead a little better.\n\nBut basic equipment is not going to suffice forever, so you'll have to grab your old tools and destroy them in order to be able to research and improve them. But you can't research more advanced equipment with basic computers, so you'll have to find plans and blueprints to improve your facilities to keep up with the times. And of course, you can't build something from nothing, so do like I do: Pick up every little bit of rubbish you can and recycle them into more useful stuff.\n\nI can go on and on about how this game works, because this is a complex game; probably the most complex survival game I've played in a long time. This means that you'll have to be prepared for some mental gymnastics to keep up with everything that's going on. It's not easy, but if you've got experience with survival games you'll probably be okay.\n\nFrankly, I can't recommend this game enough. It's not for casual players, but it's very rewarding to manage everything you come across. Just be mindful: Most of the levels are randomised, so while that means every game is a new experience, it'll also mean that just because you know where something is now, that doesn't mean you'll know where it is next time. This also applies to the facility upgrades. Consider yourself lucky if you can find improved research and production blueprints early on, because those will likely be the most important facilities you'll have.\n\nWith all that said, I'm going to go and put my head in a bucket of water to cool down now. See ya next time!\n\n\nEdit::\nI found the BFG! Well it's called a plasma launcher, but come on! Slow projectile, big explosion on impact, destroys most smaller enemies; it's the BFG!\n\nI also discovered a few things about the maps. It seems that the first level of every district is consistant on every playthrough, including the Station Hub and the facilities, meaning it's not completely randomly generated levels.\n\nAlso, while I'm at it: I said before that the facility upgrades were placed randomly across the game? Well, I was half right. The upgrades will be placed on a random level in most cases, but they're consistant in which district they appear. For example, the Lvl 2 Research upgrade will always be located in Viking Lane, though on which level is prone to change.\n\nSo my advice to new players? After you've acquainted yourself with the facilities and their uses, find the clues leading you to the Lvl 2 upgrades for each facility before you do anything else. It's just the first of three steps, but they make a big difference. Plus, if you go for the higher level upgrades before your facilities have recieved the basic upgrades first, you'll find them to be pretty much useless.\nAlso, pick everything up. Weapon parts, cudgels, junk, whatever you can. Trust me, you'll need the materials. And keep an extra close lookout for gems and chemicals/alcohols to get rare(-ish) materials early on. You'll gain more from the facilities when you've upgraded them, but it's a slow process. So again, pick everything up!","May 30","true","45.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Learning Curve feels steep beause of everything you have to manage and they make you responsible for all of it from the moment you get into your first infected sector. Lots of container and desk searching for a specific keycard or item you need. Looking forward to seeing how the game progesses, right now I feel a little overwhealmed and not sure what I should be focusing on first. While I don't know if I can yet I'd like to be able to setup turrets and defenses in sectors away from central sector (you have to protect it from attacks or colony blows up) Would be neat to also weld sectors off to stop infection from coming that way, at least for a little while. Or the possibility to destroy the infection for good in sectors with smart planning and investment. Game feels ambitious, but the pacing seems off, I want to like this game though, and since it's in early access I will at this time recommend at least people check it out.\n\nAfter about five hours I finally have a more confident understanding of the gameplay and the experience is more enjoyable and less intimidating.\n\nSince patch 0.8.8.4 the way Personal Oxygen and Temp have been reworked and improved. Game is much more enjoyable with less time worrying about producing or finding oxygen canisters since now they can be recharged like power packs.","November 2, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

If I had one thing to say about this game, it would be that it needs more stuff, more fun, more variety in enemies, and just more stuff! Not a complaint though, this game is awesome.\n\nI found this game to be a bit confusing at first. Things arnt very clear on what you should be doing or where you need to go, but once you figure things out it's relatively straight forward and alot of fun. The simple version is that you find reports leading you to the location of upgrade chips with clues, to enhance the production center and build the parts you need to repair the shuttle and escape.\n\nThere has been whisper of a game mode in which you actually fight to clean out and retake the colony. Personally, I LOVE this idea, and cant wait to see if it's true. I hope so! I would love to see a player solo playing, or even somday, able to team up with a friend or two and take the colony back!\n\nA few ideas I have that I'm intending on writing up more thoroughly and suggesting to the devs.\n\nOf course I want to see a take the colony back mode. This might seem like an endless task, clearing out a colony built for thousands, foot by foot, by yourself? YES! This would take a long time and alot of work and I think is a great idea for a long term version of the game. I think this would be awesome as long as it had a separate save from the main game. This game mode should include a type of limited regenerating salvage system.\n\nI think we need to add some monsters that start fires. The fire would lower the oxygen content of the complex even if an oxygen filter is present. The colonist would have to find a nearby fire control point, fill up his fire extinguisher (assuming it's not already filled) and use it to put out the fire before the oxygen levels would stabilize in that section. I think this would be a fun mechanic to add to the game.\n\nGame needs an assault rifle. Dont get me wrong, shotgun is a blast, and pistol is handy, but the machine gun isnt quite as useful as an assault rifle would be, machines are super handy for turrets, but otherwise not so useful, an assult rifle would be quite handy for first person combat.\n\nOn screen minimap of explored areas. I dont know about anyone else, but I do get tired of having to stop and look at the main map to see where I'm going, especially when I'm running low on air or heat and trying to get out of the area. A handy little on screen minmap of the complex would be most useful.\n\n\n","February 9","true","168.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

A very detailed and developed aspects of survival system, managing your base power and integrity, trying to slow down infection rates spreading across the map, manage heating and oxygen supplies(it is a mars base afterall). Massive amount of stuff to craft and research, using the base's mining facilites, bio farms, engineering centers, etc. Very dynamic background system - just watching the map from your base, you can imagine just how much bad ♥♥♥♥ is happening outsite. Lore and atmosphere are fantastic, you can fully immerse yourself in the game.  It also has story and goals to achieve, so while you can play endless, its not one of those games that just throws you in endless survival for no reason, thankfully.\n\nIf you're a fan of survival horrors, especially non linear ones, where you have your own "safe" upgradeable base and have to venture for stuff, then its a must have for you. The developer have also proved to be very supportive and still keeps making big updates after the game's release.","May 17","true","58.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

(But the developer has been working on and changing the real goal of the game. So watch out for which update version you will play; maybe you should play in normal? I don't wanna play again to check it though.)\n\nThe first couple of hours are really fun. I felt like I wanted to explorer every corner and scavenge everything. But I gave up on that idea and hurried to the goal. It is because whatever you do everything goes the same. You don't need to think of different approaches to the goal; actually you can't because it's limited. It's just a matter of time; how quickly you can kill the enemies and find the important items. And you have to repeat it again and again with patience.\n\nThis is not exactly an RPG/adventure/horror/survival/strategy/tactics/sandbox/openworld featured game. This is a top-down shooter in a maze with a traditional (or say old fashioned) roguelike system.","April 22","false","127.3"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","2"

So far it doesn't deliver, mostly because it is far too much about inventory management to be enjoyable to me. I find myself crawling through the same dark hallways (can you turn the lights back on?) over and over again to fill or empty my tiny backpack or resupply my oxygen.\n\nI also dislike that the various crafting or research stations are separated by loading screens or animations that serves no purpose. And your research and crafting efforts, which is a very nice system, is hampered not by resources but by software cards. So before I can build a better backpack to loot more efficiently I have to loot more stuff... I'd wish for more interactions with the environment as well, such as building barricades or fixing doors.\n\nThe best about the game is the ambience. I like that I have to monitor heat and oxygen when I explore new areas, and the shrill sounds of nearby monsters. But since I sometimes fill that lootbag in less than one room, exploring/looting feels more like a chore than part of the survival.\n\nAlso, I don't agree with the save system. Just 1 slot feels like a forced ironman and I would not stomach a restart.\n\nCombat is good enough. More detail would have been nice, but not needed. Overall it's not a bad indie game, if there were more options for finetuning the difficulty and settings (bag size, monster respawn, craft station animations, lights) for non-hardcore-fans I'd give it a solid thumbs up.","January 24","false","4.9"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","12","32","0","1"

I didn't play it for all that long but with the steam refund in mind you have to make your decisions fairly quickly.\n\nPro's\n-atmosphere- makes you feel like ♥♥♥♥ has gone down on this colony\n-What little combat i managed to do seemed good.\n\nCon's\n-No voice acting(which is fine for some games, but one where a mood needs to be set and critical backstory is a bummer.) Be prepared to read pages of text just for backstory and goals.\n-I'm fine with a resource management system by why are there so many? No one has ever said "I wish i could take a dump on my character to add realism" Food, drink, sleep, heat, oxygen. There are points in a game where managing that can be nice, but constantly is a chore.\n-The tutorial being just another text menu with pictures made me feel a bit lost with dealing with my inventory and crafting. A in depth one would make the idea of crafting in the future seem less like a massive chore. Having just played fallout 4 I was tired of junk drops and picking up and 8 ball just was like a promise of tedium.\n\nAs i type this the word chore seemed to become prevalent. This game is a chore.\n","January 27","false","0.7"," 8 of 34 people (24%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","24","8","34","3","2"
