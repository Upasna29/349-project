This is mostly due to the fact that numerous elements were borrowed from each of those games and made just different enough not to seem as though Streko Graphics had done little more than create a Myst clone.\n\nWhile this is a perfectly serviceable adventure game, it's not without flaws (some major, some minor depending on how particular the player is).\n\n(A technical aside - some bugs do exist within the game and may likely go unpatched given the age of the title, including a crash to desktop when attempting to delete a save through the in-game menu)\n\nThe age of the title means that it hasn't held up well over the years, so all the modern visual comforts and relevant settings that accompany them are absent. No true widescreen support and no option to run windowed being two prime examples. The extent of the video settings go as far as color depth options and a few standard definition resolution choices.\n\nGoing hand in hand with that, most of the 3D modeling in the game is standard fare for the time this title was originally released. Some of the characters look absolutely ridiculous at times and move in a rather wooden manner. Something that certainly allows one to appreciate the advances in that technology at present.\n\nAs to the plot, what's there is a fraction of a whole. This isn't made clear here on the store page but this is the first part of a series which means the story ends on something of a cliffhanger.\n\nWhat story that is present isn't all that compelling and lacks depth, especially when it comes to the characters it introduces.\n\nUnfortunately most of the voice acting in the game is substandard, delivered in monotone with no real inflection toward emotion (perhaps best exemplified by the blacksmith character who does nothing but shout in his brief interaction sequence yet still manages not to sound angry while doing it).\n\nGameplay is typical of the adventure game type - click to navigate a pre-rendered landscape and interact with points of interest. A majority of the puzzles are simple and can be solved without use of a hint system or walkthrough. Only one puzzle in the entire game is randomized, frustratingly to the point where it becomes less a traditional puzzle and more a mini-game of chance as to how many tries it takes before the correct sequence is found.\n\nDon't be fooled entirely by the simplicity though as there are a small number of puzzles that present a challenge in how they can be solved.\n\nThe music and sound design are a mixed blessing somewhat. Most of the game's soundtrack consists of pieces of music that have utterly random ambient noises and sound effects dropped within the middle of their loops. This leads to awkward moments at certain points in the game where something like a door knock can be misinterpreted as a cue that a door nearby needs opened.\n\nLikewise there are questionable moments of music used that betray the atmosphere of the game at certain times. Several dramatic stings are completely out of place in the likes of a small mirrored chamber or a well lit, spacious room.\n\nThe pre-rendered environments in the game are quite possibly the best done aspect of it. Seeing flecked paint on aging wood or an expanse of snow covered land watched over by a cadre of planets is nothing short of wonderful.\n\nTaking Aura: Fate of the Ages for what it is, would I recommend it? In general, no. While it is not entirely horrible, there are better examples of the adventure game to play (be it Myst or otherwise) that accomplish exactly what this game does (if not more).\n\nHowever, if you've exhausted the number of adventure games (scarce as they come these days) available to play then Aura: Fate of the Ages is (possibly) worth a few hours of your time. It likely won't climb to the top of your "best of" list but it's definitely not a total failure of the genre either.","December 14, 2013","false","6.8"," 58 of 72 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","58","72","0","0"

The puzzles are well-designed and ramp nicely in difficulty. Despite what some people say, all the puzzles are logical and are rather well-clued, assuming you look for the clues. I have yet to encounter one where I didn't understand it exactly how it worked by the time I solved it. No walkthrough either.\n\nI suppose if you miss a clue, you could get confused. But even when I was stumped, a little walking around and thinking got me back on track. I would notice something I didn't before, a pattern I hadn't considered, a reaction I had taken for granted. There is no moon logic here. Just clues you do not yet understand. If you know what I mean.\n\nStory?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acaediam/recommended/65500/","acaediam","Acaediam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acaediam/","216 products in account","First off:  MAJOR plot spoilers but no puzzle solutions.  That said, unless you subscribe to this specific theory, the plot doesn't have a whole lot of weight or emotional depth, at least from where I'm viewing it.  It's a silly game and that's absolutely fine.  I bought it because I wanted six or seven hours of mashing every single object I picked up into every single interactable location I came across, and it did indeed give me that, plus some rather ingenious brainteasers (triangle/circle lock puzzle, I'm looking at you).\n\nBut.  Um.  So.  There's a weird thing about this.  I played this with a group of people, and we all found it rather silly, and some of the Moon Logic Puzzles are frustrating, but we cheated, because the point was to have fun, and we got about halfway through (I just finished it on my own).\n\nAnd.... about at the point where we discovered the main character's name was Umang and he looked like a white guy with a vacant stare, and that the "Sacred Rings" looked exactly like a gyroscopic physics toy, we collectively decided to stop taking the game seriously, and we made it our headcanon that he was, in fact, a patient at a mental hosptial, and the other characters were the doctors trying to help him, or other patients, and all these puzzles were little tasks they'd given him to help him reconnect with the physical world and keep him occupied, so he wouldn't hurt himself or others.  It kept the occasional non-intuituve answer from seeming pointless, and as time went by it got more and more fun to point out, you know, "More evidence for the asylum theory!"\n\nThey left off on the world of Knockoff Skyrim in the Clouds, and I kept going.  And I kept finding more and more places where the asylum theory fit.  The children left alone after their mother died.  The nonsensical way the puzzles and worlds are connected.  The way the Grain of Life connects to the Stardust.  The fact that everyone who helps you can only help to a certain extent, even though they are supposedly the masters of their realm - one even says, "The rest you will need to do on your own."  The way Umang is pushed over and over and over to journey to these lands, and the way he is eventually pushed to, quite literally, travel to an alternate reality.  And it makes his reaction to that all the more poignant.\n\n(The only wrench in this plan is the Generic Evil Guy (TM) who gloats over his sequel hook/plot device, but I'm ignoring that because it's literally the only thing that stops this interpretation from flying like a paper airplane straight into the back of the teacher's head.  And I haven't played the second one, or the third one if that exists yet, so I dunno, maybe I can make something up.)\n\nLet me put it this way.  On its own, this is a more or less stupid game with a hysterically funny plotline at best and a clunky, boring one at worst.  Whoever came up with the proper nouns in this game should be forced to redraw all the characters as though they actually come from the cultures in which their names originate - for instance, I don't know that many blond white guys from India, and yet Google tells me that is where the name Umang originates.  The graphics are as advertised: from 2007.  The music is on a loop that's not long enough, and the audio transitions and voice acting are about as smooth and skillfully executed as me getting up before noon on a Saturday.  At one point, if you fail to do several things in the correct order, you are treated to a blacksmith wearing some kind of flexible metal (?) staring at you/Umang with what appears to be unrepentant (though restrained) lust (??), and you are allowed to repeat this five-second cutscene as often as you like (???).  I turned all the sound off partway through and substituted in the Pacific Rim soundtrack, which by total chance played "Mako" at exactly the right moment to give the ending cutscene a beautiful, ethereal, almost transcendent feel.\n\nOn the other hand. I love what I was able to make of this game.  I love that I can share it with everyone else, and that the narrative was free enough that this is a viable interpretation.  I love the puzzle solving and the fact that for the most part, there was a great balance between the amount of effort I exerted to solve the puzzles (at least, the ones I didn't peek on) and the cutscene, item, new area or plot detail I was rewarded with (this is definitely a game for people who like shiny things).\n\nOverall - if you'd like the game to carry itself and take itself seriously, don't play this, because it's not what you're looking for.  If you'd like to solve some puzzles and maybe laugh a little at the absurdity of what's going on, at least at face value, and then find meaning in your own interpretations - then this is perfect.  I wish you good night, good luck, and a good imagination.\n\nAs for the accusations of this being a Myst knockoff... I've never played it, but thanks for the game recc!","March 14, 2014","true","11.4"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","27","35","7","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkGriffin/recommended/65500/","DarkGriffin","DarkGriffin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkGriffin/","443 products in account","First off, don't expect Myst quality.  This is a very ambitious adventure game that feels like it had some budget/team/time issues near the end of production.  Very good first 2 thirds of the game, with a very bad last 3rd and an ending that while concluding things leaves a lot unexplained to make room for a non-existant (?) sequel.\n\nThe first two "ages", or level areas, are actually quite good in the puzzle design.  Clues are often just enough for you to piece it together yourself without taking away your own need to poke/click everything and observe.  Many require "jumping to conclusions" a tiny bit, just enough where you are not spoon fed the solution, but not to the point of being impossible without a guide.  I loved the first 2/3rds of the game, and it's those first two thirds that earn my recommended upvote.\n\nWhere it really falls apart is the magic area, the third and final section of the game.  What this area does is very ambitious, but it's clear the design team was not able to put enough videos/clues in place to really make these puzzles work right.  Often in the magic area I had to solve a puzzle by trial and error or by clicking randomly through every scene with no idea what I was doing.  There were also several times in this area that the game just expected me to "move on" after a cutscene that I felt didn't even conclude the current "puzzle".\n\nA big design flaw with this final area is that unlike the other two thirds of the game, in this part of it you do not have a way of seeing "the end puzzle", but are just expected to collect pieces (inventory items) used for it along the way.  And these "pieces" are quite random objects that make no sense unless you actually get them all and see what they are used for.  Basically, there is suddenly no story reason for doing anything in the third area, and what little story there is doesn't have enough cutscenes to explain itself.\n\nOne particularly nasty part of "clearly cut content" is that an NPC in this final area has a deep connection to the main character supposedly, but the only dialog you ever have with them is for puzzle solving purposes.  I get the feeling this person was supposed to be a "hint guide" of sorts, which would have made the whole age much better to play, but it was too expensive/time consuming to give them more animated clips of dialog.\n\nThe ending also feels really rushed, I strongly suspect a big final puzzle was cut on the last area, as it is instead replaced with a "push button and win" type of ending.\n\nEven with all that negativity, I do still recommend it.  If you are ok with playing "part 1" of an apparently never continued story, Aura has enough of a "world" to get lost in for a few days, and the first 2/3rds of the game are solid old school Myst like puzzles.  Get it on a sale, if it interests you.  I wouldn't pay full price for Aura.  But I still had fun playing it and loved exploring the world, and I feel that I did get my money's worth of entertainment, even if the final age had some pretty badly designed inventory/pixel hunting puzzles.\n\nThe world itself is actually quite beautiful, even if it is a bit outdated and populated with some of the worst animated CGI "people" I have seen in a game.  It still managed to be "enough" for me to get "lost" in for a few days of play, and I enjoyed all the visuals.  The soundscapes are sometimes a bit questionable, but none of the puzzles make the sounds used to flavor the background music, and nothing felt too out of place to me.\n\nJust on the edge of Recommended from me.  You'll get some fun for your money with this one, but don't expect anything that will blow you away, and keep the Universal Hint System on hand for the last age due to a lack of clues.  It's a good "B" rating Myst adventure, nothing super special, but nothing you would regret playing through either.","November 16, 2015","true","15.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It shows. The graphics and cutscenes are pretty but not 2016 pretty so if this is off-putting to you, this is not a game for you. Secondly, the voice acting is terrible, nothing less. But since there is very little of it (this is a 'solve puzzles, talk less' sort of game), it isn't that much of a bother.\n\nI loved this game, it was a delight to play. Tons of puzzles ranging from obvious over complex and thought-provoking to mindbogglingly unintuitive. This is not a game you will browse through, you will have to be careful and take in all the details. It's a nice, lengthy game and if you do what I do and only get clues online when you're REALLY stuck, it'll be a greatly rewarding experience.

Differences are a 360 degree camera and an inventory where you can pick up and hold items to later be used in puzzles.  Some of the puzzles are quite difficult, either because you're on the lookout for small details which are easy to miss, or they genuinely require some brains to piece together.  Sketches are scribbled in your journal to give you some not-too-obvious hints if you get stumped.\n\nThe music, atmosphere and voice acting aren't comparable, but if you enjoyed Myst or Riven there's a decent chance you'll enjoy this game.

A poor adventure game in almost every way.\n\nGiven the game's age, it looks decent but that's about it.\n\nI'll group the problems I had into three sections:\n\n#1 Story and Lore\nTo be short, there isn't any. Just the intro cutscene. There isn't nearly enough exposition, spoken or implied, to spur you to action, give any sense of urgency, or explain who's doing what and why.\n\n#2 World\nThe world(s) try to be all mystical and magical for the sake of being so and it doesn't really work. There are reasonable ideas for words but bits and pieces of plants or machinery are just scattered for visual clutter.\nThe sounds effects/ ambiance work fine for each area but the music never seems to quite fit and, in some cases, completely undermines the tone of the area. The music during traveling cutscenes is particularly egregious.\n\n#3 Puzzles and Gameplay\nJust bad. The game is trying to be a 360 view adventure game (Like Myst 3 or 4) but with an inventory. Which means that you have to item hunt in bubbles where you can only see an eighth of your current node. Madness!\nNode placement is strange and infuriating. To move towards a door, for example, you will have to back up and to the side first, even when there's nothing blocking your path. It doesn't help that the clickable area for a number of doors and doorways are offset or strangely small.\nThe cursor helpfully lights up to let you know when you can click on something but this quickly shows that most nodes are empty.\nWhen the cursor does light up on something, there's a fifty/fifty chance that clicking will do anything. Interactions are annoyingly specific, with absolutely NO indication that you clicked "wrong". Sometimes you have to go do something else first. Clickable areas are sometimes practically hidden, either in a specific node or so close to similar areas that you can't tell one from another.\nThe game's ambiance is too overbearing and routinely makes you think you triggered something in a puzzle when, wait no, nothing happened.\nThe puzzles themselves are either manipulation puzzles (fine), "fiddle with it and it works now" puzzles (?), or use-a-clue puzzles. The last type are the most infuriating, both because of the issues outlined above and also many will completely lock you out of even manipulating the puzzle until you walk back and  ask a character for help. Uhg. One tool of a wizard even helps you with one puzzle, only to say, "You must figure out the next part by yourself". The puzzle is in his own house!\n\nTo reiterate, avoid this poor excuse of an adventure game.","April 28, 2015","false","8.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Another was a lever basically standing vertically with the player's point of view almost directly above it.\n\nStill the game is fun. I like that puzzles tended to discourage brute-forcing (with often more than a thousand combinations possible) and that, with the exception of two of them, I could think them through before solving them.\n\nEven though the graphics seem a bit dated I recommend the game for providing a few hours of challenging puzzles.","July 13, 2014","true","10.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The puzzles are simplistic and don't seem to relate to the story progression, which is rudamentary, at best. While the Myst series has extensive backstory that's hinted at and expanded on throughout which gives you the sense that you're only seeing a brief snippet of a larger history (and the end of it, at that). Conversely this game briefly mentions a backstory and then doesn't expand on any of it. The voice acting is pretty terrible and NPC interaction felt very mechanical. Myst had the right idea in keeping NPC interactions to a bare minimum, the technology simply wasn't there to be able to do anything with it, but this game was released ELEVEN years after and, while Myst felt like it was a decade ahead of its time, Aura feels like it was released a decade too late.\n\nI was only able to get through to just past the statue scene seen in the sample screenshots above before I got bored.

I like the puzzle based games, but they're always better when there is at least a decent story line. The story in this is very weak and like other reviews I read, it's very much a Myst ripoff. There are NPCs in the game who give you hints, but they tell you a clue for how to complete a task and then sit dumbly by while you go to do something in an overly complicated manner (like two-part puzzle to open a door). After a number of hours, I wasn't sure what the goal of the game was anymore.

The characters are early 3d, the player character resembling an early attempt to 3d-ify the Avatar from the Ultima series.\n\n97% of the game involves looking at static objects and environment, though, which are mostly pretty.\n\nThe puzzles are passable, and I manged to make it through much of the game without help. I did get stuck for a rather long time near the beginning because I missed the left-most view of the tables full of stuff in the house near the beginning.\n\nThere is one puzzle in the third act that really made me mad, though. At one point where the path is blocked, on turning back you will see an item. It is the item you need, and is not held down by anything, but you can't pick this one up. You need to find or have already stumbled upon a different copy of the item in a different area. That copy of the item can only be found by turning to the side and looking down with no prompt to do so to find it in an area that you should have been able to see it from other locations in, but cannot.\n\nThe plot is largely forgettable -- get all the pieces of the magic whatsit before the bad guy can -- and backed up by mediocre voice acting and characters with strange names I can't remember a few hours after playing. This is passable, if you're playing for the puzzles, except for the ending. I won't spoil it just in case someone cares, but I'll say that I actually expected a final area to play after the last cutscene and was kind of shocked when the credits rolled.\n\nYeah, I can't really recommend this to anyone but the most masochistic puzzle-hound who's played every other game in the genre already.\n\nOh, and you can't play it in anything but fullscreen of 800x600/1024x768, which makes multiple monitor people like me sad.","July 1, 2014","false","7.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/godjonez/recommended/65500/","godjonez","GJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/godjonez/","1026 products in account",""Typical" puzzle adventure game where the puzzles are usually either easy to figure out or impossibly difficult because you did not spot a tiny item or hint in another place. Everything is done with mouse by clicking "hotspots", either the cursor goes bright telling there is something to interact or use an item at, or turns into arrow to allow moving to that direction. Some places and puzzles require moving around a lot and it becomes very tedious because the movement hotspot areas are at times quite small, so you need to face exactly to right direction, looking too much left, right, up, or down, and the click is in vain. The game took several hours to complete, mostly because of the slow animations that you need to wait and watch as the game won't allow any interaction during them, or because you get stuck with puzzles or the clunky movement.\n\nThat's quite much negative things to say, but the game is all about the puzzles, with some story behind. If you like these kind of puzzling adventure games, you could try this game.

I am currently in the second world and have been enyoying the puzzles immensely, however I am stuck on a doozy at the moment! I think I may even have to look up the solution as there are so many variables going on. It really is a pen to paper kind of game. Which I love playing!

If I ever get the nerve to finish this then I will edit it with end game impressions.\n\nAt first glance this is a Myst clone. No doubt about that.  But the differance between Aura and a good adventure game like Myst is that there is immersion and substance to what you're doing and why.  Aura gives you a brief introduction then plops you into its world with no idea what you're supposed to do.  It's another 360 degree panoramic adventure game like Myst III and IV and there's nothing wrong with that.  Where Aura gets it wrong is that there is no logic to some of the puzzles. They're just there for the sake of a puzzle to impede your progress.  There is no dialogue besides the introduction. No lore explaining anything besides the introduction.  You have a desire to get the rings of destiny or some such but while in the game you really don't know why you're doing certain things becasue nothing is explained.\n\nThe game does give you hints in the form of a journal which gives you a very 'basic' understanding of how to proceed.  The immersion factor is Aura's biggest weakness.  The background music is just awful. It's a mixture of metal and synthesizers.  For a fantasy adventure game it doesn't fit AT ALL.\n\nFor 5 bucks I guess this is worth a buy...only if you're  fan of Myst.  But good luck trying to get immersed in Aura's world.

That's about all this game has going for it. Music is annoying and repetitive and doesn't exactly match the atmosphere. There are random sound effects that I'm not entirely sure are reacting to actions I completed, beacuse sometimes the timing is way off. Puzzles require entirely too much walking from place to place, with too many steps between relevent locations. Usually solving a puzzle just means that I found something with the vague shape as a hole in something else. I admit I skipped through the intro movie, but I'd expect my character to know what all this stuff is, considering they're expected to get a ship ready. So while objects in the inventory are labelled, the machinery in the various locations is not. I have no idea what any of it is, or why some of it can be interacted with while other bits of machinery just seem to be there for scenery. The inventory itself sucks, having to right click to open or close inventory, but usually it takes multiple clicks to make it stay up or go away. I haven't bothered clicking on the journal yet to see if it's any help- I dread have to read to figure out what's going on (games should definitely show, not tell). I finally gave up after twenty minutes because I realized solving some puzzles would probably mean memorizing or drawing the order of complex but similar characters. I suppose that order *might* have been recorded in the journal, but again, I would expect my character to find some sort of meaning in those shapes and for that to be represented in gameplay. Maybe I'll go back someday to finish it, but I doubt it.","March 29","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
