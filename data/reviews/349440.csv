Each time you die you keep your attributes but lose the weapons.\n\nThe graphics look like a standard flash game, the sound is annoying & the music is OK but doesn't fit the game but these things wouldn't really matter that much to me if the game is fun to play, which it isn't.\n\nThe Undying Plague is as repetitive as it can get. The only thing you do is walk around and shoot the chasing zombies, which sounds like an easy task but then there are these other "Big" zombies which sometimes get stuck to a wall or stuck on each other and then suddenly storm at you, which kills you in 1 hit. As far as I know these are the only 2 types of enemies you encounter in this game but who knows you might encounter something else in wave 342.\n\nBack in the day you would find these games for free on New Grounds or Kongregate and this would be a fine game if you found it there for free but I simply do not think it's worth the money here on Steam.","January 6","false","10.6"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","1"

But its alot of fun to play. I don't know why people have a hard time playing it without freezing or crashing, personally I have never had a problem with that.\n\nThe only problem I have had with the game is when I get to level 13 for some reason the infected keep spawning without the wave ending, as if there were still a big zombie still alive (when theres a zombie alive the infected keep spawning slowly).     (PLZ FIX)\n\n\nThe things I think could be added are:\n\n>9000 more weapons (this is something I say for all the games I play, there always needs to be more weapons nuff' said).\n\nVolume control. Sometimes I want to play this game and talk to firends at the same time, but I dont have a way to turn down the volume. :(                   (Plz fix)\n\nMore charictars to play as.\n\nGrenades (duh).\n\nSome kind of primary/secondary weapon system.\n\nWhen I press escape it ends the game. This is bad because other games use escape to open menus. I don't have a problem with TAB being the upgrade menu but I think there should be a secondary menu that opens when you press escape. Like volume conrol, keybindings, settings, stuff like that.\n\n\nOh and the soundtrack is cool.
