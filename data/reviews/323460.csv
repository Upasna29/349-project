Just a heads up if anyone is experiencing the same issue.\n\nOther than that the game runs great. Has plenty of options. It does have a scarce graphics menu, but the game still looks fantastic for what it is. There's even keyboard AND controller prompts, something a bigger company like Koei Tecmo can't seem to grasp.\n\nThe game keeps things fresh by giving players different ships (and a fairy) that utilize power ups and bomb attacks in different ways while also changing ship maneuverability. I'm fan of the flagship...ship of the game personally. I find it easier to maneuver and the weapons feel great to me. The overkill system is neat and a great way for players to try and wrack up points by bring more death to those that are already dead. Although, I find my greed into trying to rack up scores by doing this gets myself killed in the process.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is unrelenting. I find it difficult even on normal settings. I can't bring myself to go any lower than that, but seeing as how I'll probably never get to the end of the game if I don't do it, I'll probably just have to swallow my pride. The game isn't very bullet helly to me. It has more to do with enemy shots moving fast as lightning and sometimes being hard see due to them blending in with the backgrounds sometimes. It might just be because I'm finally getting up in age and my eyesight just isn't as good as it used to be.\n\nThe soundtrack for the Raiden games have never really wowed me, but their pretty good and always go along with the feel of each stage. I'm more of a fan of their sound effects for their weapons than anything else and this game doesn't disappoint. I just love hearing that laser baby.\n\nThe game also has a gallery that allows you to view and play around with some of the models in the game. You unlock them through game progression and gives gamers another level of replayability. While the models look pretty rough up close, it still a nice little bonus to just mess around with.\n\nOverall all, H2 Interactive did a fine job with their port of this game. If you're a fan of the genre in general this is one game that should be in your library. It definitely won't disappoint your if you're looking for something to fill that shoot'em up void in your heart.","September 2, 2015","true","7.5"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","42","48","3","0"

I've been wanting to play IV for forever since I don't own any of the platforms it's historically been available on, so seeing this one pop onto Steam was quite a treat!\n\nWith that in mind, the porting work is very solid  - the game runs silk smooth, looks great and even has some very good gamepad support. The original Arcade version of Raiden IV (Released in 2007) runs on the Taito Type X platform, which was sort of antiquated ("Pentium 4" antiquated) even when the game first came out, so it's no surprise that the game's a pretty smooth runner... Assuming this is a direct port of the original code, anyway. Raiden IV's lineage is somewhat confusing so I'm unclear how Overkill, the PS3, and the original Type X versions of the game all relate to each other.\n\nThe gameplay's easily some of the most enjoyable shooting you'll see out of a Raiden game since Raiden II/Raiden DX, and the classic Toothpaste Laser even makes the return it didn't in Raiden III! The game's new Overkill mode takes some cues from the more score-focused games (the whole Overkill chaining setup evokes Raiden Fighters Jet's medal chaining) but the mechanics aren't nearly as obtrusive and don't need to be followed if you just want to have some fun with the new map layouts. I think this is a really happy medium between how the Classic Raiden games do things and how the Fighters games did things!\n\nSoundtrack-wise, Go Sato (The composer from MOSS - formerly Seibu Kaihatsu) returns to revisit his chiptune compositions for Raiden I and II. He did a very good job of it (and managed to make Tragedy Flame sound less like a transparent final countdown knockoff), so the game gets some marks there! Reusing music's a little unoriginal, but all the arrangements have been meticulously done. Newcomers and series veterans alike will get some ear candy! The new game modes also include remixes by other artists.\n\nThe game's very agreeably priced and includes plenty extra over the previous ports, making it easily worth the purchase. Give it a spin if you can!","September 3, 2015","true","2.9"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","0"

Yes, this game is so good. it strikes the balance between bullet hell and oldschool shmups. The new scoring system is dead simple but is just so much fun, just keep mashing that button ;D The music consist of great remixes of classic Raiden tunes. The music is pumping during stages and changes to darker tune during boss fights.\nRaiden has never been a bullet-hell and always retained its very unique (read: sluggish) gameplay with fast but sparse bullet patterns. i like how playing with Fairy overcomes the inbred sluggishnes and makes a very different beast out of Raiden game.\n\nJOYSTiCK support is the most important thing for me in any shmup. Raiden DOES work with Playstation joysitcks. Inexplicably, being a game first published on japanese Xbox360, Raiden does NOT detect xbox joysticks , both Hori and Madcatz were not functioning at all. It is a shame, because all xbox joysticks have native drivers already installed in Microsoft Windows. I suppose this issue is going to be fixed in future.\n\nthis game wil demand from you some customisation at the very beginning.\nObligatory for the better comfort of the game are:\n- screen pivot (optional but highly recommended as with any other vertical shmup)\n- screen size adjustment (make it big)\n- resolution\n- controls rebinding for keyboard users (i prefer using left hand WSAD keys for movement)\n\nIf you are passionate about playing shmups, i wholeheartedly encourage you to buy a joystick.  The simple truth is , Raiden/shmups should always be plaid with a joystick. All other input methods are not fast and subtle enough. If you churned out money for one, it will serve you for years to come (unlike constantly breaking "gamer" keyboards and mouses) and you will never look back at using anything else.","September 7, 2015","true","3.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

I spare you listing all features and gamemodes and screen options because it's listed at the describtion of the game itself and there's a ton of it. What I'm gonna try is explaining what makes Raiden to one or maybe "the" best shoot 'em up on Steam.\n\nTo sum it up it's the overall feeling of shooting your weapons and destroying stuff.The controls are very precise and the feedback you get from annihilating the enemys just feels right. Raiden IV has a high production value across-the-board.\n\nYou upgrade your ship by collecting three different types of your main weapon which get stronger as you collect more upgrades and rockets. The enemy variety is also very high. There are tanks on the ground, big ships, small ones, enemys coming over bridges and turrets on aircraft carriers. The levels are very well designed and highly detailed.\nAfter beating a level you encounter a boss. Those are also very detailed and well animated. And they demand all your reflexes and tactical abilities to beat them.\n\nI recommend grabbing a coffee or a cold beer and sit down with your controller to train your reflexes like an animal.

I'm gonna sound like an Undertale fan here, but you really should "just play it" to get a feel of how good the shooting and level design is.\n\nThis is the Overkill version as well, meaning you get a whole other game mode, which is an arrange with the titular "Overkill" scoring system which can change the way you play the game, which increases the replay value. Best of all for PC players is that this is a much better port than the Steam edition of Raiden III, with good compatibility, options and controller support.","February 10","true","2.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

First, as someone who always perfers to use keyboard and mouse, I found navigating the menus to be clunky and unintuitive. There is no actual full-screen mode. Enabling the full-screen option just centers the game in the middle third of your screen while the rest of the space is filled with a bit of static art (an image of your jet) and a solid background color. My biggest gripe is the fact that destroying enemy vehicles drops xp icons that float on the screen for a second, then zoom to your ship. Problem is, in a shoot'em up, bullet hell style game, you're trying to focus on dodging enemy fire. Almost from the start, the amount of stuff - xp icons and enemy bullets - you have flying at your jet makes it very difficult to discern what you need to dodge and what is xp being collected. This, for me, sapped a lot of the enjoyment out of the game as I died time and time again trying to dodge xp only to run into bullets. Maybe I'm just old and my eyes are crap, but I've not had this issue with other titles in this style. On a positive note, the game seemed to run fine in the brief time I spent playing and there looked to be a good amount of enemy types and weapon variety. However, due to the reasons I described, I wouldn't recommend it. That's my two cents.

Personally I think it is a lot better than Raiden III.  The 3D Grapics and the envrionments are a lot better than III and there are plenty of modes to play from.  Overkill mode is icing on top of the cake.  Music is great from Go Sato who started composing the music in the Raiden series starting on II (and also did Raiden Fighters series as well), and the gameplay feels crazy with the crazy bullet patterns coming at you.  This isn't a bullet hell Cave shooting game so while there is less bullets on bullet count wise, the speed of them is what gets to you.  You can play the game just fine without fliping your monitor to portrait but it is highly recommended to play the game in TATE (vertical portrait your monitor) since you need all the screen size you need to dodge the fast bullet patterns.\n\nAt least Raiden IV is on PC and people been hoping for this for years.","September 14, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It keeps to remember how things were done in the old days. Hard... with brutally fast bullets that will eat up all of your coins! (Wait.. we don't put coins in anymore? Err... i might have to clean my PC after this review) This time with tons of extra features and a OST to boot.\n\nGameplay is solid. It brings back the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic photon (aka toothpaste) beam to wreck everything on the screen. Just watching that beam curl across the screen and murder everything gives you quite the feeling. Many small improvements are littered in-game as well, such as the power up timer (how long until a power up changes to a new one) and interesting interactions when you stop shooting (seriously, try it. It draws in power ups and makes your next missile barrage awesome raiden fighters style).\n\nVisually it is fine. A few issues (blurry text and whatever) but it's smooth at 60fps and full resolution support along with TATE.\n\nSounds are good. The music is a mix of new stuff and rearranged music from Raiden I, Ii and III.\n\nRaiden 4 gets my thumbs up with a 8/10 and with it's multiple game modes and many stages it's worth the asking price..(Orginially it was 7/10 due to a bug in the music looping. Since fixed, it gets a extra point from me)\n\nPS - You guys can port Raiden Fighters Aces over to steam, could you?

Good.\n\nThis is a fun, well designed and extremely challenging "schmup" as this type of game is commonly called. Just like in Raiden III, enemies fly down from the top of the screen (or trundle along the ground) firing stuff at your little spacecraft (or faerie as the case may be) while you fire loads of fast moving firepower to head them off. It only takes one hit to get you destroyed but there are an infinity of extra lives and extra continues. With infinite lives and continues, why is this game challenging then? Because it's HARD not to get hit and using a 'continue' erases the point score you accumulated up until that point (as is the norm for these types of games (except, unfortunately, some of these kind of games don't let you 'continue' infinitely like Raiden IV does).\n\nAnyhow, this game is pretty fun if you like this kind of arcade-style game. It is being sold at an adequate price but, of course, it's an even better deal if you get it at a discount during a Steam sale like I did.\n\n+Nice, cute, bright, colorful graphics with each stage being a nifty area to fly over.\n\n+Intuitive, standard controls for this kind of game.\n\n+Feels just like Raiden III or indeed, most other Raiden games. This game has a great, classic late 1980's/early 1990's arcade feel to it.\n\n+Creative, interesting enemies.\n\n+Lots of game modes, some of which have additional areas to fly over.\n\n+Most aspects of this game are unlocked from the start, including both spacecraft and the faerie which you can play as thus avoiding any need to complete potentially frustrating challenges to unlock them. Even if you are not that great at this kind of game the infinite continues allows you to get through it all and see everything (including the nifty artistry it took to make this game). This makes the game very appealing for a casual gamer like myself. Just jump in, pick a mode, pick a ship and play.\n\n+Settings menus are fairly easy to use with just a keyboard.\n\n+The options for different weapons are great and the addition of the Faerie girl as a playable character is funny, especially at the very beginning when she takes off of the carrier while making jet-airplane sounds. The Faerie girl's weapons (bubbles, flowers etc.) are also a hoot.\n\n+/-Steam achievements can only be earned in the OverKill play mode.\n\n+/-Still makes heavy use of the happy, frenetic techno style music which is common for such games and is, as a result, becoming boring.\n\n+/-Extremely challenging. Potentially frustrating even on lower difficulties.\n\n-This game can get repetitive easily despite the number of different modes. I can't seem to find a boss-rush mode (a mode where you fight against only the bosses from each level) in this game like there was in Raiden III. Perhaps it doesn't have one.\n\n-Not much of a story. You seem to be fighting machines controlled by evil alien red diamonds from space (Just like in previous Raiden games) with your prototype ultra-powerful fighter plane or with your mysteriously powerful faerie girl (if you choose to play as her) (perhaps she's the Gaia spirit of earth-nature protecting all organic life from the evil diamond machine-aliens? No idea).","May 15","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
