One that begins to elevate storytelling in gaming. There will surely be a lot of discussion to follow with this one. There's a lot of care taken with the world in which it takes place in, as well as with some of the themes it handles. And Bioshock Infinite opts to hold very little back. Here you'll be tackling themes such as racism, religion, false prophets, gender roles, even moments that will test your own morals. It's got a lot to say. The story and the world also come to life in the same way that Rapture does. While Columbia is not as dazzling as the trip into the underwater world, it does have a pulse just the same. You'll find Voxphones scattered throughout. These, like the original Bioshocks audio diaries, add a lot more to the tale at hand. They add to the story, the world and the atmosphere. To ignore them is to miss out on a considerable portion of the game. For those very curious about the world they're playing in, they will most certainly want to pick these up.\n\nThe world of Columbia is wider and more open than the claustrophobic and enclosed Rapture, gun fights involve more enemies than the original Bioshock. The problem with this is that it devalues the fights itself. In the original Bioshock, enemies were something to fear. Even the most basic ones could do damage to you if you're not prepared. In Infinite, most enemies are just faceless guards who you just simply have to shoot in order to progress to other parts of the story. Most fights just end up repetitive, and though the game allows you to use various methods such as vigors and skyhooks to defeat enemies, rarely do you ever need to. Most of the game you're grossly overpowered, even if you're not upgrading your vigors or weapons.\n\nAnother thing, though admittedly it's a nitpick, the dissonance between the beautiful story and the violent shooting is something worth mentioning. Sometimes the dialogue and the "breather" scenes seem to be slightly disrupted by the high amounts of adrenaline shooting that follows. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but it's certainly something that could be done better. Less emphasis on gunplay and maybe some more exploration elements could benefit this game.\n\nBioshock Infinite isn't a perfect game, but it is a great one. A thematically ambitious game with a well told story, Bioshock Infinite is sure to delight fans who fell in love with the original back in 2007. It is a game that not only delivers well from a gameplay standpoint, but from a narrative one as well. If you enjoyed exploring the world of Rapture in 2007, then you'll love going through the land of Columbia, here.","November 29, 2013","true","29.9"," 1,011 of 1,281 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","011","1","0","24"

The game offers a fairly fast paced action that might sometimes feel a bit tedious. Bioshock Infinite contains a multitude of weapons that are era specific and are lovely to use.\n\nYou also have access to powers, known as vigors, which you can use to dispose of enemies or to just help you make your way through the game. The vigors can also be combined with each other making it an intriguing system to play around with.\n\nIn addition to Weapons and Vigors you have other tools, like the skyhook, which lets you jump around from hooks attached to the side off certain buildings.\n\nThe stealth system within the game is good. The detection is based around both sound and vision so walking on a carpet can suppress your footsteps while walking on puddles of water or broken glass will make them louder.\n\nThe games scenery and enviroments are absolutely outstanding. When I got the first glimpse of Columbia I was speechless.\n\nThe voice acting in the game is great as well with excellent dialogue. I'm quite serious now, I can't describe how PERFECT some parts were with how the characters acted and what they said. This game has brought forward some amazing quotes. In addition to that, all of the characters are well made and very sympathetic.\n\nI like games that have a good story, and Bioshock Infinite has just that. The story  is incredibly rich when it comes to content and will leave you with memorable parts that will make you smile when you think back.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a game that you will not regret playing. It's fantastic.\n\nedit - removed Chrono order to please people.","September 30, 2014","true","15.2"," 222 of 278 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","222","278","8","11"

Whilst my hours on steam don't reflect my actual playing time, as I've completed this game way too many times on my PS3, I just can't express how much I love this. It's my favourite ever game, and here's why:\n\n1) The plot is incredible, and has real substance. I've never completed a game more than once before, because I find playing the same story line tiring. However, this is an exception. The story line is phenomenal. I find myself being totally, and utterly, immersed in the world of Columbia. I have a real sense of "belonging" within the game which sounds a bit weird, but I don't really know how I can explain it. Brooker DeWitt and Elizabeth are both very strong characters, with great backstories, and the way these stories collide with each other is thought provoking, fantastically executed and cleverly directed.\n\n2) The graphics are visually stunning. The joy of playing this game with ultra settings, is one to be behold. If you're looking for a game with a wealth of detail, this is the one. Characters and scenery look great in the cut scenes and during game play. The lighting is just right throughout, and to me, fire has never before looked so good.\n\n3) The characters are strong, witty, and badass. And whoever voiced the characters need a medal, because I couldn't imagine anyone else stepping up to deliver what these guys have delivered.\n\n4)  Combat. Is. Awesome. I never really liked gore in a game before, but I really enjoyed this, with just the right amount of gore included. Not just that, it's really easy to pick up which I love, and seem to have trouble with in other games.\n\nThe only real criticism I can think of is the lack of DLC's available, and wishing that the story went on just that little bit longer. I didn't want it to end. Other than that, I really can't fault it. You're not just buying a game here, you're literally buying an entire world.

How far can a freedom fighter be pushed before virtue and righteousness are replaced by a lust for vengeance? What does a privileged society do when the foundation of its prosperity is shaken? BioShock Infinite dares to explore these heady themes and many more, giving you glimpses at just how the seemingly smallest of decisions can forever alter our realities, and our hearts. As an agent provocateur in the fantastical floating city of Columbia, your actions bring turmoil and strife to an ostensibly idyllic landscape. It's immensely fun to stir up trouble, and even more engaging to see how boldly BioShock Infinite portrays a society torn asunder.

Even though it seems to ignore pretty much everything the original BioShock had to offer in terms of narration, the game not only bears the same idea but also expands it widely, moving the series far beyond any borders.\n\nThe story now is much, much more complex. A standard rescue quest soon turns into a great adventure full of amazing twists, also featuring tons of different references, including physics, philosophy, religion, politics and many other things. By the way, it doesn't apply to the base game only — the Burial at Sea DLCs are necessary for understanding the wonderful cycle of the series. No examples here, for the whole story is worth seeing.\n\nNot to mention the gameplay mechanics which appear to be a simplified variation of the first game's scheme: easy enough to keep the fast pace and yet deep enough to let the player choose their way of dealing with problems. No more hacking mini-games or complicated stealth tactics, though, but if one is looking for some challenge, there is always 1999 mode that can make it feel like home.\n\nThese facts, together with detailed design and, of course, outstanding visuals, make it hard to deny that the BioShock franchise is nearing perfection. Irrational Games use every single instrument the gaming industry has discovered to make their own beautiful symphony — and to finally make a perfect distinction between mediocre video games and a masterpiece.","May 1, 2014","true","54.8"," 285 of 386 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","285","386","3","13"

That doesn't mean all the others releases are bad but it's been a while since i had so much fun playing a game.\n\nThe plot it's one of the best i've seen in my entire gaming life, matching some Visual Novels and books i love (i kinda like a good plot and not the usual mindless action or generic shooting gallery we get most of the time). I don't think you'll find another game with a better quality plot anytime soon.\n\nGraphics aren't realistic but that doesn't mean they are bad, they got kinda a unique style that makes everything beautiful. You could say they are the same as the older games but they certainly improved a lot. However i kinda get annoyed with the excessive "bloom" in some scenes, sometimes they are overused to the point of blinding you. Aside from that everything else is beautiful.\n\nThere's the music, honestly it isn't great but it's not bad either, the combat music is the same for the whole game save some specific scenes and it gets repetitive after a while. It's average at best.\n\nThe gameplay is what you've already seen in BioShock 1 & 2 with some improvements. You can equip gears that gives you a few improvements like auto-casting lightning when you are struck or put your enemies on fire when you strike them with melee attacks.\n\nThere's the new "Sky-Line" mechanic that allows you to travel around the place and can even be used in your advantage during combat, your partner Elizabeth even rides with you.\n\nAnd talking about Elizabeth, that's one hell of a companion. She is like Alyx in Half-Life 2: Episode One but instead of fighting she gives you support during and outside combat like finding and giving you ammo, salt, money and even warning about points of interest and some missable items like lockpicks. I love when i'm almost out of ammo and she throws me some ammo, she also plays a huge role in the plot.\n\nHonestly i haven't cared about my companion in a single-player game since Alyx, she isn't useless like most companions who doesn't do jack aside from yelling at you all the time like 'AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS", " TAKE POINT", "THEY ARE KILLING US DO SOMETHING!!!".\n\nPC port is above average, there isn't much graphics options but at least the game runs great, without vsync the game always run above 60fps (sometimes going up to 90fps) with everything maxed out and the game has some pretty graphics.\n\nIt took me around 13 hours to beat the game.\n\nMy rate: 9,5","January 5, 2015","true","30.6"," 118 of 144 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","118","144","11","4"

I had a great time playing Bioshock Infinite. I managed to complete it twice, and am considering a third playthrough.\n\nSimilar to previous games, the story is original and very well written. It kept me interested throughout the game and despite my initial apprehension towards Elizabeth’s naïve character; I ended up really liking her as a “sidekick”, because that’s essentially what she is throughout the entire game. I enjoyed the numerous twists and turns of the story, and the ending absolutely blew me away.\n\nThe gameplay is one of my favourite elements of Infinite. The new Skyrail system has transformed the dark and linear corridors of Rapture into a vast and open battlefield. The weapons are great fun to use, including the audio, with piano key drops that blare out when you land a headshot (soooo satisfying). The plasmid equivalent vigor abilities are nothing too special. Some are similar to previous Bioshock games while others introduce new things like forming a protective shield to absorb bullets and blast them back at your foes. There are some interesting combinations you can do with the vigor’s, which leads to many choices during combat.\n\nWhen compared to its predecessors, I felt Infinite lacked the horror elements that made me such a big fan of the first two games. In Rapture, everything was dark and gloomy so horror came naturally. In the floating city of Columbia, it was much harder to feel like it was part of the Bioshock universe. The secondary antagonist, Songbird is creepy and he does his best to keep the Big Daddy theme going, but the lack of creepy enemies just upset me. The boys of sound and sirens were my most anticipated enemies that I saw in the trailers for the game, but they had such a small role in the final game.\n\nDespite the lack of horror, Infinite managed to make me question my own understanding of what Bioshock is about and gave me lasting memories of a truly epic game.\n","November 27, 2013","true","53.3"," 527 of 765 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","527","765","0","10"

Everything you know or, at least think you knew about the world we're living at, is all lies. In each of the games you start as a "normal" character, with a casual personality, that during the game change and become a new character with a different personality. The game is about mental games with your brain. You gain new  powers and new abilities the more you're progressing in the game. In each game, the story change alot on each move you make. The whole idea of BioShock game series is really cool in my opinon and so are the action scenes in it and the story of each game.

It's been a while since a game compelled me to write a review and if the price is right, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite.\n\nUnique aspects of Bioshock worth noting\nElizabeth's Pathfinding, Awareness & Helpfulness. In years prior many companions in games would get you caught, waste all of your ammo, die, or block you from progressing all while being totally silent. Elizabeth will toss you ammunition or money should she find any, will move out of your way if you walk close to her and will constantly make remarks about her surroundings.\n\nThe use of the Sky Hook and Skylines. Sure, conventional methods of transportation are just fine and dandy but it certainly never hurts to think outside the box! It's quite an enjoyable experience zipping throughout Columbia on the Skylines while fighting enemies.\n\nAspects of Bioshock Infinite worth praising\n● No Third Party Digital Rights Management. No limited amount of machine activations, no "always online" requirements, and no services other than Steam you need to sign into to play.\n\n● The Achievement Progress Saving System. You can reload checkpoints to accumulate kills and loot containers. And if you were to ever miss any Voxophones, Telescopes or Kinetoscopes,  you can simply go to "Load Chapter" and select the chapter you believe you missed it on and collect it. However, you have to be weary about Infusions as they have to be obtained in a consecutive playthrough.\n\nAspects of Bioshock Infinite worth criticizing\n● No In-Game Option To Toggle HUD or Holster Weapon! This is an unfortunate trend in many 2K Games and 2K Games affiliate products going back years. Honestly, what's the point in developing such beautiful scenery if you're not going to have the ability to take screenshots of it without a Health bar, Shield bar, Vigor bar, your arm and your gun getting in the way?\n\n● 2 Weapon Limitation. In previous Bioshock titles you had access to a wide range of different weapons via a weapon wheel. This time around it's limited to just two weapons.\n\n● Lackluster amount of choices or alternative endings. For a game that's circled around infinite parallel universes with infinite possibilities, why does Bioshock Infinite have such a lackluster amount of meaningful choices or any sort of alternate ending? It's debatable if Bioshock Infinite really needed any but I certainly wouldn't want to be the individual aruguing for less.\n\nDevelopment disagreements & degradation of the product!\nBioshock Infinite was originally going to be more of an open world game with a variety of features but with disagreements in development accompanied with the limitations the product was facing on other platforms, they decided to scrap most of what they were working on to create the version you see before you. The product Irrational Games showcased at E3 2010 is significantly different compared to the product that's available to the consumer.\n\n\nNot every game has to have more than one ending, stealth mechanics, weapon customization, a third person player view, character customization, a variety of meaningful choices, manual save mechanics, modification development tools or have no scripted moments to be a decent game. Sure, any one of these features would have been great additions and dispite of the downgrade, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite if the price is right.","August 2, 2015","true","85.2"," 64 of 76 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","64","76","4","0"

The point is that define Bioshock Infinite a shooter would be an understatement, almost wrong. That created by Irrational Games is an experience almost essential for a video game that you define. A video game where sensory, emotional involvement and narrative, really make the difference going to erase the "flaws" from a revamped gameplay. Columbia is completely different from Rapture-is a cross-section of the contradictions of the American Society of the early ' 900: a world in which dive as in reading a good book, rich in facets and details, warm and welcoming; complete. It is an experience of great impact, capable of developing in us a strong empathy towards the protagonists, and let us rejoice and suffer with them at all times. It is one of the highest forms of art in gaming, where knowledge and freedom of expression are combined to form a mosaic that cannot leave indifferent. Bioshock Infinite is a far from perfect game, with many flaws, but you can't not love; It is impossible not to want. Why Bioshock Infinite is one of those productions that leave a mark in the game industry and the player, coming long remember and increasing the personal baggage.","November 8, 2015","true","232.8"," 83 of 108 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","83","108","7","0"

However there are 2 aspects of the game which imo make it an above average shooter- the story and the game companion.\n\nThe story is a deep, memorable, open for interpretation type, borderline philosophical, which sticks with you for some time even after you close the game. It did however take me 2 playthroughs to completely understand it, but i value the effort put into the story and how throughout the game they slowly reveal details to you, just to give you a totally unexpected finale.\n\nAs for the follower/game companion, this game offers the most likable and usefull companion ive ever seen in a singleplayer game. I personally dont like followers because in most games they just block me in corridors, alert enemies to my presence, set off traps or make stupid remarks. Luckily Liz doesnt do any of these things and she also throws you ammo/health during combat when youre low, which makes you want to keep her around.\n\nThe game comes with 2 DLCs- Clash in the Clouds (combat challenge based) and Burial at Sea. While ive enjoyed the main game and CitC DLC very much for above stated reasons, the events that take place in Burial at Sea DLC were at least from my point of view very confusing and anticlimatic. Probably because i havent played BioShock 1 or 2 prior to this game, and their stories are bound.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNot to bother with numeric evaluation, lets just say i find this game to be exceptional.

This game combines identity, guilt, belief, narrative, revolution, race, national identity into one of the most brilliant and remarkable creative feats I have experienced. Taking place in an alternate 1912, you play as a handsome Booker DeWitt wrecked with debt that can only be revived by rescuing a girl from Columbia. The world revolves around a floating city fashioned by Comstock who turn an ulternate America into a religion. Columbia ferrocious thrive for racial purity stems a discontent for violent change. With this brilliant metaphysical story takes the player in a journey best discovered at a slow pace. What is so extraordinary about Bioshock Infinite is how it highlights the human needs and the choices that we make as a person. Everything from its art direction to its narrative is numbing in its inventiveness.\n\nBioshock Infinite is filled with extraordinary details in every moment manifesting from audio logs to level designs. To rush through Bioshock Infinite is to miss one of the greatest pleasures in video games. One of the most impressive accomplishments is its casts of character and especially Elizabeth's appearance throughout the game. The relationship that slowly involves and metamorphosize between you that is the central thrust in the story. The success is its sublime design and animations that turns Elizabth into the most striking character I've seen in any creative media. Elizabeth earned my affection and throughout the journey as I actually cared for her. Gameplay incorporates smooth and precise action sequences. Boss fights in mid sections change up the players vitality and it's all driven by an amazing sound score that raise these moments to extreme heights. The arial combat of the grabbling hook is fresh and a wonderous achievement as it keeps you in constant rush of adrenaline.\n\nIt was impossible for me to say goodbye in the end. Bioshock Infinite will be the game of the century and will remembered for as long as I live. Just buy it and get lost in its masterfulness.\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ /5 stars","November 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 59 of 80 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","59","80","5","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/n3rfb0yz/recommended/8870/","n3rfb0yz","METRO TANGO YANKEE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/n3rfb0yz/","103 products in account","Considering no one has made a fully objective review that analyzes actually positive aspects of this game, I took it upon myself to make one.\n\nLet's start with the bad aspects. Mainly, the gameplay. Bioshock had revolutionary gameplay; plasmids were extremely versatile and can be used for many things. Solving puzzles, starting attack combos, destroying machinery, and more. Along with the customization of upgrades and gear and great stealth mechanics, Bioshock had stellar gameplay and was different than almost all FPS's of it's time.\n\nThat is, until Infinite showed up.\n\nThe game is mechanically fun. The soundtrack and noises are amazing, and help set up the atmosphere and establish that Booker is ruthless and indifferent. The gameplay is also pretty rad in that setting up traps and using a combination of vigors is always fun. Objectively, however, it does not compare with the first game. Almost no puzzles can be solved with the vigors, and everything is pretty linear. It's strange that Infinite tries to go for an almost open world gameplay style where you can go back to places you've already visited for extra bonuses, considering it's pretty damn linear. It doesn't blend well, and going back a mile is not really good design. I don't think the average person would go back at all.\n\nThe gameplay is also somewhat repetitive. At times it seems like the average AAA title where you're just filling random people coming at you with lead. The system where you can see where you're supposed to go to finish a quest/mission is pretty awful too. Sure, Infinite might have needed it considering theres so much to visit and you may be confused with the addition of skylines, but it's still not very good design. It's blatantly telling you, "hey, go here to finish the quest!"\n\nSome design choices were also awful. Probably the only formidable foe is the handyman (which is btw, practically a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ big daddy rip off), and it only shows up like 3 times. Another design choice that annoyed me was the failed potential of Elizabeth's prowess. You would think opening up rifts to different universes would be awesome, but no. Instead, it's literally just summoning ammo and guns from nowhere.\n\nI'll cut the wall of text- the gameplay is more mediocre than the first Bioshock. It's not revolutionary and it has its fair share of flaws. It's still pretty damn cool though, and I'd personally say the gameplay is better than most Triple A gameplay.\n\nTo say I didnt enjoy it is completely wrong. As a narrative, the game is amazing.\n\nSure, most people don't play games as a medium of critical storytelling- literature and film exist, after all. However, games can easily show critical value and Infinite represents this.\n\nThe characters grow increasingly complex as you see more of their dialogue. Booker is extremely interesting. He's completely desensitized to everything- yet so fragile. It is commonly shown that Booker hardly hesitates when it comes to death and dismay. When asked about this, he even states, "One thing I've learned, if you don't draw first, you don't get to draw at all." It is suggested that the events he's been through at the battle of wounded knee made him the person he is. The event adds significant internal strife to his character; he knows he's done wrong and sinned, and he can't do anything to fix it. As stated by him, "You think a dip in the river is gonna wash away the things I've done?" Perhaps the highlight of his corrupt mind is shown when (major spoilers) he even gives away his daughter in attempts to repay his gambling debts. His fragility is shown throughout the game as well, especially torwards the end. Unlike his character, he starts to deeply care for Elizabeth and puts himself in extremely wreckless situations in attempts to protect her. When she tries to kill Comstock, he tells her that instead they should just relax in paris. He wants to run away rather than confronting Comstock. He refuses to be  baptized at the last second, showing his common trait of wanting to run away. He is emotionally scarred and he continues to prefer running away than confrontation at many times. He becomes extremely protective of Elizabeth to the point where it's obsessive and wants to prevent her from harm. It isn't much of an exaggeration to say he's fragile.\n\nElizabeth is also a deeply interesting character. Being caged throughout her whole life and forced to have only the companion of a mechanical bird, Elizabeth desires freedom and relishes it. She's stuck between a rock and a hard place- she can go back to her tower and be restrained and watched her whole life, or go with Booker to whatever the ♥♥♥♥ and be utilized to get rid of his gambling debts. She does care for Booker, though she doesn't show it often. Also with the strange ability of opening rifts to different timelines, it is suggested she feels somewhat alienated from humanity. Given that she practically has a massive hatred torwards everyone and every group throughout the game including booker and yet she's forced to stay strong and go with Booker, her character is pretty tragic.\n\nFinally, the Vox Populi is really damn cool. It's much more than just a terrorist group with guns; they were so obsessed with gaining liberty and freedom that it turned into something much different. They changed from fighting for justice to fighting simply just for actual blind hatred torwards Comstock and his people. This is easily exemplified with Fitzroy about to kill the child just because of plain hatred for his family and their increasingly brutal standards for killing enemies. The concept of Columbia was bound to have internal strife, and the Vox Populi illustrates this well.\n\nNot only are the characters are well made, but also the intricate plot.\n\nIt's a highly intelligent story, yet it doesn't try to flaunt it and end up being pretentious. The ending, like the first game, is a complete plot twist. It changes everything you know about the characters. Who the Lutece Twins really are, who Comstock really is, what elizabeth represents, and more. The game is truely a masterpiece in delivery, and at too many times during the ending I had my mouth open when I realized in my head what happened. You can also find out more about the plot the more you listen to the voxophones you find during the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/minneapolis/recommended/8870/","minneapolis","Inferno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/minneapolis/","74 products in account","Bioshock Infinite is essentially an overhyped hallway shooter. At first the atmoshphere and city seem full of potential, but as you proceed through the game, all of it disappears and is replaced by mixed feelings of boredom and dread. This isn't because the enemies or environment are frightening or intimidating, but because playing the game quickly goes from 'a promising Bioshock sequel' to 'tedious mob-killing chore oh god let me finish this game already'. Progress in Infinite is akin to cutting through thick vegetation in the jungle while waist deep in giant python-infested waters, only without the danger, suspense, and adventure that would come with such an expedition.\n\nOne would imagine that such a setting as a floating city would be an incredible feature on it's own, but alas, even the very world you play in falls flat on it's face and doesn't bother getting up, opting to roll awkwardly to it's destination instead. It is entirely forgettable that you're in a floating city once you begin to proceed through the game. Perhaps it's because rather than being able to explore the city and be reminded that you're miles in the sky, you end up just walking through one straightforward area filled with bullet sponges to the next.\n\nWhere the Bioshock games allowed the player freedom of movement around whatever section of Rapture they were in, Bioshock Infinite instead holds the player's hand and leads them down one corridor to the next; the game's map design is basically a big, fat, straight line. Previously it would take some degree of exploration and attention to move onwards. Infinite, meanwhile, decides that it's done with all that non-linearity business, and makes sure there's an abundance of giant doors with comically oversized flashing locks on them so you know exactly which end of the hall goes to the next area. After you kill all the enemies there, get ready to fight more of them. Waves after waves of them, until the end of the game.\n\n\nPerhaps the worst part of all is that all of the main features that people were pumped for were instead revealed to be nothing like expected:\n\nThose cool sky-rails that seemed to have so much potential? Almost exclusively used to circle around whatever area you happen to be mowing down baddies in.\n\nElizabeth having fun and dynamic interdimensional powers capable of smashing bad guys with items or having offensive and/or interesting combat use? They instead spawn in robots, skyhooks, cover, and guns/health/salts in a few predetermined places.\n\nThose giant handymen that seemed like they'd be fun replacements for Big Daddies? Get ready to fight two of them in the entire game.\n\nThe giant bird that was anticipated so much and seemed like you'd have an amazing showdown with? You never fight it.\n\nExpecting a pit-in-your-stomach feeling as you plummet towards the earth after walking off an edge? You simply teleport back to where you stepped off.\n\nHaving any choices in the game that could impact the ending or your overall power (like Big Daddies and harvesting/saving Little Sisters)? Don't expect anything even remotely similar, this game has no meaningful choices at all and has a hilariously stupid excuse for it (as well as the previously mentioned teleporting) that comes with the ending.\n\nWhat else do you expect from a game that Levine admitted they had to rewrite 6 months before release to accomodate the ending he came up with? It's hard to go into detail about some things (like the lame explanation for tonics existing) without spoiling the hastily assembled story, but all you need to know is that despite the mildly charming and well crafted environment (one of the few good things in this game), this game is a very poor successor to the Bioshock series, and an incredibly mediocre game overall.","November 25, 2013","false","22.5"," 1,143 of 1,936 people (59%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","59","143","1","18","36"

I love the mechanisms and gameplay. Apart from this, this game really uses your brain and your memory what you did in the game from the beginning. Elizabeth is a very beutifully crafted female characters i have ever seen in games (one of the best possibly). And Booker is a very good character as well, story flows very nicely and it does not make you bored at any place. The Hook Weapon and then death from above move is awesome, and using vigors simolatenously when you are shooting is a great combination. Elizabeth helps you mostly throught the game as a great companion by passing you health, ammo, currency and salts. And the best thing is you dont need to look after her, she always finds a safe place when you are in combat, my jaw was dropped after seing the ending, but yeah that was this game meant to be "Bioshock Infnite" ♥, i recommend this game.","October 3, 2014","true","15.6"," 54 of 80 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","54","80","0","0"

This game has received so much praise that it physically pains me, because I know in the back of my mind people with no concept of consumerism are buying into this hype train wreck.\n\nBioshock Infinite has repetitive gunplay with unsatisfying weapons that are better than their successors that appear later in the game when upgraded. It has horrible hostile A.I. that uses no form of logic other than aggressively running into the open and mindlessly attacking the player. There is also a lack of unique enemy types to freshen up the combat, and any uncommon enemy that is in the game can still be killed by simply shooting at them. No enemy types require any form of special strategy or apporach to defeat them, so the unique enemy types serve no purpose, and may as well be normal generic enemies. The vigors lack variety, and often just replace functions that mixed up the gameplay in previous installments of the series. Many of the combat vigors are simply grenades with fancy skins and a tripmine feature. Also the enemy A.I. hardly makes use of vigors, only the flame and crow enemies use any type of Vigor. Splicers in previous Bioshock titles used plasmids very often, and made enemy encounters more varied, plus with vigors taking the same role as plasmids, should they not be a commonly used tool among the citizens of Columbia? The tear feature is extremely under-utilized, and doesn't alter the game environment during combat nearly enough to really keep the experience fresh. So every fight narrows down to shooting at bullet sponge enemies and throwing vigor grenades.\n\nEscort missions have always been things players dread, but many games have achieved amazing escort mechanics such as Yoshi's Island, Resident Evil 4 and Ico. Instead of actually trying to be inventive, and making escort mechanics seem less of a chore, Irrational Games decided to remove the gameplay element of escorting Elizabeth from the equation entirely (either to pander to the feminists, or avoid the risk of adding something idiots may think is too hard). Elizabeth is unarmed the entire game in the middle of gunfights, there's no way she can, "Take care of herself," without having a weapon or some line of defense. Despite the enemy's main objective to be capturing Elizabeth, they make no efforts to do so during combat. In Ico and Yoshi's Island, the goal of the enemy faction is to capture your partner, that's why preventing them from being captured is an element to the gameplay. Why is Elizabeth in the game? Answer: To pander to Tumblr psuedo feminists who want capable female characters instead of good gameplay, and neckbeards who want to be together with Elizabeth forever. Elizabeth is a useless friendly A.I. that doesn't aid but rather wastes the players time spawning ammo, health, money or other items (due to the previously mentioned bullet-sponge enemies draining you of your ammo, and the enemies dropping ammo for guns randomly, instead of based on the weapons you are currently using) and stripping control away from the player or clouding the screen with a button prompt to receive the item you could have simply picked up yourself, and in no way takes part in combat. While she can pick locks, there is no reason Booker himself couldn't have been given this abilty during development. Either way, you still have to command her to pick the locks, so you might as well be doing it yourself, her doing it for you also removes the possibility of having lockpicking being an aspect to Infinite's gameplay. The tear ability still requires you to command Elizabeth to utilize it, therefore the ability might as well be Booker's. If Elizabeth had an A.I. that utilized tears based on which would be more advantageous to you at any given time, this would have actually given Elizabeth a purpose in the game; too bad that would require work on Irrational Games's part.\n\nInfinite is also highly praised for its atmosphere, but I disagree with this claim.  Attention to detail on the player's part will immediately remove them from the environment they are meant to be immersed in. This game's visuals are praised to be groundbreaking, but only because they used the trite orange-blue contrast everywhere they could instead of the color brown. Level design clashes with the gameplay. Now, the first Bioshock was closterphobic, cramped, tightly packed, consisting of small arenas or hallways. This compliments the more simplistic, arcade-y FPS elements of the game, where you can avoid exposing yourself to many enemies, and reveal yourself to make a quick offensive. In Infinite you have a two weapon limit, so you can't pull out a sniper (you might not have one) and make an offense in the open, you have to approach your enemy, expose yourself, and be forced to take damage. Even the enemy design clashes here, where they'll run at you with melee weapons and be slaughtered by you in the wide open spaces. The melee weapons were useful in Rapture, where enemies could ambush you and get solid hits on you, here it's assanine.\n\nMost of this game's "atmosphere" should be credited to fancy skyboxes, and bloom. Whenever I started to take in the environment, something stupid would completely spoil everything. The biggest of all being the first person cutscenes, where the game makes you watch your character do things you didn't command him to do in first person view, the main display mode of the gameplay. When playing a platformer, cutscenes don't play from the stock camera angle, or else you'd be still be in the mindset of trying to control your character, and being surprised to find out that conrol of them has been stripped from you, immediately taking you out of the game.The same rule applies here, the first person view is reserved for the gameplay, so transitions from gameplay to cutscenes are less jarring. Another huge video game sin is where the game presents choices to you through button prompts. These decision making moments aren't presented in the gameplay's format, the gameplay is stopped so you can press a button and watch your decision unfold. One should be prompted to make a decision without being removed from the actual gameplay; the whole Half Life 2 "pick up the can." scenario is a perfect example where you are presented with choice without removing you from the gameplay. The setting of Infinite is nowhere near as compelling as Rapture, where you'd wander the deserted hallways and wonder what life was like before it all fell apart. Instead, Infinite seems to prefer shoving controversial issues like racism or patriotism in, and never actually do anything intellectual with the themes presented.\n\nThe game's focus on narrative is problematic as well, simply because it takes importance over the game's gameplay; the most important part of any game. People seem to think writing has to be "cerebral" or "deep" to be good, but a simpler story that's charming, horrifying, campy, epic, joyful, or heart-breaking is just as, if not more compelling. Story is something that can be enjoyed on the side. Games shouldn't have to confrom to movies or literature, they are unique in that the player experiences them instead of watching or reading them; the events of the game are happening to you, so you are already invested in the adventure. Video games are about the actions you perform while playing them, the lessons you learn and the the emotions you have while perfoming them, and the sense of accomplishment you experience from overcoming the challenges the game made you face along the way. This game isn't worth your time or money, because it forgets the fact that video games are about the experience of playing them. Anyone willing to look at this game critically will know that buying it is a huge mistake, and a vote for games going further in the wrong direction.","December 2, 2013","false","12.4"," 922 of 1,602 people (58%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","58","922","1","9","67"

Vigors are a dumbed-down version of Plasmids that are not tangential to the plot of the game like Plasmids were to BioShock (though this is cheaply tied together in the last DLC).  Hacking is gone entirely.  Tonics have been replaced with a much smaller variety of equipable clothing.  Vending machines are horrendously expensive.  Skylines are pretty silly for methodically dispatching most enemies at ease.  The game also treats the player with an innovative and never-before-seen regenerating shield on top of their standard health bar.\n\nDoes not have the same sense of wonder and discovery of the previous games, mostly because Infinite is, dare I say, a completely different genre from the other BioShock games - it's an action FPS, and as far as I am concerned, the only thing that makes it remotely similar to BioShock is a brief tie-in with Rapture, and "BIOSHOCK:" being in the title of the game.\n\nI'd recommend it for a $10 Steam sale, not much more than that.  The Burial at Sea DLC brings you back to Rapture in the most awful way possible - playing with the same terrible, console-treated mechanics that you had to deal with in the main campaign of Infinite.  UPDATE 3/25/14:  BoS Episode 2 does a little better in this regard, forcing the player to adopt a stealthier style of play unlike the running and gunning of Infinite and DLC 1.\n\nI honestly don't get the critical circlejerk about this game.  It is easily the least fun entry in the series.  For reference, I had played the first and second BioShock games within a period of 72 hours prior to playing Infinite.\n\nUpdate 3/25/14:  Burial at Sea Episode 2 fills a lot of holes and ties a lot of plotlines together, almost to the point where it feels like filling plotholes was the only reason this DLC was created.  Nevertheless, playing as Elizabeth is a lot more interesting than Booker's chapter of the Rapture DLC, and the storyline of the second episode is a lot more important than the first.  Considering that the second DLC offers a "recap" of Booker's DLC, only purchasing Episode 2 is entirely feasible.","December 14, 2013","false","21.6"," 750 of 1,320 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","750","1","7","34"

That being said, I'll remain spoiler free if you've wandered across this review somehow and haven't played it (you should, its excellent!). Bioshock Infinite takes us from the submerged, suffocating horror of Rapture to the strident, soaring world of Colombia, high above the clouds. The atmosphere and tone is very different, but atmosphere and tone is still very much present in this world. Bioshock is dragged out of the shadows and put into the light. It works, it's a captivating fantasy world which I really enjoyed with its own hooks, but on some level its not "Bioshock" as I immediately associate it with the claustrophobic, maniacal terrors of Rapture. That's not a bad thing courtesy of its magnificent storytelling. There's a good selection of powers and weapons to choose from with a variety of playstyles to select as you please. Having the DLC made the early game feel a little too forgiving however, as you receive a substantial volume of additional resources. The highest difficulty levels present a decent challenge, you have to be moderately conservative with your ammunition and vigors. At no point did I hit a brick wall in my achievement runs of the story, a test but beatable. There is also a challenge mode over several maps, and this is a challenge! Some of the wave missions are pretty demanding and precise, and if you mess them up, you have to start the entire map again and get back to that wave. Be prepared to invest some time if you get the completionist itch.\n\nThe games strongest component is its storytelling. It's exceptional. Unlike the blank canvas of our Rapture denizens, Booker and Elizabeth are defined characters with distinct personalties, behaviours and voices. They interact heavily with the world around them, and most importantly with each other. There was a really poignant moment where I wandered into a room after a firefight, and found a guitar. Elizabeth began singing as Booker strummed. Spontaneous and incredibly touching. I normally skip such pseudo cutscenes if possible, but I found myself just sitting back and listening. That's good storytelling.They tangibly develop as characters over the course of the game, and you feels its earned and justified. Nothing is more rewarding as a player than when you yell YES! or WHAT! while playing, because you've developed a connection to the characters. There are also the classic Bioshock plot twists. Prepare to dive into the rabbit hole in this one, it gets pretty wild with some clever nods. I loved it. The game also possesses the most wonderfully bittersweet ending, which is worthy of a mention in itself. It makes your second playthrough almost as interesting as your first, as you look for the telltale signs of the set up. And oh boy is it a set up.\n\nSo the question that rises: is it better than the original Bioshock? Well, in my opinion yes, but for a specific reason. As visceral as the atmosphere and plot twist of Rapture is, the strength of the narration and characterisation in Infinite carries it above it's previous entries, with twists to match those of the first game. It goes on my all time favourites list, and my 100% completion list.\n\n'There's always a lighthouse, a man, a city'","March 1","true","54.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAnthonyNL/recommended/8870/","TheAnthonyNL","TheAnthonyNL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAnthonyNL/","3345 products in account",""Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt"  - A sentence heard in-game which you will be remember for a lifetime. Several years after Bioshock, Irrational Games and 2KGames coming up with a new game Bioshock Infinite. Want to read more about check inside...\nBefore I start, I just want to say a few words. First off, the game lasted around 16 hours, that's with completing the story from the start to the ending credits. Besides that, in my review, I'll post the cons after I've put up my review of that section.\n\nStory:"Indebted to the wrong people, with his life on the line, veteran of the U.S. Cavalry and now hired gun, Booker DeWitt has only one opportunity to wipe his slate clean. He must rescue Elizabeth, a mysterious girl imprisoned since childhood and locked up in the flying city of Columbia. Forced to trust one another, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond during their daring escape. Together, they learn to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, as they fight on zeppelins in the clouds, along high-speed Sky-Lines, and down in the streets of Columbia, all while surviving the threats of the air-city and uncovering its dark secret."\n\nThe story itself is amazing, you get so immersed into the game it's unbelievable, making it impossible to stay off the game. As you step through the story, you get a real feel for the game, you start to see how American history is referenced (I won't say too much more as I don't want to spoil it for anybody).\n\nSo yes you are Booker DeWitt, and you have to rescue a girl called Elizabeth. You enter a floating city called Columbia, which is living a lot, everywhere people are walking around and interacting with each other. Most of the times they say something which add some twists to the story you follow. As soon you find out what's wrong you will fight alot of enemies and hope you can find an answer for all your questions.\n\nThroughout the game, there are two factions, The Vox Populi and The Founders:\nThe Vox Populi (Latin for "Voice of the People"), are a militant underground insurgency group led primarily by revolutionary Daisy Fitzroy. They are in open conflict with Zachary Hale Comstock and The Founders, rejecting their puritanical and xenophobic ideology.\n\nThe Founders are a major citizen faction and political party in the city of Columbia. Their name relates to the fact that they see themselves as the true founders of the city, and they attempt to model their ideals after the founding fathers of the United States. The party promotes ultra-nationalism, religious faith in the divinity of Father Comstock, jingoism, Militarism and extreme xenophobia, and is currently engaged at war with the anarcho-communist resistance group known as the Vox Populi.\n\nBoth have there own story, decisions and things they believe in. Throughout the game you will learn more about both of them. I can tell you it will makes an interesting experience to know each story.\n\nPros:\n- This game story left a me with a mend-bend.. :).\nCons:\n- None.\n\nGameplay:The gameplay in this game is very similar to the first Bioshock. However, there are some differences, which should be noticed by the average player along with the veteran players of this franchise. I love it myself, so I definitely noticed!\n\n1. Gear: Ingame you can find and collect Gear parts. Each gear part has some stats which change some gameplay things like more damage or faster sprint and more like that.\n\n2. Vigors: Remember the plasmids from Bioshock 1? Well now they are called Vigors, they do exact the same but only difference is that you need Salt for it instead of Eve. But these Vigors are awesome, you can let people fly in the air so you can do more damage to them before they hit you, or you can make an enemy your ally to fight with you for a specific amount of time.\n\n2. Sky-Hook: This is a melee weapon and means of transportation throughout Columbia on its Sky-Lines. This thing can also be used as a melee weapon so you can hit you enemy with it or you can press a button so it insta-kill your enemy which result in flying enemies or burning ones (depends on the gear you wear).\n\n3. Elizabeth: After you rescued here, she will help  you during the fights. So she can give you ammo and health. Beside the fights she will randomly walk in the area where you are and might ask you sometimes if you need some money or she tells you that there are some lockpicks there. Yes lockpicks, Elizabeth has a great lockpicking level, but like always its hard choice to lockpick or not.\n\n4. Weapons: Booker DeWitt has alot of weapons but the only downside of this is that you can only hold 2 of them instead of all like in the first Bioshock. (For more information about all weapons can be found here: http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/BioShock_Infinite_Weapons ). Every weapon has it's own up and downside effects, like limited ammo, more damage or lot of recoil. You will experience this on your own while playing.\n\nBonus: Once you completed the game you are able to play the game again in the 1999 mode, so how you played your games when you were younger. This mode makes the enemies harder to defeat, you have no map or direction help and you get less money. Beside that there is another way to achieve the 1999 mode but from start, all you have to do is enter the konami code and you are done :D.\n\nCons:\n- I could say that 2 weapons is one of the "cons", only it doesn't make a difference to the game, but I'll still leave a note here.\n\nGraphics:Where should I start, the first time you enter Columbia you will be amazed of what you see. It's absolutely gorgeous, the visuals are beautiful. The light shines through the windows, it gleams around the buildings. Honestly, this game is a dream with it's graphics, they're fantastic.\n\nThe graphics, atmosphere and the visuals are just outstanding, they are so perfect. I'm not sure what to say more about this part of the game. It's like you walk into a dream story, you feel so immersed into the gameplay it's crazy. Great visuals make for some great sounds, too..\n\nFor the people which are wondering, i ran all settings on High. This is not the highest setting, but listen: I tried very high and ultra, and I must say I couldn't see any difference else then how the water visuals were different anything else was just the same.\n\nCons:\n- Can use a better variation of NPC faces (they look mostly all the same :().\n\nSound:Well, what can I say about the sound? The voices, the music, they're all amazing, and they add that extra pop to an already great game. The youtube video below is an example of the in-game music, but I suggest you play the game to get a feel for it.\n\nPersonal:Rating: 9/10\n\nRecommendation:This is really one-of-a-kind game you should have played. The graphics, atmosphere, story, visuals and the sound makes this game a adventure you won't easily forget. It doesn't really matter if you didn't played the first 2 bioshock games but still it would make some clue more understandable.\n\nPersonally this is the GOTY 2013 for me, let me know what you think... or at least get this game and try it for yourself.\n\nNote: Season Pass will hit soon, this should give us 3 new expansions for Bioshock Infinite which should be alternate stories. Ken Levine has stated that you don't need to finish the game in order to play the upcoming expansions.\n\nNOTE: Old review i wrote for a website. I know the season pass is already available so don't worry ;).","March 10","true","44.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guudjah/recommended/8870/","guudjah","Arth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guudjah/","193 products in account","Bioshock, the spiritual successor of system shock is built upon a series based around thrills, horrifying moments and atmosphere. While the games suffered from balancing issues and some poor design choices, they are quality horror games.\n\nBioshock infinite however has stepped away from its predecessors leaning towards a very tense and story driven experience. Anyone attempting to play this game for horror, will find it sparsely sprinkled throughout the game, and very mild mannered at best. Overall I find this to be a great path to tread.\n\nThe presentation is impeccable. The visuals are amazing. From flying vehicles to the skyrails and islands you will explore, there's never a dull area. There has been so much thought put into what you see, that areas didn't feel the same as each other. Even the enemies look wonderfull, the vigor animations are a treat to watch. A word of warning however, prepare yourself for the execution animations. I feel they are out of place, and downright gory compared to the rest of the game. After executing my second soldier, I had to stop myself as it is just too visceral for my tastes.\n\nThe characters are amazing as well. It's as if they've figured out how to make a sidekick in a video game feel alive. Elizabeth is no damsel in distress. She will always be interacting, speaking with you and exploring the world. It will never be about following you, getting in your way or being generally useless. I came to really enjoy her presence, and as the game progressed I really wanted a good ending for her.\n\nAll of this with the story being the highlight of the game. It has been a long time since a story has not held my hand. That while giving you clues as to what's going on, it never directly shouts it at you through a megaphone as if you are a fool. It is intelligent, enjoyable and throughouly worthwhile. How it tells itself through character interaction, sights and sound just floored me. If at all possible avoid spoiling this game for yourself.\n\nWith all the good things I have said about this game, I hope you are still reading, as I'm about to explain what brings this game down. That is the gameplay. Bioshock infinite has a problem and that is, it's a game. A game that does not blend itself well with its story counterpart.\n\nThere is an intensity presented in the game for your characters. You feel that they want to escape. You understand the pressure and intensity that they are going through right up until you enter any of the games many shooting segments. To get to the point, the soldier A.I is downright braindead. They lack any reasoning skills and are generally bullet magnets, and sponges to boot. The worst part is that they are the main force you will fight for the entire game. Unique enemies will present challenges and intensity from time to time, but they are too sparse to make up for it. There will be segments of up to an hour of slogging through fodder just to get a brief respite. A moment where you feel and can empathize with your characters plight, as you will be forced to move, run and fight for your life. Then it will return to being a mundane slugfest.\n\nThe reason this problem exists is that there are several flaws inherent to the games mechanics. The vigors are poorly balanced with some outshining the others. There is little reason for variance as many of the vigors are just functionally irrelevant. Why throw a grenade when you can stun, increase damage dealt, reveal from cover and never miss.\n\nThe guns as well just don't match up to each other in power. I found myself clearing the entire game without reason to drop my guns in favour of others for any situation. Ammunition is plentiful, there are vendors sprinkled throughout the majority of the game causing me to never want to remove a weapon. Possibly if you could equip more than two there would be incentive to swap.\n\nBetween the enemies, the poor gun/vigor design and the enemy variety the game gets a very dragged feeling. I very rarely felt the intensity that my characters felt. Immersion was weakened for me due to the weakness of gameplay. I feel that poor design choices and lack of A.I for regular enemies really holds the game back. It could have been much better than it is.\n\nBut that does not stop me from recommending this game. Yes, the combat is pretty dull, yes enemies are bullet sponges. The story makes up for this, and it is really something you should experience for yourself. I hope more stories in games are this interesting, with characters that feel so... real.","March 12, 2014","true","11.5"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","25","38","0","0"

Impressed by The City in the Sky. After finishing Bioshock and Bioshock 2 I thought nothing can ever compete with the world of Rapture. But then I walked in the streets of Columbia for the first time and it was so peaceful, so beautiful, so incredibly atmospheric.\n\n"There's always a lighthouse. There's always a man. There's always a city.." But still.. these two worlds are so different. In Rapture you were stuck in small rooms with very limited ways to escape. It had its own charm. Columbia is just the opposite. It has many big open areas with the possibility to move fast around by attaching sky-hooks to the city's main transport system Sky-Line.\n\nBioshock Infinite story is, without doubt, one of the best ever made for a game. It tells you the story by showing you things. Do not expect any direct explanation. This part is on you to find out what just really happened.. To put all the pieces together and try to understand.. Fortunately some people already made their explanation and interpretation of this very complicated story and that helps players like me to understand a bit better. And of course it opens more question for discussions.\n\nI have to admit I liked the combat system in previous Bioshocks a bit more. The biggest issue I had was that Bioshock Infinite allowed me to carry only two weapons. Sometimes I felt like I was stuck with what I found around. Upgrading certain weapons didn't feel very satisfying in the end. I never used them as much as I would like to. I was very frequently unsure if I should pick up different weapons around or not, because you never know what will you be facing behind the next corner.\n\nHere comes another But. You can't save your progress in the game. You have to wait for autosave. I understand their intention but it can become a bit annoying when you have to stop playing and next time you can't simply continue from where you were before.\n\nI chose hard difficulty level and it was both, enjoyable and challenging. Despite some of my complaints the fights were still very decent.\n\nTo be honest all the negative things I experienced were washed away by the impressive graphics and story. I took some time away from the game before writing this review. My mind was struck and paralyzed by the very emotional and confusing ending.\n\nThe good feelings still persist. I must recommend this game and then I must continue with the DLCs :)","December 1, 2015","true","37.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

I was a bit skeptic about the skyline feature of the game at first, but it turned out to be greatly implemented with the game's world. Some say that the game is a bit repetitive; and I won't deny that at one point, I was wondering whether the enemy killing would ever end. But personally, it felt way less forced than most games I've played. When you encounter enemies, there's always a reason or an explanation. You won't get attacked by random enemies at random times for random reasons. For once, it actually follows the plot line.\n\nThe game features a decently nice selection of weapons and upgrades, which is obviously, always a plus in any shooting game.\n\nWARNING: Slight spoiler ahead.\n\nThe "vigors" add a really nice touch to keep the game from being boring, along with the ability to get Elizabeth to open "tears" to help you along the way, which really gives you the opportunity to try different tactics to fight enemies.\nElizabeth will also sometimes throw you some supplies as you run out, so being out of ammo or "salts" during a gunfight is not very likely to happen, as long as you don't abuse Elizabeth's powers.\n\nThe characters development is truly one of the strongest point of this game. Elizabeth and the Lutece twins are the most unforgettable characters in Bioshock Infinite in my opinion.\n\nStoryline\nAw yes, the best part of playing this game.\nThe storyline in Bioshock Infinite truly sent me on a feels trip. I felt wonder, curiosity, happiness, denial, unbelief, and even a bit of sadness right through the whole game. Never at one moment, did I not stop thinking: "Why?" "Who?" "How?"\nThe game's world kept me entertained with all its great wonders, while still keeping me clinging to the plot line until the end.\n\nWARNING: Slight spoiler ahead.\n\nThe ending is probably the most memorable one I have seen in any games. The only thing that was a bit of a downer about it, is the fact that they fling at you the whole explanation in a few minutes, triggering much confusion, and leaving you with a feeling of "...what?"\nThe ending is rather complicated, and I even went and read an article explaining the ending after finishing the game, to truly understand a few minor points I had missed through the story. I ended up thinking about the game for two days straight to finally put all the puzzle pieces together. Overall, it makes much more sense than I initially thought.\n\nWARNING: MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!!! If you haven't played the game yet, DO NOT read beyond this point.\n\nI felt the story ended a bit abruptly. When I realized what was happening, that in order to break the cycle, the Booker from this universe HAD to die, I also realized that Booker DeWitt, along with Elizabeth, Comstock, and all of Columbia would no longer ever exist as they are. Without Comstock, Elizabeth would never have been who she is, and Columbia wouldn't have existed in this universe either. It felt as if after going all of what you did, all of this had been pointless, yet very necessary to break the cycle. The other versions of themselves would never know that without them, the cycle would have gone on and on. Booker and Elizabeth would now live, but in an entirely different world.\n\nThe post-credits scene was interesting as well. We see Booker sitting in his office, hearing a baby and suddenly getting up and calling "Anna" and asking if it's her. Somehow, it seems that this version of Booker slightly remembers what his other version went through, thus he doesn't believe Anna to be there. We'll never know if this theory is true or false though, since the game ends there.\n\nOverall, the game was truly memorable in every way. I really enjoyed it. I wish most games would have such an immersive story as well.","January 8, 2015","true","39.9"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/recommended/8870/","jipearce82","Senno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/","755 products in account","Bioshock Infinite really sets a new high for first person shooters - fitting really, considering its set in Columbia, a floating metropolis above the clouds. With Infinite, original Bioshock developer Irrational has changed the game, they have not attempted to transport the gunplay and atmosphere of a city at the bottom of the sea to one that literally floats to the heavens, and while there are some call-backs to the first game and both are indeed first person shooters, Bioshock Infinite is a fresh experience once again delivered in a stunning original world whose first moments may just illicit the same awe we all got on our first view of the failed utopia of Rapture.\n\nIrrational Games is known as a genuine outlier to predictability. It creates worlds that gamers will want to explore, from the destroyed capitalist freedom that was crushed under its own economic weight (Bioshock) to the claustrophobic fear of an over-run starship (System Shock 2), and with Infinite, Irrational has developed Columbia, a promised land, where, once again, not everything is as it seems.\n\nColumbia feels very much like a place that at one point may have existed. It is the vision of a zealous ultra-nationalistic leader who sees himself as the prophet for a new era in American exceptionalism. With its own history, hierarchy, and propaganda filling the city's streets, children playing on sidewalks and the constant views to the clouds, Bioshock Infinite paints a very different picture and atmosphere to that of its predecessors, but this fantastical world feels alive and genuine - and one you'll happily delve into.\n\nThe world painted by Infinite is all the more believable due to its amazing cast of characters, chief among these being Elizabeth, the character for whom the game's story is set in motion. As war veteran turned private inspector Booker DeWitt your objective is to infiltrate the city and kidnap the "girl" in order to "wipe away the debt". The first hour spent in his shoes gives only the barest hints of his mysterious character, and he is clearly not a virtuous man, though this isn't a weakness in the game's desire to coax you into his backstory.\n\nBooker's backstory and his character are filled out by Elizabeth, who early in the title you are able to break free from her captors before the city turns against you. She rarely leaves your side, even in a firefight, and while she's not one to grab a rifle and start blasting away, she will throw you ammo and health as needed, coin when it's safe, and even use her powers of manipulating time and space to allow for some truly fiendish and clever gameplay.\n\nElizabeth is an amazing character, up there with Alex of Half Life 2 and Tali Zorah Nar'Rayya of Mass Effect. She is a companion you will truly grow to love over the course of the game. During idle moments, she may speak her thoughts about your recent actions or what she sees in the world. Elizabeth is a fully fleshed out character that few games ever truly aspire too, and Infinite is all the better for it. Her presence is a departure from the previous titles in which you travelled alone, and she greatly contributes to the game's emotional depth and your character's motivation.\n\nHer captor, the zealous antagonist Zachary Comstock, is a great villain in that he is seen as a prophet by his followers and is reprehensible in the eyes of the player. He has a level of evil that permeates the entire game, with his followers drawn to his stirring ideals and manipulation of the game’s events.\n\nThose you will be fighting throughout the game are somewhat more comical; George Washington Patriot robots, three metre tall human cyborg handymen, cops, security men and various citizens. There are many variations on these few enemies, though none feel as developed or as interesting as the various splicers from the previous Bioshock titles.\n\nAccepting that, Infinite’s Songbird feels only slightly more developed than the Big Sister character of Bioshock 2. Awe-inspiring and a little chilling at first sight, but whenever he shows up the game kicks into high-gear with some thrilling chase sequences. It’s a shame he doesn’t live up to his premise as Elizabeth’s keeper, though he does play a crucial role in how the story is set up.\n\nAs with the original Bioshock, your shooting prowess is augmented by a power system, in this case, vigors, which can bolster your offence with electricity zaps or fireballs, among others. They each can be powered up with tonics found throughout the game, and they also have secondary fire capabilities, usually as traps for unsuspecting enemies. With one hand dedicated to firing at enemies and another for using various powers, there’s a wide variety to how any various encounter may play out. And in addition, Elizabeth can use her powers to bring extra guns, health packs, cover and turrets into the world, providing another layer of strategy to firefights.\n\nBioshock Infinite’s story doesn’t end when you “get the girl” to “clear away the debt”, and much like the original Bioshock, doors are closed off to you to exit areas until you complete an objective in the current zone. This could feel infuriating, yet I was never angered to explore Columbia some more, and the story does take a few turns you might not expect. If you are expecting a mid-game twist like that in the original title you will be happy to hear that Infinite has one as well, and it’s a doozy. I know I didn’t expect it and it comes out of left field, though on careful replays there has been some build-up I overlooked. And at the satisfying conclusion of the title, some fifteen hours or so after start (it’s a little shorter than that, but I definitely lingered in some areas), you will definitely want to talk about what just transpired, like all good movies wish to accomplish.\n\nBefore release, I had to question whether Irrational Games could hit the extremely high expectations of gamers again. Overall, I believe they have delivered. Infinite is a remarkable game that offers a distinct experience in a new signature world as every bit as satisfying as our first ventures into Rapture. Infinite is a brilliant shooter and stands out in a ‘me-too’ market, providing satisfying gunplay, some great characters and some amazing innovations in its world, atmosphere and storytelling. Highly recommended, and I suggest purchasing it, would you kindly?\n\n9.2/10","December 2, 2013","true","75.7"," 89 of 157 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","89","157","0","6"

Takes about 10-20 hours to play and is a great offline game (why I don't have more hours into this).\n\nThe story mixes with the actual game and makes a great combo the fighting is never boring due to the combination of guns and vigors (magic). The combat itself is hard and forgiving because of the fall back to a checkpoint style of death while at the same time keeping with the story which every part of this game does perfectly, there's no meta game moments which brings the world in a beautiful way to you, uninterrupted by gameplay. The game is fresh and unique while at the same time familiar and easy to grasp again.\n\nThe story is that of the best I've played for a long time and without giving away spoilers its one you most likely won't get until the game tells you. It gives you the nice twist you (should) expect and it ties it off, yet in a way that allows for another game after this.\n\n=== Complaints:\n\nChoices don't matter in this game but they still make the world different and... well its related to the story.\n\nThere are no puzzles like I expected... aside from The one in the very beginning regarding bells and that... that's a joke.\n\nEasy mode is... nothing normal is easy hard is normal and 1999 (konami code) is hard. by that I honestly mean that hard (normal) makes you use your skills and your guns or else, you can also make it through without any back tracking or grinding for money. Easy you could probably use your melee through the entire game. 1999, is the hard mode you expect, requires precision and sometimes may involve an actual use of vigor combinations along with just about anything else.\n\nLast is the vigors... they are great and each person has their own favorites, once you find yours you wont stray too far except in some situational use.\n\n=== Warnings/Spoiler free tips:\n\nIf you fancy yourself a seasoned gamer I would recommend entering the konami code at the main menu (where you get an options menu) this will give you a tougher game mode and you don't have to repeat the game in hard / normal / easy. (although I will still play the game on the harder mode so that I can revisit and re analyze the game.)\n\nPay attention.\n\nCollect the voice recorders to uncover the full story.\n\nStory: 10/10 (WoAh, watch out for that twist)\nGameplay: 9/10 (FPS, not very exciting. +Vigors or else it would be 7)\nPresentation: 10/10 (Good style)\nSoundtrack: 7/10 (Non memorable, a few snipets of pop culture type of music)\nReplayability: 5/10 (If you do it will feel like a chore, or that you have been betrayed by the game.)","January 13, 2014","true","12.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Those bosses are the definition of rushing toward them and flee them at the same time. The difficulty is perfectly balanced on this game.

It is the third game in the BioShock franchise and you don't need to have played the first two to enjoy this one ^_^\n\nYou play as Booker DeWitt, an ex-Pinkerton agent, who was instructed to bring a girl and wipe away his debt... join him as he unfolds the mystery that lies inside Columbia.\n\nThe story is the strongest point of the game. No doubt, it has one of the best stories ever.... rivaling novels and such. The game starts off very confusing, but explains everything as you go. Honestly, I had to pause the game multiple times just to take in what happened. I also had multiple "Holy Sh*t" moments because of the wonderfully executed story-telling and all it's unexpected twists and turns :) It's just beautiful..... gave me goosebumps :3\n\nThe visuals of the game is very colorful and bright but somehow very eerie and unsettling...... I love it :D Somehow it feels repetetive, but pretty nonetheless :3The AI of Elizabeth feels so alive, she isn't dull and she will keep herself occupied if she gets bored. The music just blends with the atmosphere so flawlessly that it feels natural e.g. a bad rendition of Nocturne will be playing in the slums of the city while a beautiful orchestral piece will play in the higher class. The stunning music and artwork of this game will transport you to the world of BioShock Infinite.\n\nThe gameplay is an FPS with RPG elements put into it. You wield a weapon in one hand and a Vigor in another, experiment with them all to find out what best suits your playing style ^^ At first, I thought fighting while using the Sky Lines would be confusing, but it surprisingly isn't :D You do have to familiarize yourself with the battleground as the combat in this game can get intense.\n\nOverall Experience: I love this game so much, it's the story and atmosphere that really got to me. It's a masterpiece and it deserves the praise it got. Although the game stutters at times, it's not enough to ruin the experience. I highly recommend this game ^_^ It's an experience that you shouldn't miss.....","December 14, 2013","true","45.1"," 72 of 127 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","72","127","0","4"

''Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt' Its all a bit vague at the beginning but as the story progresses you will see what it was all about in the beginning. Next to all this, when you travel to the cloud city of colombia people recognize you as some sort of antichrist and they are all gunning for your head. On colombia there is racism and hatred going around plenty. You have to choose a side. You come across Elizabeth the girl you need to save early on in the game. But she is being held hostage in a tower guarded by a giant birdlike creature with the name Songbird. Well you can find the rest out for yourself. to keep it short. the story is good. A bit predictable but with enough twists to keep you guessing whats really happening till the end. Storywise this game has its plottwists but it is well voiceacted and carried out great so im not complaining.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis is a first person shooter. You can play trough the game in 10 hours or so if you ignore everything around you and go straight for the story. People like me take a bit longer because im trying to collect every damn thing there is to collect. (which I failed to do too lol).\nThe gun handling is okay I guess but what stands out the most are the vigors. you can create traps and lure your enemy into them, you can lauch enemies into the air, push them away and set them on fire. It was fun finding good combinations with the vigors to devastate your enemies. The variety in weapons was not that great. You have  like 10-12 weapons in 2 different variations. But they basically do the same, the only thing that differs are the names. But I didn't mind that. I just chose the 2 weapons I enjoyed the most playing with. And kept those for the rest of my playtrough.\n\nAlso there are a couple of enemy types you will encounter on your trip to Colombia. They offer enough variety in gameplay. You will have to adapt to the enemies that are thrown at you. The hardest gamemode was a more of a challange than the rest. It keeps you on the edge of your seat so to speak.\n\n*SPOILERWARNING*\nAs it turns out her father Comstock locked Elizabeth up in that tower to contain her. Elzabeth is a gifted girl who can open 'tears' to other places and worlds. Prophet Comstock thinks you are the Antichrist. As it turns out you are actually Comstock but from another world or something.  Yeah its all kind of messed up in Colombia but it was a fun rollercoaster in the end.\n\nConclusion & Final verdict\nShould you buy this game?\nIMO yes. if you love a entertaining story with enough twists and turns, some good gameplay and great voiceacting you will surely enjoy this game. Its not at all like the 2 other bioshock games. If you want that rapture thing back, well its not really here. You should get the 2 DLC packs for this game. Its a refreshing take on this franchise and after all I had a blast playing trough this game.\nIts all I wanted and expected out of a game like this and therefore my final verdict for Bioshock Infinite is a great 9/10\n\nDo I recommend this? If it wasnt clear for you yet, do yourself a favour and buy this already.\nWant more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

The combat is limiting and repetitive with a two weapon limit with an expensive as hell upgrade system. The "Vigors" (plasmids with a new coat of paint) all do the same thing with three exceptions: Possess machines for a short period of time (Not the same as hacking from Bioshock 1), charge at enemies with a strong melee attack (comes with a certain upgrade that makes it stupidly overpowered so you'll probably not use anything else), and an ability to catch and reflect bullets (would have been pretty cool if it wasn't given to you at practically the last part of the game), all other Vigors are just the same crowd control effect with a different look.\nThe story doesn't save the game either. In the beginning it tries to send a message about racial equality and revolution but that's thrown away in favor of theories about alternate-dimensions/realities (which don't make any sense at all the second you start thinking about them).\nAlso; why did they feel like they needed to have a twist ending in Infinite? Just because the first game had one? They also did it in Infinite's DLC. Are twist endings now a staple for this series? Do they understand how a twist ending is supposed to work? A twist only works if the audience isn't expecting it, just by making your series the "Series with twist endings in them" you're ruining the surprise because people will be expecting it. That's what made the twist in Bioshock work, the game gave everyone enough hints towards the twist without giving it away; no one was expecting it. In Infinite the twist is not hinted at at all, I played the game twice just to make sure I missed something but any actual hints towards the big reveal were extremely vague.\nIt's only 12 hours long but many areas felt like unnecessary padding. The ending is 20 minutes long and it's whole purpose is to provide an explanation to many of the mysteries in the game, but it fails. Not only are many questions left unanswered, many more questions are raised. They try to explain most mysteries with alternate dimensions and quantum physics which ends up not making any sense.\nOn a sunnier note, Columbia as a setting was pretty cool, but I honestly think this is the only thing the game truly has going for it.\n\nWait a minute that card/10","January 21, 2014","false","26.4"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","39","66","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/8870/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","BioShock Infinite is the third entry in the BioShock series, notably taking place outside of the underwater city of Rapture and heading to the skies to a flying city known as Columbia.\n\nColumbia is set in the early 1900s, and the sort of themes you'd expect with that time period come-up as well. The early innovative machine craze, racism, sexism, a city divided by the rich and the poor, among many other themes. While these themes are explored, unfortunately most feel like they become rather underutilized for the last third of the game as the main story sort of kicks in.\n\nWe follow a man named Booker DeWitt, who's come to Columbia to wipe away the debt. He has to capture a girl named Elizabeth, who we quickly figure out is some kind of icon for the city. She is guarded in a very Statue of Liberty-type structure, and has a giant colossal bird guardian known as the Songbird. And upon her rescue, we quickly find out why she is so precious to this town... She has the ability to open up tears in reality, which break the rules of time and space and go into other time periods and alternate dimensions.\n\nBioShock Infinite is a weird game for me. I both loved it, and didn't at the same time. Maybe a more appropriate way to word this is that I loved parts of it, and other parts didn't quite do it for me. I feel the game was maybe plagued by having way too many ideas, that many of them end up feeling kind of underutilized. And meanwhile other elements feel like they get too much attention and focus.\n\nThe game is insanely pretty and visually impressed me time and time again to the climax. It doesn't look particularly realistic, but has an artistic and colorful charm, with some fantastic lighting effects, that really bring the world of Columbia alive. This is backed by excellent attention to detail, there is a bunch of small things in the environments that really make the whole location feel believable, if not fantasy-esque. The setting really did it for me, while it's maybe not as well realized or atmospheric as the forefather city of Rapture, it has charms that may strike high with those with a love of early 1900s aesthetics, gardens, and steampunk charm. The characters are also well-designed and expressive.\n\nThe music in the game is rather well done too. The soundtrack supports each scene, and audio is utilized well in the environment. A few songs one might recognize also creep their way into the game, with some spun into early 1900s versions of themselves. With classic-style renditions of Girls Just Want To Have Fun and Everybody Wants to Rule the World, who can complain?\n\nVoicing is also really well handled. While a few actors can be noted on who they are on the spot (such as our everyman voice of Booker, voiced by none other than Troy Baker, though I think most gamers who play the game will know), but they do good on delivery, emotion, and sounding natural.\n\nThis game is probably too action-focused for it's own good, especially in the last third of the game. Up until that point, I did find the combat to be enjoyable, adrenaline-pumping, and well spaced out with other elements. But to the last third, combat becomes far more frequent and honestly overstayed its welcome. And this honestly is probably the single biggest sin the game commits, as it threatens to ruin the otherwise fantastic endgame the game provides, and may make many too frustrated or just bored of tedium to really enjoy the things around them.\n\nI feel BioShock Infinite is at its best when it's not composed of action corridors and shoot-out sequences. And there thankfully is a lot of that here too. There's a lot of things off the beaten path to indulge yourself in. Areas to explore for the sake of exploration, little side distraction, secret scenes you can trigger, things to interact with... I think I enjoyed the game most in downtime to explore the vibrant world of Columbia. It's an element one could skip over the entire game, but I honestly think they'd be robbing themselves of some of the best moments and enjoyable qualities that Infinite holds.\n\nAnd when BioShock Infinite is good, it's really good. If you happen to be a person who loves exploring, world-building, and just getting into the atmosphere of a game and taking everything in, Infinite has moments like this in spades, and the title may be worth experiencing alone for this purpose. It's littered with interesting sights, moments, and memorabilia. And the game isn't super short, it should take someone between 10-25 hours to complete it (the time varies so greatly because of all of this optional content one can either partake in or not, I personally was around the 22-hour mark).\n\nBut then certain elements feel so underutilized it's honestly disappointing, or certain things feel like they could of been spaced out more. The Songbird's role becomes rather lackluster unfortunately and hardly lives up to the promise such a beast holds. Certain story threads are delved into, but still feel underutilized, especially as so many are dropped so easily, leading to a lot of themes and plot threads feeling non-conclusive, or really just there to be there. The rail segments, where you can hop and ride on rails, are interesting and appropriately adrenaline-fueled, but in the end are shifted over to hardly more than a distraction or a method to one-hit kill enemies. And then even possibilities the game brings up, both in narrative and mechanics, feels like they remain underutilized as well.\n\nAnd I think that's why the combat feels even more tedious towards the end. Because the game seems to want to deny itself delving into the really fantastical and instead rest on what we've seen a lot of in the last few years, a first-person shooter. It's not a bad first-person shooter, but it feels like it was too scared these other more interesting elements would bore some action-craving crowd and drags us back reluctantly to remind us that's the core game here.\n\nBut I'd still say BioShock Infinite is worth experiencing. While unfortunately the whole is not as great as it could be, the sums of its parts hold absolute brilliance and are definitely worth experiencing. And the climax and finale, while what I expect many won't see coming, are deliciously... Well, that'd be telling.\n\nBioShock Infinite is pretty, backed with fantastic atmosphere, world-building, and more brilliant moments that most any other game could envy. But it's because of these moments the tedium of the game, especially as a first-person shooter, really stands out and starts to grate on the player. It's still worth experiencing though, even if it provides both the antidote to what's wrong with FPS in this day and age, and the poison.","May 4, 2014","true","32.1"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","18","27","0","1"

Bought it as a combo pack with all three games.  Friend has been raving about the series for years to me. I play the first and am blown away by the story.  Start the second one and couldn't even get past an an hour into and am thinking total garbage.  So the third installment I put on hold for quite awhile.  Finally get a wild hair to sit down and play it.  It is a very graphical stunning game.  I'm a little at a lose on written this review because it's a good game possible a great one with one thing I'm not 100% sold on the story.  The story is good but it was completely rushed it starts out slow like the first one that's fine getting your bearings and the lay of the land.  But then you hit the action and it's done quicker then a plate of oreos' at a weight watchers meeting.    It leaves you wanting more or it does in my opinion.  A person could easily finish this game in ten hours just rushing it not exploring or all that jazz.  I would feel even more cheap, dirty, and used like a five dollar hooker if I had paid full price for the game.  I did not so the feeling passed pretty quickly think I picked up all three and the season pass for idk around $20.  The story itself is good but you wish it had a little more detail to it.  All in all a good game don't let this review discourage your from purchasing it.  And the ending linking up to the Bioshock original wasn't even needed.  Love how they did just not fundamental to the story.  I would rate this game a 7.5 maybe an 8 but more towards the 7.5 mark.   Graphics superbly done. Story I liked it but didn't love it.  All in all if your a fan of the first skip the second and purchase this one.  If your new to series doesn't matter the order you play them just skip the second and your golden.  This game should definitaly be on your wishlist at the very least.","September 9, 2014","true","15.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

But overall graphically I am very amazed.\n\nBut games aren't about graphics, unless you're a naive 10 year old kid, so how's the gameplay? Well, it's great, a lot of combat situations felt really intense and fun, though I do recommend playing on a higher difficulty, since the game is pretty easy for most parts (and this is coming from a person who is not very good at FPS!), Elizabeth usually revived me if I didn't notice my health dropping, and ammo was plentiful, and so were the guns. But over all the game has a lot of hidden treasures to find, has optional objectives (not too many though, which is somewhat dissapointing), and Elizabeth can unlock doors and chests using lockpicks to get a bunch of good loot too!\n\nNow let's get to the best part - the story. Now the story is quite something, by the end I had my jaw dropped without even noticing, there are so many plot twists that just aren't expected, there's a lot of lore to find in the game that does tie the story up together, but it did leave me confused a bunch of times, in a good way, though. Elizabeth is an incredibely interesting character (and pretty good looking too, I should admit), and most of the story is based more or less about her, and her father Comstock, as well as a big (and bad) revolution of the Vox Populi, that are mainly of second class citizens of Columbia, the racist capital of the world.\n\nOverall, the game exceeded my expecatations, but what stuck out to me the most was the story, which left me wondering and speclating it long after I passed it.\n\nSeriously, give this game a go, it's a masterpiece.","March 17, 2014","true","18.1"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/8870/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nBioshock Infinite is a first person shooter with an excellent story, fast paced game play, varying challenges, and dynamic character upgrades that help keep the game fresh and going. This game will easily make it on my favorite games list, and the leader in its genre.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Have you ever completed a game and can’t remember any of the characters names? I think this is a common problem we all have, and game designers try their hardest to make sure you remember their protagonist.\nIn Bioshock Infinite you will never forget the names “Booker DeWitt”, “Elizabeth”, or “Father Comstock”. Why? You may ask; it’s because these characters are fascinating, you’re drawn into the spiraling story and floating city that is “Columbia”.\nI won’t give away any important plot details, just know that each time I thought I understood where the story was going, it was changed and reversed leaving me astonished and eager to learn what would happen next.\n\nGame Play: Unlike the past two Bioshock games, this game limits you to using two weapons and two Vigors (aka, your: Force Powers / Mana / Plasmids) . I preferred this mechanic because it simplified the controls and made you plan which devices suited your strategy.\nThere are two other elements to talk about regarding game play: transportation, and clothes. In this game you get to use a special tool that lets you zip along rail lines, which I must admit still hasn’t gotten old for me. Instead of having gene tonics (DNA adjustments that gave you special abilities and strengths) you have clothes which do the same.\n\nAchievements: Bioshock Infinite has a total of 80 achievements, about half of these are earned in the main game, the rest are from DLC. Regarding the achievement types; they’re what you would expect, story achievements, killing enemies with certain guns, killing enemies certain styles, collecting all the voice recordings, find all the things, and beating the game on the hardest difficulty.\n\nPrice: Bioshock Infinite is  $29.99. At the time I’m writing this review, I’ve put in 18.5 hours; on my first play through I played very thoroughly (I was only missing 1 voxiphone/Voice-recordings at the end *cries*) I think this is a fair price for the amount of time I spent playing, as always I suggest you purchase the game on sale or from a humble bundle.\n\nConclusion: Many people have asked me to compare Bioshock 1, 2, and infinite. What I said is that they’re all extremely good games, but for infinite you don’t need to play the first and second game because it’s a completely different setting.\nNaturally the game feels more new, but that shouldn’t undermine the fact that the whole Bioshock series has raised the bar, and up to this point Bioshock infinite is the most worthy successor yet. One can only wonder what might be to come next?\nI’m Atratzu, and I highly recommend this game.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update April 10, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock\nHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock 2","January 27, 2015","true","18.5"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/recommended/8870/","biendeo","Biendeo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/","835 products in account","Long story short: Not as solid as a game as the other Bioshocks, but amazing at story-telling, even if it takes a bit too much from Half-Life 2's book. Excellent as a finisher for the trilogy's story.\nDISCLAIMER: I don't own the DLC for this title, so I can't give an opinion on it. I've heard the Burial At Sea episodes are really good though, possibly better than the main game. Check reviews for the season pass before you make your purchase.\n\nBioshock Infinite was rated really highly for Game of the Year 2013. And rightly so, the game does an amazing job at wowing the player. The amazing visuals, spectacular voice acting, and brilliant underlying motifs and themes make this one of the most memorable games of the year. However, gameplay features have been stripped down from the original Bioshock, some for the better, but in general the gameplay has ended up being a glorified shooting gallery rather than the maze-like claustrophobia that is Rapture.\n\nInfinite takes place in Columbia, a city above the clouds, rich in detail as light floods the streets of moving buildings, vapour passes underneath, and zeppelins float by. The story goes like this (and I will keep this spoiler-free and brief): you play as Booker, a guy who is sent to capture a woman for someone else. That girl ends up being Elizabeth, who becomes your companion after about a quarter of the game. Her characterisation is great; she gives this sense of trapped freedom throughout the entire game. Certain scripted areas really bring out her personality a lot. In the meanwhile, the citizens of Columbia turn against you after discovering a mark of the False Prophet on your hand. This theme of religion is explored pretty well throughout the game as well.\n\nThe story is told in a Half-Life 2 fashion: you move from locale to locale to progress the game, each place broken up by a "cutscene" like area where, while control isn't taken away from the player sometimes, you're contained in an area until the dialogue has finished. It's alright, even if the pace slows down a little bit too much. There's also hidden voice logs around in typical Bioshock fashion just to add a bit more lore to the world.\n\nThe ironic part about Infinite is that, for a game that has risen from the ocean in terms of locale, it's also lost a lot of depth in gameplay. On surface-level, Booker can hold only two weapons, and can unleash any of his vigour powers (magic spells essentially) at any time in conjunction, such as shooting with a revolver and unleashing crows on enemies. Hacking is non-existent now, and has been pushed into a vigour of its own.\n\nMost of the enemies are gun-wielding humans, which means the combat is cover-based. The health accommodates for this by using an armour/health mechanic where armour is cheap but rechargeable, whereas health can only be restored with pickups, giving the player a bit of room for error (which is always nice) without being ridiculously forgiving. Some enemies, such as the Handyman are more tank-like enemies (like the Big Daddies from Bioshock 1), and involve a much different playstyle to take down. However, the gunplay doesn't entirely work in its favour: unlike the Big Daddies, you're more or so launched into arenas with the Handymen, so traps and clever planning cannot be used; a drop in depth.\n\nThe combat itself is a bit more dynamic that other cover-based shooters, however. Elizabeth has the ability to pull in objects from alternate dimensions or time periods such as cover, grappling hooks, health packs, etc. It's neat the first few times, but it seems a bit too contextual as some areas lack these tears, and combat reverts to the standard peak and shoot strategy, rather than the dynamic cover-shifting that the developers tried to implement.\n\nElizabeth also can sometimes find items throughout the game, which, again, feels contextual. A lot of the time, she'll give items when you need it, which makes her seem a lot more useful than she actually is. However, I think it's a mistep that Elizabeth will sometimes find money during gunfights, and think it's a good idea to hand over as bullets wizz past her head.\n\nFinally on combat, there's certain areas with skyhook rails, places where you can latch onto a rail and shoot along as you zoom down the line. The game makes it easy to hop on and off, and a couple of places in the game utilise this in a huge arena-like setting. Unfortunately, it makes gunplay a bit difficult, at least on PC, as you do not lock on to targets, making hitting them while moving a challenging endeavour. This is alleviated by the ability to crush enemies by landing on them, but it does make these sections seem a bit sporadic more than anything.\n\nWeapons and vigours can be upgraded throughout the game, and fortunately the amount of money given to you in the game is quite small, only allowing you to upgrade a fraction of the things you can upgrade. However, the fact that you can only wield two weapons means that you can decide on a favourite playstyle and run with that, utilising other weapons only when they're handed to you. The vigours also are not utilised as much as the predecessors (for example, the hacking vigour is used a lot less than I'd like it to be used (I think I used it about eight times in the game)).\n\nThe biggest issue with Bioshock is that it's the third and final game in the series, yet a lot of its features seem a bit worse than the original titles. It's hard to discuss on its own just because I'm constantly reminded of what is missing, as opposed to what is there. However, the story is subjectively better than the previous titles: the land of Columbia is wonderous and well realised. It's also beautifully modelled and textured, and is a joy to look at.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a very good story, but it's not as solid a game as its predecessors. I'd recommend grabbing the trilogy package if you're new to the series but like first-person shooter titles as, while it's worth playing, it's not as good as the original Bioshock. If you do own the previous games, this game is still worth your money.\n\nRATING: 2 UP, 1 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.\n\n[/table]            0 UPs        1 UPs        2 UPs        3 UPs                Not worth playing, skip it        Alright, play it if you're into the genre        Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying        One to go down in history, a must have for everyone[/table]            0 DOWNs        1 DOWNs        2 DOWNs        3 DOWNs                Nothing detrimental in the game        A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it        Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it        Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do","December 26, 2014","true","16.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","4"

A society that is eventually flipped into a bloody civil war.\n\nI won't go in to much more about the plot, because I want to spoil as little as possible.\n\nBut the gameplay is quite FPS generic, you get some weapons, you shoot some guys, but you also have your "special powers" Throughout Columbia you find bottles, you can drink these bottles and with them come great power, power to kill. These powers make all battles a bit more interesting, and there is also a hook which via "cables" in the sky you can travel quite fast around the battle areas, surprising your enemy from above.\n\nI would say what makes this game is the story, and especially the ending, however the gameplay isn't bad but it isn't great either.

The interesting thing about The Queen is she cries a lot and makes lots of tears that make black-and-white things appear like in the olden days. This is used as a very unique mechanic in battles to overcome Cornstarch's, Slater's and Mr. Vox Populi's men. Additionally, the town of spingleton has many sky train tracks that Booker can latch on an take The Queen on a sightseeing journey whilst being shot at. The enemies also vary quite a significant amount, from the fireman who ironically throws fire and explodes to the handyman who has hands.The special powers in this game, also knows as nigors, are as diverse as the number 8 and offer a great variation of gameplay. For example:\n\nIn one instance you may step back and press the button for you nigor to fire birds at the enemies to finish them off, or perhaps you may choose a different route and stay back and press the button for your nigor to throw a fireball at the enemy, or maybe you might choose instead to stay back and press the button for your nigor to use the lightning on your enemy and give them a shock (get it?), or you might diverge and choose to stay back and use the nigor that throws a ball of energy at them or even choose to stay back and make horse sounds as they decide to float. The list goes on...\n\nThe story of Bioshock is even more depthy, as the man Cornstarch and the relationship between him and The Queen becomes more evident.

The game mechanics are excellent, and places it right up with with the best shooters. The thing that puts it a cut above the others is its narrative, which, as is true of all geat works of science fiction, is well written, keeps you guessing, and gives you plenty of concepts and ideas to try to wrap your mind around.\n\nFor those who don't care about a litterary tour de force with lots of brain food included, there's still plenty here to hold one's interest. Along the way one will find articles of clothing imbued with powers, vigors (essentially spells), and weapons. The weapons and vigors have upgrade paths, but upgrading costs money, and money is limited, so one must carefully pick and choose. It's next to impossible to get every upgrade in the game. To do so one must find every silver eagle in the game and never get killed, and have a little luck on top of it all.\n\nIf you do not already have this game I strongly recommend getting it, for it is destined to become a classic, and perhaps a rare multi-generational one too.","March 29","true","350.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

I'm not going to write down any "pros" or "cons" but I will talk about abit of my experience with this game.\n\nThis game was laying around my house in a case, I was abit sceptical about playing this game considering the games I usually play consists of open world RPG type games so I wasn't really sure how I would enjoy playing a story following game. I have played story games before and I particularly enjoyed portal 2 and beyond two souls (ps exclusive) but I generally would always feel incomplete when I finish a game and I’m unable to keep playing more the often I would be disappointed with an ending and then I would feel as if i wasted my time playing a game that lead nowhere or too have a good story build up for it just too end on a crappy note.\n\nThis game on the other hand I was actually so happy too finish, it gave me a sense of fulfilment that I generally don’t achieve with this type of game. I was worried about jumping straight into this game because I actually haven't played the first two games but coming to a realisation that Bioshock Infinite had nothing to do with the older games gave me the all clear and I can tell you now that I really want too play the first two before I have a go at the DLC (also because the first two is on sale at the moment)\n\nI really don’t know how to write reviews about games without spoiling it but what I can say is that this is the most smart games I’ve ever played it literally is the game that craps all over those people who say that games are unintelligent and that they make you unintelligent when there is heaps too think about when it comes too this game, I finished that game but I am still interested too learn more about the story because I’m sure there are alot of theory’s out there that are going too make this game stay alive.\n\nI just wanted too thank my boyfriend for buying me this game and 2K games for publishing this wonderful journey (if I may).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Craftian/recommended/8870/","Craftian","Craftian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Craftian/","147 products in account","A lighthouse. A man. A city.\n\nIrrational's conclusion to the BioShock mythos was widely considered an instant classic upon release and rightly so. The game pays homage to the classics of the late 1990s such as System Shock 2; bringing the excellent design and relevant mechanics of such games to a mostly new audience and era. But unless you've been living under a rock for the past few years, you probably already know this and also have probably played it, so I'll skip the formalities and get right into it. Heads or tails?\n\nYou are Booker DeWitt, a tortured, former Pinkerton agent, sent by his mysterious employers to the floating city of Columbia, a steampunk, pseudo-Christian dystopia to find the young woman Elizabeth, the city's mysterious idol and supposed heir of Father Comstock, the so-called Prophet and main antagonist. Your goal? To bring them the girl and wipe away the debt. In leading the beloved Lamb of Columbia astray however, your journey as The False Shepherd will take you beyond the blood-soaked city, the ruthless factions vying for control and morality itself as the two descend to where you may not want to go.\n\n"We all make choices\nbut in the end,\nour choices make us."\n\nDrawing heavy influence from science fiction and philosophy, BioShock Infinite features a narrative unlike any other, proudly boasting complex themes and a well-written cast characters as the game ultimately plays out as a thought experiment, hinted at from the opening title and the plethora of voxophones, (the audio logs of Columbia), that can be collected. Though it is in the format of a first-person shooter, (with deeply satisfying and fluid gameplay to boot), the world of Infinite is rich and full of life and stands head-and-shoulders above the barrage of military shooters in recent years. The opening sequence is especially memorable and opening the doors to Columbia will certainly be remembered for the breathtaking moment that it is.\n\nWhat you will immediately notice upon playing is just how gorgeous Unreal Engine 3 is, even today. Though the occasional muddy texture would catch my eye or a slight pop-in, as a shameless cinephile, the colour palette really is the gaming equivalent of the Technicolor of classic cinema, i.e. that it is absolutely beautiful to look at.\n\nNow, of course, it would be criminal if I didn't dedicate an entire section to the Sky-Hook. Already featuring the lore-appropriate return of the Plasmid-like Vigors, combat will quickly introduce you to the Sky-Line feature that links the quantum levitation of Columbia's buildings together through a suspended rail system, which you are free to use whenever you like, with a quick magnetised jump on or off. The manual executions with the Sky-Hook are bloody as hell and pretty damn satisfying in the heat of battle.\n\nAlso complementing general gameplay is your excellent companion, Elizabeth, who might even surpass the likes of Alyx Vance as the greatest companion/sidekick in gaming. Along with her Tear abilities, Elizabeth will frequently collect and toss health kits, salts for your Vigors and money at Booker, repeatedly saving your life, especially on higher difficulties. Furthermore, she'll often have contextual comments or interact with the environment which are always really interesting to hear and I often found myself turning round and walking back to see what she was up to. That is, of course, after Booker was finished stuffing his face with hot dogs and coffee.\n\nOver all, you will certainly develop a bond with Elizabeth as Booker begins to find his redemption in her. She is a fascinating and likeable yet tragic character that ultimately feels like a friend to both you and Booker, which makes the ending that much more painful and the plot twists all the more meaningful. Make no mistake, Infinite will pull you into one of the most immersive shooters and mindblowing experiences gaming has even seen and will stay with you long after you've finished playing.\n\nIn addition to the fairly long campaign, (which you'll undoubtedly go back to for multiple playthroughs even just to pick up on small hints that you missed), and collectibles galore, the DLC released features two sets of content. Clash in the Clouds is a rather enjoyable arcade-like challenge map mode in which you fight off various waves of enemies and complete challenges to progress. I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it is and the mode also includes behind-the-scenes content that you can spend your earnings on to unlock. Far from gimmicky, it is actually quite good.\n\nThe best addition, however, is the Burial at Sea episodic expansion which brings Booker and Elizabeth into Rapture and the events surrounding the fall of Ryan's underwater utopia in 1959.  The first episode is good, establishing the events of the DLC but it is the second episode where this truly shines, connecting both the original and Infinite in a remarkable and quite emotional experience, well worth the price of the Season Pass.\nAs someone who has followed this franchise since the early days, all the way back to my beloved PS3, words cannot truly express just how great it is to be back in Rapture, realised in all it's true glory in Unreal Engine 3. The respect that Irrational has shown throughout to both the community and the world it has created is remarkable and, though now disbanded, they set a standard for games that all other studios should aspire to.\n\nThat's not to say that Infinite and it's DLCs are not without flaws however. A divisive criticism since the first game is that the series is often too heavy with exposition and there are some notable plot points left unexplained. The checkpoint feature can be irritating at times, even with the well-executed respawn mechanic. The ability to only wield two weapons at a time can be a pain, especially in large battles and ammo is running low. Booker is no longer the silent, walking death machine that Jack was by the end of the first and 1999 Mode will be sure to remind you of that very quickly.\n\nBut all of these pale in comparison to the game as a whole. After playing it through again and again, you'll find yourself simply not caring about the few negatives that are noticed. You'll be too busy invested in the top-notch sound design and immensely satisfying gameplay. It is important to note that if you have not played this before then you must avoid all spoilers, even with the third anniversary since release approaching. If you haven't played the first BioShock then I also highly recommend that you check it out. A walkthrough or wiki page does little justice.\n\nBut I've been rambling on and off for the past few hours now so let's conclude.\n\nYou'll often hear the words 'essential' or 'masterpiece' be thrown around in the midst of hype and enthusiasm, but BioShock Infinite is one of those rare feats that lives up to itself and achieves what can only be described as true greatness. At the time of writing this review, the entire series is on sale for an absolute steal, but even now it would be worth full price.  It isn't perfect but, in all honesty, when was the last time you played anything that was this good?\nA work of art and a triumph of gaming as a medium, this is one for gamers and non-gamers alike. Pick it up with the Season Pass as soon as possible.","January 28","true","39.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EarthFox/recommended/8870/","EarthFox","Suicide King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EarthFox/","166 products in account","Bioshock Infinite is a game by Irrational Studios and 2K Games which plays as a First Person Shooter with intwined game mechanics. Bioshock Infinite is easily my second favorite game of all time. From the breath taking artwork to the tear-jerking storyline there are few games that can compare to the masterpiece known as Infinite. The game itself plays unlike it's predecessors Bioshock and Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams. Bioshock: Infinite takes place in an alternate dimension (as well as time) from the universe of Rapture, where the other two games were set. Infinite takes place in the city of Columbia primarily during the year 1912 (and other places/times as the story progresses). The game lasts 5-8 hours on average.\n\nMain Storyline:\nThe main story follows the point of view of Booker DeWitt as he searches for the elusive Elizabeth Comstock. His goal is to bring her back to New York in order to pay off a debt he owes, accumulated through excessive gambling, Booker is an ex-soldier of the military which was heavily involved with war crimes during both the Boxer Rebellion and the Battle of Wounded Knee, His actions led him to feel remorse and soul-crushing guilt for the rest of his life. His one joy, his daughter Anna DeWitt, was lost when he was forced to sell her to help repay his debts. In the game he meets Elizabeth and together they discover the secrets of Columbia and take on the prophet, Zachary Hale Comstock.\n\nThe game is told from Booker's POV. Most of the game he is accompanied by Elizabeth however it does not play like an escort mission. Elizabeth can fend for herself and supplies Booker with tears, ammo, money, salts and health. Booker can carry two weapons at a time (excluding the SkyHook he uses for melee) and is able to use all 8 vigors once they are found or purchased. Booker's shield is regenerated when not attacked for a set period of time however health can only be regenerated through items or vending machines. Salts fuel vigors as Eve fueled plasmids and salts can be found throughout the game.\n\nClash in the Clouds:\nClash in the Clouds is a wave by wave survival and elimination type of DLC that was added to the game. The DLC is non-canon to the main storyline however once one completes the Museum Curator achievement they will find an interesting reference to the Bioshock series. The Clash in the Clouds DLC contains four maps, each with 15 waves. The maps become increasingly difficult as the waves progress. The money system in Clash in the Clouds is untied to the main story and one may purchase museum items as well as upgrades for the DLC exclusively.\n\nBurial at Sea Ep. 1 (Spoilers):\nBurial at Sea Episode 1 is canon to the main storyline and yet at the same time is almost entirely detached. In Burial at Sea Episode 1 the player takes control of Booker once more however in this universe, the setting is in Pre-fall Rapture. Christmas Eve. The plot follows this version of Booker searching for a young girl named Sally who Booker seems to believe is like his daughter. An older and more mysterious Elizabeth (whom this Booker does not recognize) leads him out of Ryan's Rapture and into the ruins of Fontaine's Futuristics (hundreds of leagues below Rapture). In this ruin, Booker and Elizabeth search for Sally and eventually lure her out of the ducts she is hiding in. To this Booker's dismay, Sally is a little sister and she calls upon a Big Daddy to protect her. Booker defeats this Big Daddy but soon realizes that he is not who he believes. He witnesses a flashback to his past where he understands that he is in fact, Zachary Hale Comstock. This version of Comstock fled Columbia after cutting off Elizabeth's head in a struggle with the Booker he stole the baby Elizabeth from. The guilt drives him to Rapture where he restarts his life and forgets his past as Comstock. Once the older Elizabeth learns the truth she allows a second Big Daddy to murder him from behind.\n\nThe game plays very similarily to the Bioshock Infinite main storyline and the player is introduced to two new vigors/plasmids (Old Man Winter which is similar to Winter Blast and Radar Range which microwaves enemies). The DLC itself is fairly short however it is more eerie and closer to the first Bioshock game in terms of atmosphere. Ambient noise and splicers make the game reminiscent of it's first predecessor. While short, the DLC is highly recommended and provides a rough 2-3 hours of enjoyable gameplay.\n\nBurial at Sea Ep. 2 (Spoilers):\nThe second installment of the Burial at Sea DLC is far more storyline intensive and plays almost entirely differently from all the Bioshock games. Burial at Sea Ep. 2 differs in the fact that the player assumes control of Elizabeth (the one that enteres Rapture after the Elizabeth whom accompanies Comstock in the first part of the DLC). This Elizabeth is originally care free in France and is able to fully control her abilities. However, the guilt of allowing Sally to be taken to Rapture and turned into a little sister is enough to convince Elizabeth to find Sally in rapture. This Elizabeth arrives to find that the journey into a universe where one of her alternate selves is dead collapses her ability to create tears. Now entirely succeptible to the dangers of the world and unable to use tears to see the future, Elizabeth must rely on flashbacks and an imaginary Booker to save Sally.\n\nElizabeth first discovers her alternate self, murdered by the second Big Daddy who arrived to finish off Comstock (see Burial at Sea Ep. 1 Notes). She then moves to strike a deal with Atlas (or Frank Fontaine) in exchange for Sally. Fontaine noting the worth of Little Sisters in Rapture, agrees to release Sally if Elizabeth can bring Fontaine Futuristics back up to Rapture. Elizabeth agrees and journeys alone (with the exception of her imaginary Booker) throughout Rapture to find a way to move Fontaine Futuristics. She winds up in Suchong's lab and strikes a deal with the scientist. She promises Suchong a hair strand (not knowing it is her alternate self's hair) that he desires in exchange for use of his machine which fabricates tears. Elizabeth travels to Columbia during the Vox rebellion where she realizes that the Luteces coerced Daisy Fitzroy into playing her role as the evil leader whom Elizabeth must murder to mature into a woman. She also learns of Songbird's imprinting process as she searches for the hair (after retrieving the Lutece particle which would rise Fontaine Futuristics to Rapture's level). She describes the process as "The Lion with a thorn in it's paw". Jeremiah Fink leaves Songbird in a near-death state with only Elizabeth around. After a young Elizabeth saves Songbird's life, it imprints on her thus beginning Elizabeth's estranged relationship with the creature. Suchong wishes to use Fink's plan in order to get the Big Daddy's to imprint on the Little Sisters whom they are designated to protect. When Elizabeth returns to Rapture she is confronted by Ryan whose forces she defeats. Elizabeth raises Fontaine's building to Rapture's level where he betrays her and begins his assault on Ryan after he knocks Elizabeth out. Two weeks later, Elizabeth comes to and sees Frank Fontaine on the losing end of the war. Desperate for a victory, he interrogates Elizabeth about the "Ace in the Hole". Eventually saved by a past memory, she barters for Sally and her own life once more and finds the "Ace in the Hole" in Suchongs lab. Expecting the betrayal, Fontaine kills Elizabeth with a wrench and as Elizabeth lays dying, she witnesses a future where Sally is saved by Jack. Elizabeth dies smiling with Sally by her side.\n\nThe game is heavily stealth-based and provides 3-4 hours of gameplay. This DLC is HIGHLY recommended for all players. This DLC is more difficult than any other Bioshock game or DLC and the 1998 mode is more than a light challenge. Take the DLC slow and pay attention to various Easter Eggs related to the series's storyline.","March 27, 2014","true","55.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

Not only is it an evolving story that sees protagonist Booker DeWitt and the mysterious Elizabeth grow closer, but Irrational's latest deals with the hubris of a society built above the clouds, its ideals inflated with so much of the same hot air that propels it above the world below.\n\nThough it touches on topics revolving around racism, religion, rebellion and revenge, these themes take a backseat to BioShock Infinite's primary topic: Love. Whether it be a society in love with its own patented brand of American Exceptionalism, a leader in love with his own self-appointed immortal image, or a pair of people that come together to care for one another, BioShock Infinite is a love story.\n\nAnd it's an easy story to fall in love with. Taking place in 1912, BioShock Infinite follows Booker DeWitt, a man with a mysterious past charged with ascending to the once-iconic but now forgotten city of Columbia, a floating city in the sky. Once there, DeWitt must find a woman named Elizabeth and bring her to New York to wipe away his debt. DeWitt, who first appears to be without a vestige of sympathy for the plight of the woman, complies. To describe details any further would only serve to eradicate BioShock Infinite's exceptional ability to surprise.\n\nUnlike the undersea city of Rapture – the setting of Irrational's critical and commercial smash BioShock – Columbia is a living world. Players won't draw blood from enemies for quite some time when they arrive in Columbia, a world established and ruled by a figure known as Father Zachary Comstock. Rather, DeWitt and the player are introduced to the technology and ideals that power the city as they move across its interlocking sections; and as gorgeous as the world of Columbia is, it's a horribly grotesque place. DeWitt learns that the city is fueled by racism, misplaced loyalty and morbid patriotism, and it quickly becomes a joy to know the game will eventually allow him to pull it down from the sky, arrogant brick by brick.\n\nWhen players first arrive on Columbia by way of being rocketed into the sky, the focus is a civil war between the "White Power" fanatics led by Comstock and a rebellious group dubbed the Vox Populi led by a strong black woman named Daisy Fitzroy. While this story weaves in and out of the overarching narrative, it eventually takes a backseat to more pressing matters: Elizabeth and DeWitt's search for the truth about their existence on Columbia.\n\nBioShock Infinite's core gameplay mimics that of Irrational's previous effort: a first-person shooter with a magical component. The "magic" in Infinite is composed of collectible vigors, potent elixirs that grant DeWitt special powers, like the ability to electrocute enemies or lob fireballs. Each of the vigors, and all weapons, can be upgraded to increase their power and properties – longer ability duration, extra ammunition, etc. Where things begin to diverge for Infinite versus the original BioShock is in collectible gear, which can be mixed and matched to grant special buffs, like headgear that allows DeWitt to leach health for successfully performing brutal melee execution kills with his skyline hook.\n\nThe hook is used to traverse Columbia's skylines, a network of massive, suspended mechanical rails that connect different parts of the city. While both DeWitt and Elizabeth can use them to travel the city, they serve as more than just a simple means of transportation. As the game progresses, the pair will encounter arenas with varying levels of terrain with enemies attacking on all sides. Though you can pick each aggressor off from a static cover point, it's far more fulfilling to zip around on skylines and fight from multiple angles.\n\nElizabeth provides DeWitt with valuable resources like ammunition, health packs and salts during battle. Beyond scavenging, Elizabeth can also modify the properties of the battlefield by playing with pre-determined "tears" – splits in the fabric of time she has the ability to open. These can introduce things like cover, turrets, and even motorized allies to help DeWitt come out on top.\n\nTears also play a crucial role in the narrative. Elizabeth has been able to open them since early childhood, though as a young adult she's lost some of her grip on her ability. DeWitt, understandably, is terrified of Elizabeth's power, unclear of the true intentions of everyone involved in her life, including Comstock and his own employers. The tears add to the mystery, sometimes appearing with music from the wrong decade spilling out of them, raising immediate questions as to the true nature of the phenomenon, Columbia's place in history and even Elizabeth herself. Though their relationship is quickly strained upon first meeting, with neither truly trusting the actions of the other, Elizabeth and DeWitt become allies and even friends, a relationship made possible by BioShock Infinite's superb voice cast.\n\nEngagements are typically a fun dance between mixing weapons and abilities while utilizing the environmental possibilities to cut down Infinite's assortment of enemies – snatching powerful weapons from tears, leaping onto skylines and fighting as you glide across the sky. Some of the battles, however, drag on too long and interrupt the flow of story-telling, especially toward the end of the game.\n\nIn terms of its immediate adversaries, Infinite lacks any foe as terrifying as BioShock's Big Daddy; though the aggressiveness of the Handyman – a robotic behemoth with a human head that literally begs for death – can be a daunting challenge to manage. Both standard and special enemies, even the mini-gun toting Motorized Patriot, eventually become just another thing to shoot at, never reaching the same dangerous heights as BioShock's giant, iconic protector.\n\nThe ending of the game is marvelous, and you'll have to trust me when I say that BioShock Infinite's final section – dedicated entirely to its narrative – handily disposes of any minor gripes. There is not only one twist to the tale, but many entrances and exits to a wide array of secrets, diving deeper into the past of the primary cast of characters and the world of Columbia itself. The greatest discovery, however, is the love that blossoms between Elizabeth and DeWitt, and how far the pair are willing to go to protect each other.\n\nAs a game, BioShock Infinite has its successes and its falterings consistent with any suitably complex piece of interactive entertainment. As a story, as an exercise in drawing the player into a believable and relevant world, as proof of exactly what a videogame can mean to a person... BioShock Infinite is damn near perfect.","March 14, 2014","true","120.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I mean its another FPS game. I was wrong.\nThis game is worth playing but even more so when you get all the content (DLC packs)\n\nAt first i was disappointed that the main story campaign only takes an average of 9 Hours to finish even with exploration and a bit of backtracking, the atmosphere was superb, the graphics were phenomenal, the voice acting was superb, and i really fell for the overall feel of Columbia. Then when i finished the campaign, i just kinda let it sit in my library.\nBut then as soon as the Burial at sea Episodes unlocked, i got sucked back into the world of Bioshock. I tell you, they really did a great job on the damn story on this one.\n\nThe story is superbly thought out and was simply a pleasure to experience.\nI really felt for Booker, i empathized with him and at one point i felt like i was him. Clinging to this tiny shred of hope that maybe, just maybe i can redeem myself and save this girl for i have already doomed her in another reality.\nAnd i really sympathized with Elizabeth. The loneliness and the feeling of being caged off from the world outside the walls she knows so very very well.\n\nThe game made me question choices and the illusion of free will for you are given a few choices but with pre-determined outcomes. Despite all the good that it has, it has flaws as well.\nThe atmosphere is great but i wish that i could interact with more of the environment aside from the vendors, the trash cans and etc. I'd like to have a conversation with a random civilian and have that person acknowledge me (me as booker at least) and not feign back to the scripted, backgroundish routine that it follows. The plasmids kinda just help you shoot people better, they are useful for stopping your enemies or holding them in place or disabling them so you can deliver some lead to their systems. After a while, i get tired of the phrase "BOOKER, CATCH!"\nI particularly like the SkyHook feature as it allows me to sucker punch an unsuspecting enemy into oblivion (if he were standing on a floating piece of real estate in Columbia)\n\nI believe that despite the feeling of it being over-hyped, its a great game.\nIt is a masterpiece that can only be done through the gaming medium. Movies, books and music can only hope to scratch the surface of what Bioshock Infinite's story has done. I doubt that any other medium could deliver this story quite as well as the game has already done. But i wouldn't mind seeing some books, graphic novels and other things about BioShock.\nThis sets the bar for storytelling in games that are centered around a full bodied plot.\nThe DLC's story was a perfect example of content that gives you the kind of clarity that you get when you get to the conclusion of a long fairy tale.\nThe final DLC hits the nail on the head, and is a fitting final goodbye from Irrational Games.\n\nGet it on sale and get the season pass.\nIts a hefty Download but damn its worth it.\n\nWould you kindly play the game?","March 26, 2014","true","26.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The graphics are excellent, the city, story, and enemies are creative, and Elizabeth is a great female character. It is incredibly fun to zip around on the cargo rails, watch different factions attack each other, fight off enemy airships, and just explore the city Irrational Games has created.\n\nUnfortunately, Infinite is plagued with repetition. For the majority of the game, you must basically kill everything that moves, loot, get ambushed or creep up to a new area of enemies, and repeat. In addition, the gameplay itself is repetitive; while the gunplay is great, there is a seriously limited selection of guns, and while some of the magic abilities are useful, most are virtually useless. The game will also make you fight the same bosses over and over, and you will find yourself saying "Again?" throughout. You may also find yourself becoming frustrated like I did during the graveyard scene (or other scenes), but I just turned the difficulty down to Easy and it was manageable.\n\nThankfully, Elizabeth proves to be an awesome companion and really changes up what would otherwise be an average game. You can tell her to create a first-aid supply station during battle, direct her to spawn a aircraft to shoot missles at enemies, and even change the world completely. If it were not for her, it would be easy to lose interest in the game, but Elizabeth and her story were what motivated me to play to the end. Although it has some flaws, exploring the city with Elizabeth is an amazing experience, and so I think Infinite is above average and is worthy of your time.\n","December 30, 2015","true","8.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

Mistake.\n\nThis game is NOT bad, it is a downright overhyped dissapointment. It looks great and works generally fine, there is no amazing soundtrack (not that big a deal), but where it falls short is the content.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Gameplay is horribly repetitive. The false sense of open space is actually more confining than the actual confined space found in the first two games. Gameplay consists of pathetic "vigors" that have no taste and all have trap versions. The guns are underpowered generally, don't seem cool, and the removal of the weapon wheel is a bust as ammo is no longer conserved. The sky-hook is insanely broken. What could have been the selling point of the game (and kinda was) was boring, repetitive, and screwed up your objective beacon. The Elizabeth tears were alright but anoyying and the constant backtracking was a strain.\n\nENVIRONMENT: The environment is dirt. At first, the environment is cool; walking around a steampunk 1900s racist city and all, seeing the magical tech at work. As soon as the tears start happening and you start running around, you realize how boring it all is. The game doesn't feel like a fight for survival and freedom on a floating city - it feels like MMO quests in first-person on a bunch of blimps. The best level when a "scare"-factor is actually involved comes too few and too late.\n\nSTORY: The story is linear and bland. The main story is fairly guessable and not fleshed out. Voxophones, which are like the audiorecorders of old Bioshock, offer little and are too hard to get too. The DLC storylines are too blatant in their fit to the paradoxy of Infinite, getting those weak fools who enjoy this game to drool over the worst dialogue ever.\n\nCONCLUSION: A total buchery of one of the best games I've ever played. Removes all the good elements of bioshock 1 & 2, has a ridiculous story, awful environment, and the vigors (the point of bioshock) are extremely underplayed and have no story implementation. What was once a survival horror game is now the posterchild of absurd MetaCritic scores.\n\nA good game, not what it should have been. Kind of like a Halo 4 but even more dissapointing. 75/100","December 8, 2013","false","0.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Comstock, Infinite's equivalent to Andrew Ryan, is a religious zealot and Nationalist whose vision of an jingoistic, WASPy industrialized society suspended in the clouds away from the impurities of those treading upon soil is realized when a couple of brilliant physicsts deliver a technology that allows him to construct his city among the heavens dubbed Columbia. Comstock has his daughter, Elizabeth, held captive in a tower in Columbia, guarded by a large mechanical flying creature known as The Songbird. Elizabeth is no ordinary girl, she is giften with the ability to open tears in space time. Enter your character Booker DeWitt, a Private Eye who has fallen on hard times due to his alcohol and gambling problems. He is offered the chance to wipe away his debts and start fresh if he can rescue Elizabeth. Little does he know, his journey to rescue the girl and wipe away his debt will be one of self discovery as he confronts his past.\n\nInfinite, grafts the gameplay of the previous entries onto it's turn of the century setting, mixing gunplay with vigors (the same thing as plasmids) with various enemy types. While the game offers much in the way of variety with a dozen weapons and a handful of diverse vigors, it never forces players to use one over the other. It's a missed opportunity to introduce some much needed challenge to the gameplay as it's just as easy to blow gaping holes in emeies with the formidable firearms that make up the game's arsenal as it is to deplete your salts (the game's magic power) in order to execute your foes in a flashy manner. New to Columbia are sky rails that allow Booker to travel through the air, adding some verticality to the proceedings. high flying aerial duels can be thrilling at first but often you will fail to notice the rails overhead until after your foes have been slain. Combat is certainly not Infinite's strong suit despite the numerous options it provides.\n\nWhere Infinite is nigh peerless is it's art direction and the way in which is delivers it's narrative. The world of Columbia looks as if colonial Annapolis or Philadelphia as been hoised into the air. The brick buildings and cobblestone streets create and idealic atmosphere that masks the darkness of racism and industrial exploitation that loom out of sight and out of mind of the bourgeoisie of Columbia. The city is bathed in the warmest orange glow and decorated in vibrant colors that make the game stand in start contrast to anything else on the market. Infinite is also littered with propaganda posters and almost every district and area has a story of it's own to tell--reflecting the lives and mindset of the denizens of Columbia. Stong visual motifs are also employed creating several powerful moments even when the game's narrative suffers from errors in logic. Bioshock Infinite offers one of the most beautiful and memorible worlds in gaming.\n\nThe Burial at Sea DLC expands upon the links between Rapture and Columbia, offering a touch of fan service with a seriously fulfilling narrative. The first episode excels by retooling the combat a bit by limiting ammo supplies. It also delivers an incredible opening sequence that allows players to explore Rapture as never seen before. The second episode faulters a bit with an emphasis on stealth but both episodes offer the same stunning art direction and voice work from the core game. No expense was spare in bringing this DLC to life making it worthwhile and memorable.","April 2, 2014","true","33.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I can't stop thinking about it. Somebody might say that an average man thinks about sex every 7 second. Well I think about this game every damn seven seconds! It's just that GOOD! Only if I could remove my memory to experience it all over again... I've been seriously depressed lately because of this.\nI think I made it very clear that this game is worth playing. I loved every second of it and it did make me very confused sometimes, but I did figure it all out eventually. This game has the best story in a videogame I have ever seen, and the athmosphere of Columbia is just perfect. Characters are near perfection, especially Elizabeth. The gameplay is... good. It's not bad, not at all, but usually I just want to quickly shoot my way trough enemies just to start scavenging around and progressing into the story. Just as I said, the story is somewhat confusing to wrap around your head, but you'll figure it out. The dlc:s are also worth playing. I could almost say that I enjoyed burial at sea even more than the main game. I won't spoil anything, but the ending made me cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feederguy/recommended/8870/","feederguy","it's high noon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feederguy/","1128 products in account","Bioshock Infinite is easily one of the greatest games I've had the pleasure of playing.\n\nGraphically, it ushers in a new standard for the PC. Set in a backdrop of a 1930s city, the environment is vibrant and colorful, but not distracting towards gameplay, although the same cannot be said for the heroine Elizabeth ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). The textures and intricate details put into the surroundings and characters allow for a spectacularly immersive experience, all the while being well optimised and running smoothly for most mid to high end computers.\n\nJust like its predecessors, the storyline for Bioshock Infinite is fairly dark. This certainly does not seem to be the case at first when you enter the idyllic, utopian city in the sky that is Coloumbia–it appears nothing like the dingy underwater city of Rapture in the past two games. However it soon becomes evident that there is much more than meets the eye.\n\nInstead of the generic, faceless protagonist in many FPS games, you play as Booker Dewitt, a man with his own agenda, motivations...and regrets. Tasked with retrieving a girl named Elizabeth from the city of Coloumbia, the two develop a complicated bond as they rely upon and learn about each other in their bid to escape from Coloumbia. There is very strong character development in both Booker and Elizabeth as the story progresses, on par with a well-written novel. The plot also progresses at a enjoyable pace with many twists along the way. Although the story is linear, there are moral choices that the player has to make along the way, and you are constantly reminded of that choice for the rest of the game. Despite several plot holes, the story was one of the best I have experienced for a video game, to the extent that I feel that the game would have remained a masterpiece even if combat gameplay was removed and it was made into a visual novel with the same cutscenes.\n\nTherein lies the only mediocre aspect of Bioshock Infinite: the actual combat. Although there are some fairly innovative features, such as shooting while moving along aerial rails at high speed, much of the FPS elements fail to leave a big impression. The weapons and abilities that you can use feel largely similar, just as most of the enemies that you fight. There seems to be little variation in tactics involved, the player simply guns baddies down from one area to the next. This is further limited by the fact that you can only have 2 weapons and 2 active abilities at a time.\n\nCombat is also hardly challenging with little disincentive to dying. On death the player respawns at the location, with only the surviving enemies from the past engagement healed–already killed enemies do not respawn. This means that you could just slowly try to kill an enemy one at a time before dying if you are having difficulty in a fight, rinse and repeat until you manage to clear it.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, I feel that Bioshock Infinite has redefined videogames and the FPS genre as a storytelling medium, and I certainly look forward to replaying it again. (In fact, this lengthy review was written in a bid to stave off that feeling of dejection that one gets after clearing a really good game/book. I hope that stands as a testament to how brilliant this game is.)\n\n10/10","September 8, 2014","true","32.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasedAvellone/recommended/8870/","BasedAvellone","The American Tolkien","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasedAvellone/","260 products in account","Bioshock Infinite is an OK game. Let’s just put that on the table. This is pretty good. But that whole “the defining game of our generation” crap swirled around in the media by “reviewing” sites such as IGN are wrong. This game is not revolutionary.\n\nFirst off, the game-play. Bioshock Infinites game-play plays disappointingly similar to the original Bioshock, that’s not to say it’s bad, just not very different. Plasmids from Bioshock 1 have been replaced by Vigors which carry slightly different abilities and are taken orally instead of through injection. Some abilities are really fun to play around with, such as Possession, allowing you to take control of nearby enemies and make them fight for you for a brief period. Another good one is Return to Sender, allowing you to blast back damage taken from enemies and absorb attacks. It seems however, all other 6 Vigors are just means to either straight up damage your enemies, or disable them for a short time to allow you to shoot them. You tend to pick two or three Vigors you like using (for me it was Shock Jocky, Possesion and Bucking Bronco) while all the others are sort of just forgotten about. However, playing on harder difficulty mode does sort of force you to use other Vigors to get little creative. Another thing I found strange was that some of the Vigors, namely Undertow and Return to Sender are only entered into the game in the last few hours, leaving no really chance to get a feel for them.\n\nGun-play is solid; each gun feeling like it has strong differences to the others the others, allowing you to choose which is best for you. However, the upgrade system for the guns is really poor. They basically give damage bonuses, recoil reduction and increased clip size in exchange for in-game currency. No form of attachments or customizations on the guns at all, which while not really necessary, would have been nice.\n\nThe soundtrack, visuals and voice acting are all exquisite, couldn’t really fault them if I tried. I played this back on my old PC at low Graphics and game still looks amazing.\n\nNow, the story. If you're interested enough to play the game, stop reading here, just to avoid any minor spoilers.\n\nIt is to me at least, decently executed and fits into the feel of the game. All the characters are well-written, especially Elizabeth, whose backstory and mysterious powers is the most interesting aspect of the story. The point when the plot becomes controversial however is the end. There is a huge plot twist that is hinted slightly throughout the game but never really realised until the end that will leave many people a little dumb-founded. Some people love this shock factor in media. That said, while being starling, it is by no means original, it’s be done before and been done better. Regardless, the game is still executed well and the story is of enough credit enough to warrant a play-through.\n\nDon’t believe the hype of this game, it is, like all other hyped games, nowhere near as good as people say it is. But don’t let stop you from playing.","April 28, 2014","true","10.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/8870/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Bioshock Infinite is quite different than the other Bioshock games because of what’s excluded. Gone is the city of Rapture. Gone is Jack, the protagonist. Gone is Andrew Ryan, the main villain in Rapture. Gone are Big Daddies and the Little Sisters. What’s new is the city of Columbia in the year 1912, a city that seceded from the United States because of its ideals and feelings of superiority.\n\nWhile Rapture was a city underwater, Columbia is a city floating on top of the clouds and is beautiful on the outside, ugly on the inside. It is a gorgeously rendered, lively city with townsfolk realistically having fun at a local fair, children playing with each other, birds chirping, and lots of propaganda. The propaganda is what shows the ugly side of Columbia: racism, extreme views based on religion, and very nationalistic beliefs. It promotes white supremacy in ways that would remind people of America’s ugly past and degrades working class people. Most shooters do not do such a great job in rendering a city so well with great art direction. It feels so brilliantly directed that it feels like it was directed by an experienced movie director.\n\nThe protagonist is Booker DeWitt, a private eye who has a shady and a mysterious past. His job is to find a girl named Elizabeth, who is in the possession of a gigantic bird known as Songbird. Throughout the story, you will frequently hear the quote “wipe away the debt.” This seems to relate to DeWitt’s purpose of finding Elizabeth. The game gets better after finding Elizabeth, as she is free from the Songbird and tries to help DeWitt in more ways than one. He is up against Zachary Comstock, who is known as the prophet of Columbia. He is the Andrew Ryan of Columbia and frequently calls DeWitt a “false shepherd.” He influences the citizens to hate and stop DeWitt in any way possible.\n\nColumbia is a more open setting than Rapture, so it’s not as linear as the first two Bioshock games. The weapons, vigors, and related upgrades largely work the same as the weapons, plasmids and related upgrades in Rapture, but with different names. Vigors work like plasmids, but they require you to drink from well-designed bottles to obtain those powers. You will have to learn how to use vigors strategically during battles with the local police, the rebellious people of Columbia, and Comstock’s large, magical enemies. The wide open districts in Columbia mean that combat feels like it is in wide open arenas. What is part of some of these districts is the skylines, tracks that look like roller coasters allowing you to use your Skyhook, a mechanical gauntlet that can be used to melee some enemies, but is not useful against the more powerful enemies. The Skyhook is also good for navigating to rooftops and other hard to reach areas. You can also use the skylines to drop down and knock out enemies instantly.\n\nThe larger enemies in the game are quite interesting, including a motorized patriot. The motorized patriot is an imitation of former U.S. president George Washington. The patriot carries a crank gun, a Gatling gun that can tear you to shreds in seconds. Another large enemy is the Handyman, a pumped up version of the Big Daddy with a lot of height. Some vigors work well against some enemies, but other enemies are immune to them. One vigor, the murder of crows, throws a group of crows at an enemy in its radius, causing lots of distractions and allows you to fire at them with conventional firearms without retaliation for several seconds. However, there are some enemies that are immune to the murder of crows. I remember fighting a Zealot, a Comstock supporter who carries a coffin on his back and can turn into crows to defend himself. I realized that he was immune to the murder of crows, so I had to turn to other vigors such as shock jockey or the devil’s kiss while being careful with my salt level. Salt works like eve did in the previous Bioshock games. In essence, you have to know each enemy’s strengths and weaknesses against vigors.\n\nElizabeth is a blessing during combat. She doesn’t get in your way and can help replenish ammo, health, and salts in the heat of battle. Her AI is surprisingly superb, as she knows exactly when to stay away from you. She may get in your way when you are trying to walk through a doorway, but that is nothing more than an annoyance. She can help open tears so that you can access weapons, ammo, turrets, and a motorized patriot. You can open a tear of a motorized patriot to shoot it out with a motorized patriot who is trying to bring you down. Tears appear to be alternate grey looking worlds that can be only opened by her. The tears are crucial to survival and sometimes lead to alternate worlds. It looks to me like tears make the story contrived since they seem to always favor you when you are in a desperate combat situation. Therefore, the combats with the tears seem staged, but that’s only a minor complaint.\n\nThe ending of the story seems to include a lot of emotion and drama that some people may not even understand it fully. However, the graphics are rendered beautifully. The DLCs are a continuation of Bioshock Infinite and include Burial at Sea: Episode 1 and Episode 2. They bring you back to the city of Rapture and get into the connection between the city of Rapture and the city of Columbia. It also touches upon the connection between Comstock and Ryan. I recommend playing Episode 1 before playing Episode 2. I think Episode 2 has a better plot than Episode 1 and tells a better story about Rapture and its connections to Columbia. Interestingly, you will play Elizabeth in Episode 2, as it explains Elizabeth’s complex life in both Rapture and Columbia. It also emphasizes stealth for Elizabeth, who seems to be too weak for combat against Rapture’s splicers and Columbia’s Vox Populi.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a fabulous game in terms of gameplay and art direction. The combat is definitely worth your participation as it requires lots of strategy with conventional firearms and various vigors against Comstock’s diverse citizenry. I highly recommend this superb game to any gamer.\n\nMy Score: 9.5/10\n","June 25, 2015","true","45.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

I will leave it in the good pile though.\n\nQuestionable\n\n- It handles its grand themes clumsily and with a heavy hand. They decide to deal with racism by using the shock value of the public pelting (which then concludes with some gruesomely brutal killing, because that means great narrative) and the statement over blind zeal is handled by a cartoon villain.\n\n- I think it tried a bit too hard to ride on the original Bioshock's coattails. Vigors are shoehorned in, sound bites are recycled, and Gears are watered down tonics.\n\n- The tears and infinite universes kind of seem like a wasted opportunity. Gameplay wise opening up tears is the same thing as picking up ammo, health, weapons etc. Yeah she can pull out a samurai or neat looking turret, but it only looks cool there is no added or changed value by it coming from a tear. It's not a bad mechanic but it is a very cliche one with a new coat of paint, and I feel like Infinite really could have broken new ground with it.\n\n- So I know at some point they stated they wanted the many worlds thing to rival interpretation in film and bring it to video games as something unique. However the thing is, interpretation has already been in video games for a long time. Depending on how deeply you want to look into games, anything can be interpreted. Some games would be more abstract or cryptic about it (Another World, or even the Super Mario series), but interpretation and analysis is there.\n\n-Overall gameplay. Very cliche and weak. You don't actually have to think about much, just splash around some vigors and shoot. Some enemies can really soak up damage, but they are all pretty lazy and just charge at you. The guns are all very basic with some stats differing between pairs. The shield mechanic is also another crutch that feels like they were really trying to appeal to a wider audience...\n\nOh wait. I get it now.\n\nBioshock Infinite is probably one of the best shooters out there if you only compare it to modern shooters. It is meant to be the prize horse of shooters like Call of Duty rather than System Shock or Deus Ex. I was expecting more in terms RPG elements or narrative, but that was not Infinite's goal.\n\nAs a sequel? I am not sure if it will measure to what you are wanting: some of the mechanics are polished while others were watered down.\n\nOn its own? Bioshock Infinite is a great action game that offers polished and accessible combat in a vivid and interesting setting . On top of that it gives a nice little overview of some heavy themes and tries to focus a bit on narrative. It is closer to Call of Duty than Fallout 3 compared to its predecessors.\n\nSo, if you don't really like to play video games or tend to play games that aren't known for their story, then think of this as Ringo introducing you to the Beatles. From here you can try your hand at games that offer different experiences like: more complicated/challenging shooting, different activities besides shooting (like hacking, stealing, exploring), more focus on strictly storytelling (like point and clicks), and maybe games that are a bit more abstract or pretentious.\n\nIf you are pretty used to video games, especially mondern shooters, this game will cover familiar ground and might not wow you. If you are a snob? this might be a lukewarm experience for you.","July 19, 2014","true","31.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Wipe away the debt.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a fantastic First-Person shooter in the sense that it has fun gameplay with a strong narrative behind it,driving the game forward. You take the role as Booker Dewitt, a man we know nothing about, and you are asked to find the girl and if done so, you will wipe away the debt. The story seems to be simple but as the game goes along, it gets more intricate and by the end it had me in awe. Even the second time around. The dialogue and voice acting is some of the best I have ever heard (Troy Baker is God) and it really helps immerse the player into the world of Columbia. I found myself finding and playing every single voxophone, small voice recordings of characters, because I loved the side/back stories behind all the characters introduced.\n\nElizabeth, the girl, is a strong female lead for the game because she is very likable. She has some great AI mechanics which do not hinder the fastpaced gameplay but instead make it more interesting and fun as Elizabeth throws whatever she can at your aid to benefit you. The gun mechanics feel very smooth and the added Vigors allow more variety to be in play from "shock powers" to "calling in a swarm of crows" powers and it really helps make the game so much more fun. Another aspect which makes the game so much fun is introduced a little into the game and it is the skylines. The skylines allow the player to ride above the ground and land off and attack or flank enemies from all over the area.\n\nThe main story clocked in for me at about nine hours which I think was the perfect length for a game like this. I played the game originally when it released on the Playstation 3 and I enjoyed the feel of the game a whole lot more on PC. It runs better, it looks better, it plays better, it feels better, and it is better on the PC than the consoles.\n\nWith some great dialogue, an intriguing story that keeps unraveling until the very end, and some very fun first person shooter combat, Bioshock Infinite is just one fantastic game.\n\n9/10","July 17, 2014","true","18.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I was starting to get sick of Rapture and am glad this game has a different setting.\n\nThe game gives the illusion of a vast expansive sky city, it does not have the stuffy claustrophobic feel of the underwater city Rapture. In Columbia you just want to soar and swoop at every chance you can. Though it does make my stomach churn at times using a sky rail is almost like riding a roller coaster.\n\nElizabeth is an interesting character though at first she reminded me a lot of a Disney princess, the way she moves, expressions in an over exagerated disney princess way, she's almost a rip off of Belle from Beauty and the Beast in how she looks, she has same hairstyle, big over large eyes.\n\nYou have a variety of ways to kill enemies you can ask elizabeth to open a tear so you can have more cover, a hook for swinging off, medical kits, guns, turrets, though that is limited as you can only have 1 tear open and active at a time.\n\nBut the game is not without frustration.\n\nYou can only carry 2 guns at a time which is very limiting, though you can swap 1 gun you are carrying for a gun that's on the ground, you can never carry more than 2 at a time.\n\nVigors are often the most fun and versatile ways to kill which are the replacement for plasmids but are much more limited in their use as you can't carry salts on you, you seem to run out of salts way too quickly though  (salts are the blue energy metre simular to eve) to replenish salts you have to find some sort of drink or a bottle of salts. Usually there are salts nearby or Elizabeth will find and toss you some.\n\nYou can't carry first aid kits either but you have a energy shield which is better, you don't lose health unless your shield is fully depleted and if that happens you can just hide till it replenishes.\n\nBut even so I found the battles more fast paced and enjoyable than the previous Bioshocks.\n\nI dislike most  that there is only auto save and you can't save your game when you want. I wanted to stop playing but it said my last auto save was 10 minutes ago, so had to keep playing for 10 more minutes to get the next checkpoint. It makes it so I have to replay again if I just want to quit playing. The most annoying thing about the game. I had to leave the game running when I wanted a break as my last checkpoint save was half an hour ago, auto saves should be at least every 10 minutes.\n\nThere is no hacking, I miss that.\nThe only thing that is a tiny bit like it is that Elizabeth can pick locks for you, but there is no mini game associated with it.\n\nTo sumarise it overall the game is better in some ways than the other Bioshocks but also worse in other aspects.\n\nThe story overall is rather freaky, tragic and messes with your head, I did a lot of reading about it to understand the story fully. But I better not say anything else as I don't want to spoil it for those who have not played and completed the game.\n\nMostly though it feels enjoyable, fun, scary in some ways and exciting. Though unlike others I would not got so far as to say it's one of the best games I've played. Almost would rate it an 8, but there is too many negatives that the game should not have, it does not deserve more than 7/10.","September 15, 2015","true","47.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/8870/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The scope and ambition of Bioshock: Infinite is in itself difficult to fully take in, but it’s in seeing this ambition conceptualized in such astounding fashion that causes it to become almost exhausting to try and appreciate the vast amount of layers laid in such an intricate pattern required to make it what it is.\n\nIt’s the rarest of occasions where the incalculable expectations heaped upon it are not only met, but exceeded, in ways I wouldn’t have anticipated despite my own rabid hopes for what the game might be. It’s an experience that’s both familiar yet defiantly willing to take risks in its attempts to outdo its predecessors, firmly steeped in its own heritage but only so much as it can be used to further itself into something even more remarkable, constantly pushing itself to new heights despite the possible catastrophe that could result. And it pays off. What Irrational Games has achieved is unprecedented, deserving of commendation and once again resetting the bar that the original Bioshock did so many years ago. It’s truly something to behold.\n\nThe setup to Infinite’s plot is likely the sole moment that can be easily explained, materializing with the words that have become so familiar by now but adopt a larger meaning in their greater narrative context: “bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt”. You are Booker Dewitt, a man on his last line of hope in removing himself out from under the hand of some very dangerous people.\n\nAnd this is where Infinite forgoes any semblance of simplicity or predictability, literally ascending into the floating city of Columbia and a far more complex, complicated narrative that all but demands repeated playthroughs to truly understand. Columbia is itself a fascinating world to explore, for reasons Rapture never was or could be. It’s a living, breathing city that unravels at a deliberately slow pace, dropping breadcrumbs for you every step of the way but never exposing itself enough to have you see the full picture and become disinterested.\n\nThe city feels real, for as fantastical and impossible the existence of a floating city seems; a gorgeous, fully realized environment dripping in early American history and architecture that comes to life in an artistically arresting display of color and visual fidelity. The constant dissimilarity between the beautiful areas you explore and the horrifically grotesque violence that takes place within them creates a sort of twisted beauty that never wavers or deteriorates into mindless gore.\n\nIn many ways Columbia exists almost to entirely contradict rapture. It's a city floating in the sky, brought up by a fiercely communal, religious figure head that seeks not to eradicate law and God but embrace the ideals of a warped version of Christianity created in his own image. You arrive here not after the dust has settled and the city has fallen, but at the cusp of a viscous civil war that is nearing its boiler point, waiting for you to drop the match and light the flames.\n\nIn the wake of the many firefights and incredible scenes of destruction that litter the path to Infinite’s shocking finish, it was often the quiet moments that made me appreciate Columbia the most for giving me something Rapture never did. Without the constant fear of being attacked or an oppressive atmosphere weighing you down, Infinite is allowed to show its humanity. Seeing the city the full of life gives a sense of place on a level I've rarely witnessed. Kids running in the streets, venders attempting to sell you their wares; it all serves to establish this robust society before its descent into madness, something often lost in a medium seemingly obsessed with sterile, dystopian wastelands.\n\nAt the center of this is Elizabeth, the girl previously referred to who immediately upon her introduction becomes far more than the mere bartering tool that you set out for. She’s a character without the flimsy mirage of personality drawn up to hide a lack of depth, or a throwaway damsel that only serves to burden you down. She’s a person; naive, curious, independent, and the one you come to rely on throughout the game almost more so than she does you.\n\nThe relationship between her and Booker is the grounding force for a narrative that often feels as if it could spin wildly out of control at any moment, but stays firmly on course throughout every path it goes down, the culmination for which is only describable as utterly insane and brilliant.\n\nWith all it attempts, there are certainly a handful of threads which never get the closure or development they deserve, most prominently that of the deeply rooted racism of Columbia and the rebel for of the Vox Populi that has sprung up as a result. It’s one of the most compelling subplots in the game, though unfortunately has little time to be expanded upon and is mostly a means to a very violent end. Ultimately it’s almost understandable, as there is hardly room for Infinite’s larger narrative to exist in, let alone as many subplots as it has also managed to fit in alongside it.\n\nThough the shooting in Bioshock has never been a problem (quite the opposite, it’s one of the most intelligent and mechanically sophisticated shooters ever made), Infinite is unquestionably smoother in every aspect. It’s a faster, tighter, streamlined game that smartly ejects portions of past games to allow space for its new mechanics to coexist. The core of combat is in many ways the same as it has always been, with mostly names being swapped to reflect the change in local, but otherwise preserving the strongest aspects of Bioshock’s combat while expanding upon them in intelligent ways that further the tactical depth of each encounter.\n\nThe skyhook provides one of the biggest changes to the formula, allowing for a level of verticality the series has never had, as you zip along rails through huge levels which require you take note of the new speed with which you can traverse levels and the vantage points now accessible. It requires a complete rethinking of how fights are approached, and gives the player the tools to take on larger numbers of enemies that in turn are also granted access to these new tools, and make full use of them in their pursuit to take you down.\n\nVigors, Infinite’s replacement for plasmids, offer the same superhuman element as before but now in a much more focused and deliberate manner. Different abilities can be combined into more effective weapons, from electrocuting a murder of crows, to creating exploding enemies by setting them ablaze and then charging into them. It’s a logical evolution of the series’s most unique mechanic, and that only grows further as you come to learn the various combos hidden in the already powerful abilities.\n\nThe switch to only being able to carry two weapons at a time at first felt like a disadvantage, but effectively worked in making me pay more attention to my surroundings and be more active in choosing which weapons to use and where to find new ones. It ensured I was constantly moving and engaged in the combat, as different weapons were often noticeably more effective against different enemy types and I was rarely given the luxury of having them all nearby. Coupled with the smoother aiming and ability to sprint and aim down the sights fundamentally altered how I played, and by and large made for a more compelling experience.\n\nBioshock: Infinite is a stunning achievement; bold, refined, innovative, and constantly stimulating. It’s a game that never falters in its vision, fearful of how easy it would be to have it all crumble upon the weight of its own aspirations, confident in its ability to deliver something awe-inspiring. There are few experiences more worth your time, and leave you with as much to think about.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","November 11, 2014","true","21.3"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","6"

"Bioshock Infinite" takes everything you loved from the depths of Rapture and molds it into something brilliant located in the flying city of Columbia, where a surprising sense of isolation will lure you into its world accompanied with a gorgeous visual style, unbelievably detailed textures and some of the generation's best voice acting.\nI still miss Rapture when I revisit Columbia, yet "Bioshock Infinite" is a game that pulled me in and didn't let go far after I've completed it, and that's something I love about videogames.","February 2, 2014","true","27.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The trailer left me wondering "WTF is this? Why is this a game about a city in the sky now? Where are the big daddies? What happened to the little sisters? Where's all the water? And why the ♥♥♥♥ is George Washington in this game!?\n\nSo I finally purchased the game expecting to hate it, wishing through out the whole time that it was like the first 2 games. It only took about 10 minutes for all of that to go out the window. The new world  in Bioshock Infinite is beautiful. Definitely better than  Rapture. Rapture is grimy and there is very little to look at. In Colombia, the atmosphere is a lot more lively. Everywhere you turn there is something to look at, It's like a giant theme-park.\n\nColombia is a lot more open than Rapture, so it allows for combat to be more spread out and not so in your face as in the previous 2 games. The shooting feels a lot better. At first i was a bit bummed like most players about only being able to carry 2 weapons, unlike the previous game were you could carry 8 (I think). It took me a while to see how this 2 weapon system is a lot better IMO. In Bioshock 1 & 2, I pretty much just used 2-3 weapons and it was a pain fumbling around with all the other weapons I had no interest in using. In Infinite you find a lot of the other weapons you aren't carrying around anyway, so it's not like you get stuck with crappy weapons you don't want.\n\nPlasmids are still in the game, but now called Vigors. Rather than leveling them up with Adam, you just upgrade them with money in vending machines. No big deal really. The new vending machines are an improvement over the old circus of value ones, I like them. The hacking is gone, don't really care really, after a while it became annoying in the previous games.\n\nThis game is not about just eye candy, it has a fantastic story just like the previous Bioshock games.  But it does a better job at presenting it. The story is more interactive in this game than the previous, where it was pretty much all driven by the audio logs.\n\nOverall i really enjoyed the game. I finished it in 3 sittings. That is something i rarely do, I usually just play like 1/4 of the game and come back to it a few months later in episodes until i finish it. This kept my interest and never really felt dull. It is a great installment in the franchise and I can't wait to see where they take it from here.","February 1, 2014","true","26.0"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","1"

A Steampunk-styled, dystopian alternate universe; However, instead of traveling to city at the bottom of the ocean, you are transported to a sky city where everything is Heaven-flavored, that is until it all goes to Hell. Fast. I have to admit, I sort of fell in love with the series after a short time playing the very first Bioshock. I found myself wanting to immerse myself in the story and learn all I could, while trying to survive not only the hidden things lurking around corners, but the scattered people who seem to have gone completely insane. This Bioshock was different. In this, the people of the sky city are told by their rulers, whom they almost seem to worship, that you are The Marked One, who must be killed. So instead of encountering people who are completely insane, you are chased, cornered, and attacked by people of thinly veiled sanity, from a once seemingly utopian society. I would recommend this game, as well as the entire Trilogy, as it was fun, exciting, and worth at least a playthough.","May 26, 2015","true","0.1"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/8870/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","BioShock Infinite... one of the most critically overhyped game, is THE biggest disappointment of the year for me by FAR.\n\nThe game starts out very, very strong by showing you our character, Booker DeWitt and explaining why he has the mission to find a mysterious girl by the name of Elizabeth, and so is sent to the world of Columbia, a colossal city in atop the sky. I say it starts out strong is because it wastes no time in immersing you into what you immediately see a vast city filled with life and soul, but it quickly drops after you're introduced to the actual game.\n\n~Visuals\nRight at the very beginning, you can see how beautiful the game is. With vibrant colors and clean textures for most of what you see. Although some items thruought the world of Columbia have muddy textures and just things that look downright lazy, it's essentially a nitpick when you see what the real focus of the game is - however those items are still present and detract from the overall ambiance. Enemy models and the such are varied throught the game when it switches the standard Columbia militia for members of a cult organization to supernatural entities.\n\n~Sound\nNot much to say for this game. The game has a few ambiance setting melodies throughout to keep the mood running the way the situation calls for it, though generally you won't notice the music running in the background at all, there aren't any real unforgettable scores other than Elizabeth's Theme. The rest of the game does a fairly well job of relaying how guns work, the enemies yelling in the background mocking you, the distance of their gunshots, etc. My best mention sound wise, is the soundwork for Songbird - it is genually as creepy as the Big Daddy's cry in the original BioShock.\n\n~Gameplay\nSadly though, this is actually where the game faulters. The game quickly starts you on a shooting romp that is seemingly never ending without much variation. From the very first gunfight you have in the game, the only things that change is when you get more weapons, more vigors and Elizabeth starts using her powers, most of which, with the exception of Elizabeth, do nothing to improve the base gameplay the game has to offer.\n\nYou can use vigors (very similar to that of BioShock 1 & 2, but in here, you're better off going the "gung ho" way as the vigors on this game are pretty underpowered, nearly all of them, except for the "Shock Jockey" vigor, are damn near useless or do same thing as others do or does next to nothing at all(Lol wash away your enemies). Elizabeth presents the most to the gameplay as the game (I'm aware of the 90's mode the game has) gets incredibly easier when she tags along. Elizabeth can activate turrets, robots to help you get the enemy, decoys, cover, health, etc to help you in your battles, while there's not variation here either - it's still a welcome addition that's also pretty original in any game.\n\nSadly, the rest of the game can be summed up with one description: Shooting Gallery. The game literally consists of you moving from room to room in what the game tries to illusionate is an open world, but is actually a long corridor - you effectively run from room to room shooting dozens of enemies, kill them, run in a straight line to another room, kill more dozens of enemies ~ rinse and repeat. It tries to incorporate strategy by incorporating the "Skyhook" as a means to move about the combat area, but that only serves to be a cheap way of "saving bullets" and killing enemies and it generally very useless outside of combat and in areas that don't have a rail on 'em.\n\nAll in all, the game was a disappointment for me as I was expecting more story and interactivity from a game that had promised just that. Instead I believe we got a game with an unsettling pace, extremely linear gameplay, a forgettable soundtrack and it was just overall a forgettable, generic experience.\n\n**Just to clear up some misconception - No, BioShock Infinite is not a bad game. It's not inherently broken or buggy (PC wise, it's actually one of the better ports out there), this is just what it is, an opinion, to me this game was one of the most repetitive experiences I've had this year and the story bits were too scarce for me to really get into it. I don't have fun mindlessly shooting wave after wave of enemies, if you do, then by all means get the game.","July 8, 2013","false","17.5"," 378 of 723 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","378","723","0","15"

Upon release, BioShock: Infinite was praised with positive reviews that I personally noted, but they did not alter my skepticism. How wrong was I? Completely. Totally. Utterly. Rarely does any medium of entertainment--from books to movies---challenge my perceptions or affect my emotions. BioShock: Infinite did and I'm not sure why. The game is a virtual rollercoaster ride that mixes strong dramatization, story, characters and new gameplay mechanics that build up another one of Ken Levine's twisted dystopias. The game also offers one of the most compelling non-playable characters (NPCs) to date that will ultimately lure you into the world of BioShock. The game is beautiful, varied and philosophical in its representation. BioShock: Infinite has displaced the Mass Effect series as my all-time favorite game which is a statement unto itself considering the length of one game versus a trilogy.

Or is it?\nThe game is set in the year 1912.  Booker Dewitt accepts a job to travel to Columbia, a city suspended in the air, in order to retrieve a girl (Elizabeth) and wipe away his "debts".  I don't know how much else I can say without spoiling some bits, so I'll just get right into the review.\nYou see, Inifinite not only has a different setting.  It's very, very different to the first two games, in fact.  So different to the point where one could easily say that it's just a game that only has a different, original setting (as well as some lovely throwback references to the series) in common with it's franchise.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and find it to be a great addition.\nThe game itself is fantastic.  The story was good, combat was quite good, the setting was fantastic and I found myself enjoying the characters (Elizabeth, The Lutece Twins and Songbird were probably my favourites.  Yes, even Songbird).\nOne who tries to play this game as if it were the original BioShock (or the second) will not do too well.  This game is more of an open-ish world shooter with large areas to move around while in combat.  As well as this, the player can utilize Columbia's transport system (Sky-Lines, metal lines that one can traverse with a grappeling hook) to fight foes and move around the city.  It's a cool feature in general.\nWhen watching the game be played, the main fear I had was that Elizabeth would be constantly forced as a character I desperately needed to care about.  While this is true in some respects, I didn't neccesarily find her overbearing.  In fact, I began to enjoy her company as well as the character throughout the game.  That being said, though, she definitely isn't a companion; more of a follower.\nOne thing to note is that you can no longer carry more than two weapons.  Apparently the downloadable-content "Burial at Sea" allows this once again as the player returns to the city of Rapture but since this is about the main game I'll just say it's a bit of a letdown.  I'm not thrilled that the change was made, but it's not something I believe you should focus on.\nAnother thing to note is that the little "boss" characters that the character finds throughout the game aren't utilized very well.  I find that they're nowhere near as memorable as the Big Daddy characters that the player encounters in the first game.  It's a letdown indeed.  That brings me onto another topic; Plasmids.  Plasmids, or "Vigors" as they are now called, just aren't as memorable as the ones you encounter in Rapture.  On top of that, I only found myself using two or three of them on a regular basis compared to the first two games where I would use a wide variety.\nTo sum it up, this is a good game that should keep you occupied.  If you're one who likes to play through games multiple times once you get it I'm sure this could keep you entertained for a while.  That being said, I still can't overcome my biased attitude towards the first game in the series and would definitely reccommend that, if you're willing to pay for this game, you at least consider getting the first one as well.\n\n","January 17, 2014","true","12.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","5"

The gameplay is superior over the other episodes and much better balanced. The story is nearly as good as the first one. It cares for the female player, got lotsa eye-candy and has the highest grade of replayability compared to the other parts. In my opinion, balancing story and gameplay, the best of all 3 Bioshock games. If you liked the others, you will also like this one. At best, you played just BS1 and not the 2nd part beforehand (unless you wanna play all 3).\n\nstory\nThough BS2 had not a bad story, the Would you kindly? moment was missing. Now, you got a repackaged BS2 story which takes care of that. It is somewhat unrelated to the other episodes and you could use it as a starter to the Bioshock world, though due to graphics and gameplay, I advise against it.\nIt definitely tries to get the girls to the consoles as in a slightly female colour scheme, a female hero w/o mega ♥♥♥♥ nor skin tight leather... and to top that up, even a change of hair dressing is included! ;P\nThat said, there is enough blood, dirt and gore and Bioshock manages once more to combine high morals with bloodiest violence and beautiful sceneries.\nA lot has been recycled from BS2, though: It feels a bit like the Syren Alley level and its objective being a whole game combined with the Eleanor meta story. In Ryan's Amusements you had to get a Plasmid inside a propaganda amusement park for kids in order to continue a journey on a train. In Soldier's Field the difference is only that Plasmids are called Vigors and that you continue your journey in a Gondola. Besides an obstacle blocks your carriage and you have to get the Plasmid/Vigor inside a children's propaganda theme park. Fink and his stage reminded me a bit of The Great Alexander - There are many moments which feel like BS2.\n\ngameplay\nUsed to be the biggest pain in the ♥♥♥♥ on its predecessors, but the Bioshock team seems to learn by trial and error. Each part gets better gameplay-wise and now, the mindless spawning and many shortcomings of BS1 and BS2 are gone.\nThe gameplay is much better balanced due to:\n\n* "Killer"-Plasmids are mostly gone in the main game (like Winter Blast for example).\n* Plasmids are generally better balanced and thus less powerful than before.\n* Adam is gone as character building source it is now "all about money". Since corpses contain money, the infinite spawning of enemies is gone in BS Infinite.\n* the marvellous Green Arrow which gives you directions on demand!  No more "Should I turn the quest arrow on or off?" A+++\n* The research system is gone and nobody will miss it!\n* Sadly, the mini-games are gone, too. Elizabeth lockpicks the doors, safes and chests for you now.\n* Enemies and gear are revamped but the same: Houdinis, now called Zealots, are fewer but tougher. Handymen are basically extra fiery Brute Splicers and the Rumbler returns in a downgraded version as Beasts; there is even a  Mark Meltzer moment. Insect Swarm is also far less powerful now and replaced by Murder of Crows - which is a good thing, since Insect Swarm and Winter Blast was all you needed, even on the most difficult settings.\n* generally, the gameplay is more stream-lined, though there are more collectibles.\n* Negative: More CoD-like in the sense of a less tactical approach and the shortage of resources.\n* Many tutorial elements in the game are too short or simply missing. Vigor Combos for example, though there would have been enough chance for it on some fair stand.\n* The skyline could be better integrated into the gameplay, but as mentioned below, it seems to be technically the most critical part.\n\ngraphics, bugs & Co\nRan it on Win7 64bit with a Geforce GTX760 on highest settings w/o problems. Only major bugs I encountered was on the skyline, there I got stuck under certain circumstances. Also, the only minor bug I am aware of is as well connected to the skyline. It let's Liz circle the skyline for hours, once I am already off - but it doesn't hinder progress and at some stage she is back.\nUnfair to compare graphics, since I played both old parts on XP, but lotsa eye-candy indeed. And as I found just far more "picturesque".\n\nBurial at Sea\nHaven't played it as of yet....\n\nBtw: Si tacuisses... !\nHm, a game that costs soo much money to produce and is so in love with detail, ridicules itself by misuse of professionell knowledge?\nThe first steps into Columbia makes you believe you entered an alternate world of idiots:\n* Gladium is like clavem an Accusative version of the words gladius,-i and clavis,-e.\n* 2 Lockpicks will never open a lock, but inserting a tension wrench[/i] and a lockpick will. Besides but important: Locks don't get damaged by picking (but picking can be detected forensicly).","June 26, 2014","true","68.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It begins mysteriously and soon shows a wondrous world of a colorful fancy; yet, very soon once again, this lovely world reveals its sad, painful secrets; and then, as we get to know the characters and their motivations, their hopes, their fears, we find a tale that is touched by sorrow and longings for redemption or freedom. But there is something more. Its secrets are unveiled eventually, yet there is still much that is left to the player all shattered, and which much be put back together.\n\nWhen the world is torn by hands that touch other worlds, other times, this tale begins to tear the heart too, ever so slowly. In the end, the lives here woven together, the truths gleaned or disinterred, the frailty of it all - lead to an astonishing epilogue that, for all its perplexities and sorrows, all its aesthetic or poetic beauties and its dark paradoxes, I found very splendid.\n\nThere are certain scenes, meetings, conversations, revelations, atmospheres, pains, smiles, sounds, tunes, compositions of horizon and voice, which alone are of great artistic beauty. And, as a whole, with its superb visual design, its excellent soundtrack, its interesting world, its plot with so much fantasy and so much humanity, its dramatic might, and its characters, or some characters I came to care about, BioShock Infinite is a very intense experience whose impressions may well be indelible.\n","January 12","true","70.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Cюжетка там конечно отстает, а во второй там вообще сюжетка хуже чем первая, но DLC для нее более менее лучше. Все таки ребята эти части для мне остается хорошим воспоминанием.\n\nВот и настал 2013 год и вот она BioShock Infinite от разработчиков Irrational Games. Эта игра проста бесподобная и яркая красивая. Честно говоря я такого не ожидал, когда увидел такой шедевр. По стиле BioShock первоначально мы идем в маяк, а дальше мы спускаемся в подводный мир, но в BioShock Infinite наоборот мы поднимаемся вверх в летающий город Колумбия. Когда я первые увидел красивый летающий город Колумбия мне показалось что я в раю. Такой город можно увидеть только во сне. Дальше уже спускались в церковь и там была песня которая очень понравилось (will the circle be unbroken). Гулял в городе там такая атмосфера шикарная как будто я был во сне.\nСамая главная мне понравился девушка Элизабет напарница каторая помогает во всех случаях. Элизабет дочь пророка, но на самом деле это не так. Она добрая и хорошая можна на нее смотреть с улыбкой на лице и честно говоря я о такой девушке мечтал бы.\nНасчет сюжетки или же графике придираться не стоит все на высоком уровне. Прошел я эту игру первоначально на ПК с клавиатурой и мышкой, а дальше когда перепроходил второй раз играл с геймпада.\nСоветую пройти с геймпада, а на клавиатуре с мышкой вы не почувствуете хороший геймплей этой игры.\n\nВ дальнейшем думаю 2K даст возможность разработать новый BioShock к Irrational Games.\n\n\nBioShock Infinite - the best of the series\n\nThis game has covered my soul for what it is unmatched.\nI took this game 3 times without thinking about what I know the whole story and gameplay, but the fact that I played this game back?\nThe first series of BioShock came out in 2007, and then in 2010 the second part of the 2K Games Developer.\n2K Games - in fact they are popular sports games, but that's expected from them BioShock think it is not necessary.\nOf course, I played two BioShock and to be honest I do not particularly like it. Story certainly lagging behind there, and in the second there is generally story worse than the first, but the DLC less is better for it. All the same, these guys are part of me remains a good memory.\n\nThat came in 2013, and here it is BioShock Infinite from Irrational Games developers. This game is just great and bright beautiful. Honestly I did not expect, when I saw such a masterpiece. In the style of the original BioShock, we go to the lighthouse, and then we descend into the underwater world, but BioShock Infinite contrary we rise up in the floating city of Columbia. When I first saw the beautiful floating city of Columbia seemed to me that I was in paradise. This city can be seen only in dreams. Next we are down to the church and there was a song that is very much (will the circle be unbroken). I walked in the city there's an elegant atmosphere as if I was in a dream.\nThe main girl I liked Elizabeth help in all cases. Elizabeth daughter of the Prophet, but in fact it is not. She is kind and good it is possible to look at it with a smile on his face, and to be honest I'm on such a girl would dream.\nAbout story or chart should not find fault with everything on the highest level. I passed this game was originally a PC with keyboard and mouse, and then the second time when pereprohodil played with a gamepad.\nI advise you to go with a gamepad, a keyboard and a mouse, you will not feel good gameplay of this game.\n\nIn the future, 2K think will make it possible to develop a new BioShock to Irrational Games.","April 20","true","61.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/8870/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","INTRODUCTION:\nBioshock Infinite is the third installment to the popular Bioshock series. Set in a city in the sky as opposed to the city underwater, this game features a revamped combat mechanic featuring Sky-lines rails and and a new AI companion, all the while, retaining some of the old features of the previous games.\n\nYou play as Booker DeWitt, a former 7th Cavalry soldier turned Pinkerton who was tasked by unknown individuals to recover a girl, Elizabeth, from the floating city of Colombia. A simple recovery mission quickly turns sour when the girl you have to take turns out to be a very important figure head.\n\nPROS:\n+ Story: -Needless to say, the one primary factor that drives the Bioshock games is they are narrative-driven. This game delivers a very compelling, interesting and immersive story that makes you want to know more about the city and world of Colombia.\n\n+ Graphics: -Stunning visuals and magnificent world design makes Bioshock infinite one of the prettiest games of the franchise. Breathtaking scenery, beautiful texture quality and character designs makes the world alive.\n\n+ Elizabeth: -I normally frown at escort missions, specially if the AI is poorly programed for, but Bioshock Infinite (despite being an escort mission start to finish) got past that  by introducing an companion AI who is helpful and doesn’t get in the way. She assists the player through support roles providing money, ammo, and regenerative potions all throughout the game. She's not the revolutionary AI companion that everyone was excited about, but she's the closest one we have.\n\n+ Optimization: -Was optimized enough for the PC to allow even mid-range desktops or laptops to play the game in relatively high or medium-high settings.\n\nCONS:\n- Combat: -Retains the fun and high paced combat with guns and magic of the previous titles BUT seriously fails due to the poor decision of limiting the player with only TWO weapons carry limit which does not live up to the previous games who had several weapons at the player's disposal. Too many: (1) Kill Bad Guys, (2) Elizabeth Opens Door, Repeat step one, sequences.\n\n- Poor Antagonist (No Spoiler): -Explaining this is a bit hard without spoilers. We were introduced with a great antagonist by the name of Andrew Ryan in the first game but I can't help but feel that the new Antagonist, Comstock falls short. Anything more would be a spoiler. Now even the new Songbird creature (kinda like a buffed up Big Daddy) makes very, very limited appearances and its role in the whole story somewhat becomes pointless once you progress.\n\n- No sense of Danger: -This has been an illness since the first game. Death in the Bioshock franchise is more of a minor inconvenience than an actual penalty. Vita-Chambers in the first and second Bioshock games made death pointless. This was carried over to Bioshock Infinite where the Vita-Chambers beeing replaced by Elizabeth reviving you every time you get incapacitated. This totally eliminates any sense of dread that you should be feeling in a high combat scenario.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAN OVERALL GREAT GAME. Though it has its short comings, I would still recommend Bioshock Infinite to any fan of the franchise. It provides a satisfying narrative and introduces new characters that leave a lasting impact.\n\nAlthough I would still RECOMMEND this game to NEW players in the Bioshock franchise, I think this is best appreciated by people who already gone through the first and second games.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

I felt like I was shooting enemies just so I could earn the next bit of exposition at times. One of the criticisms leveled against the first Bioshock was the drop in quality during the third act, after the climax. Infinite attempts to address this by ending the base campaign right after the appropriate moment. Those unhappy with the ending are welcome to try the DLC, although I doubt anyone looking for a happy ending will be satisfied with that either. I like sad stories so of course I thoroughly enjoyed it. As always, the value here depends heavily on your expectations. I have to agree with zero punctuation on this one - it's not perfect, you can point out the flaws, but its way more ambitious than most anything else that came out in the same year, which makes it GOTY. Sad that it didn't make enough money to keep the devs in business. AAA games may have to take a rest until they find a business model.","October 5, 2013","true","20.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The city of Columbia is a marvel to look at, and its exploration stays enjoyable until the very end of the game. It is a breathing, living world that really makes this game remarkable and for this reason alone I recommend getting the game and playing through it at least once.\n\nHowever, I wish I could say the same things about the gameplay and the story. While the skyrail is a joy to use, the shooting simply does not feel satisfying and the enemies are too bullet-spongy. Even though you gain superhuman powers throughout the course of the game, you simply do not feel powerful.\n\nIt doesn't help that I played the game on 1999 mode which in itself, is a joke, because there is simply nothing "1999ish" about it. Your health regenerates, exploration for ammo and health is very limited, and the checkpoint system also does not improve on the situation. The developers thought they made this mode harder because you can only die a number of times (I'm not sure if I remember this correctly), but you can easily cheat the system if you just reload the checkpoint before the death animation finishes. Sure, you could spam the quicksave-quickload buttons back in 1999, but you still were on the edge of your seat due to conserving ammo and health.\n\n(Not to mention the fact that every time you reload the game, the item drops RANDOMIZE. I have no idea who thought this was a good idea. Sure, some bullets or health here and there could vary I guess, but even the gameplay-affecting modifiers too?)\n\nThe story, while it starts out strong, it gets way too stuck up its own ♥♥♥ towards the end of the game. While I enjoy a complex story and even the dimension-jumping element was a good surprise ( I also managed to get around 70 of the audiologs), explaining what the hell happened in the last 5 minutes is not good storytelling. It seems as if the developers had all these crazy ideas what should happen throughout the campaign but ultimately failed to wrap things up nicely.\n\nUltimately, I give this a recommendation because the game really shines in its world-building and atmosphere. If you go in expecting a remarkable if somewhat flawed shooter, you're going to get your money's worth out of Bioshock Infinite.\n\nHowever, if you're a Shock-fan that has played through the System Shocks and the first Bioshock, I recommend waiting for a sale.","May 5, 2014","true","23.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

BioShock Infinite serves as an excellent addition to the BioShock franchise and if I must say, has become my favorite game of the series. It's a game that has an excellent story, interesting and loveable characters, amazing settings, and more. With the previous two games having both taken place in the underwater city of Rapture, it's nice to see this game take a departure from there and instead, having it take place a completely brand new, different setting, which is the floating city of Columbia. I also enjoyed the game's soundtrack and as well, was taken in by the graphics of the game. It isn't the top of the line realism graphics, but graphics that I find to be quite beautiful. And then there's Elizabeth! She has to be one of my favorite companions of any game. I could honestly go on about her for ages, but in short, she's a character I easily grew to love and who has a very interesting personality, as well as backstory. As well, a companion who is actually seems real as opposed to a not so smart AI. One of my favorite things of this game though is that the city of Columbia as a whole and it's people, as well as so much of the game taking place in bright settings like outside and such, at first glance, it seems like one of those bright, positive games. While this game does have it's brighter, cheerful moments, underneath all that, at the core, I believe BioShock Infinite to be a darker game, when you consider certain parts of the storyline and such, especially when delving deep into the story. Overall, I've had loads of fun playing this game and think it to be a masterpiece of a game, if I do say so myself. I'd recommend this game to anyone without second thoughts!","February 3, 2015","true","39.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/8870/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Bioshock Infinite is a First Person Shooter set in the floating city of Columbia. In stark contrast to the previous game's Rapture city, Columbia is all about blind faith and unity instead of cynicism and individuality. We are sent to Columbia in order to capture a girl who goes by the name of Elizabeth and return her to New York in order to pay off your gambling debts. Upon entering the city we walk in to a rather jolly festival with games, prizes and free magical powers for some reason. Everything seems just dandy until a mysterious symbol appears on your hand, you are spotted then all hell breaks loose. At first you only have a pistol to defend yourself with though it is more than enough to deal with the early enemies as one headshot is all it takes to put them down. In a rather weird design decision you are given some of the game's most powerful powers at the start of the game effectively making you an unstoppable killing machine. Like its predecessors you will still have an energy bar to make sure you don't rely on it too heavily.\n\nThe only way to recharge your energy bar is by consuming salty foods or salty beverages. Why it runs off of salt or why you don't just carry a few packets in your pocket remains a complete mystery. Truth be told the powers themselves feel forced into Infinite since they have become a series staple even if it feels really out of place here. Ultimately these powers are a good thing as they lend much more variety to the combat which there will be a lot of. While the other two Bioshocks focused on subtle horror and enemies were meant to feel threatening Infinite goes the full action route and will have you facing hordes upon hordes of goons. It's a change of pace that really harms the experience as Bioshock has never been known for having good combat and very few of the enemies are memorable while fewer still are enjoyable to fight. Some of the special enemies we have is a bullet spongy teleporting bloke and a rocketeer that doesn't reload, can see through walls and will shoot a rocket into your face even if you are right in front of him whilst taking no damage.\n\nOne of the worst enemies is a giant cyborg who forces you to use Infinite's new skylines feature which allows you to hook onto a rail and either ride it or jump to higher grounds. It's a cool feature but will mostly be used for getting to higher ground as riding on one will make you into a human piñata as the enemies are good shots. The problem with the giant is that he is simply too agile for the extremely slow movement speed of this game and for some strange reason our character can only leap an incredible amount off the ground only when you are looking at a crane to hang on to. We also suffer from fall damage unless we jump off a skyline as if adding more velocity to the landing makes it safer. Very petty things to critic a video game about no doubt but these odd contradictions are put in the spotlight when facing the giants and becoming aware of how awesome it would be if you could use your mysterious jumping skills to fight these raging beasts midair instead of waddling around like a new born lamb. In a game where you can shoot crows out of your wrists and has gone to the full action route it wouldn't be that out of place or it could be made into a power that uses your energy bar to keep it balanced.\n\nWe still have a health bar that can be refilled with random food or health kits but in addition we know also have a shield bar that recharges itself after not taking damage for some time. It sounds like that may make the game too easy though it is so weak that you can't play this like a cover based shooter. Searching your environments you can find tonics that will allow you to either upgrade your health, shield or energy bars. For some reason we now have a two weapon limit which is a subjectively bad change from its predecessors since you will likely be relying on the same two proven and upgraded guns while ignoring any new ones that may show up. That ends up making the combat even more boring due to not wanting to experiment with your load-out in case there is a vicious trap right around the corner. You can't carry much ammo but this is never really a problem as your sidekick Elizabeth gives you supplies whenever you need it most and she never seems to run out of stuff which confirms the theory that a woman's purse is a door to another dimension and is why they can fit a near infinite number of objects in there.\n\nShe won't actively help in fights but she can open small pockets to other dimensions in set places that allows her to spawn friendly turrets, supplies or a vantage point to climb up to. With her around you never have to worry about ammo since she will toss some your way whenever you are running low making sections when she is not around very noticeable. One of the things that really irks me is that there is no manual saving and you will have to wait until you reach one of the sparsely spaced auto-save points. As long as you don't leave the game or it doesn't crash there is no fear of losing any progress since Elizabeth will not allow you to die and will bring you back to life no matter what happens and how many times she does so.  It does remove any tension from Infinite and respawning was in the previous Bioshocks though you cannot disable it here. Elizabeth will be pretty much the only friendly face you'll be seeing and is a rather interesting character who is not afraid to immediately beat you with a book for breaking a hole in her ceiling. Our character is fully voiced as well and named Booker but while being important to the story he never has anything interesting to say.\n\nEnvironments themselves are both beautiful and occasionally open ended allowing plenty of exploration. The surreal look of a city floating in the skies never gets old and the steam-punk theme of the game really suits it. Searching your surroundings will net you all kind of goodies like money, food or voxophones that will fill you in to the back-story of characters or environments. A very neat idea was with the cryptic codes written in blood that require you to find a book to decipher it with and then follow its clue to find a stash of treasure. This only happens twice in the game but it was a really neat feature that I would have loved to see more of. Money is a really important factor that will allow you to buy ammo and supplies as well as upgrading both your weapons and powers. One very powerful thing that you can't buy is “Equipment” that you can wear on four parts of your body for really nice bounces such as being able to reload 30% faster or creating a friendly ghosts when you kill an enemy with a trap. All of your powers can be placed around the environment like landmines to surprise your enemies leading to some potentially interesting fights if you are undetected and allowed the time to rig the battlefield beforehand.\n\nThe story of Infinite starts off interesting and starts losing steam from then on. Near the end of the game it really goes downhill as it has you fighting ghosts and finding rifts in a really long winded filler section. While Bioshock’s trademark melee weapon was a wrench, in Infinite it is a Riddick style spinning blade which also lets you latch onto the skylines. They are nowhere near as deadly as you'd imagine and are effectively a much cooler looking wrench though you can use it at the press of a button instead of having to equip it which can mean life or death when in close range. It does have the best combat in the series but even so it is not particularly good, making it a real shame they went for the heavy action route. I would suggest not buying this game just because you really liked the last few games as Infinite is quite a departure from the desolate and creepy city of Rapture. With that in mind it is still a very decent game that is worth a look by those that like a combination of both FPS and RPG.","March 22","true","20.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

It's a change of pace that really harms the experience as Bioshock has never been known for having good combat and very few of the enemies are memorable while fewer still are enjoyable to fight. Some of the special enemies we have is a bullet spongy teleporting bloke and a rocketeer that doesn't reload, can see through walls and will shoot a rocket into your face even if you are right in front of him whilst taking no damage.\n\nOne of the worst enemies is a giant cyborg who forces you to use Infinite's new skylines feature which allows you to hook onto a rail and either ride it or jump to higher grounds. It's a cool feature but will mostly be used for getting to higher ground as riding on one will make you into a human piñata as the enemies are good shots. The problem with the giant is that he is simply too agile for the extremely slow movement speed of this game and for some strange reason our character can only leap an incredible amount off the ground only when you are looking at a crane to hang on to. We also suffer from fall damage unless we jump off a skyline as if adding more velocity to the landing makes it safer. Very petty things to critic a video game about no doubt but these odd contradictions are put in the spotlight when facing the giants and becoming aware of how awesome it would be if you could use your mysterious jumping skills to fight these raging beasts midair instead of waddling around like a new born lamb. In a game where you can shoot crows out of your wrists and has gone to the full action route it wouldn't be that out of place or it could be made into a power that uses your energy bar to keep it balanced.\n\nWe still have a health bar that can be refilled with random food or health kits but in addition we know also have a shield bar that recharges itself after not taking damage for some time. It sounds like that may make the game too easy though it is so weak that you can't play this like a cover based shooter. Searching your environments you can find tonics that will allow you to either upgrade your health, shield or energy bars. For some reason we now have a two weapon limit which is a subjectively bad change from its predecessors since you will likely be relying on the same two proven and upgraded guns while ignoring any new ones that may show up. That ends up making the combat even more boring due to not wanting to experiment with your load-out in case there is a vicious trap right around the corner. You can't carry much ammo but this is never really a problem as your sidekick Elizabeth gives you supplies whenever you need it most and she never seems to run out of stuff which confirms the theory that a woman's purse is a door to another dimension and is why they can fit a near infinite number of objects in there.\n\nShe won't actively help in fights but she can open small pockets to other dimensions in set places that allows her to spawn friendly turrets, supplies or a vantage point to climb up to. With her around you never have to worry about ammo since she will toss some your way whenever you are running low making sections when she is not around very noticeable. One of the things that really irks me is that there is no manual saving and you will have to wait until you reach one of the sparsely spaced auto-save points. As long as you don't leave the game or it doesn't crash there is no fear of losing any progress since Elizabeth will not allow you to die and will bring you back to life no matter what happens and how many times she does so.  It does remove any tension from Infinite and respawning was in the previous Bioshocks though you cannot disable it here. Elizabeth will be pretty much the only friendly face you'll be seeing and is a rather interesting character who is not afraid to immediately beat you with a book for breaking a hole in her ceiling. Our character is fully voiced as well and named Booker but while being important to the story he never has anything interesting to say.\n\nEnvironments themselves are both beautiful and occasionally open ended allowing plenty of exploration. The surreal look of a city floating in the skies never gets old and the steam-punk theme of the game really suits it. Searching your surroundings will net you all kind of goodies like money, food or voxophones that will fill you in to the back-story of characters or environments. A very neat idea was with the cryptic codes written in blood that require you to find a book to decipher it with and then follow its clue to find a stash of treasure. This only happens twice in the game but it was a really neat feature that I would have loved to see more of. Money is a really important factor that will allow you to buy ammo and supplies as well as upgrading both your weapons and powers. One very powerful thing that you can't buy is “Equipment” that you can wear on four parts of your body for really nice bounces such as being able to reload 30% faster or creating a friendly ghosts when you kill an enemy with a trap. All of your powers can be placed around the environment like landmines to surprise your enemies leading to some potentially interesting fights if you are undetected and allowed the time to rig the battlefield beforehand.\n\nThe story of Infinite starts off interesting and starts losing steam from then on. Near the end of the game it really goes downhill as it has you fighting ghosts and finding rifts in a really long winded filler section. While Bioshock’s trademark melee weapon was a wrench, in Infinite it is a Riddick style spinning blade which also lets you latch onto the skylines. They are nowhere near as deadly as you'd imagine and are effectively a much cooler looking wrench though you can use it at the press of a button instead of having to equip it which can mean life or death when in close range. It does have the best combat in the series but even so it is not particularly good, making it a real shame they went for the heavy action route. I would suggest not buying this game just because you really liked the last few games as Infinite is quite a departure from the desolate and creepy city of Rapture. With that in mind it is still a very decent game that is worth a look by those that like a combination of both FPS and RPG.","March 22","true","20.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

The story itself is brilliantly written the same as the characteristics of the major characters. The main character is Booker DeWitt who was a detective in Pinkerton agency. Our hero Going to Columbia on a mission to save a girl and pay off debts. The graphics are very pretty but the biggest role in my opinion, plays here the lighting is simply wonderful.Textures are nice but only on the main characters, ordinary residents, guards, etc... does not differ much from each other. The area on which we will give you a lot of freedom of action and the possibility of exploration btw. in the major areas will move on the ribbons with the help of the hook attached to the wrist. To survive we will use different types of weapons and vigors and the hook which also giving us a food melee weapon and nicely executed finishes. I recommend this game to all, this game is not that difficult but it is not that easy, and for demanding i recommend "1999 Mode". :)","September 11, 2015","true","35.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

That's the only good thing I can say that did right.\n\nThe gameplay is so ♥♥♥♥ing boring. Not even "bad", just boring. Wave of enemies come, you shot them, they drop, maybe if you are  feeling creative you can use the sky rail, but even those get boring after some hours playing this game. The vigors could be used to add more depth, but mostly all of them are just some sort of stun(so it's easier to shot your enemies!) and even the ones that aren't, are completely non-relevant to the game.\n\nStory wise, it's a really letdown. It introduces nice themes early, just to be dropped two hours later, with convoluted and shallow plot twists. Soundtrack is okay, but quite forgettable. Can't really recommend this for anyone, if you want story-driven FPS games, there's way better ones out there, like Deus Ex, Half-Life and even the first Bioshock.","November 26, 2013","false","9.8"," 242 of 463 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","242","463","3","16"

I played it once through on hard difficulty, which took 11 hours for one playthrough. So keep that in mind for this review.\n\nWell, definitely great graphics wise. Combat feels fluid and fun, though since I played on hard I spent much of my time hiding and taking potshots at enemies. Plot is overall great for a video game, though there are a few inconsistencies that are present within the plot that is provided to you (which you can wave your hand at and still enjoy the game).\n\nThe vigor system is more fun to mess with than in Bioshock; the upgraded 8th vigor is insanely good. The enemies you face are relatively smart and challenging (that siren boss killed me 20 times in a row before randomly dying (I was hiding behind a building, and suddenly she died without me doing anything)).\n\nI'd have to give it a 9.5/10.

The stage is set for another adventure through the grim, but surprisingly sunny, world of Bioshock.\n\nThe original Bioshock is a landmark in immersive videogame narrative and incredible design. It combined wonderfully designed aestethics with cool gameplay elements and a nice story to boot. For those who were truly interested there was plenty of room to explore and learn more of the fallen city of Rapture. Infinite then had a lot to live up to.\n\nInfinite takes you to the flying city of Columbia, a seceded state from early America that left the blasphemous world below behind to ascend to a plane closer to god. You're former private eye with a checkered past who is hired to retrieve a girl from this flying utopia. How hard can it be?\n\nPlenty hard. As it turns out, you're expected, and they're not happy. Inifite has you duke it out in the streets of Columbia while listening to the zealous chants of radical prophets and out of control rebels. The atmosphere is piled on at every turn and the game spares no expense to show you new and crazier things than you held possible. It is an exercise in world building of the highest order that adresses social, racial and religious themes to make you, the player, contemplate your actions and you make your way through the game.\n\nHowever, for all the grandeur and splendor found in its presentation, the execution leaves something to be desired. Do not misunderstand, the story unfolds perfectly and you're still given room to explore. The problem is in the gameplay. Infinite borrows much of its combat from the original Bioshock, but trims away a lot of the fat and only leaves a bare bones set of options. Most battles revolve around bullet pumping and a bit of power flailing, while the combat systems in Bioshock 2 introduced so many cool things. This is Infinite's main problem. After a few hours, the sun doesn't shine so bright anymore while you stride into another gunfight.\n\nLuckily, Infinite spares no expense to keep the pace up so you can make your way through the story at a proper pace. This makes it a game to be enjoyed for its content, while it skimps a bit on the gameplay. That said, if you fancy yourself a masochist, feel free to dive into the 1999 mode. A super hard mode that leaves you reeling if you don't prepare. That'll keep you occupied for a while. Still, Bioshock Infinite is an experience you will need to try at least once.","February 3, 2014","true","12.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hybridial/recommended/8870/","hybridial","hybridial","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hybridial/","289 products in account","Okay, let me preface this by acknowledging that this game is reasonably well polished, visually impressive and doesn't really contain any content that is particularly offensive.\n\nBut otherwise this game is incredibly bad, and I am going to lay out why.\n\nI think the first thing to do is to comment on the gameplay in comparison with it's forebears, Bioshock and Bioshock 2. This game does not play much like them, yet it plays too much like them. The gameplay was stripped down, with numerous features removed and replaced, and yet no significant work was done to improve the combat. This is a problem because Bioshock combat isn't good, it needs elements to it to give it flavour and strategy, such as hacking, interacting with elements in the environment and making enemies target one another, etc. Infinite only has possession as a function for replacing hacking and mind control but it does this with no flair at all. Hacked turrents/enemies are invincible when they are your ally meaning when the ability runs out you have to deal with them then. The Vigors have almost no narrative reason to be in the game and they lack variety even moreso than the Plasmids from prior games.\n\nThe weapons are a massive disappointment. Only allowing for two weapons carried massively cuts down on variety of gameplay yet again, their upgrades are not interesting and just change some stats. And you're penalised for not focusing on upgrading only a couple of weapons that you will use all the time. The gunplay is terrible, enemies are bullet sponges making the combat slow and monotonous. I also think that though some areas of the game are very pretty, much of the game takes place in pretty nondescript corridors, or generic open areas.\n\nEnemies simply spawn in waves or wander around randomly. They never use tactics, there's only a handful of enemy types. The most interesting part of the game is a fairly standard stealth section and the one "boss" fight it has was a massive slog. At no point is this game every truly fun to play for all the obscene amount of money that clearly went into it.\n\nHaving said that, the story and characters are somehow even worse. Elizabeth, for whom much of the game centres on, is a lifeless and annoying character whom it's almost impossible to feel any kind of bond with because once you are meant to protect her... you don't. She doesn't exist as far as the game's enemies are concerned, and thus you do not at any point ever protect her. You simply mass murder your way through Columbia whilst she can randomly spawn ammo, health or money for you. Despite her years of confinement, she acts like a ditzy disney princess for most of the game and when things do get more serious, she has a complete personality turn and becomes a relentless and single minded fool who spouts meaningless philosophical nonsense. The ending is incredibly stupid, makes no logical sense and is intensely cruel and evil.\n\nIn the end this game doesn't manage to be about anything. It has no real message to it, no moral, and no interesting insight into any of it's characters or setting, the setting of Columbia is explored for about an hour at the start and then simply becomes a linear tube for Booker to violently fight through. All of it's characters are stock, reprehensible and pretty much at no point is it possible to sympathise with any of them as they perpetuate a cycle of greed, intolerance and murder. At least in Bioshock Rapture had an ideal built on foundations of intellectualism and free knowledge, Columbia is little more than an idealised floating American city circa 1901. If you're familiar enough with the time period, the game makes very few attempts to use that knowledge for gain, like I've seen in other historical period games like Assassins Creed.\n\nAnd above all, it does not serve any of it's narrative aims by being a poor shooter that doesn't even meet the most basic criteria to be a fun game.\n\n","November 26, 2013","false","11.1"," 176 of 336 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","176","336","0","1"

Of course you get the amazing narrative you'd expect; Elizabeth is one of the best companions in gaming. The developers took their time in developing her character and build the relationship between her & Booker. A character of this quality has not been done since Half Life 2, and even then the comparison falls in Infinite's favor.\n\nThe level design is another standout. The addition of the skyline was ingenious as it allowed the developers to open up the map in a way where it complimented the setting of a city in space.\n\nSuperpowers, now called vigors instead of plasmids, allows the player to mix a match their play style. There's a decent selection of vigors that allows the player to experiment with certain combos and leads to some replay value. Some of the returning powers from the old game have been streamlined to allow for easier management. For example, instead of having to switch between enemy specific plasmids, the power of possession now encompasses all enemies. This aids the somewhat clumsy interface that plagued the first game.\n\nThere is simply no other game like Infinite at the moment. It is frankly one of the most memorable games I've ever had the luxury of playing. Thanks to the superb narrative and game design, Infinite will sit in my mind for days to come.","May 27, 2014","true","100.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

The shooting mechanic is fun but generic, as is the spellcasting/Vigors powers which is a little dissappointing. This is all secondary towards the story telling which is excellently voiced and written, though pacing in the beginning needs work. There are plot holes (the ending, the mother story thread, etc) and jarring game mechanics (Elizabeth's powers) but nothing preventing you from wanting  to see how this all unveils. For all my quibbles, it's smoothed out with the charming characters and world that Infinite presents.\n\nThe Long:\nAfter 2 hours in to Infinite, I stopped playing this game.\nI felt bored, and as pretty as the world was presented in this wonderous alternate steam-punk reality of a cotton candied 1910-esque US, it just wasn't enought to keep me interested because I've seen this theme many times in lower detail and quality, and after 10 minutes wondering around, it all felt familiar. The clever plot points were slipped in from early on, but a bit too obvious and/or heavy handedly but at least a good attempt was made.  The gun play is typical, movement was typical, vigors/spells were unique enough but nothing unheard of. And that's when I stopped. The story was being too subtle, especially for a player like me, who wants to see all places presented, thus making the story even slower.\n\nAfter some nudging from friends, I booted it back on and trudged forward. Once you meet Elizabeth, everything this world and story was building upon started to click. Factions, trials, wonders, backstory, expositories, trageties, horrors, betrayals and tender moments all come at you like a torrential storm surge, each trying to overwhelm the other in waves. Weirdly, through this maelstrom of motivations and hatched plots, the characters and why the world is the way it is, was and/or to be all make some semblance of sense, albeit broken sense if you're not caught up in the spectical/revelation and think about it a bit. The voice acting and dialog is wonderful and believable, there is chemistry between Booker and Elisabeth in their voicing and 3D depictions. You get the sense of balance between tragedy and resilience from Elisabeth, while Booker is definately a man with a past and skin he's not comfortable in anymore.\n\nThe ending... I'll let you be the judge due to the nature of it. It's definitely you take what you will with it since there really isn't a proper answer besides speculation to be honest. The one the game presents is possible but flawed in my mind, but given the game's title, who am I to really judge? Play it and see if you choose to believe it as it is one of the infinite possibilities.","June 27, 2014","true","22.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeanKapsLock/recommended/8870/","SeanKapsLock","Sean Kapslock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeanKapsLock/","198 products in account","After playing this game numerous times (once on Normal, once on 1999) I can safely say it's one of the best stories of all time. The game, however, sucks.\n\nLemmie explain.\nIn the original Bioshock, you had 7 weapons (8 if you include the Camera) that you can carry on you at any given time. This, coupled with the 3 types of ammo for nearly every weapon, allowed you to approach situations and adjust to them as they came. In addition to the interesting weapons, their upgrades were even more fascinating. The ability to freeze somebody by smacking them over the head, then shoot them with fire bullets? Why not?! The possibilites for an interesting combat experience were endless.\n\nBosses in the original also had depth, and were interesting characters. You knew them, you saw what they'd done, you'd heard their words, and agreed with why they must die for you to continue onwards. They also had a habbit for knowing when it was high time to fall over, meaning, after their primary mechanic was exploited, their minutes quickly became numbered, creating a fast paced, difficult, non mundane boss fighting experience. It wasn't just the bosses that died without a ridiculous amount of bullets being pumped into their face, regular enemies didn't take half a nuclear arsenal to bring down, and with good reason; they were just drug heads in t-shirts with the occasional power. Nothing more.\n\nMy apologies for ranting, but there's a point to this. The reason I mentioned the previous two things in those long drawn out excuses for paragraphs it to show what Infinite is lacking. You can hold a maximum of two weapons (the melee weapon now passively always being attached) and thus decreasing the possible methods of dealing with an issue by an exponentional amount. The upgrades for weapons in Infinite are also a joke, being the standard "Reduced Recoil, Increase Damage, Increase Ammo Capacity". That is boring. This is why I mark off the weapon system as terrible.\n\nThe second thing to complain about in this game is the combat sections (if they can even be called that). Interesting locations and cool locales taken thrown headfirst into a game of "Who can be the biggest bullet sponge." The enemies act with a reckless disregard for their own safety and recieve no penalty for it because they can take more hits than an IS-2 tank. It's not interesting fighting enemies who can run up to you and tank all the damage and just punch you in the face. The mess of a combat system quickly becomes a chore when you realize who Ken Levine called in when the bosses all called in sick: Handymen, a dude on fire, and a Spooky Scary Ghost. The Handymen might quite possibly be the worst enemy I have ever faced in a game (besides of course the Lopers from Return to Castle Wolfenstein). They're not enemies so much as they're trucks that can fly. They take a ridiculous amount of punishment and just don't die after being hit in the "Weak Spot" at least 20 times by 12 guage slugs. You also need to fight them every 10 or so minutes, so you spend 1/3 of the game playing and about 2/3s fighting these fun champs, who quickly lose appeal after the first encounter.\n\nNow onto the good part: The story. Horrible combat aside, Bioshock Infinite is a must buy. The enviroments are diverse and feel real and full of life (until you start shooting but hey then it's full of Up-Till-Recently life), the big enemies/friends you encounter all feel like part of something much bigger than yourself, and the story itself and watching Columbia fall apart is absolutely golden and shouldn't be missed.\n\nAn 9/10 story coupled with 3/10 gameplay could easily total to a solid 7.5 game. Highly recommend.\n\n","December 19, 2013","true","21.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Forgive my ranting, derivitive wording, and sloppy editing. Ill probably do something about that at some point in the future.\n\nAllosaurus Rex, a youtuber I quite respect, described interactive media as running on parallel lines of narrative devices and player interaction; A games predetermined narrative, the players input into the interactive gamespace, and how those two lines influence each other. If the parallel runs properly, then player input should serve as a narrative device on its own, even in a mechanically linear game. Take for example Hotline Miami, its usage of neon psychedelia and bass thumping combat queues to reinforce the players disconnect from the games violence, and binding it to the player characters own disconnect. The game uses its interactivity to reinforce the narrative and connect the player and character headspaces; The gameplay means the same to the player what the actions its portraying mean to the character. The narrative flows and the gameplay flows with it.\n\nThe core thematic and narrative concept of Bioshock Infinite, as is traditional of the franchise, is the father-child relationship of the protaganist's filtered through a lens of idealistic extremism, with Randian Objectivism replaced as the focus of satire with colonial American Nationalism. The Father-Child of the story being the player character Booker and his ward Elizabeth. The scripted narrative wants us to feel connected to and ultimately protective of this ward, as the authorities want her back under their control. Protect Elizabeth, that’s the narrative line. The game itself is a linear shooter. Once combat, the gameplay proper, kicks in Elizabeth recedes to the background, immune to damage and only interacting with the player to interrupt the flow of combat to spoon-feed them health and ammo, completely ignored by enemies. That’s the player line. The parallel is obviously not well maintained. A narrative focusing entirely on a cast of two characters and their interactions and how Booker, the vehicle for the player to experience and connect to this story, grows connected to Elizabeth cannot subsist on script alone, something mechanical, something involving the player, needs to be established for that relationship to mean anything. A character as critical to the scripted narrative as Elizabeth cannot be a non-entity in gameplay. Even the excessivity of the violence becomes jarring in the games narrative context. In the original Bioshock the body count made sense within the games world; Jack was engineered to take and dole out damage, and the mentally unstable enemies made suspension of disbelief for their behavior easy, but in Infinite there’s no real logical reason that arguably rational people would be so happy to zerg rush a killing machine like Booker. Going even more basic than that, its a failure. One of the first (ultimately pointless) moral choices the player is confronted with is a pseudo-lynching of an inter-racial couple that the player is forced to participate in. You are given a ball and told to throw it at the couple. At its most basic level, a shooter requires two forms of input: aim and shoot projectiles. So when given a projectile and a target to aim at, of ♥♥♥♥ing course you make the choice with button prompts. Instead of letting the player choose this on their own, potentially letting the setting influence the choice as the pressure of the moment is on them, its reduced to binary hand holding. Without a mechanical factor to bridge the gap between player gameplay and character action, you stop being able to connect to the story as a factor in it and just become a spectator to it. You’re just shooting ♥♥♥♥, and that is a criminal waste of potential in an interactive medium.\n\nIts a sloppiness that persists even to the scripted narrative alone. Its heavily praised usage of themes like racial inequality and nationalism are barely present. Compared to real-world racism in real-world America at the time, what goes down in Columbia is tame. Barely any mention of abuse, either physical or verbal, of the black and irish underclass is present in the dialogue. And by the half-way point these ostensibly critical aspects of the game world are thrown out the window for a nonsensical many-worlds plotline that ultimately devolves into the most basic of grandfather paradoxes that uses quantum mechanics as a synonym for magic.\n\nInstead of solving the core issues with the concepts presented, like escort missions or enemy AI, the developers over-simplified or cut it out to the detriment of the narrative as a whole. This is a pretty consistent issue; The vigors are a glaring leftover from the Rapture setting. They make no sense in the context of Columbia and its culture, and even in gameplay terms they quickly become redundant to the player, as half of your vigors overlap in use. Even the shooting mechanics end up inconsistent and frustrating. A game with a two weapon limit has no business having a weapon upgrade system. Ammo will never be consistent enough for the player to keep their favored weapons, and the curve of weapon introduction insures that at several critical moments of the game the player is left with un-upgraded weaponry as their only valid option. It limits your arsenal, disrupts its own upgrade system, and leaves the player to deal with its schizophrenic ammo drop system where enemies most of the time drop ammo for weapons that you don’t have and can’t get.\n\nTL;DR This game is a pretentious, badly designed mess. For all its praised as being this fresh innovative piece or art, its just another sloppy shooter with a bad story in an industry over-poluted with sloppy shooters with bad stories.","January 7, 2014","false","11.1"," 184 of 352 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","184","352","0","13"

The developers of the game wen't all out with this one and it turned out just fine. The game visually looks like a painting and it's a beautiful site to behold. Often I stop and take in all that I am looking at. The people in the background doing their own thing, Barbershop quartet. But I feel that all of this really overshadows the rest of the game. Is Bioshock Infinite overrated? Yes, but I still think it's worthy of a playthrough. I feel that too many people praized this game eventhough it's not that amazing as people say it is. If you like a story with a FPS Style themed game, than you would enjoy this for sure.\n\nSo, here's the story. The story is about the protagonist of the game, Booker dewitt who has find a girl named Elizabeth and bring to her back to a certain person in New York. Once he finds Elizabeth, you'll be surprised at how good and realistic they made her. Almost all the time through the game, her character was very spontanious. The voice acting in the game is very satisfying. The combat in the game is also pretty satisfying as well. I played with the sniper rifle pretty much the whole time in my playthrough because I found it awesome to see the enemies head blow off when shoot. I found this game also to be a handy tool to improve your aim in games. And with the new addition of vigors, you'll have more variation in your kills. Something that was a little disappointing in the game was the half non and half linear level design and I love games where you can explore everything in the level but this game sort of lacks that. I also don't like that you walk in an empty room, go into the next door, all enemies and you kill them, walk into another empty area and walk upstairs and more enemies and kill them all and then another empty area. If you know what I am talking about, you'll understand what I mean.\n\nBut this is the thing that I truly dislike the most about the game. It's too damn easy! Yes, when you are in combat, Elizabeth often throws you ammo, salts, and health whenever something is low and I actually don't like the idea of that. I also don't like when you press a key on the keyboard and there's an arrow that points you in the right direction. I'd rather ignore all of these things and enjoy the game without it being this easy. I'd like a challenge with these types of games. There are different types of big daddy's in this game now and they are like elderly people put into this body to prolong their life. Without spoilers I would like to say my opinions of the ending. Let me just say, ending are not always that easy when people make a game and this ending is a little illogical at first, but on further notice you begin to think more about it and you kind of reflect about everything that happened in the game. Apart from that I would give it a 7/10. You should better play the original Bioshock because that is a true classic. This game got too much praize for what it was actually not, but I'd still reccommend it.","August 28, 2015","true","9.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

Almost everything is worse in infinite compared to bioshock 1 and 2.\n\nYou can only hold 2 weapons at once which makes it so the game has the typical modern "we only give you the weapon you need for the situation" style. The weapons are all very boring, a rifle, a machine gun, shotgun, sniper... Very unoriginal and boring weapons and the upgrades for them are only "better ammo capacity", "more damage". Very generic and unoriginal. There is a noticably lower amount of vigours/plasmids/powers in infinite and there is a more limited amount of salt/eve so you can'ät use them as much.\n\nThe levels are very linear and are therefor not very interesting and you never have any problems with resources such as ammo or health. Another very dissapointing aspect is that several of the special enemies did not get implemented the way they were promised too especially the more interesting ones.\n\nThe only redeeming aspect is the story of the game and that might be worth your time but for the full price I can seriously not recomend this game for anyone as long as you don't believe that the story alone is worth it.\nPlay the first two games if you want something really good and skip this one or pick it up on sale but for full price I would say no.","November 27, 2013","false","36.8"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","24","43","0","2"

This game proves me wrong. It is an amazing story based game. There are some bugs and glitches but that did not bother me, I was so wrapped up in the story and trying to figure out what was going on as I was playing (not confused just wanted to know the whole plot). There were Easter Eggs and hints at the ending through the game which were hard to pick up on. It is just a FPS nothing special but the story makes the game more than worth it! There are some different guns, some stradegy required at times and some pretty awesome special abilities. Plus the soundtrack in my opinion is pretty awesome too. Highly recommend!\n\nAny game that leaves me dropping my controller, just saying "no... no that... no?!" because I was so in to the story makes it worth while.

This is why I decided to get the game Day 1 and after reading the reviews I got the idea that it would deliver but after playing the game I was really dissapointed with it as I founded to be the weakest Bioshock game in the series. I will start with the good I would say that the game does look really good, does have some nice areas to explore and it does have an interesting story. However, I realised that the story can become a little bit predictible towards the end as the second half of the game really drags on for quite some time, but it does have a really strong beggining and ending. The story is also riddled with plot holes that really don't make sense once you start thinkinh about it. Then theres the gameplay which the weakest. As for a Bioshock game, the shooting is lackluster and as a FPS it is also lackluster. I have just happened to play better FPS games like Crysis 2 and 3 or FarCry 3, whereas Infinte tries way too hard to be a FPS. The vigors are also pretty useless as you will only find yourself using one or two whereas the rest are not that interesting or fun to use, and the same can be said for the weapons. And finally, the vigor and weapon upgrades are also useless as they don't make your guns or vigors that powerful, no matter how many times you upgrade them. Overall I honestly wouldn't recomend buying Bioshock Infinte but instead go for Bioshock 1 and 2 as they are much better games.","November 29, 2013","false","12.7"," 126 of 241 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","126","241","0","5"

However, as you play, you will start to notice how shallow the game is. Environments dont respond to you, NPCs dont respond to you, and you feel like the game has no soul. The flying city did not feel like a flying city. You spend most of the time in rooms and hallways. You get a few chances to take to the clouds, but I really wished there was more emphasis on living in the sky and was hoping for more air fights. At many points in turns into a call of duty duck and cover til you win strategy type of game. The combat gets boring, the vigors get boring, the 'boss battle' is freaking rediculous - but with a great ending - I still felt somewhat satisfied and happy to have played it.

The same can not be said for this game, there was no quartz cumming involved and I was personally extremely saddened to see this game make that choice. What really sets this game back is the distinct lack and obvious work around the devs did when making this game. In the demo Elizabeth's ♥♥♥♥ were at least twice the size but in this game they're like half. They used to be ♥♥♥♥ing watermelons and now they are merely saggy lemons, anybody would think she's just a typical lemon ♥♥♥♥♥, why would any sane person change that? THIS GAME DOESN'T EVEN HAVE BOOB PHYSICS! After touching myself furiously to the first few demos this game released it was clear that the full release game was not intended to be an extended means of masturbation, which as you can imagine sadened many a poor boy. After crying to my daddy on the telephone, "how long now?" I was stricken with the realization that perhaps I could still one rub one out to Elizabeth, even with the lack of breasts that she had once obtained. So I poured myself a glass of fruit loops and let my hand fall into my pants. Elizabeth did not get me going for a second, but there was a shiny knight waiting for me, his name is Booker and I'll tell you what, that man has a lovely jaw line. I have now racked up 320 hours of gameplay on this game and are still yet to finish.\n\n♥♥♥♥: 1/10\nBooker's Calf definition: 10/10\nBoob Physics: 0/10\nStory: 2/10\nGraphics: 1/10\nGameplay: 1/10\n\nOverall: 10/10\nBooker is a handsome man.","November 29, 2013","true","17.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you haven't played this game yet but intend to, do yourself a favor and DO NOT spoil the twist ending for youself. Like any game, it has its imperfections: I feel like the new Health/Salts system is nowhere as good as the system in the first BioShock Health/Eve system. Here, instead of having several health kits and even hypos on you that allow you to refresh your health and eve in a battle, you need to actively look for those items in your environment which can often be a hassle because the salts are so scarce. While under different circumstances this system might have worked, in BioShock Infinite it just becomes annoying after a while. Another qualm that I have is the Vigors themselves. While each of the vigors is unique and can be combo'd with another vigor, most of the vigors do essentially the same thing: they disable enemies in an area for a few seconds and deal some damage. There are some exceptions but ultimately out of the entire arsenal of vigors you end up just going around using one of them to do all the work. Unlike BioShock 1 and 2, the storyline is now much more linear and while some sandbox elements were added such as a couple of secret locations, they're barely noticeable. The Haevy Hitters, which are the equivalents of the Big Daddies from previous games have been reduced from enemies that you need to carefully plan your fights with to simple bullet sponges.\nUltimately, despite these flaws the game is still very fun and enjoyable, has a great story and I do recommend, but it doesn't live up to the original BioShock.\n","March 21, 2014","true","62.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sadpickle/recommended/8870/","sadpickle","Bob Ross","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sadpickle/","184 products in account","This is probably the best game in the world. That's not to say everyone will love it. I think almost everyone can gain something from playing this game. It is first and foremost an excellent shooter game. I'm no legend in FPS games, in fact I pretty much suck. I played it at default difficulty and the game provided a consistent challenge, but never felt impossible. The learning curve might be a tiny bit steep for players new to Bioshock or FPSs. However the game does an excellent job of introducing you to these gameplay elements, without drawing you out of the environment. And oh, what an environment it is.\n\nThe game is about a year and 6 months old now, and the version I played during Turkey Weekend 2014 was remarkably stable. There were maybe two or three minor visual bugs, and one instance where I had to reload a checkpoint to continue. That's literally it for errors, everything else was flawlessly executed. Graphically, a quad-core processor and budget video card will let you set the quality to max visuals. I recommend this, because it's an important part of playing the game. Really, do play this game on PC, at max settings. You do yourself a disservice otherwise.\n\nTo say it is art is to damn it with faint praise.\n\nBioshock Infinite is beautiful. It's like a painting in motion; a world of wonder brought to life in vivid color and ethereal light. The city of Columbia is brimming with breathtaking imagery, particularly during the first half of the game. Shafts of soft light fall on pools of water that ripple in realistic fashion; water that casts reflections on nearby surfaces. Anyone who has been to an indoor pool knows this visual phenomena. There are moments where I had to stop and just admire how gorgeous everything was. In that respect it's unlike any game I've ever played.\n\nThese sumtuous visuals are complemented with excellent sound engineering and a terrific music score. The careful listener will much enjoy some clever musical arrangements. Everything is voice-acted, and that too has been done with care. The voice actors for the protagonist, Booker DeWitt, and his companion Elizabeth, are excellent. Troy Baker, Booker's voice actor, did a particularly fine job of fitting his voice to the era. There is frequent dialogue between Booker and Elizabeth; these conversations provide a level of intimacy that is all too frequently absent from games with a narrative.\n\nIn short I can't recommend this game enough. It's like a book you can immerse yourself in. Provides a solid 15-20 hours of play. It's actually worth $50, but if you can get it on sale, do. This review can't do it justice. You have to experience it.","December 1, 2014","true","30.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is clearly demonstrated in the game as he has the uncontrollable urge to slam his fist into every elevator button, in an attempt to smash it out of its metallic existence. I decided to replay the main game after getting the Season Pass on a sale, and also to complete some easy steam achievements that I've missed.\n\nEdit (Completed DLCs): The 2 Burial at Sea episodes really brings the story together. The plot is well written and matches seamlessly to BS1. I would say the combat in BAS episodes shies away from that of Infinite, especially the stealth approach in BAS2, and was really enjoyable for me.\n\nHowever, I am really disappointed in the lack of slamming of elevator buttons.

While it's considered a game, the game parts are above-avarage at best. I'll go over it.\n\nStory:\nYou are Looker DeWitt, a man hired to find a certain girl in the lands of columbia for a price. That's how it starts at least. Throughout the story you meet Elizabeth, and unlike most followers in games, she isn't useless and is actually rather charming. The story shows their tale... tales... I don't even know how to describe it because the ending is a mind breaker, but i won't spoil it. Either way you'll see them learn and progress. Especially Elizabeth changes over time. Starting as an innocent lady and eventually becoming a badass. The story is easily the strongest part of the game, even if it's all over the place at times due to the cheap way of "Alternate Timelines/Dimensions" yada yada. But in this game it was actually implemented in a very good way. For story alone I would recommend the game. But I'm not done yet.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are stellar. Columbia is really beautiful and other areas in the game are aswell, but in a different way. You can see how bad something is going just by looking around in later areas and it's a really beautiful but also a kind of sad place at times. The game is beautiful, no doubt about it.\n\nRacism?:\nYeah yeah you heard it from everyone, hur durr racist game. Seriously, don't even pretend racism doesn't exist. In fact, I would say it's a strong point of the game. Gives you more of a reason to hate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in charge. So those who complain about this game being racist, IT'S FOR A REASON.\n\nAudio design:\nThe music in areas really add to the atmosphere of the game. Both for the darker and lighter places in Bioshock infinite, the music makes the areas really stand out. Sound effects are pretty good aswell. I would say the gun sound effects COULD be better, but it's not bad. It's pretty good. Other than that the sound in the game is great! The voice acting is done extremely well and the actors really helped you get attached to eachother and the emotions the characters felt were well translated by the voice actors.\n\nGameplay:\nLook. Like I said. The Gameplay is above avarage at best. You have two spots for guns. While this could be used for strategy, there is no reason to. It's clear which guns are better for you and it's not like you're running out of ammo anytime soon. Or health for that matter, as Elizabeth keeps throwing health pickups, ammo pickups and salt (explaining that later) pickups. The only time you ever really get in trouble is when Elizabeth isn't there. And that's a really small portion of the game. Elizabeth kinda feels overpowered, but either way everything around you contains health, ammo and salt too. Seriously, if you have elizabeth with you, shoot away! You won't run out of ammo, at least I didnt.\nYou also have these vigors (or plasmids). They are really fun to use I'll admit. But besides watching crows kill people or lighting people on fire, there is no reason to use it. The upgrades for the vigors and weapons arent anything to be excited about either. Then there is the skylines... A neat feature. But really not that useful for anything other than escaping some mad men. Good luck aiming when you're turning around a corner on the skyline.\n\nNow, is Bioshock Infintie worth the price tag?... I'll be honest, it is if you care about story and graphics. If you want it purely for gameplay, then please wait for when it's a decent price, like on sales. But the price tag now is pretty appropriate for this game. It's not the best game ever, but it's damn good at what it wants to do. Create an atmospheric experience with excellent story and graphics. Sadly, they sacrificed Gameplay for it, but it's definitely something anyone must experience. Just wait untill the price is appropriate for you, and then get it.","December 19, 2013","true","12.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It might be slightly confusing as to what's going on a few hours in, but it'll kick in. You have to pay attention foremost. Irrational Games went a different route in scenery this time. Although the creepy, dark atmosphere and enemies of Rapture is what made BioShock 1 & 2 so great, you're now in the clouds. And it looks beautiful. Add the soundtrack and it's double that.\n\nGameplay is similar to what you're used to in most types of shooters. You have a array of spells called vigors and you can cast them in combination to get a desired effect. There's weapons too and while you do need to shoot your way out of situations, they're not as exciting as using vigors.\n\nElizabeth is extremely smart and proves to be a very helpful self-dependant ally. So no, don't worry about being a Leon.\n\nInfinite is a GOTY contender for many reasons. Top voice acting, a story that is better than anything Hollywood can ever come up with and fluid gameplay. If you want to play one of the best single players this year, get Infinite.","December 6, 2013","true","48.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Columbia, 1912. An utopia floating in the heavens. A city of peace and harmony as mankind has never seen before. The new Eden, free from sins.\n\nAnd then, it all fell apart. Behind the masks of the holy city, political, religious, philosophical and scientific conflicts corrode that self imposed image. Nothing is what it seems. You're Booker DeWitt, sent to Columbia to rescue the young Elisabeth, held captive since an early age. What secrets the city hides? How important is the girl? And who is she?\n\nWith a wonderful ambientation, a steampunk reality of the 20s, mixing the culture of this time with a strangely advanced technology. The soundtrack perfectly composes the plot as you cross several different and well made scenarios​​. You can really feel yourself in that place.\n\nOpen your mind, prepare your heart and come see all the beauties and obscurities of Columbia.\n\nMy Personal Score                Fun:        9/10                Gameplay:        9/10                Ambientation:        10/10                History:        10/10                Replayability:        3/10                Multiplayer:        0/10\n--\n\nBioshock Infinite - Análise: O Jardim do Éden e a Maçã do Pecado\n\nPartindo de uma franquia aclamada, Infinite possuía uma difícil missão para a série: Trazer novo fôlego ao universo de Bioshock, sem perder as características que conquistaram os fãs na decadente cidade submarina de Rapture.\nInfinite abandona as águas profundas para viajar a céu aberto. Columbia, 1912. Uma utopia flutuando nos céus. Uma cidade de paz e harmonia como a humanidade jamais vira antes. O novo Éden, livre de pecados.\n\nE então, tudo desabou. Por trás das máscaras da santa cidade, conflitos políticos, religiosos, filosóficos e científicos corróem esta imagem que se impõe. Nada é o que parece. Você é Booker DeWitt, enviado a Columbia para resgatar a jovem Elisabeth, mantida em cativeiro desde tenra idade. Quais segredos escondem a cidade? Qual a importância da menina? E quem é ela?\n\nCom uma ambientação maravilhosa, uma realidade steampunk dos anos 20 mistura a cultura da época com uma tecnologia estranhamente avançada. A trilha sonora compõe perfeitamente a trama, enquanto vocês cruza diversos cenários diferentes e bem feitos. É possível realmente se sentir no local.\n\nAbra sua mente, prepare seu coração e venha conhecer todas as belezas e obscuridades de Columbia.\n\nMinhas Notas Pessoais                Diversão:        9/10                Gameplay:        9/10                Ambientação:        10/10                História:        10/10                Rejogabilidade:        3/10                Multiplayer:        0/10","September 3, 2014","true","38.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/8870/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Bioshock Infinite is the third in the Bioshock series and takes place in a different environment. Both Bioshock 1 & 2 took place in the underwater city of Rapture, while Infinite takes place in the flying city of Columbia. In general though, the gameplay between the three games is very similar and if you liked parts 1 & 2, you should like Infinite as well.\n\nA recap in case you haven’t played any of the Bioshock games yet:\nBioshock 1 showed what might happen in a world ruled by extreme practicality, everyone looking out for their own best interest. A man named Andrew Ryan created the equivalent of Atlas Shrugged’s “Atlantis.” In the underwater city of Rapture, there was economics without government oversight, art without censorship, and science without ethics. Imagine what the Olympics would be like if all athletes were allowed to take steroids or be otherwise enhanced. Rapture collapsed (figuratively) when people started “splicing” freely.  A substance called Adam was discovered from deep sea slugs that could be used to transfer modified genetic material to people. Everyone could buy these “plasmids” giving themselves superhuman powers and other genetic modifications. Unfortunately people became addicted to this “self-improvement” and a kind of civil war broke out which ended up leaving the city a ghost town. You show up in the final days of the city and try to find your way back to the surface.\n\nIn Bioshock 2, you learn more about the final days of Rapture, as well as what happened after the fall. A psychiatrist Sofia Lamb came to Rapture to try to solve the city’s problems, but she ended up creating an even bigger divide amongst the citizens. Dr. Lamb saw the potential to create a true Utopia (perfect world) but realized that to have a Utopian city requires Utopian citizens (everyone living to serve the greater good).  She tried to create the first Utopian using Adam gene splicing, with the result being a superhuman with all the memories and super powers of everyone in the city (bad idea). You play a different character from the first game trying to rescue someone held captive in the city a couple years after the events of Bioshock 1.\n\nThe story of Bioshock Infinite actually takes place before parts 1 or 2. In the flying city of Columbia, the opposite of Rapture has happened. The city is ruled by religion and actually seems like a great place (if you’re not a racial minority). Bear in mind that this takes place in the early 1900’s so there’s a lot of racism and discrimination. The first half hour of the game you might be shocked at how awesome Columbia is, with no crime, and everything is on the honor system. People don’t need to watch their stores because nobody steals. Instead of worshipping God, the people of Columbia seem to worship the Founding Fathers of the United States (George Washington, Ben Franklin, etc.). The city is controlled by “the Prophet” with the people gladly giving their lives for him if needed. As you go along you find that under the surface, the city is on the verge of revolution.\n\nYou play the character Booker DeWitt, a private detective looking for a girl being held prisoner somewhere in Columbia. When you find the girl Elizabeth, you realize that she has the power to create dimensional rifts and is revered (and feared) by the people of Columbia as a kind of messiah who will bring destruction to the sinful world below. The story is pretty complicated since it involves dimensional travel (maybe time travel?) and a lot of shifting loyalties. I’m still not 100% sure of what happened in the end but it’s a gripping ride nevertheless.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a First Person Shooter similar to Half-Life 2 in that it has no out of body “cut scenes.” You see everything from the view of Booker DeWitt with the story happening around you. There isn’t too much variety in weapons, although a few of the weapons have different “versions” since they’re used by different factions in the story. The game has “vigors” which are basically the same as plasmids in the first 2 Bioshock games. Think of them as magic powers that you find along the way. You have a health bar and a “salts” bar (mana) and you find a lot of health and salt pickups, many of which are dropped by enemies when they die. The game also seems easier than Bioshock 1 & 2 because Elizabeth is with you most of the time as your ammo / health supplier. You don’t need to escort her and she tosses you items occasionally when you’re almost overwhelmed.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent story that you “live” instead of read about. In Bioshock 1 & 2, you mostly learn the story by listening to recordings.\n+Decently long game with a lot of replay value. I’ve played through the game 3 times and I’m keeping it on my hard drive to play again.\n+There’s a lot of variety in environment. You’re not stuck in an underwater city this time. You can fight in the sunny outdoors, flying along skylines, or in a “haunted house.”\n+The price is pretty low for this game. It was so critically acclaimed that it’s constantly a sale headliner.\n\nCons:\n-No multiplayer, but frankly I don’t see how multiplayer would add much. Maybe a co-op mode would be nice but is unnecessary.\n-A huge bunch of the Steam achievements are for the game’s DLCs. I usually don’t buy DLCs and the Season Pass for the game is as expensive as the main game :(\n\nOverall, Bioshock Infinite is definitely recommended to fans of shooter games and good stories. So many people seem to have the game that you could probably use Steam’s family sharing to play it off of your friends’ accounts. It’s a pretty big download but definitely worth it.\n","September 23, 2014","true","37.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The environments were great, of course, but the actual weapons felt... weak and enemies became too bullet-spongy later on in the game. Elizabeth is a pretty interesting addition, as she runs around looking for stuff you're running low on in the middle of combat which saved my ♥♥♥ plenty of times. Though interesting she's almost the only actual face-to-face interaction you get beyond a few non-combat areas. And the vigors were... well they were alright but mostly ripped from the previous Bioshock.\n\nIt was the gun-play which was really disappointing. Things like only being able to carry two weapons pretty much forces you to carry a gun and a heavy weapon. Plus weapons have very little kick and the bulletspongy enemies make it feel like you're using a toy gun. At the end of the game ammo is very scarce and there are no vendors you can get ammo from at all. And really, it just felt terrible at points, I found myself wanting to just get combat over with just to get back to the amazing story.\n\nI'd say its definitely worth a buy, as this is easily among the best stories ever told in a game. However in itself, not a good game. So I'd advise you play it on easy to get to the story bits faster.\n\nStory: 10/10 (amazing)\nEnviroment/World: 9/10 (awe-inspiring)\nCombat: 3/10 (far too generic and far too much of it shoved in for a story-centric game)","August 9, 2013","true","19.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

(SPOILER-FREE)\n\nBioshock Infinite is at its core an average single-player shooter game. However, this is not what compelled me to pick it up. I picked this game up for around 10 bucks during the Steam Black Friday sale, hearing that the story was excellent, and far better than what you'd see in an everyday shooter. After about a month of letting it sit in my library, I gave it a try. Damn, were my friends right. The story is what MADE the game. The world of Colombia is sprawling and full of life, which is surprising due to the subject matter. The character of Elizabeth gave the game heart and a way to convey its story through someone else's eyes, rather than the focused and violent sight of Mr. Booker Dewitt. The ending left me speechless, and I talked to my friends about it for hours. I tried the other Bioshocks, but they were not even close to the fun I had with Infinite. They were far too dark and overall lacked the polish of Infinite. Infinite's choice of a lighter atmosphere and a gripping story reeled me in and gave me an overall great experience. It was worth every penny.","March 10, 2014","true","14.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The other persons stay quite faceless.\nThe enemies act ok, but they are all exchangable.\n\nIf I hadn't bought the game on a Steam Sale, I would be now quite vexed.","December 8, 2013","false","15.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

O look you have a known graphics glitch happen go back 3 hours. O look another crash 2 hours gone. Secondly minus 20 points lack of telling you you are leaving a section of an area and can't back track.  Third minus 30 points unable to have more than 2 weapons, upgrades too expensive, lack of 'tonic' choices like the first two.   This game gets a 10 out of 100 from me and that is me being generous. I also have a high end computer so it is not my PC that is the issue. This game is buggy as all hell and too much 'first person shooter in a hallway for my liking.

If you like story driven games, then you will at least get something out of this title.\n* The fights are really sort of boring, as they are heavily scripted in many ways.\n\nConsidering Bioshock and Bioshock 2 are two of my favorite games in the FPS genre, infinite has been a huge letdown for me. While Columbia is amazing and lovely, and the story is well done...I was expecting ... more. Something better. Something more intuitive.\n\nAnother thing is: the way irrational nickle and dimes you for weapons and money. (i.e: the add on packs)\n\nAll in all, it's a toss up. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone generally, but if you like story and visuals...buy the base game.\n\nDon't waste ANY money on the DLC, it's garbage. Yes, Rapture in the new engine is pretty.

A lot of this is knee-jerk, "I don't like anything that happens to be popular" but there's a fine grain of truth in there that's definately worth addressing.\n\nThe story doesn't really make sense. It makes sense at first, and then it doesn't, and then you overthink it for a while until it starts to make sense again, and then it kind of eats its own tail in a final hail of riduculousness. I won't spoil anything here; but you will go from head scratching, to enlightenment, to being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the story. That being all of the important interpersonal story elements are good fun and deserve recognition. When people focus on the sci-fi elements they're looking at the wrong parts.\n\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous and I don't think that needs to be stressed too much because what you see in the trailers is pretty much what you get.\n\nCombat is good and I found myself rotating through a lot of different abilities. In the original Bioshock I pretty much found my favorite power and stuck with it through the whole game. Infinite rarely lets you get away with that; I found that I had to use almost every ability I had at my disposal to get through some of the harder portions of the game.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously.

The whole concept of infinite universes and 'constants and variables' is an ever present theme throughout the series.\n\nAfter completing the base game, I was left with a few questions, but the two follow-up DLCs: Burial at Sea 1 & 2, gave me such an emotional and satisfying ending that I was left with no ill-feelings. I'll just say straight up that if you love a good story, which is so massive and complex, yet understandable, this game is perfect for you.\n\n\nGameplay\n----------------------------------\nBioshock Infinite has some very enjoyable gameplay. Combining FPS, with rapid skylines, and vigors (special abilities), makes this game mind blowingly awesome. Every shot, every power, feels impactful. The visual detail is stunning for a game which has an almost 'cartoony' feel to it. Riding skylines, and hopping from location to location feels amazing and action-filled as you quickly hop off to take down an enemy, only to run back and swing along looking for your next target.\n\nFor the more tactical players, setting off vigor traps, or possessing enemy structures can turn the tide of battle in an instant.\n\nThe weapons....oh man the weapons. The time period of this game brings back all the 'old-school' weapons which have a certain kind of feel to them which can't be explained. The detail of the gun models, the sounds, the firing rate, and the damage it inflicts just gives a satisfying feeling at the end of a battle. There are all kinds of weapons for any kind of player. Snipers, pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers, and a ton more.\n\nGameplay wise, this game deserves a playthrough at the very least...but no, there's more...\n\nCharacters\n----------------------------------\nOh my god, where do I begin?? First off, Elizabeth is possibly the most lovable, attractive, helpful character I've ever seen in a game, period.\n\nThe voice actors for both Booker, and Elizabeth are simply amazing. They made the characters feel so real, so personal, and the story could not have gone anywhere without top quality voice actors.\n\n\n\nThere's literally paragraphs upon paragraphs I could write about this masterpiece of a game, but no, buy this game and it's DLCs. Play it. Enjoy it.\n\n9.9/10  I wanted Elizabeth to live :'(\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

But compared to the original Bioshock and System Shock it is crap. As far as a Shock game i was very dissapointed even though I played through it twise (one time on 1999 mode, hoping for a bit of the old feel, but no).\nWhile Bishock and Systemshock feelt "real" and dynamic in a way few games do, Infinite feels more like a bland rail shooter. It is not really a shock game anymore, you don't even have a map! (because you don't need one in this "corridor" shooter!)\n\nAnd while the splicers in the original Bioshock feelt very thoughtout and fitting to the setting, they just copied them to what is supposed to be regular humans in Infinite, taking another well thought out game setting and turning it totally unlogical. In Bioshock, crazy splicers jumping at you in frenzy make total sense. In Infinte regular policemen doing the same, not so much.\n\nThey had the good sense to not involve nps:s in the first Shock games to much, in Infinte again, they just screw it up with populating the world in some areas with these "robots", just taking away from the feeling this is a real place.\nThe best things about the game are Elizabeth as a character and as an AI. Very impressive. Also the story is interesting, but not as involving as in the original Bioshock.\n\nJuding this as a stand alone game with nothing to do with the Shock series I would say it is a good game and give this a honest 7-8/10\nAs a Shock game it is a huge dissappointment : 3/10","December 15, 2013","false","47.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But that's it... there's not a lot to say about the rest: the relation with Elizabeth was the only reason I finished the game. Problem is: just like the rest of the series, the good aspects are only  a nice dress for a linear shooting experience. Story and gameplay don't even try to reconcile and there's nothing substantial about the backstory and its "philosophy". It's just a convoluted excuse to blow heads off with guns and magic: the gameplay has been dumbed down for the casual crowd when compared to Bioshock 1 & 2. There's no survival or rpg-lite element. Just... shooting. The story does not make any kind of sense, but that's a given for the Bioshock series.

The Story is as you come to expect from the creators of Bioshock, you wander around a city for awhile trying to complete a goal that will lead you to the big twist at the end of the game. It was done very well because of the voice acting, pacing, writing, and its impact.\n\nHowever, the gameplay was extremely boring. First off, all you did was verse the same 2 enemy types that never change over the course of the 17 hour campaign. Then you have the vigors , which are explained in a cool way but are just various forms of stun that distract the enemy for about half a second. The Handymen  and the Motorized Patriots were sad attempts at trying to recreate the Big Daddy that didn't offer any reward. Next, you can only carry 2 weapons that never seem to have enough ammo and make you feel underpowered.

However, I do have my problems with it, coming from a Bioshock 1 fan. I find the openness of the environment to be tiresome, I see many opportunities for this game to be completed easily - especially then atleast at a medium or hard mode.  As I played it, I found the plot to become more and more predictable. I felt as if the concept of Columbia being a bigger wonder than Rapture, yet not being featured as a first game in the series, was sort of confusing. They harness the same knowledge as the founders of Rapture, hell, maybe even more, and they've built a city in the skies... I truly hope there will be a Bioshock 3 and that Infinite is simply a spin-off. I liked the combat mechanics alot. I have to say though - what I truly am thankful for is that I got this on sale, and I'm sorry to bring such a negative review to such talented devs, but this game is not in my taste.","January 10, 2014","false","14.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

But compared to the original Bioshock and System Shock it is crap. As far as a Shock game i was very dissapointed even though I played through it twise (one time on 1999 mode, hoping for a bit of the old feel, but no).\nWhile Bishock and Systemshock feelt "real" and dynamic in a way few games do, Infinite feels more like a bland rail shooter. It is not really a shock game anymore, you don't even have a map! (because you don't need one in this "corridor" shooter!)\n\nAnd while the splicers in the original Bioshock feelt very thoughtout and fitting to the setting, they just copied them to what is supposed to be regular humans in Infinite, taking another well thought out game setting and turning it totally unlogical. In Bioshock, crazy splicers jumping at you in frenzy make total sense. In Infinte regular policemen doing the same, not so much.\n\nThey had the good sense to not involve nps:s in the first Shock games to much, in Infinte again, they just screw it up with populating the world in some areas with these "robots", just taking away from the feeling this is a real place.\nThe best things about the game are Elizabeth as a character and as an AI. Very impressive. Also the story is interesting, but not as involving as in the original Bioshock.\n\nJuding this as a stand alone game with nothing to do with the Shock series I would say it is a good game and give this a honest 7-8/10\nAs a Shock game it is a huge dissappointment : 3/10","December 15, 2013","false","47.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But that's it... there's not a lot to say about the rest: the relation with Elizabeth was the only reason I finished the game. Problem is: just like the rest of the series, the good aspects are only  a nice dress for a linear shooting experience. Story and gameplay don't even try to reconcile and there's nothing substantial about the backstory and its "philosophy". It's just a convoluted excuse to blow heads off with guns and magic: the gameplay has been dumbed down for the casual crowd when compared to Bioshock 1 & 2. There's no survival or rpg-lite element. Just... shooting. The story does not make any kind of sense, but that's a given for the Bioshock series. Overall, Infinite is one of the most overrated game I ever played.\n\nVote: 5,5","December 15, 2013","false","21.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A lot of this is knee-jerk, "I don't like anything that happens to be popular" but there's a fine grain of truth in there that's definately worth addressing.\n\nThe story doesn't really make sense. It makes sense at first, and then it doesn't, and then you overthink it for a while until it starts to make sense again, and then it kind of eats its own tail in a final hail of riduculousness. I won't spoil anything here; but you will go from head scratching, to enlightenment, to being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the story. That being all of the important interpersonal story elements are good fun and deserve recognition. When people focus on the sci-fi elements they're looking at the wrong parts.\n\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous and I don't think that needs to be stressed too much because what you see in the trailers is pretty much what you get.\n\nCombat is good and I found myself rotating through a lot of different abilities. In the original Bioshock I pretty much found my favorite power and stuck with it through the whole game. Infinite rarely lets you get away with that; I found that I had to use almost every ability I had at my disposal to get through some of the harder portions of the game.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously.

The whole concept of infinite universes and 'constants and variables' is an ever present theme throughout the series.\n\nAfter completing the base game, I was left with a few questions, but the two follow-up DLCs: Burial at Sea 1 & 2, gave me such an emotional and satisfying ending that I was left with no ill-feelings. I'll just say straight up that if you love a good story, which is so massive and complex, yet understandable, this game is perfect for you.\n\n\nGameplay\n----------------------------------\nBioshock Infinite has some very enjoyable gameplay. Combining FPS, with rapid skylines, and vigors (special abilities), makes this game mind blowingly awesome. Every shot, every power, feels impactful. The visual detail is stunning for a game which has an almost 'cartoony' feel to it. Riding skylines, and hopping from location to location feels amazing and action-filled as you quickly hop off to take down an enemy, only to run back and swing along looking for your next target.\n\nFor the more tactical players, setting off vigor traps, or possessing enemy structures can turn the tide of battle in an instant.\n\nThe weapons....oh man the weapons. The time period of this game brings back all the 'old-school' weapons which have a certain kind of feel to them which can't be explained. The detail of the gun models, the sounds, the firing rate, and the damage it inflicts just gives a satisfying feeling at the end of a battle. There are all kinds of weapons for any kind of player. Snipers, pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers, and a ton more.\n\nGameplay wise, this game deserves a playthrough at the very least...but no, there's more...\n\nCharacters\n----------------------------------\nOh my god, where do I begin?? First off, Elizabeth is possibly the most lovable, attractive, helpful character I've ever seen in a game, period.\n\nThe voice actors for both Booker, and Elizabeth are simply amazing. They made the characters feel so real, so personal, and the story could not have gone anywhere without top quality voice actors.\n\n\n\nThere's literally paragraphs upon paragraphs I could write about this masterpiece of a game, but no, buy this game and it's DLCs. Play it. Enjoy it.\n\n9.9/10  I wanted Elizabeth to live :'(\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's story, Its caracters, Its gameplay, Its music and the list goes on...\n\nIt was a completely different game from the original Bioshock and even the DLC, (that I did a review for too) despite being set in the same location as the original Bioshock and being a direct prequel, still is as different as a cat is from a dog. Let's start with the story. The story was a tad longer than the original Bioshock. It does not have different endings like it, but leads to one concluding (un)expected climax. All of the endings (by all I mean the ones from the dlc too) made me sad. It doesn't reach the tears level sad, that it could aswell have, if they had put a little more work into it, but is still pretty sad. Maybe, because I personally didn't understand the characters completely, or maybe just because I am a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who would punch another person for a laugh. One of the game's main mind-tricks are constants and variables. It's always mentioned in the story. They seem to be very important, but in truth, the little parts and the decisions you make don't really matter. The only difference the pendant you chose made, was which one was on Elizabeth's neck throughout the rest of the game. It makes you think that the variables matter, but in truth, the only things that matter and make the story are the constants, which leads me to the characters. The characters, as I said are very well voiced and animated. You can actually feel their inner suffering and wish to help as much as you can, but the game is, technically a sad corridor walk.  If I were any of those characters, I would have taken the other paths so many times, but the game just doesn't allow you to do it, despite being an RPG, with a little bit of open world, (as tiny optional areas to explore). Though, to anyone playing this game, I will again and again recommend exploring the hidden rooms, listening to the voxophones and doing optional objectives, as you will get more money, infusions, and even access some vigors earlier than you are supposed to. Also, it is good for the eye, as the flying city of Columbia, and later on the underwater city of Rapture are very beautiful locations, that require long stares to truly appreciate their beauty. The combat, at least in the original campaign, is a costrated version of the combat from Bioshock 2. Yes you can have both plasmids and guns at the same time, no you can only have two guns on you at a time, or at least until you do the DLC. Combat in the DLC tries to re-capture the Bioshock 2 one, allowing you to have all the weapons on you, using the style of this game's HUDs. Also a major drawback in combat, for me at least, is that different from the first games, weapon upgrades are not visible. I buy a longer clip for my machinegun, and what do I get? the same machinegun with the same clip. Where did the room for 80 more bullets come from? Is it bigger on the inside? It's not that much of a problem, but it's quite a disappointment, for me at least. What do I still have to go over... oh yes, the difficulty! Even on the hardest difficulty the game was fairly easy. Yes, there were a couple places, where I couldn't get pat on my first try, but they were all doable, all thanks to previous preparation, and visiting optional areas. No really, you should really do it. It's better for your own sake.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT OWN RISK!\n\nLastly, I want to draw this one last comparison to the original Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite. The original Bioshock's story focused highly on Ideology and psychology, especially with the suddent plot twist at the end. It makes you question yourself. Who am I? What ideology is best for me? Am I truly living for myself or am I just somebody's slave? While still having psychological aspects to the plot, Bioshock Infinite focuses more on science(-fiction), racism and battle of the classes, and religion, a little bit. Starting from the end, the religion part comes from the fact that all the opressive, white, rich capitlists are Christians, who believe in American exceptionalism, thinking that the new "Noah's ark" is only for them and the other skin colors are there to serve them as lesser humans. While this makes you feel for the "Lesser humans", know, they act just like the higher class says they act, despite saying they don't. The white man claims to fight anarchists, who kill women and children, but they themselves don't hesitate to shoot anyone wearing red on sight. The Vox on the other hand claim they just want to stop the oppression and live in equality and peace, by doing anything but peaceful things. Sadly, the game doesn't let you decide your evil and does it for you. Though it is kind of good too, since you don't have to check are they shootable on sight and can literally kill everyone that comes on your path, and in the end you're left as a neutral fighting for themself and not stupid ideas. Being done with racism and religion, I've still got the science(fiction) aspect to explain. Ken Levine believes in the theory of parallel universes, and lets you use them as help throughout your adventures. That's it.\n\nNow if you really read this all through and didn't skip this pointless mumbo-jumbo like you should have, here's my rating for this game.\n\n\n\n123 Heads/123 coin flips, otherwise the game just wouldn't have worked, and Booker wouldn't have saved Elizabeth.","February 16","true","62.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The story isn't very good either, infact it's very, very bad. Its full of plot holes from begining to end. Why doesn't booker cover his hand when he relizes its a sign of the false sheperd? He makes no effort to conceal his hand it doesn't make any sense. also spoilers but why did elizibeth kill booker in the end? if it is infinite universes then wouldn't not matter in the end? wouldn't there just be a universe where he survives in fact there would be an infinite amount of universes where he survives meaning the ending is pointless and ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in every way. so the story and gameplay suck so far, but I will admit that the atmosphere is decent and for the most part I'd say its not great, not good but not bad by any definition.

There’s a little bit of all of those things but not enough to be meaningful or interesting. It’s rather belittling to the seriousness of the topics that are invoked that nothing is ever done with them. I endured the entirety of this game not caring about anything that happened.\n\nSeparate Bioshock Infinite from Ken Levine and Bioshock, and technically it is a fine game. Everything functions properly. Voice acting is OK. Little details in zones means there’s something cute around every corner. But these sorts of things don’t make a game a masterpiece. It just means the devs had the time and money.\n\nOn top of the muddled storytelling is the rather lackluster ending that gives the impression Levine simply tried to dress up what was already a terrible, half-♥♥♥♥♥ idea with pretentious intellectualism.\n\nI wish I had played the game everyone else seems to be raving about.","November 30, 2013","false","13.6"," 77 of 147 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","77","147","0","0"

Otherwise you may want to read this review to contrast the fanboy fawning from the industry and previous fans of the series.\n\nThis is my opinion: BioInf is a beautiful game, with mediocre gameplay where longer healthbars simulate difficulty, and a story that pretends to be deep while it's really mostly pretentious, chopped up, and doesn't "handle" and of the issues it briefly touches on. I could write you an essay about all the plot flaws; examples being blatantly ignoring huge character events, having Booker act like a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (and I mean extra everything total ♥♥♥♥♥♥ even in game terms) to make the story even more convoluted, and not keeping to their own in-universe laws. They introduce story elements like travel in time and between worlds in the multiverse, but don't seem to take into account the obvious consequences; for example, why does Booker assume that if they pass into a new world, his old deal with someone would be valid over there? And concerning all the deep issues it handles; you get hammered by racism, then all the black people go murderbrawl and you have to mindlessly shoot them all, is that what people mean by the game "handling big and important issues"?\n\nNow, I don't think BioInf is a worthless game; it can be fun at times. The intro is fantastically beautiful, for example. But if the question is simply: did I think it was worth my time and money spent? then my answer is no. The original idea of this game may have been brilliant, and the story complex and beautiful, but it feels like it's been compromised too many times in development, and consequently can't hold itself together. It may have benefited from not taking up quite so many "deep and important issues" and not branching out into quite so many things. It ends up trying very hard to be something it isn't: a good story.","January 4, 2014","false","13.6"," 41 of 77 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","41","77","0","0"

I'll start by saying that all of the amazing things shown in the E3 demos was cut for some reason and replaced by more basic and less interesting content.\nThe game itself is extremely linear run-and-gun, but slower and less convenient. Rather than explore a city, you get locked into small arenas with a circular railway circuit and are forced to fight a number of respawning enemies until a timer runs out and you're allowed to leave.\n\nThe complexity of levels is comparable to more faster-paced, more straightforward shooters like Serious Sam, but scaled up in size immensely, which while looks impressive, also means it takes ages to move down pretty basic paths. Exploration involves backtracking miles to find secret buttons or clues, meaning a bad hunch can waste over 20 minutes of walking (which happened to me a few times).\n\nCombat is run-and-gun, but slowed down with combat mechanics that are interesting at first (and I'm sure many gamers would love it), but for me gets jarring and annoying quickly. You get Elizabeth to spawn in infinite ammo boxes, minor barricades or friendly versions of NPCs to distract enemies (and no escape routes or secret passages as previously planned). You then use a basic 'stun' attack with the vigors and then shoot the enemy in their weak spot to kill them, and you have to do this a LOT and the pace of the game gets annoyingly slow as a result. Because you are expected very strongly to use the vigors, the guns are extremely unreliable. To make matters worse, you have only two weapon slots, you can only switch guns with dropped weapons, and ammo can completely vanish in certain areas, with many areas that strongly lean towards specific weapon types- which skews gameplay in many annoying and frustrating ways.\n\nStory was ok-ish, and the presentation of the story was certainly excellent. But again, compared to the trailers, nowhere near as good. The vibrant living atmosphere of a city full of paranoid psychos where Booker tries his best to blend in at his own peril when they could turn on him any minute? Wasn't there. After the opening sequence, the streets are deserted for the rest of the game except for the badguys (police or rebels) waiting to fight you and its a standard first-person shooter. Another problem is the majority of the story is delivered solely via voxophones (audio logs), which are mostly hidden and easily interrupted by scripted character speech, meaning the player must wait for a quiet spot, turn it on, and just sit around listening to it. Some in-world spoken information is easy to miss by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Overall, it's very easy to miss what is going on.\n\nOverall, it was a pity, as it could have been outstanding, and there is nothing in the game that is legitimately botched or crappy, and to its further credit, the drawbacks I listed were all fairly ambitious ideas and mechanics that I think many people will love (that I simply didn't), and never to poor or unimaginative design that plagues many other games.\n\nIf you think an approach like this, or a theatrical experience, is worthwhile in itself, and don't mind the gameplay style, then certainly buy it, if you're like me- maybe not.","November 26, 2013","false","21.0"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","23","42","0","0"

Is it?\n\nWell, no. It's possibly not onlt one of the most overrated games of all time, but probably one of the most boring AAA first person shooters ever released to boot.\n\nThe one thing the game has going for it is its phenominal art direction. This is promply ruined by some utterly hillarious character models, props and textures that look like something out of Quake 2. Who needs feet on a cahracter when you can just have flesh coloured matchboxes? Who needs barrels of fruit at a market when you can just have a low resolution texture of fruit put over a polygonal surface? And on top of all this it runs like absolute ♥♥♥♥, even on a relatively beefy rig like mine.\n\nNow, what about the gameplay? The grand irony of Bioshock Infinite is that it's heralded as a renaissance from all of those dumb, brainless corridor shooters spat out by big publishers for 12 year old boys, but is in reality unfathomably linear and brainless; more-so than the likes of COD. Enemies are brainless, incompletent bullet sponges who charge toward you like wooden targets for you to effortlessly mow down with your weedy, unsatisfying, royal-free sound effect guns. You might remember the original Bioshock for its ferocious and desperate combat. You won't find that here. You might also remember the brilliant plasmids from Bioshock and the variety they brought to the game. You won't find that here. Well, the plasmids are back (why a society of racial puritans would even think of permanently desecrating their bodies I'll never know (the secret society of crow people being a hillariously bad example which the game never explains)), but I'm not exagerating when I say they all do the exact same thing, just with different, console grade eye candy. One click to stun someone (with an easy instakill if you headshot him), or hold it for a trap (which is useless given the AI). Upgrades all consist of having said effect spread to multiple enemies. You'll probably only ever find yourself using the lightning plasmid.\n\nIn addition to all of this, instead of actually, say, balance and design their levels properly, the vast majority of the game will consist of you being unable to find ammo or items, but your parter tossing conveniently needed items in your direction every five seconds. And if that isn't bad enough, the game effectively eliminates any and all challenge by having absolutely no penalty for death. Yes, that's right, if you die, you just carry on as usual. You'll lose some money, but as you'll soon find it's utterly worthless as there's nothing you can spend it on that won't be pelted in your direction the second you need it.\n\nYet again, this renaissance of the FPS genre is actually even more casualised and patronising than even the dumbest of COD clones. BUT SERIOUSLY, GUYS! IT'S THE GREATEST GAME EVER MADE!\n\nThe final thing this game is primarily heralded for is its story. It's an emotional and political tour de force! It sets the standards of storytelling for every game that follows it! Well, I can safely say that's complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThe game is set in what is initially an enthralling and interesting universe of what is essentially Utah; an isolantionist state of religious puritans all brought together in their love for their prophet, of whom live in absolute luxury on the backs of slave labour and show utter disdain for whom they view as racially inferior. Eventually all hell breaks loose as the underclass revolts in a bloody civil war against their opressors. All the while you are sent to save a girl for a mysterious unexplained reason from this heavenly hellhole, of whom you then have to save.\n\nThe universe the game is set in is intially fascinating and deals with what appear to be some great themes; the metamorphasis of religion and government, a post-modernist interpretation of popular revolutions and their fall from grace from the years of hatred the populace has endured. But this is all quickly abandoned in favour of a multiverse plot.\n\nYes. Alternate universes.\n\nYou skip universes so much in the main story line that you wonder what the point in even being attached to anything going on is, as you're ultimately abandoning it five minutes after you even hear about it. And when it does go back to the themes it was obviously supposed to cover but forgot at the last minute, it does so in the most juvenile, brain dead, shallow manner.\n\nOH MY GOD! THEY'RE GOING TO PELT THAT INTERATIAL COUPLE WITH ROTTEN FRUIT!\n\nWell, that's quite literally about as far as the game covers racism. Mississipi Burning, this aint.\n\nOH MY GOD! THE LEADER OF THE REVOLUTION WANTS TO KILL A KID FOR NO APPARENT REASON! THE HORROR!\n\nAnimal Farm this isn't.\n\nAnd to top it all off, it ends in possibly the laziest "OMG SO DEEEEP" ending imaginable. You may remember Bioshock's (mostly) incredible ending/final act plot twist that revealed you to simply be a puppet of the game and those offering you guidance; both a great narrative plot twist, and a brilliant commentary on our own delusions of free will in what is purported to be a free environment where we make our own descisions, and gamer's general tendency to simply do as they're told because they're told to do it. The ending of this game, however, without spoilers, quite literally amounts to "what does doing anything even matter any way? You're just gonna die in the end anyway. ♥♥♥♥ it.". Kind of lazy for the Citizen Kane of FPS.\n\nUpon criticising the story, you'll likely be criticised for being too stupid to understand its brilliance, at which point the plot in its entirety will be explained to you. The problem is in proping up this game as a literary masterpiece, the fact that its a convoluted, non-sensical, 12 year old's fanfiction of a wreck of a story the fact that it's confusing, or has serious plot holes, or has the political intruige of the graffiti in the sixth form toilets, it's considered as "ambitious", or "deep", or a "poltiical commentary". It's really not any of those. If you find yourself confused at any point, it's not that the story is too complex for you, it's that it's just poorly written, cobbled together tripe.\n\nThe other grand irony of this game is the way Elizabeth is fawned over as some revolutionary, amazing female role model for video games. It's become incredibly common for pseudo-intellectual third wave feminism to be considered acceptable in gaming journalism (and as a convenient means of demonizing consumers and protecting massive corporations like the one that published this game), but I can't help but find it ironic that THIS character is an incredible female lead, when she's quite literally  a coddled, ignorant and clueless baby (not my criticism, it's a basic plot point of the game), who requires rescuing from a big prison from a big bad man, regardless of the fact SHE CAN BEND TIME AND SPACE TO HER WILL. Outside of the story she's relegated to a useless bumblbing idiot who throws health potions at you and cowers behind cover in combat, only using her incredible powers when you tell her to. Yep, you've never heard a female character being criticsed for being useless for these reasons before, have you?\n\nThere's an awful lot wrong with this game, and an awful lot wrong with the people who love it so much. Criticising it will often lead you to be swarmed with gaggles of fanboys telling you to "GO BACK TO COD YOU 12 YEAR OLD!". It's a shame they're so unaware of themselves that they don't realise that they're playing something with worse gameplay, worse graphics, worse story, and worse replayability than even COD.\n\nPerhaps worth it for your own curiousity, but it's far from the second coming of Jesus that the gaming press declares it to be, and it's definitely not worth your time or money if you want a game that's actually competent in the areas a game should be competent in.","December 7, 2013","false","12.2"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","23","42","0","2"

When you would round a corner and see a group of enemies or a Big Daddy and then mentally prepare on how to tackle it. You could lay down some mines or trip wire, stay close to a puddle of water to electrocute your prey and just have a variety of well planned destruction at your disposal.

What you're presented with is a story that dissects culture as we've come to know. A brainwashed patriotism powered by slavery and a bunch of other somewhat touchy areas throughout history. Racism is thrown up at every corner, and it feels like it fits for an early 1900's era.You can still see some of the overzealous Christian overtones and theme they shove down your throat, for story telling purposes. The graphics are beautiful and colorful with the vivid image of Red, White, and Blue painting the sky and interiors of all the places you'll come to see.

If you bought this on sale you may very well get your money's worth, just see yourself as paying for a really damn good story. Just remember, there's always a lighthouse, there's always a man, and there's always a city. You'll know it when you need to.","March 26, 2014","true","18.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Unlike Rapture's idealiser, Columbia's had little imposing density in his character.\n\nBut BioShock is not entirely about its self-righteous and paradoxical authority personalities, and Infinite shines outside this conceptual bubble. In spawning a more ancient, more morally delusional - and picturesque - society, the game becomes more satirical, thus more interesting to add to. A vivid city, Columbia exposes the illnesses of the American "Thule", so to speak. Over those clouds lurks a shadow of disguised hate and disciplined stupidity, much like the idealisation of national rights of John Gast's Columbia and the dangerous romanticising of the Manifest Destiny. Only this time, America went airborne, not westwards.\n\nInfinite triumphs on this premise. As it unfolds - so subtly -, its characters become less of casual citizens and more of monsters, just as its astonishing streets become filthy paths exposed by rebellious graffiti and mauled bodies. Its beautiful design and graphics provide the eye with constant awe, as though those bright windows and doorways far into the sky were veritable man-made stars. It is a joy to witness the game's visual ascension as you attempt Elizabeth's "rescue" and learn more about that floating pseudo-paradise.\n\nOh, and speaking of Elizabeth. Although I expected more than an almost quintessential damsel in distress, voice acting and writing often gave me hope; and her background, fears and convictions throughout the story - not to mention her in-game functions, tacit but exciting as they are - forced me to think back to previous milestones of the story and look at the whole scenario from a standpoint which was not that of Booker DeWitt's. That was unique, I have got to say.\n\nBioShock Infinite may not cause as much thematic bewitchment or those dialogue goose pimples, but it offers decent food for thought; which is the safe haven of the series. Its virtue may not lie in character conception or in the renewal of the plasmid feature, for example, but its well-paced and extremely pleasurable gameplay, its audiovisual style, its sidekick system and its plotline premise hold consistency to the end of the chapter, refusing to even steer close to collapse. The BioShock name, though currently with a relatively uncertain future, still shines.","September 25, 2014","true","36.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Since then, I have always been drawn to games that were simple, straightforward adventure games that sent a message or told me a story along the way. As gaming has evolved, especially within the past five years, it seems that titles that completely immerse the player in the world the developer created are becoming harder and harder to come by. Bioshock Infinite is one of these rare commodities in a gaming scene dominated by flashy graphics, visceral combat, but no story or atmosphere. The second that I laid eyes on the floating city of Columbia, I knew I had found a rare gem, a diamond in the rough of first person shooters. Atmosphere; that is the word that describes this game through and through. Every scene in the game, every citizen of Columbia oozes it, and this is what keeps the game engaging. I find that it is difficult to really stick with a game if it does not have the atmosphere to initially grab the players attention. While big titles like Assassins Creed or Fallout may have good stories, they still do not have that initial pull that makes the player want to discover more about the world they are playing in. But the game doesn't simply end with atmosphere, not by a long shot. Within the first hour of gameplay, you are flung into a story that, despite the fact that you know nothing about the character you play or why you are in the beautiful city in the sky in the first pace, keeps you hooked. In fact, it may be because of this ignorance that the story is so engaging. The thrill of finding out what lies around the next corner, what may happen to you and your companion as the story unfolds, this is the second beauty of Bioshock Infinite. While the combat and other game mechanics may not be quite as engaging as some other mainstream titles, those things aren't the focus of this game. If you ask me, this lack of focus on gameplay and combat is actually a breath of fresh air. Sure, the combat is engaging enough to be enjoyable at times, but I was glad to see that the developers didn't get caught up in making the rugged, battle worn Booker Dewitt into a second-time veteran, and second-dimension character, but rather spent their efforts making him a fully fleshed-out character, with motives and desires. I will avoid talking about the other characters for the sake of not spoiling the story for those of you who haven't played it, but I will say this: there is a reason this game is my favorite game of all time, and I really hope that this will be yours, too.","June 4, 2015","true","72.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","2"

The best way to start this review is by breaking down the franchise itself a bit: The 1st Bioshock was a masterpiece of a game and a legendary PS3/360 generation, 6 years after a legend was born, the legend's worthy successor is also born (let's not count Bioshock 2, shall we?) Bioshock Infinite effectively ends the console generation with a definite boom! It's memorable in every single aspect from gameplay, to A.I (the A.I is not flawless, but it's pretty good) to the story as well...\nStarting the review itself, it's best to get the graphics out of the way: the graphics are great, there are some jaggy stuff but nothing that ruins the overall quality of the game.\nMoving to the Art-Style: It's fantastic, Columbia is full of vibrant colors and knocks most other FPSs completely out of the park! Bioshock Infinite is very colorful and the art-style is very distinct. I love it!\nAtmosphere: How immersed in the game are you depends on you, but the game really tries for you to get immersed, the presentation is amazing, I dare to say it's the second best presentation in video game history after the first Bioshock! During the presentation when Columbia is first seen, a piano solo is played and it's incredibly appropriate and beatiful! Stuff like that just doesn't match other video games in any shape of form!\nAtmosphere in this game is so unique that it needs even more to be discussed! I warn you, the next part IS NOT a spoiler! It's an optional activity during the middle of the game, it's not even in a linear path, you have to search a bit to find this "moment". Anyways, during a part in the middle of the game, you can head to a basement where a little poor hungry kid (who looks like sh*t, I mean, very poor clothing, dirty as a pig, really poor boy! You feel sorry for him to be honest, at least I did...) is trying to reach a few oranges on the top of a platform that is too high for him. When you appear, the kid gets scared and hides under the wooden staircase. That's when the "thing happens", if you want, you will grab a guitar and start playing, at the same moment, Elizabeth start singing "Will the Circle be Unbroken?" (same song sang in the credits of the game) and grabs one of teh oranges and while she is singing, she offers the "not-so scared-now" kid the orange, at that same moment I had a huge flashback to my childhood when I saw those awesome Disney movies, like Snow-White or Beauty and the Beast.  This is clearly one of the best moments of the game and shows how much PERSONALITY it has! And just blows everything I've played until now out of the park in terms of atmosphere, absolutely fantastic and memorable moment!\nI guess atmosphere is done here, so moving to the gameplay: Very unique and fun! Now, instead on the plasmid powers, you have the called Vigors, which are pretty much the same, There are a grand total of 8 vigors, all of them very unique but some are pretty pointless, but I know some friends who used those same "useless" vigors the most, so I guess the vigors suit your playstyle, which makes every person's experience unique, which is very nice! Instead of Mana (or EVE Hypo) in Bioshock, in Infinite you have the called "Salts".\nThe gunplay is...awesome as well! The guns sound and feel VERY nice! The shotgun in particular looks like God slamming his house door shut. When I was going from a place to the other I would randomly shoot a shotgun round just to hear and feel it again, because how powerful it feels! A rarity for shotguns to feel this good in gaming! I recall some very powerful-feeling shotguns, but like this one, I can't really remember any shotgun at all that feels this meaty!\nThe vigors are very useful in combat and will save your life a lot of times, mostly in the hardest difficulties.\nThere are also many upgrade vending machines, which let you upgrade your guns, your vigors and let you buy ammo, salts, health, etc.\nThe A.I is also very good and most of the time they have a counter to everything, which makes you assemble various strategies to the various enemies that you face during your "journey". Handymen (Infinite's Big daddys) won't allow you escape using the skylines, they will quickly electrify the skylines so that you can't use them.\nThe enemies take cover well, react well to your position and the animation quality is very good as well.\nNow going to the best part of the game: the story! Holy ♥♥♥♥, the story! The game takes place in the year 1912 and starts with you, Booker DeWitt (awesome name!) a former Pinkerton Agent that got in some nasty sh*t (like gambling debts), assigned to go to a lighthouse (Bioshock anyone?) and get a girl named Elizabeth to "Wipe away the debt" (yeah...you will hear this sentence a lot of times during this game...), and so the game begins with Booker, on a self-redeeming journey to get his life back on the track. Sadly, stuff gets progressively weirder from the moment Booker lands in Columbia (which is gorgeous and one of the most beautiful places i've seen in any game, ever!) which is pretty enough to make you go "wow" "ah" very oftenly...\nThe story is very well done. I've heard many idiots complain that it's very confusing, but they haven't reached the ending. The game's story is confusing until the end because it tries to put you in Booker's place, because, trust me, he's confused as f*ck with all the stuff that is happening around him! The ending consists in 20 minutes of shoving info in your face and clears all the foggy story until the end. Some people didn't like how the end was just 15 to 20 minutes of information after information, personaly I really enjoyed and I think it made sense when looking at the story as a whole.\nTo understand better the story I also recommend you search like a mad man for the voxophones, because they play a meaningful role in understanding the story.\nThe game also has a few "Secondary Objectives" which aren't all that many but they are very helpful, mainly because of the reward they give (mostly Infusion which allows you to upgrade your max health, max salts capacity and max shield capacity.)\nI have also to warn you to NOT skip the credits! Because more at the end, there is a scene in real life where the voice actors of Booker and Elizabeth play/sing that song that I mentioned at the start/middle of this review. That is a very fun and nice moment to watch, Ken Levine is also there.\nAfter the credits end, there will be a little scene where you gain control of Booker again.\nI played the game 2 times and I still want to play a third time! That is basically unique for me! After one playthrough and I'm done! The Normal is very easy, I recommedn you play on Hard first! My second playthorugh was on the hardest difficulty avaliable (the 1999 Mode) Which isn't just "Very hard", no! It doesn't allow you to use the navigation aid and it is particularly hard!\nI guess I covered everything about this game, probably the only thing left is the flaws of this game... which are pretty much none... Maybe a bug here and there where one enemy would just stand there and do nothing (very easy headshots :P) but they are very rare and they won't really break away your experience, at all!\nAll in all, this game is pretty much flawless and fun as hell to play, I got extremely immersed in this game and it's, for me, the main contender for Game of The Year of 2013 (and no, The Last of Us isn't better, it's a decent game, but certainly not better than Bioshock Infinite) and I doubt it will be beaten, maybe by Call of Duty: Ghos...pffff *laughs*, yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed that it will be 2013's GOTY, congrats Irrational, you made another Masterpiece and Ken Levine, you smart ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you are a freakin genius! This is easily a:\n\n10/10!!!!!

Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth's characters are so unique and engaging that it instantly captures ones attention and enthralls you. You play as the main character (DeWitt), and Elizabeth is your companion. You may be thinking "Oh great another pointless npc who will get in the way." WRONG Elizabeth is crucial to almost all aspects in the game including gun fights. To me, Elizabeth isn't just some pretty face or a damsel in distress--she is the best damn wingman to ever don a dress. There are also a wide variety of new guns and plasmids, err vigors, at your disposal to use that were very much needed in comparison to its' predecesors choice of weaponry. I will stop now before I reveal too much more as I could still go on about this game. Let me just reiterate that this is indeed well worth every last penny you put into this game. At the very least, you should give it a shot at some point in your life, even if you must borrow it from a friend. ~Buy. Now.~","May 6, 2014","true","39.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","5"

Since then, I have always been drawn to games that were simple, straightforward adventure games that sent a message or told me a story along the way. As gaming has evolved, especially within the past five years, it seems that titles that completely immerse the player in the world the developer created are becoming harder and harder to come by. Bioshock Infinite is one of these rare commodities in a gaming scene dominated by flashy graphics, visceral combat, but no story or atmosphere. The second that I laid eyes on the floating city of Columbia, I knew I had found a rare gem, a diamond in the rough of first person shooters. Atmosphere; that is the word that describes this game through and through. Every scene in the game, every citizen of Columbia oozes it, and this is what keeps the game engaging. I find that it is difficult to really stick with a game if it does not have the atmosphere to initially grab the players attention. While big titles like Assassins Creed or Fallout may have good stories, they still do not have that initial pull that makes the player want to discover more about the world they are playing in. But the game doesn't simply end with atmosphere, not by a long shot. Within the first hour of gameplay, you are flung into a story that, despite the fact that you know nothing about the character you play or why you are in the beautiful city in the sky in the first pace, keeps you hooked. In fact, it may be because of this ignorance that the story is so engaging. The thrill of finding out what lies around the next corner, what may happen to you and your companion as the story unfolds, this is the second beauty of Bioshock Infinite. While the combat and other game mechanics may not be quite as engaging as some other mainstream titles, those things aren't the focus of this game. If you ask me, this lack of focus on gameplay and combat is actually a breath of fresh air. Sure, the combat is engaging enough to be enjoyable at times, but I was glad to see that the developers didn't get caught up in making the rugged, battle worn Booker Dewitt into a second-time veteran, and second-dimension character, but rather spent their efforts making him a fully fleshed-out character, with motives and desires. I will avoid talking about the other characters for the sake of not spoiling the story for those of you who haven't played it, but I will say this: there is a reason this game is my favorite game of all time, and I really hope that this will be yours, too.","June 4, 2015","true","72.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","2"

Its successor, BioShock Infinite, takes us to a new world that is superficially just as captivating as Rapture, but the similarities are purely superficial. Where BioShock had ideas, Infinite simply has plot devices. Where BioShock asked us to choose, Infinite just asks us to run and shoot.\n\nPart of what made BioShock special was that its ideas, emotions, story content, and gameplay were all coherent in a thematically consistent way. Ultimately BioShock told a story that was thematically compatible, and even thematically harmonious, with the conceits and conventions of FPS games. BioShock Infinite tries to tell a story, but the dissonance between the narrative/emotional content and the gameplay content is jarring in the new installment. It doesn't help that the story, though told with exquisite craft and care, ultimately is for all its artistry utterly inane.\n\nWith a story that is so thoroughly undermined by the gameplay mechanics, Infinite needs to lean heavily on gameplay to be entertainment. Unfortunately, like BioShock, Infinite is merely a competent shooter from a gameplay perspective. Worse, the level designs are now more linear.\n\nIn sum, it's a competent but underwhelming game, and outright disappointing when set against its predecessor.","June 27, 2014","false","12.1"," 43 of 81 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","43","81","0","3"

On top of the innovative gameplay Irrational and 2K do an exceptional job of creating beautiful environments, and constructing a polished narrative and pulling off an excellent story. Infinite might bear a lot of differences compared to its predecessors in the Bioshock franchise, but the story and atmosphere is the icing on the cake. Infinite’s Inception-esque conclusion will have players on the edge of their computer chairs and then continue on to blow their minds.\n\nOverall Irrational and 2K, as always worked up an amazing title worthy of winning many game of the year awards. Not incorporating an excessively fun completive or cooperative multiplayer modes are the only gripes that comes to mind. Not to worry. Due to excellent DLC releases I think Bioshock Infinite has the potential to keep audiences hooked and wanting more of Columbia for quite some time. Bioshock Infinite comes neck and neck with its original predecessor in this outstanding series.\n\nIf you’re looking for a great single player experience with stellar visuals, and some of the best story telling the videogame market has to offer, don’t pass up a chance to enjoy Bioshock Infinite!

The firefights were uninspired bouts of you against massive bullet sponges.  There is little incentive to use your elemental powers as the enemies are easily defeated without.  The combat seems to encourage the use of cover, however it lacks a key component: usable cover.  Each fight is approached the same way, and although the game lets you use your powers to place traps, you will almost never find yourself in a place to use them.  Each fight is a head-on bout of how many bullets of your seemingly infinite supply it will take to progress in the story.\n\nspeaking of the story, it has no focus.  In the beginning, it is a portrayal of a society in the clouds full of religious bigotry and racism.  It soon turns into a completely pointless display of how much Ken Levine knows about theoretical physics, apparently just enough to think he knows what he's doing when he has really only scratched the surface.  Although at times interesting, by the end it does not make sense with itself and still baffles the community and even Levine himself.  The story will leave you feeling empty, as it makes no remark on the social injustice happening in columbia.\n\nThe game tries to do too many stories and fails to complete them effectively, making the whole game feel both unguided and lazily put together.  If there was a more clear direction as to where they wanted to go with the story, it would have been at least redeemable in that aspect.  The gameplay should be completely revamped, as the actual first-person-shooter aspect is neither fun nor rewarding.  Every weapon uninspired, every special ability almost pointless to use.\n\nBioshock: Infinite gets a 2/5","December 31, 2013","false","33.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There were promised stealth, Plasmids (at that time they were usable together with the weaponry, as it was clearly intended from the beginning and how it was starting from BioShock 2)...\n\nBut the most important thing they promised was freedom. We were promised Rapture - the place where is no god (linear design), no king (scripted scenes that are required to proceed), only man - the player!\n\n"It's all about choice, it's all about options." - Ken Levine\n"It's all dynamic, none of this is scripted["http]" - Ken Levine\n\nNow, what we see in the game that was released to the market? An Xbox-crippled corridor shooter with the plot full of self-irony about no freedom at all. And do you remember why the Teleport Plasmid was cut out? Because it would let the player to avoid scripts that made the whole game instead of AI and game world.\n\nBut that was okay. It was a good, very good Xbox-crippled corridor shooter. I like it very much even like this.\n\nBut years passed, and we moved many kilometers up. Project Icarus a.k.a. BioShock Infinite. We were promised free exploration on the dynamic city in the sky (while fleeing the free-roaming Songbird and hiding from him). We were promised civil war["http] and ability to participate. We were promised all-new vigor system with separate charges for each of them, lots of choices["https] and really groovy abilities (just look at that telekinesis gun use!). Just for protocol: I know these trailers are fully scripted, but the were a promise the developers made to all customers of the first release.\n\nAnd what we see now? We see good graphics. Is that all? Yes, it is. Vigors turned out worse than Plasmids, the only big change was inability to store hypos and inability to get "one use while there is still some EVA", the principle that was the foundation of Hypnotize Big Daddy price and overall Vigors are weaker and bleaker than Plasmids (so what we can make a trap from almost each of them? I would gladly trade this ability for Security Beacon and Natural Camouflage. And oh, Telekinesis. We don't have it anymore). Also, we don't have as much weapon choice: No additional ammunition, no upgrades, only two guns to have - Keep It Simple and Stupid. But do you think it was the worst thing?\nI don't I think the worst thing was the fact that when in the first BioShock we at least had some choice that affected at least the ending, now we have none. throw or not was not a choice, you couldn't do neither. Cage of bird? It didn't affect anything than the neck of Elisabeth that you can never see up close as she avoids aim reticule.\nAnd the epic plot about the fate of Floating city became a story of interdementional, but all the more petty squabble about parental rights with both of the fathers being crazy, stubborn and stupid.\n\nI must still admit - this one isn't always a corridor shooter. At times it is a different type of FPS - a bridge shooter, where you make a step to the side and faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall.\n\nI sincerely believe that if Andrew Ryan were with us, he would surely ask the developers:\n"Are you men or slaves of a machine["https]?"","January 1, 2014","false","36.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The main complaint I have with BioShock Infinite are its two contrasting themes of parallel dimensions mixed in with themes of religiousism, idolfication, the constitution of the United States of America, sexism, hedonism and people in black sheep's clothing, it does too much. There is no separate transition from this main theme towards the other themes of tears, parallel dimensions Elizabeth can will by the power of her memories.  If this was removed the game would be so much better.\n\nLet's get down to the breakdown of the game.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay as others have mentioned I am sure already is the repetitive gunplay. There are many situations where you are forced through the in-game script to pick-up weapons you may not want to use in the situations they make you use them in. This is problematic in one of the toughest battles later in the game against warships, zepplins. The guns however do feel nice to use. The sounds of them might be a little unrealistic or barely noted to pay attention to.\n\nStory:\nThis is my largest complaint with the game , even more so then the repetitive gameplay without much variation. Much of the game is told through kinetoscopes which tell majority of the story through a type of film projected roll of film in black-white old cinematic style. However, the story is better presented through non-verbal actions when you meet Elizabeth and when she interacts with you within the world she was trapped in. However, you as an outsider don't understand everything that Elizabeth understands and knows about the world in which she lives in as an insider. This is why they had to put parallel dimensions in this game to make sense of both an insider and outsider perspective of the situations at hand. However, it is poorly executed and done.\n\nReligion:     Many of you that are not religous or even Christian for that matter will not understand some of the biblical references to the garden of eden, Sodom of Gomorrah and washing away the debt of sins. However, without spoiling the story too much, one guy comes to you and says you can wash away the debt of your sins if you give your own daughter away; though, it is really unclear if it is yours or Elizabeth when she was a girl. I assumed it was Elizabeth since she is the one they wanted to take Lady Comstock's place in the end .\n\nThemes:\n\nIdolfication: The story takes place in the early 1900's. There are points in the game where you enter in upon factory workers being enslaved and  people are  being tortured for heresy against a rising secular cult of people that are not following the true Gospel of God. Everyone in this game is blinded by idolfication. Even the people who follow Comstock, they are just his followers; nothing more. He is the actual false prophet in the game, though they frame you as the AntiChrist when instead you play the role of Jesus. Your job is not to minister to people but to tell them that they are wrong about following this skeptical guy Comstock and his teachings. He is the one that actually should be accused of heresy. However, during this time, Columbia is promised an eternal state of Heaven. However, they believe it has to be done through a human sacrifice of Elizabeth through the baptism of Booker De Witt.\n\nRacisim: They have black and white wash stations characteristic of slavery days. There are various jargon and little things I will not be going over as that would spoil the game's experience for you. Take note that there is much racisim and questions regarding the philosophies of the world along with branding people's names of the last sins they have commited upon death. If it takes place in the 1900's sins should be wiped away through Jesus Christ. Ultimately they believe Booker is the AntiChrist. Yet in many parallel dimensions he is seen as the hero and savior of the world of Columbia.\n\nOverall: Do I think Christians should play this game though it stands as one of the most controversial triple AAA games out there currently in the bounds of the Christian worldview and modern world? Yes I think you should. This game teaches you what the nation is like and the times we live in today with modernisim using parallel dimensions and universes as the main driving point and vehicle for the message. It shows you both the good and bad things of religion. What works right when religion is performed in a manner based on biblical teachings, then what goes wrong when those biblical teachings are reprimanded when man's leadership is based on the teachings of our country's founders.\n\n6/10 Only because many games don't have the courage to discuss idolfication, racisim, sexism and politics in a worldly sphere and through alternative realities relating to the secular realities of men and women on this earth. Even though the game is just your average shooter, it is worth at least for you to check it out for yourself.","March 27","true","21.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

"I am a bad man" "No you're not a bad man." *Killing about twenty people* "Are you a bad man?" "That guy is a bad man." "That guy is a bad man."\n\nBioshock Infinite wants to be a game about the nature of "what-if" and choice, framed in a story about ex-military officer Booker DeWitt sent to a mystical city in the clouds to rescue the mysterious waif Elizabeth, whose strange world-altering powers and sheltered childhood lends itself to an unfolding narrative of mutual cooperation; encouraging the player to care for an NPC as the two of you battle an unjust world out to get you.\n\nWhat it *is*, is a game about shooting dudes in the face. Lots of them, in hectic combat where you tend to get disoriented a lot and your low health and lack of carriable healing items causes you to run around from cover to cover like a headless chicken looking for that precious popcorn or abandoned soda to boost your all-too-fragile health. And when the red mist is over you are left with a pile of dead police officers and ordinary, well-intentioned people convinced you are a bad guy. Which, after having killed about twenty of them, you kind of sort of feel like. Racists they may be, but nothing in-game ever convinced me these people *needed* to die, and especially not in such crude, gore-tastic manners.\n\nBioshock Infinite has a real issue with story-and-gameplay integration: The story and presentation leaves me ill-motivated to care about the main characters or anything they do. The gameplay, even if it had been better (it is certainly the weakest of the Bioshock games to date, sacrificing the last vestiges of System Shock on the altar of Call of Duty) creates a sharp divide between the themes of caring for someone and cooperating with them and killing endless hordes of very human cannon fodder with nary a thought; apparently only the hopes and dreams of the main character are worth diving into. Booker's dismissing of practically everything about this magical cloud wonderland he finds himself in, or his refusal to engage in any form of self-reflection about himself or his actions, certainly don't help matters.\n\nIn fact, if I may be so bold I might say this game's core excellence is as a showpiece for the ideas promoted by Spec Ops: The Line. Do I feel like a hero yet? No, Bioshock Infinite. No, I do not.","June 25, 2014","false","8.0"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","25","46","0","2"

It tries to tackle some social and existential questions, provide entertaining gameplay, and wrap it all up in an emotionally moving package. Unfortunately, the game's polish belies its shallow depth.\n\nThe gunplay brings absolutely nothing new to the table. While the addition of Sky-Lines was an interesting idea, the implementation reduces it mostly to a form of locomotion, rather than a primary form of combat. The game provides challenge through tough, not intelligent enemies, especially on later difficulties where several headshots may be necessary for a simple grunt.\n\nAs for the story, it attempts to bring in elements of multiverse theory and explores ideas of choice and consequence for each of the characters in the game. However, in doing so, it contradicts itself several times over in its conclusion. I won't spoil that here; there are several videos you can watch to see the ending, along with interpretations if you wish.\n\nWhile the game paints a pretty picture and plays a few nice tunes, it fails to sufficiently answer many of the questions the early portions will give you.

Well, it doesn't call it magic, but it's the same idea. You're a private investigator who can't investigate for ♥♥♥♥ and gets pulled along by the undertow of fate and personalities in the universe. And that's just fine. You can switch between two kinetic weapons out of quite a few in the game ranging from pistols to RPGs. Some are better than others, and at one point the overvariety of similar weapons gets a bit overbearing. You also have the power of 'vigors' (spells). I find these similar to the weapons in that there are some stand-outs that I love using but many fall into the "me-too" category, particularly those that are only obtained late in the game. The very first vigor, possession, is by far the most useful and fun in general combat situations. There is also a grusome (if fun) melee attack that tends to become obsolete early due to the prevelence of guns unless you find the right gear to improve it when more difficult enemies appear.\n\nThe most similar aspect to the HL2 series is your companion, Elizabeth, who assists you for much of the game. Unlike Alyx in the aformentioned series, Elizabeth doesn't engage in (and outshine you at) combat. Instead she will throw items to the player and effectively act as an engineer by pulling turrents and other defensive items out of her tear. Oh, tears... those are "rips in dimensional time and space, revealing an alternate universe, which does not exist in the current world." Don't worry, it makes sense in context. While Elizabeth's role could be otherwise filled, she is useful in combat and does not require guarding, a good choice by the devs.\n\nShe's a compelling character that is the real star of the story, not the player controlled 'Booker." And the story is quite good, though it's confusing at times and feels like it has a few aborted endings. Most of the time it's compelling, though, and makes you want to keep playing to find out what's going on through the time loops and dimensional warps that occur. The ending is a powerful gut punch, and not wishy-washy at all. There are some choices in the game, but none matter. Or perhaps they all matter, but none can alter the ending- further explanation would be spoilerish and get into the philosophy of determinism. There are plot holes, as with any story that involves some sort of time/space warp, but it's a good story with a puncuated ending that I needed to sit back and recover from afterwards.  Then I quickly restarted so I could get back to the more carefree portions of the game and also start to see the events from the hindsight of knowing how everything plays out. There's a lot of backstory lying unobtrusively around for those who want to look for it in a playthrough.\n\nCons include an awful save system (this is 2015, why can't we figure this out?) and a couple of portions of the game that are too repetitive with no payoff.\n\nI'd say the game is a steal at sale prices under $30.\n\nI didn't play the first bioshock but I think it might be a good time to pick it up...","November 29, 2013","true","82.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I do however feel that it is a fantastic piece of art. The environments are gorgeous, and exploring Colombia were rather enjoyable. Also the story was well told and quite moving despite some gaps in continuity. However that's the extent of its positive qualities.\n\nAs game it fails to be challenging, even on Hard mode the combat is incredibly trivial. Elizabeth can keep you feed with an infinite supply of ammo, health, and salts, which you don't even need because you can just kill everything with the skyhook. Aside from the combat the game was incredibly linear, with very few secrets, and of those that did exist none really provided any substantial benefit because the combat was so easy to begin with.\n\nAnd again back to the problems with it being so linear, I can't help but compare it to the first Bioshock, which was also linear, however at least had multiple endings. With Bioshock: Infinite there is one ending, and honestly it's not that good. For a game that has a theme of infinite worlds with infinite possibilities you have only one ending? Really?\n\nTo sum it all up it's just not a good game; like I said the story was pretty good, but the combat is poor, and the player cannot change the outcome of the ending. In terms of gameplay it's more like Myst or Riven than a shooter. It's just a beautiful enviornment to explore. However, unlike Myst or Riven, Bioshock: Infinate is devoid of any choice or challenge. Overall I'd have to say that you would probably be better off just watching all the cutscenes on youtube, because it would make a better movie than a game.","January 3, 2014","false","9.5"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","26","48","0","0"

And the game is very pretty but you are on rails most of the time so the levels often feel plastic and static (like a Doom level but with modern smoke and flare effects).  So, you are left with obviously demarked shooting areas and then a cutscene --  rinse, repeat.  The shooting is frenetic but not very strategic.   You can swap out your abilities at any time which sounds like fun but it quickly becomes apparent that the differing abilities often amount to the exact same thing.  It is far too easy to hide and shoot thru every dang level.  As a point of reference and as shooters go?   I would still play the first Far Cry over this game.      In that old game, fighting was strategic and varied and the large levels offered tactical choices.    Bottomline -- "Infinite" is sadly a C+ game with an A- story.","December 7, 2013","false","10.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The result is that I am not one of of hte many fans of the game. Now, please ignore this review if you are a fan of bioshock, this may indeed anger you.\nOk. First off, I want to say that yes this game has a great story. the story is simple but is a well done story that has some scifi elements that made me say, I want to see a bit more. The ending is really good as it deals with a twist that was kinda unseen in the game. The characters, though likeable, I would say a bit forgetable. The characters I think are more memorable is the twins, who are pretty funny because they have a bit of the "out of this world" characteristic that you can enjoy. Elizabeth, the main female protagonist does indeed seems to be a very like able character, though not exactly a outstanding character as people would make her to be.\nHowever, the biggest problem with the game is the game, which I'm sorry to say, is subpar. Originally, I though that the original game wasn't that interesting to me because the combat system was too easy and too dull for me to continue playing the game. In Bioshock Infinite, I felt that combat felt less impressive than the first game. Fewer weapons and limits to what weapons you can have often drives me nuts when playing games. It even worst that the guns feel less impactful and that combat also felt like a chore for me. The only weapons that felt good to use were the pistols, revolver and the Air Grabber.\nThe special abilities that you collect are also a real dull choice as it's possible to only use 1 or 2 of them throughout the game without even using others more than one moment.\nThe enemies in the game are also a real annoyance, Some enemies, such as the RPG and Handy man, felt really overpowered and that the hints given about the handy man's weak point do not even result in doing any damage. The Ghost level is what I considered the worst level becauuse of how poorly done it is and how even the objective pointer after the 2nd tear was extremely broken because they only lead you aroudn the whole map.\nOverall, despite the great story, I cannot say this game is considerd a 9s or even the 10s that it recieved. I wasnt' surprised to see this game get awards at all. Overall, this game isnt' not the game we need or want.","December 11, 2013","false","10.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The main issue I had was I got all 3 Bioshocks, never played them until now, so I ran through all 3 of them and Infinite is clearly the weak link and it's really not a Bioshock game....\n\nThe first 2 create this atmosphere and semi suspenseful style of gameplay. Creeping around this dark ruined city under the ocean filled with psychos and genetic freaks. You can hear them shouting their crazy phrases and your sitting there wondering "Where the hell are they?!". Every time you encounter a Big Daddy instantly what came to my mind was "Awwww ♥♥♥♥♥t. Here we go!". But in Infinite honestly it was NOTHING like the older games. Your wandering around a bright city killing random soldiers and every day people. Nothings even remotely suspenseful or similar to the first 2 games in any way shape or form. There are no Big roaming sort of bosses like in the first 2 with Big Daddies.\n\nIt's basically just arena gameplay which I never played Call of Duty but it definitely felt like a generic shooter. Just run into an area and start shooting. You can clearly see they lost any element of suspense with the ridiculous introduction of a damn shield. That completely ruins any aspect of surprise because if someone catches me off guard who cares..... It didn't break through my shield and actually hurt me. What's worse is everythings shared through just generic money. Want to upgrade your powers? Use money..... Want to upgrade that weapon? Use money. Non of the upgrades ever had any actual impact on your weapons appearance like the old games. I found it hillarious using a double chamber revolver shotgun in the old ones that totes electricity through the chambers. This one you can't even hold more than 2 weapons. So why would I even care about these weapons which I'm going to have to keep swapping in and out? I can choose a favorite but this area calls for a Sniper rifle so I have to ditch one of my favorites and oh look Elizabeth tossed me a sniper rifle.\n\n\n\nI can rant forever but it's just.... .... not Bioshock. The story tries to be clever and almost mirror the events of the first game in a vague sense. But the story is just generic and kind of pretentious.","December 15, 2013","false","14.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The story consists of plot twists for no reason other than to have plot twists, regardless of the mess it makes of the narrative, or what messages it ends up conveying. One character has the special ability to literally tear holes in the plot. As the "alternate universes" angle comes in, any reason to care about the characters goes out the window - if they're all alternate versions, with alternate realities, why care about any of them? Why is one reality/timeline objectively better, or more valid, than any other?\n\nOn top of that, the gameplay is frankly boring. It does absolutely nothing to advance the shooter genre - on the contrary it's bland and derivative.\n\nIt is VERY pretty though, I'll give it that.\n\n------SPOILERS BELOW------\n\nWhen I say "The story consists of plot twists for no reason other than to have plot twists, regardless of the mess it makes of the narrative, or what messages it ends up conveying" I'm referring to the Vox Populi turning on you.\n\nThe game starts out with the premise that you're fighting against some really awful people, really vile racists and bigots. By introducing the plot twist that you must now fight the Vox Pop, though the developers almost certainly did not intend it, what their game is now saying is "You know who the REAL evil people are? They're not really the oppressors, they're the downtrodden minorities!" It's an absurd position to take, and it's an absurd situation to be in. There is no justification for having to fight the people you've been fighting to save, other than it being a hackneyed "shocking" plot twist just for the sake of having a plot twist.\n\nYou can tell that at least one person at 2K had an inkling that this might be the case because before you have to fight them the Vox Pop are mostly black folks, but you only ever fight Irish folks. You can tell because it would make the offensive absurdity of the situation starkly obvious if the second half of the game was all about massacring black people!\n\n"♥♥♥♥ minorities, up with Whitey" obviously wasn't what 2K had in mind when they set out to make this game. But because whoever wrote the plot didn't stop and think that is what their creation says.\n\nThen there's simple, silly things it does to the plot. We jump through a portal into an alternate universe after failing to save the weapons dealer. Ok, so how does it help anything at all to defeat Comstock in this new universe? We've still left behind a universe where he wins. Why is this new universe objectively any different?\n\nWhy does Booker ultimately drowning himself change anything at all? He's just ONE iteration of Booker; why does the death of that universe's Booker have any impact on any others?","December 20, 2013","false","14.7"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","26","48","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quyzbuk/recommended/8870/","Quyzbuk","Quyzbuk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quyzbuk/","269 products in account","tl;dr: EXTREMELY overrated game, if you want a Bioshock experience, look back to the first or second installments, this one is not worth your time or money.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is for the base game, I do not own, and will not purchase any DLC for this mess of a "Bioshock" game.\n\nI had pre-ordered this at the very last second because I wanted to see some critic reviews first... there were at least a dozen reviewers giving this game glowing - if not perfect - reviews, and I've gotta say I've never felt more deceived at how off they were or more confused as to what they actually played.\n\nFirst things first, this is NOT a Bioshock game, it may try to call itself one, but it is closer to Call of Duty or whatever other "modern" shooter you associate such gameplay mechanics as: regenerating health, 2 weapon carry, overuse of "press 'x' to do 'y'" prompts, and other similar elements with.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves, what about the non-combat parts you might ask?\n\nThe world just doesn't seem to recognize that you are there unless there is a scripted event or if you have enemies trying to kill you. NPCs are stuck on an animation loop with a thousand mile stare and provide zero interactivity.\n\nThere is some eye candy in the visuals department no doubt, but the rest feels like you are window shopping. There's barely even any physics in the game - good luck trying to do something so mundane as knock over a box or have some kind of actual feedback when trying to interact with the world.\n\nIn fact, for a game released in 2013, there are a lot of things that make you feel like the game is from early 3D FPS days: no facial animations on almost all of the character models, no actual weapon recoil (burst fire increases spread where applicable, that's it), weaponry that differs only with regard to how fast they fire, ultra-linear gameplay when trying to appear open-world, etc.\n\nThat is about as deep as the "show" part of the game goes unfortunately, and the "tell" isn't much better.\n\nElizabeth... where oh where to begin on this poorly conceived joke of a 'character'. Let's see, she's supposedly important to the plot, yet completely invisible to, and ignored by the world, friendly or hostile. She doesn't take damage from anything, so she's not any kind of escort. Despite throwing things to you throughout the game she "finds" (magically spawns), she's never actually seen picking up anything. In fact, the most you'll ever see her "do" is perhaps point at an item, but only when out of combat... and having lingered in an area for a while. And perhaps the worst part is that she is your 'key' to locked doors... you have to wait for her to come over and break locks before you can proceed forward in many areas. It doesn't help matters that she is a walking plot hole device either (as if the story needed any more of those), able to open... well, holes (or tears as the game calls it) to other locales and realities that they try to lead you to believe are parallel... but only when they decide that it makes sense in what they try to pass off as the story.\n\nThe main "bad guy" of the story barely even has any time in the actual game. There's a few scripted minutes where Comstock points out what you are up to plotwise, then he disappears for over half the game, shows up again for a few minutes, then disappears till the end of the game where he is killed in a cutscene.\n\nAbout the only good thing I can say about the 'tell' is that the voice work is well done, but that's really about it.\n\nChoices in the game amount to absolutely nothing as well. There is no morality system, but rather an extremely half-♥♥♥♥♥ "Do not steal or we will try to kill you" in a couple odd sections which makes no difference one way or the other. Moments where you are stopped and forced to pick something seemingly relevant to the plot are just as pointless due to the fact that not only do they not affect anything afterward, but even if they did, the way the game ends would make it a non-factor anyway.\n\nSurely the combat makes up for these many downfalls though right? Not. In. The. Slightest.\n\nThis is another case of a sequel being dumbed down for no discernible reason. There are a LOT of Call of Duty-esque (or modern military as some call them anymore) things in the combat - regenerating shield (not health thankfully), 2 weapon max carry, standard generic weaponry, no special ammo types, and combat that only sometimes tries to give the illusion of options, but ultimately fails because of not only how arbitrary these choices are, but also because the simplest approach 99 times out of 100 is the most effective one (thanks in no small part to the lowest common denominator shooter mechanics they for some reason decided were needed here).\n\nOdds are Elizabeth will give you way more than is needed to make any engagement fairly underwhelming as it is anyway. As soon as you drop below a certain % on your health, salts (EVE), or ammo, she'll magically "find" some more for you to use, and this happens EVERY battle, no matter if there actually was something there or not (because scavenging would actually mean she has to do something). This coding is so blatant that it is surprising that they didn't just stick a cooldown timer on the HUD somewhere. What's worse, this is the ONLY thing she 'contributes' (term used VERY loosely) to battles, as the rest of the time she is cowering (usually out in the open), despite having god mode and being completely ignored by enemies, or waiting for you to press a button to yell at her to pull something into the battlefield. She literally does nothing on her own which makes the endless praise all the more baffling that people laud upon her for being a good character when you have MUCH better examples from other games, such as Half-life 2's Alyx, Barney, and even the rebel allies, which can put up a good fight and even hold their own in the many situations you are presented with, that came out well over a decade ago! As it stands, Elizabeth has no presence in, or out of combat, she is just 'there' throughout the majority of the game, leaving you to wonder why they even bothered putting such a big focus on her in the design process.\n\nDo you recall the ad where she was about to be hanged by an angry mob and your character swoops in to save her? Yeah that doesn't actually happen in-game... ever... in any shape or form.  It really should've, at least the damsel-in-distress bit it would invoke would justify her existence somewhat.\n\nOne of the very few similarities to Bioshock there actually are come in the form of plasmids... err... sorry I mean "Vigors". Unlike Bioshock though, these are much less varied than the preceding games, much less used by enemies (there's maybe half a dozen that actually use what you use out of the thousand or so enemies you'll fight), and they can be severely game breaking in a great many of the fights.\n\nDifficulty is another major issue for those of you who like a challenge. One of the biggest factors for me at least, this game just doesn't feel particularly difficult, like at all. There are a couple exchanges which can get heated here and there, but ultimately it is because you are dealing with an army of enemies rather than having a character that feels mortal, which is only further underlined when you "die", since you respawn back into the fight moments later. And no, this cannot be disabled unlike in Bioshock 1 & 2.\n\nBut otherwise, there you have it, what little that remains of Bioshock returns here in a heavily watered down form, with the rest of the gameplay being pulled from lowest common denominator shooters like Call of Duty and the like to make this mash-up of a game that I really regret purchasing. The game tries to be so much at once, much of which it never was in the first place, and fails in every regard.\n\nI don't know what the hell other reviewers were playing, but if you have had the fortune to avoid this clunker, continue to do so.","April 8, 2013","false","43.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","53"

Before you begin in with cries of you don't get it or you can't compare it to bioshock, I will bisect those two arguments right here and now. First off, yes, I may have missed bits of the subtext but I understood what was going on and it was a bit of a mess. Being pretentious does not mean being misunderstood, it means pretending to be making points and being smarter than you are, and this game is not nearly as intelligent or interwoven as it would like you to think it is. Secondly, yes I can compare it to bioshock because its called bioshock infinite, has psuedo-plasmids and similar combat and even blanketly steals sound assets from the first. The very name invited the comparison and therefore invites criticism regarding that. Now with that out of the  way, no I would not reccomend this game at full price, though at a sale price I can reccomend it for a playthrough at least. The game squanders its potential by not focusing on the more interesting bits, like talking to citizens and exploring the town with dull combat, that is infinitely more boring than Bioshock. Theres no real sense of progression, the fights are just long and drawn out and the abilities are mostly uninterestinhg or just copies of the original games plasmids. And speaking on that, the vigors are just reskinnned plasmids, just without any of the lore, intrigue or even real relation to the universe that Bioshock and even a game that I consider in some ways to be better, Bioshock 2 had. Theres no interwoven lore, the world is just there, the physics ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pretentious and the main villian and city are uninteresting. I don't like how no one took this game to task for its issues, because maybe I am being pretty critical but the game is not as perfect as advertised. It got talked up and talked up and talked up, and even when I tempered exprectations I was left dissapointed. Its infinitely weaker than Bioshock, lorewise and world building wise and I just don't like it. I also really don't like how a game that did everything better than this one was overshadowed by this one because it was so hyped and deep and ♥♥♥♥. Its not that deep, and when you have a line like "The city doesn't float cause of the ballons, it floats cause physics!!!" you know its trying to be that game without understanding that by trying and not doing it falls flat. Worth a playthrough, but bewared the hype, as I personally felt it was far weaker than advertised. Go play  the much better Bioshock, or even Bioshock 2, or hell, go play Spec ops if you want to play a truly great game, and if you want to see what this game could've been, go play the game it helped push away from the perhiphery, Metro Last light, because that game for all its flaws is much better than this one.","May 8, 2014","false","7.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

But, just like Bioshock again, any topics they bring up like racism for example has no commentary or explanation for it which is just bad. This is because it makes the setting and characters feel shallow, and because commentary and explanation can be interesting and informative in it's own right.\n\nThe interactions between Booker and Elizabeth are interesting and will probably keep you engage enough to see the story to the end, but most of the game is bad shoot people gameplay.\n\nPeople will argue that the gameplay is bad because B:I got rid of basically all the RPG elements in Bioshock and also made the map design completely linear, but I disagree with this. These people don't remember that Bioshock already had shallow RPG mechanics and poor map design. The maps were design so that each path was a deadend that the player had to backtrack through once a mission was done... instead of making things loop around. This happens in B:I still, but the linearity negates most of it to optional missions.\n\nIn B:I the vigors (plasmids) nearly all do the same thing (LMB to attack, RMB to make a trap) removing any strategy on which one to choose and removing any reason to mix them together (which atleast Bioshock had). You also can only hold 2 weapons, which ruins any chance of mixing up the gameplay. Like you have limited resources so you have to choose wisely on what weapons to upgrade so you'll probably only hold the same 2 weapons you've upgraded through the game because if you upgraded a 3rd weapon you won't be able to use it unless you randomly find it on the ground in the middle of the fight.\n\nAlso since you don't have an inventory Elizabeth will randomly throw you items that you need during a fight which means there isn't really any strategy to refilling your health/magic in the middle of combat. Yes there are items that have small refilling benefits but that doesn't replace potions. You also can buy refill potions that are applied instantly and also random refill areas in combat arenas so just abuse these locations?\n\nBut while they basically stripped down the gameplay to a bare FPS minimum, I think it was a step in the right direction for these developers. But they needed to go one step further, remove the gameplay entirely. Seriously, if this was a Themepark Simulator there would have been more time to flesh out the narrative, characters, and setting which the game greatly needed.\n\nI played the game on medium and I would not recommend playing it on higher difficulties because there are bullet sponge enemies and the only boss fight in the game is a bullet sponge that infinitely spawns enemies in which you fight the boss multiple times.\n\nI can't recommend this game because of the poor gameplay. I would recommend instead watching an LP (Let's Play or Long Play depending on your perspective c;) and buying some cool looking merchandise from Irrational Games instead https://store.irrationalgames.com/","January 2, 2014","false","11.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

Combat turned from fun to an empty, churny and uninspired chore between story nibblets. It felt like the team lost track of "fun" 70% or so into the game. As such, the promise the game made with its fantastic first hours turned out to be a huge lie towards the end. The many many faults with the nimble-as-a-refridgerator controls were at first totally forgivable, but when everything but the visuals crumbled and came tumbling down around it, the painful dance with those blaring faults were pretty much all that was left. The payoff the game convinced me it could deliver was just reduced to a dirty rag tossed to the side.\n\nPlaying on hard can be a real challenge towards the end, but I find that most of my deaths through the game came from getting stuck in basic geometry, the character not running, or simply not jumping to the various hook-spots when he was supposed to. Bioshock Infinite is also a perfect reminder of why enemies using hit-scan weapons in shooters just aren't fun.\n\nI will try to beat it as I'm most probably just one small hill from the end, just to get it over with, and certainly not because I find it entertaining anymore. I'm actually even rather uninterested by the story at this point, as all the characters decided to just muddle up their believability with just stupid and inconsistent behavior.\n\nIt honestly feels like the original team of the game were not, at all, the same people who made the latter hours of it. Weird. Disappointing.\n\nI really wanted to recommend this. I was looking forward to finishing it so I could look up the DLC. I had it in my list of favorites. But I can't recommend it anymore. And I will certainly not touch the DLC.","January 6, 2014","false","14.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I finally got my hands on it but just didn't want to believe what I've seen...\n\nTwo weapon limit and combat mechanics just feel wrong. Enemies are way too precise and feel non-human. Combat feels rushed and hectic. Enemy dialogs are repeatative and annoying. Resources are too tight which makes the scavenge around most of the time instead of focusing on the atmosphere. Elizabeth does help you with ammunition however it does become annoying when she interrupts the combat to throw coins and salts and ammo at you...\n\ngraphics are good... however if you want to explore Columbia more you'll have invisible boundaries blocking you.\n\nSo far [after 9 hours] story is also really predictable. Also the NPCs around you almost don't respond to you at all. They all look and act like bunch of robots...\n\nTo sum up after the first two Bioshock games this game is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I just don't understand how this game attracts more attention and better reviews than first two. Save your money for some other game...\n\nEDIT:\nI've just played it through, I must admit that the story did get better than at the beginning (very good ending), however I still find the first two games of the franchise better. Weapons and plasmids were much more fun to use. Combat felt right and fair. And the storytelling was better than in Bioshock Infinite. Instead of a weak start and a good end they were consistently good.\nIt's sad to see one of my favourite games becoming something so dull...","February 7, 2014","false","18.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Beautiful design, engaging themes, and entertaining situations. Fast forward to around the sixth hour of gameplay: redundant fights, annoying combat, unsatisfying powers, and (if playing on the highest difficulty) maddeningly frustrating fights with the Handyman. Seriously, if you disagree with me, try to beat the Handyman in one of the last fights on the hardest difficulty. There is nothing gratifying with the combat structure in this game.\n\nMost reviews that I see gush over the game's story. Look, I get it: the idea of alternate universes, travel between them, and consequences of choices that can alter future choices is intriguing. Unfortunately, getting to these themes involved introducing multiple, underdeveloped characters that just seemed like more and more names being thrown at you. The games storyline with the revolution and the overall "alternate universes" theme conflicted and annoyed me for the latter part of the game. Fighting animated patriot machines was... dumb. It seemed like the developers felt they could get away with putting any stupid scenario in the game just because in one of the infinite universes it was possible.\n\nI would recommend many other games over Bioshock Infinite. I strongly feel that its success is a product of strong advertising. Not GOTY in terms of atmosphere, story, and combat mechanics.","December 20, 2013","false","11.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It's really a shame, because the game makes me want to finish it, but I can't stand replaying the same parts over and over, hoping to hit a save checkpoint before the next crash.\n\nSo, long story short, it's buggy and basically unplayable for me.

For months I avoided everything the /r/gaming ♥♥♥♥♥ had to say about it, avoided spoilers, avoided gameplay videos. Anything to just not spoil what I assumed would be the story behind the awesomeness that was the first two games.\n\nI was wrong. So very wrong. This game is terrible. It's a bigger piece of ♥♥♥♥ than Assassin's Creed 3. The entire game is comprised of the dev team sucking each other's ♥♥♥♥♥ for 6-12 hours while moaning "mmmmm fatalism nnnngggggggg" over and over.\n\nThe combat is garbage - you can overpower everything easily without having to worry about things like needing to find all the weapons. The plasmids are pointless. Other than the game forcing you to use some of them to advance the storyline, you can just pick the one you like best and annihilate everything. Or you know, abuse the Tears to just cheese turrets and the like. They respawn, so if yours dies, just hop up on the sky rail and wait it out, then re-Tear them. Or do like I do in all games - walk the ♥♥♥♥ up to mobs, beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them melee style, and laugh as you plunder the soggy remains of their bodies for cash and food.\n\nLet's talk about food for a minute. It's everywhere in this city. People just carry tons of it in their pockets. One guy had a pineapple in his pocket. Seriously. A pineapple. Could you tell from looking at him that he was sporting such an epic bulge? No. And it's not like he had some unique brand of pants that enabled him to stuff a whole pineapple in there - they were the same pants everyone else had. Good news for guys hung like a moose, and good news for guys who don't believe in carrying grocery bags.\n\nThe gameworld is pretty, as long as you don't look at things like the very flat grass and plant life. There's a lot of detail to things - cigarette butts around the trash bins, books with fine detail, and some very questionable artwork, which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe entire game is a very long and drawn out story about how the white man is superior, and you should persecute non-whites, as well as the Jews. And why would you do this? Because you're super religious and that's what your prophet wants of you. A fair amount of blatant and subtle racism takes place, and the story expects you to just roll with it. The whole thing was more of a cheap addition of "lolz look racism mmmm fatalism" instead of making people look at moral or ethical decisions.\n\nEarly on the game they even present that to you - you make the moral and ethical choice of choosing Elizabeth's broach - a  free bird or a cage. I chose cage, because ♥♥♥♥ that constipated ♥♥♥♥♥. As I played along with someone who chose the bird, I noticed that the game is identical. No matter which path you chose, it ends at the same conclusion and they wrap it up with "well that's just how it is, everything is decided for you" and circle jerk it a bit harder.\n\nNormally I would add a spoiler warning, but I'm not in this case, because I want to prevent other people from wasting their time and money on this piece of ♥♥♥♥. Elizabeth is your daughter, and you end up dead. Oh and it was also multiple realities, so she's not dead, and you're not dead. It then implies that BioShock 1 and 2 are also alternate realities. At this point I was so annoyed by the level of terrible going on that I let the credits roll in case it was a joke. When I realized it wasn't a joke, I uninstalled the game. Since then I have reinstalled it to play the Season Pass that was thankfully $5 during the Steam sale, thinking it would finally give me the great content I wanted. (I am told that the multiplayer for BioShock 2 is actually the game I was expecting, so we'll see)\n\nNope. You start out exactly how I pictured the game - in Rapture, it's gritty, gorgeous, and how the damn thing should have been. Then Elizabeth leads you on a 45 minute circle jerk about fatalism and alternate realities. You meet the Little Sisters as they first form, which is cool, and then you're trying to rescue one. You fight a Big Daddy, which is a joke - just cheese the Tears and you win. Then you see the rest of your flashbacks, which are the other realities, and then Elizabeth kills you with the help of a Big Daddy because you're an evil man in another reality.\n\nIn summary: the people who made this game took a massive religious ♥♥♥♥, then wiped their collective asses with the BioShock name and called it a game. Don't buy it. Just don't. Take the money and stuff it in a stripper's thong. Or buy something else, like Super Meat Boy. Or Recettear. Or $30 worth of chicken nuggets. All of these things are far more valuable than this ♥♥♥♥-show.\n","January 25, 2014","false","18.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","2"

No, not you gamers, the developers. They removed everything bioshock... well, technically system shock, but I wont split THOSE hairs right now, from this game. Choice is meaningless. Kill everyone you want, it doesn't matter. Make all your in game choices by flipping a coin, it doesn't matter. Dozens of plots are dropped into your lap and then shatter away to be forgotten without a thought. I hope you kids enjoy Songbird... for all 15 seconds you will see him.

Not the good "purple haze" kind of high, but the stoner in the basement giggling about God spelled backwards kind of high. In the span of 3 minutes you render the entire game moot, undo your own story, then actually go back and retroactively write the first two games out of existance. I'm not kidding about that, BTW, the forshadowing is strong with this and there are little clues that state the first two games are just this game in a different universe... and you proceed to unmake them all. You not only ruined your current game, you went back in time and ruined your first two games as well. What the HELL is wrong with you? Then you have the nerve to release this DLC featuring Rapture... even though you changed things in such a way that the city couldn't even exist. Your writing is so horrible you lost track of your own ending while you were writing it then forgot it again when you made your DLC. Oh, and before I forget, your game play was utter crap. Two weapon rule wasn't fun in the 90s, it damn sure isn't fun now. Your combat is boring enough to be seen as a chore.

Good news for guys hung like a moose, and good news for guys who don't believe in carrying grocery bags.\n\nThe gameworld is pretty, as long as you don't look at things like the very flat grass and plant life. There's a lot of detail to things - cigarette butts around the trash bins, books with fine detail, and some very questionable artwork, which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe entire game is a very long and drawn out story about how the white man is superior, and you should persecute non-whites, as well as the Jews. And why would you do this? Because you're super religious and that's what your prophet wants of you. A fair amount of blatant and subtle racism takes place, and the story expects you to just roll with it. The whole thing was more of a cheap addition of "lolz look racism mmmm fatalism" instead of making people look at moral or ethical decisions.\n\nEarly on the game they even present that to you - you make the moral and ethical choice of choosing Elizabeth's broach - a  free bird or a cage. I chose cage, because ♥♥♥♥ that constipated ♥♥♥♥♥. As I played along with someone who chose the bird, I noticed that the game is identical. No matter which path you chose, it ends at the same conclusion and they wrap it up with "well that's just how it is, everything is decided for you" and circle jerk it a bit harder.\n\nNormally I would add a spoiler warning, but I'm not in this case, because I want to prevent other people from wasting their time and money on this piece of ♥♥♥♥. Elizabeth is your daughter, and you end up dead. Oh and it was also multiple realities, so she's not dead, and you're not dead. It then implies that BioShock 1 and 2 are also alternate realities. At this point I was so annoyed by the level of terrible going on that I let the credits roll in case it was a joke. When I realized it wasn't a joke, I uninstalled the game. Since then I have reinstalled it to play the Season Pass that was thankfully $5 during the Steam sale, thinking it would finally give me the great content I wanted. (I am told that the multiplayer for BioShock 2 is actually the game I was expecting, so we'll see)\n\nNope. You start out exactly how I pictured the game - in Rapture, it's gritty, gorgeous, and how the damn thing should have been. Then Elizabeth leads you on a 45 minute circle jerk about fatalism and alternate realities. You meet the Little Sisters as they first form, which is cool, and then you're trying to rescue one. You fight a Big Daddy, which is a joke - just cheese the Tears and you win. Then you see the rest of your flashbacks, which are the other realities, and then Elizabeth kills you with the help of a Big Daddy because you're an evil man in another reality.\n\nIn summary: the people who made this game took a massive religious ♥♥♥♥, then wiped their collective asses with the BioShock name and called it a game. Don't buy it. Just don't. Take the money and stuff it in a stripper's thong. Or buy something else, like Super Meat Boy. Or Recettear. Or $30 worth of chicken nuggets. All of these things are far more valuable than this ♥♥♥♥-show.\n","January 25, 2014","false","18.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jet-Black/recommended/8870/","Jet-Black","Jet Black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jet-Black/","517 products in account","Very few games move me enough to have me consider a second play through. BioShock Infinite is one of those games. From the story to the combat, I have enjoyed every last second of the Columbia experience. Please don't compare this to previous games with similar titles... and as such I will not compare them in this recommendation. What I will do is explain what I love about Infinite, and if it jives with what you also love in games, then you will enjoy this experience as well.\n\nFor one, without any spoilers, the story is tremendous. Not Dickens or Shakespeare, but for Sci-Fi fans who enjoy stories that try to stretch the imagination, this definitely satisfies.\n\nColumbia itself is nicely fleshed-out with a lot of details. It's nice to see a city that is seemingly pleasant until you see the underlying fanaticism and bigotry. It is almost uncomfortable and off-putting, but makes the experience that much more real.\n\nBesides story and setting, the remaining piece would be combat, of which I found quite satisfying. If you're not a fan of bullet-spongy baddies you've definitely come to the wrong place. I played through on Hard the first time, and the game definitely gave me a challenge. With only two weapons to swap between and a limited amount of Salt for Vigors (read Plasmids), I had to be very careful. It was easy to get myself killed by running out into the open; movement and cover is key.\n\nMost of the weapons are satisfying although at first I was a bit confused by the red and blue ammo (each faction has similar weapons with their own sets of ammo); I think subsequent play-throughs I will focus on upgrading a handful of specific ones instead of spreading myself so thin.\n\nAs far as Vigors are concerned, I have to admit I enjoyed some more than others. While many where useful, when I eventually got "Return to Sender" and "Bucking Bronco", I was in love. There is a good variety of the usual suspects such as fire and electricity, and some interesting combos you can get (and there is an achievement for finding them all if you're into that sort of thing) by say lighting someone on fire and then charging them to create a bunch of fire-bombs that spread throughout the area.\n\nCharacter building in Infinite is mostly about what weapons you upgrade, what Vigors you buy and upgrade, but also is a little bit about clothing. There are four pieces of clothing Booker can wear, each with its own passive bonus. A lot of the best clothing is found through exploration, so make sure you poke around the levels if you want to find something good. Over time you will find a set of gear that will complement your play style which is especially satisfying.\n\nFor me, this is a game that will stay on my hard drive for a long while. I'm not much for clutter, so usually uninstall games after completion. While not as consistently replayable as Borderlands, I certainly expect to go through this story again as well as the two Burial at Sea DLC packs.\n\nIf what I've written piques your interest, then go ahead and buy this game. Still unsure? It's old enough that you can find it somewhere online at a discount, so you really don't have much to lose. It's time for you to go visit Columbia today!","January 4, 2014","true","24.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaker_The_King/recommended/8870/","Jaker_The_King","Jaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaker_The_King/","275 products in account","REWRITTEN AS OF MAY 10th, 2014!\n\n\n\nFirst off, I have very little that is good to say about this game.\n\n\nGraphics: The graphics are amazing and beautiful, same as the previous Bioshock games at the time of their release, however a beautiful world does not make up for the fact that the rest of this game is bad and it certainly doesn't make up for the fact that the level design is very poor, but I'll get to that later.\n\nGameplay/Combat: This game makes a very poor use of the already old and tired Halo combat mechanics. You get a shield that absorbs damage until it's broken, then you must get behind cover and not get damaged to get your shield recharged. You're also arbitrarily limited to a grand total of two weapons, not counting your melee, which is just a button you hit and not actually selectable. Aside from that, the combat itself is very poor consisting entirely of "shoot these guys." Sometimes you can get Elizebeth to summon an unlimited item cache or an automated turret from an alternate reality, but the turret dies pretty quickly and is pretty much useless, as are the item caches since Elizebeth is a fountain of free items, but I'll get to that later.\n\nStory: The story is the most nonsensical convoluted garbage I've ever had the displeasure to endure. I'll try not to spoil anything, but this game makes use of alternate realities as a plot device, which can be really good if done well. Sadly this is not the case. The alternate realities are just a convenient excuse to explain away anything that doesn't make sense, essentially the equivalent of "a wizard did it." The antagonist of the game, Comstock, is an evil, radical, super racist, psychotic religious leader and self-proclaimed prophet who built a flying city whose whole reason for being all that is literally the fact that he got some water poured on him, otherwise he would be a poor, drunk war veteran living in a cheap apartment regretting his actions in the civil war. I am not joking, that is literally the whole reason he's evil. The final moments of the game consist of twenty minutes of exposition because the entire plot is such a tangled mess that this was the only way the writers could attempt to make sense of it. And they failed. Miserably.\nElizebeth has these powers to open "tears" or portals to alternate realities and as you jump from reality to reality over and over you lose track of which was the original, but the charcaters don't seem to care at all, despite their entire world changing each time.\n\nLevel Design: Each and every level in this game consists of two things. You either get a mob arena, or a small enclosed area for some story to happen or poorly written exposition. I've really got nothing else to say here.\n\nCharacters: I feel all the characters and their motivations are poorly written in this game, especially the antagonist, Comstock, who I've already talked about. Without spoiling anything, Booker is looking to pay off a debt he owes...By bringing them this girl, Elizebeth. I'm sorry, but what kind of good guy takes a woman he doesn't know to some seriously shady people to pay off a debt? Literally all other characters are cardboard cut outs. You've got greedy corprate shill who shows up for five seconds, strong independent black woman who don't need no man and mysterious duo who are mysterious for ♥♥♥♥♥ 'n giggles.\n\nEnemies: 90% of the enemies you face in this game are generic soldiers who use guns. Sometimes you will face a pyromaniac, a dude who sends flocks of ravens at you and a giant part mechanical man who is a bit of a tank, he's essentially the replacement for the Big Daddy, but you don't have a choice of fighting him, he just shows up and attacks you. Last, but not least, you have this annoying ghost-like banshee that makes literally no sense, she ressurects anything in the area and constantly sends them after you. Of course the explination for her existing is alternate realities, because of course it is.\n\n\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nGameplay: 2/10\nStory: 1/10\nLevel Design: 1/10\nCharacters: 2/10\nEnemies: 1/10\nOverall (Average based upon above): 2.6/10\n\nDon't buy this garbage game, even if it's on sale.

Long story short: It's still not good in any particular way. It looks and plays rather dated. The game is meanspirited, ugly and not as immersive or intelligent as it likes to pretend it is. Almost everything it does well another game or story does better. Want chaotic shoot and loot gameplay with customizable upgrades with oddly frequent vending machines? Borderlands 2 is all that but non-linear. Want to delve into an immersive dystopia presented in a linear fashion? Try Dishonored. Want trippy pandimensional storytelling that doesn't take itself too seriously? There's a lot of good anime like that, try Steins;Gate. Bioshock Infinite isn't bad but it is mediocre and tiresome, practically presented like a Halo level that threatens to never end. On the plus side, if religious racist political zealots grind your gears the game does serve as a nice anger outlet, but I wouldn't pay more than $15 for the whole thing including DLC. It does have a few neat characers like the Lutece twins that are worth seeing, but they're not enough to salvage the game.","February 9, 2014","false","33.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

People say it's like Systemshock and in that case i say i have to buy Systemshock!\nThe first Bioshock was such a good game that i got it through means that i would rather not discuss at first. Played all the way through. Bought it for the Xbox and seriously think if i should buy if on steam just to have it on my computer! I love it THAT much.\nBioshock 2 got a lot of flak but i think it still is a good game. It's not as good as the first one but it's a worthy successor to a great game IMO.\nNow we got Infinite. I saw the trailers and got hyped out of my mind! It's Bioshock but it's in the sky and in a different time? COOL! Maybe we'll get something else, something new something that is just as good with a new twist!\nWell, what we go was a confusing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with ♥♥♥♥ gameplay! yay?\nAt first i didnt know what to think. The game wasnt horrible. But the more i think about it the more i realised that Bioshock Infinite is just the devs trying to hard to ♥♥♥♥ with your mind.\n"OOOOOH. Look multiverse theory! Are you confused yet?" No. Im not confused since i realise that you are seriously just trying to mess with me.Thats the problem with a multiverse theory it gets hard to follow and messy in a heartbeat and they did it so poorly that i wanna smash my head against a beltsander in frustration! The settings go from one to another without really setting the mood and 90% of the time i dont really care since im going on to next version of Columbia in a few minutes.\n\nThats the main problem for me. It doesnt matter if i kill characters in this universe since it  has no impact and in another universe and im supposed to care about said characters! Sometimes i see them die and they dissapear since we never hear from them again and leaves me wondering if they are alive in this universe but maybe they didnt even exist in this universe. So dont bother about them.\nThe gameplay is downplayed so much it's stupid! In the first Bioshock you had the protagonist pockets. You ran around with half an army in your pockets and guided what weapons you should use with ammo! In this they went with the Duke Nukem Forever approch! 2 weapons no ammo! In Bioshock they put care and thought into the design of the weapons. Rapture had a weapons ban so people smuggled in weapons or made their own. You could see that with the grenadelauncher made of soupcans and the crossbow made from a pianowire and a bunch or spareparts! The shotgun looks like something you find over a fireplace and gets cooler as it gets upgraded.\n\nIn Infinite the weapons act the same. They are boring and the upgrades offer no visual representation to show that you'upgraded them. In Bioshock you find the "power to the people" stations. Again made from junk that you find in Rapture. Very cool concept. The resistance fighters made their own weapons and fought Andrew Ryan and theres layers upon layers of cool backstory that you find out regarding Frank Fontaine, Andrew Ryan , Suchong and Tennenbaum all over the place. Backstory sprinkled with codes to safes and tips about stashes of loot everywhere. COOL ♥♥♥♥. But in Infinite even the audiologs are boring! No backstory or anything just rants about how people were stupid and racist back in the days! Woopie! All to preserve the twist at the end and they couldnt even do that right!\nBooker is combstock! BOOM! just saved you 20 hours of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! you can thank me later.\nSeriously the only half decent thing they managed to put in this crap is Elisabeth. I like her but she's just a tool to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!\nShe's one of the main reasons this game falls short! She's the one opening the rifts into other worlds and she's the carrot at the end of the stick. She's also the most aggrevating person to chase after in video game history. Theres a scene where Booker tries to talk some sense into her after he's clearly shown that he's taking her to a place she clearly does not want to go (New York and i dont blame her) She wants to go to Paris (Wrong move there too sweetheart!) and she slows him down with everything from parades to balloons! (CURSE THOSE DASTARDLY HELIUMBALLS!).\nI didnt have to pay for bioshock Infinite (Thankfully) But i did have to trade away my timestopper. If i had to choose Timestopper or Infinite i'd be paying a whole lot more Faceless void!","March 4, 2014","false","26.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

The uninspired combat system (and controls that leave no middle ground between "not turning" and "spinning in circles", even with an adjustable sensitivity mouse) doesn't hold up to those of the previous games, this game's plasmid equivalents ("vigors") provide uninteresting powers, and without them being a central plot point, or even having any obvious significance in the story, it seems that they exist solely so that Infinite could be called a Bioshock game.\n\nThe story itself is so ridiculous that, if you read it in a book, you'd think it was a satire (and Poe's law be damned, no one could take it seriously). It follows the story of a floating city filled with a fanatical religion dedicated to the (literal) worship of America's founding fathers and also racism, possibly best exemplified by a bar where the the most prominent feature is a mural of a haloed John Wilkes Booth shooting Abraham Lincoln (complete with horns and red skin), visited not long after hearing a sermon about Washington crossing the Delaware (Incidentally, said mural was the point at which I closed the game and started looking up reveiws and "let's plays" to see if it got any better. Spoiler alert: It doesn't.). I surmise that the rationalization behind this schizophrenic mix of ideological parodies is this: the average person is not, in fact, violently opposed to either nationalism or religion, so to properly vilify your opponents (the general populace of Columbia) heavy handed (even anvilicious) racism was tacked on to remove moral ambiguity and guilt the other aforementioned ideologies by association, thereby justify shooting all the people who were literally just giving you free food and money.\n\nThe writing was painful, too. The shift to a vocal protagonist was by no means a good one, since being reminded of what you should be thinking by your own character's voice makes for a shallow experience ("Augh! These heights are so scary!" during a mediocre above-ground experience where falling to your death is, in fact, impossible), not to mention that every third voice clip was to the tune of "huh?" or  "what's going on?".\n\nI won't even get into the time-traveling multiverse garbage.\n\nIt's really a shame, because I really enjoyed the previous 2 games in the series, but Infinite seems like a poor attempt to capitalize on the reputation of a popular franchise in spite of, essentially, being the worst possible political commentary on nothing at all.\n\nIn the interest of fairness, I have to admit that the game looks really nice, but fancy graphics do not a good game make.","January 1, 2014","false","1.0"," 52 of 99 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","52","99","2","7"

He then finances a scientist, Rosalind Lutece and they build a city in the sky, Columbia. Because of that he never marries, he never has Anna and is made sterile by Lutece's dimensional machine(which also gives him cancer). So he devises a plan to steal a child for himself from the alternate version of himself via the help of Luteces.\n\nIf he denies the baptism he starts drinking and gambling, his wife dies due to childbirth and eventually he sells the baby Anna to alternate reality Comstock, regrets it, brands himself with her initials on his hand and spends next 20 years drinking till Luteces bring him through a tear(causing him to manufacture new memories) to the world with his Comstock and Columbia.\n\nEssentially both of them are two different versions of same person. So in order to kill Comstock, both of them have to die. Logically that can only be done by killing Booker before he makes the choice to become either. Thus no Booker or Comstock exists after baptism, and thus no Columbia or Anna. The only t hing remaining are the two Luteces and our Elizabeth(who is technically a god now).\n\n-------------------------------> BEST GAME EVER<-------------------------------","November 30, 2013","true","429.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Everything is a step down from the original: Story, gameplay, setting. Everything.\n\nGameplay is Call of Duty tier: kill hordes of mundane enemies over and over completely lacking any thought or satisfaction in the deed.  Guns are terrible. Seriously, there is not one gun in the game I do not reflect back upon with utter distain. In the original Bioshock weapon and plasmid upgrades were bought through separate resource pools. But in this game, EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING, is bought through the same pool. This means you don't have any room to experiment with the "Vigor's" (which are just cut & pastes from the older game), and have to invest in solid shoot'em'up tactics because when you get right down to it, Vigor's are just something to call this game a "Shock" game and not a "Call of Dutes" game. You can only carry two guns at once, and there is easily 10+ ♥♥♥♥ tier guns polluting the gun pool with their ammo. Which means in certain engagements, your main upgraded guns will likely run out of ammo and you'll be forced to use terrible re-skins in their place. Shooting guns is sticky, slow, tedious and all around not fun.\n\nStory takes a dive 1/4th into the game and from there on its a run and gun shoot'em up, all the way to the end with its exceptionally ill thought out ending (which doesn't resolve anything), but makes scrubs who don't want to feel stupid for not getting the ending shower it in praise for "depth", when in actuality it's simple, dull & poorly thought out. Ken Levine Scrapped the real Bioshock Infinite when he ran out of time wasting it on MP no one wanted, and was forced to put this ♥♥♥♥ out on the market. Literally, nothing promised in the original hype was delivered. Everything was recycled from the REAL Bioshock Infinite to create a presentable new game, and it certainly shows. Especially in character dialogue.\n\nSetting is un-imaginative and in comparison with Rapture, Columbia doesn't hold any water (no pun intended). In Rapture, the city felt like a living enemy. The ocean and crumbling city always loomed with you, and you were always aware that you were in a tin-can with a sheet of flexi-glass between you and death. In Columbia, you can just jump off the side and insta respawn with no consequences Super Meat Boy style. Enemies lack explanation or purpose in the world of Columbia, (take the fireman & patriot) & those that do are incredibly un-original or just half-♥♥♥♥♥ (crow racist people, Handy-Man).\n\nIf you buy this game, I have no sympathy for you. Enjoy your middle of the game ♥♥♥♥ tier boss battle with Ghost lady 3 times over, while trying to justify your purchase by telling people like me "it was 2deep4u".","November 30, 2013","false","27.2"," 33 of 62 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","33","62","0","4"

It took me 13 hours, and I took it SLOWLY but what an insane game.\n\nThe scenery and atmosphere is straight out of a psychedelic trip, i can't even describe it.\n\nThe story is so deep it will leave you thinking for weeks, and the research the developers must have put into this is just breathtaking.\n\nThe music is spot on, and i often found myself just abusing the ingame radios to replay songs. Voice acting flawless aswell.\n\nEven the characters are so well crafted, to the point where you can feel their personalities, very rare imho.\n\nUsually when I play FPS games, its for the combat the action and so on. But in this game, the combat actually anoyyed me, cus it meant that i didn't get any lore, that i didn't get to explore and feel the game.\n\nThroughout my entire playthrough i didn't encounter a single bug, i didn't have to restart the game once and not even a visual bug was to be found.\n\nAnd if you think you're a hardcore player, you can just play on hard, and i promise you it will be a challenge even for the top skilled.\n\nIf I have to compare this to other games, i would say Half-life 1 with a stronger story, and much more atmosphere minus the puzzles.\n\nThis is a standalone game, the story really doesn't overlap with bioshock 1/2, and you can easily play this without playing the others.

The writing seemed very lazy, offering cliche time travel explanations for much of the experience, and unrealistic character behavior left and right.\n\nThe character of Elizabeth was not particularly likable and was a complete Mary Sue (pretty much flawless, unrealistically skilled in various implausible facets). The storyline concerning her didn't very much interest me. I could not relate to her at all.\nThe main Protagonist, Booker Dewitt, was a bumbling nobody who toppled an entire nation, capable of challenging the United States, single handedly. We have all seen many games able to pull off this type of protagonist in more believable ways than Infinite. He comes off as some cliche " evil with a heart of gold"  type of guy. I happen to be sick of this type of character.\n\nI didn't like the low amounts of ammo found in the game, and how you would have to abandon your upgraded weapon for a cheap handgun many times due to the lack of ammunition and the limited number of carried weapons allowed at one time. Superior weapons found near the end of the game also reminded you of the useless thousands of dollars spent into upgrading the earlier weapons.\n\nI am used to the tedium of backtracking in video games and I don't usually count it against a game unless it is exceptionally tedious. In a game where there are MULTIPLE UNIVERSES, why are the revisited areas almost exactly the same? Some color being different, or a swapped out statue in one universe was not enough to impress me, and it felt cheap and lazy (Does the same architect posess the ability to traverse worlds and walk planes of realitiy through tears in space/time, just like Elizabeth?Seriously?).\n\nVigors. Useless, useless vigors. I was very disappointed with the vigors. Throughout the entirety of the game, as soon as the lightning Vigor was available, it became the exclusive one used. Barring the times where the game needed you to use a different Vigor ability to progress, Lightning was more than enough to get through the game easily, especially with the upgrades it unlocks. That is not to say I would have wanted to use any of the other vigors anyway, they seemed so boring and useless to use. Why don't enemies use Vigors? Except for those few special enemies with increased health, why don't average Columbians use Vigors? What's up with that?\n\nElizabeth being able to lockpick seems like a forced reminder to keep the illusion of how useful she is. It's strange how many large, important places of interest have their security entrusted to the same cheap, flimsy lock. Columbia sure would be a breeze for Jill, the master of unlocking, to get around in.\n\nOnly two weapons at a time. You can only carry two. Irrational games decided to hate fun this time around, I suppose. It's not like there is any large tactical advantage or disadvantage to carrying one over the other, it's like they tried to go for realism in this lone, weird gesture, when they tried it with nothing else. All it did was leave you no option, in some situations, but to weild a rocket launcher in a small narrow corridor, ensuring that you would lose precious health.\n\nConstants and Variables. That is what Elizabeth tells you after you inquire about the nature of the tears in space/time. "Constants and Variables?" "Yes." and it is left at that.\nYeah, whatever you say, Irrational Games.\n\nYou cannot carry medkits or salts. Why not? "Because we said so", say the men in the cubicles.\n\nThis game sucked.","October 29, 2013","false","11.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","1"

The amount of detail that went into building this new world to explore was insane. It had a distinctive voice of it's own but still fit in with the rest of the franchise very nicely.\n\nHowever, I did find the gameplay to get a bit repetitive towards the end.

I also just didn't care for the story much, this could just be me but,  it felt like they just kept dragging on the ending for eternity and it made the last two hours or so of gameplay horrifically boring.

This masterpiece puts on your screen a high quality for a low GPU, giving you a variety of properties to modify but still running on minimum you can see how marvelous this game is.\n\nOptimization: *NEW* This might be the best game's optimization in the history of games, and one of my best 10 games of all times, simply flawless in any escale.\n\nSound: Bullet sounds, Music is set in the early 30 and 40's tho the game (between the original game and the dlc Burial at sea) is set with a game of about 40 years difference, voice acting is top quality and you get to feel what the characters experience during the game right until the end.\n\nMetascore: 97/100 "Masterpiece of all times and GOTY 2013, a MUST BUY for any gamer out there"","October 13, 2014","true","68.2"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","18","33","0","0"

And the plot gets so bad and illogical eventaully with certain aspects being cheaply used.\n\nAt least the game is very polished and bug free.\n\n4/10 Somewhat intresting story but incredible short, bad in gameplay and overpriced for what it is.

The gameplay is certainly subpar, with lots of elements removed from previous titles. There is a nicely large variety of weapons, but this is completely undermined by the utterly unnecessary two weapons limit, which serves only to stifle player choice and undermine the upgrade system as well. Enemy variation isn't much to write home about. The regenerating shield is the first time that regenerating health has been tried in this series, and unfortunately really hurts the combat, since it makes cowering behind boxes and popping out to fire one of the most effective combat tactics. Also the only boss fights which occur in this game are terrible. Not just hard, but horribly designed: infinitely respawning enemies, limited weapons and a bullet sponge boss, with money deducted and enemy health restored every time you die.\n\nThe story starts off quite strongly, although as more of the plot is revealed, plot holes spring up all over the place and the conclusion is confusing, rife with its own plot holes and unsatisfying. The world is also poorly constructed, with the player murdering hundreds of innocent people for the crime of being law enforcement officers, then continuing to have normal conversations with Elizabeth, making Booker seem completely insane. Vigors are an adapation of plasmids from earlier games, but while plasmids were integral to the plot in Bioshock, vigors are very much an afterthought, with basically no bearing on how the city operates.\n\nElizabeth as a character is confusing. She has spent her whole life locked up in a tower, yet seems to be normally socially adjusted, which seems unusual. As a gameplay element, she is strangely shoehorned in. She cannot be injured or captured by enemies, who will completely ignore her, and can occasionally "find" ammo, health or salt (vigor power) around the battlefield, although these are not available through standard searching, only through Elizabeth. Her addition to gameplay is redundant, and only serves as an excuse for poor design in terms of ammo.\n\nVisual design is fantastic, but there is little else to recommend about this short game, especially replay value. Don't buy it.","November 29, 2013","false","8.7"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","1"

The story it tells through it's main characters, DeWitt and Elizabeth, is so engaging and surprisingly well put together, you will find yourself incredibly immersed. If you're anything like me, you won't be able to take a break. It is an amazing adventure, as well as a suspenseful mystery, that all comes together in its final moments to form an incredibly solid ending. It will leave you with many questions, but only a very small number that can't be answered by another play-through or a few more minutes of thought. All of this paired with it's polished look, and smooth feel makes it a must have for... Well. Everyone.\n\nOne final note: I'd recommend using a gamepad to maximize the experience. Some of the controls using a keyboard and mouse, even with customization, have some seemingly unavoidable non-intuitiveness to them. That's my opinion, anyway.\n\nEnjoy!","November 26, 2013","true","67.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Plasmids, plasmid upgrades and weapon upgrades whilst helpful play no bearing on progress or the style in which you would attempt to play through the game. This isn't the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, it's not even the spiritual seccessor to Bioshock, it's a Shock game in name only in my opinion...rapture references, plasmids, steampunk and noir stylings notwithstanding.\n\nIt excels however in storytelling, serving up an experience drenched in art and design stylings which are arguably as good as it gets. This is flanked by one of the best looking and best optimised engines I think I've seen of late. Cities in the clouds, beeches, shantytowns, factories, Rapture are all brought to life with vibrant lighting and visual effects. Every scene is a picture postcard, breathing.....alive.\n\nSmall moments in game such as when you first meet Elizabeth. She's painting a picture of the Eiffel tower in France but after pondering the results of her picture instead decides to open a "tear" in space and time and as you look through the "tear" Tears for Fears can be heard blaring amongst the background hustle and bustle of a Parisian street, Return of the Jedi is shown as playing at a cinema on said street. Bioshock Infinite overflows with moments such as this and the result is that it elevates a fairly average, linear FPS to a captivating, involving experience.\n\nThe ending pretty much cements any positive opinions I had on the game, it made my head spin, it was unexpected, satisfying, borderline perfect actually.","August 5, 2014","true","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think the game's strongest point is its story with the visuals at a close second- unfortunately, gameplay is far behind. Combat is largely Bioshock in that you face a number of uninteresting fights saddled with a poor combat engine, slowly whittling down a huge number of HP-sponge enemies. It's unfortunate that the story is punctuated by the lackluster combat, because it just makes the actual gameplay a hurdle to be skipped over in persuance of the next tidbit of story progression. It's quite an interesting story, dealing with multiple universes and how it all combines in 1912 America. The visuals are superb, and the flying city is the perfect setting to show off the engine. Unfortunately I think the city itself is the dumbest part of the game. Where Bioshock 1's Rapture was a nuanced, living place, Columbia is alternately filled with Tea Party racists and OOGITY BOOGITY leftist caricatures. Note: It's not good writing to make everything so extreme as to be ridiculous. The ending is the laziest piece of writing I've experienced in many years and makes the game completely worse for it. I can't really recommend this game, except to a Bioshock fan.","May 19, 2013","true","19.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrensk/recommended/8870/","wrensk","Wrensk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrensk/","85 products in account","Had this game on Ps3 when it came out, and found it very indulging in story to the point where I may have spent a bit too much time playing it over and over for a week straight. The gameplay is just your average FPS variant due to the combination of guns and special powers called vigors that work in a similar way to plasmids from the first 2 games. The story is a fairly average one until you get more towards the end of the game where it finally all hits you and mind****s the hell out of you, and I did thoroughly enjoy it. Whilst the twist may not have had the same impact as the first Bioshock's twist did, it still was pretty much unseen for the most part and is worthy of appreciation as much as the first game was.\n\nIf you have played the first 2 games, I think you will really enjoy this one. In my personal opinion I would put it ahead of Bioshock 2, but behind the original Bioshock, yet still a game worthy of the hype it received. If you like to play games based on the gameplay, and you're looking for a very good FPS, this MIGHT fit the bill but I would recommend it far more for the immersive story, the connections that can be made to the old Bioshocks, and the refreshing colour tones it brings for most of the game. (Oh - And of course all the crazy fan theories people come up with).\n\nVery enjoyable and well worth the download. Personal verdict - 9.5/10.","February 2, 2014","true","23.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArgTute/recommended/8870/","ArgTute","Tute, a mókus király.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArgTute/","200 products in account","Bioshock Infinite plot begins with our protagonist going in a mission to rescue a girl that has been held captive in an utopiac city over the clouds. First thing you'll notice once you get there is the stunning beauty of the colourful visuals. You can see Irrational games put a lot of work into this, and it continues all through the game until the very ending. Next is the OST, I wouldn't say outstanding, but rather fitting. Combat is fast paced, and fun, especially when using the sky lines. There's room for strategy, but it's not a tactical shooter, cover and shoot will get you out of almost any situation even in the Hard difficulty. The story is the strongest point of the game, not much is reveled until the end, but you'll probably figure out things and make theories on your own. It reminded me of Chrono Cross, but don't worry, it doesn't get that complicated.\nAs drawbacks, I experienced performance issues even though I'm roughly over the recommended requirements, the lack of a multiplayer to add play time, the low difficulty (Passed it swiftly in hard) and poor enemy AI. Playthrough time is 11-13 hours.\nGreat shooter, absolutely recommended: 8,2/10","April 1, 2013","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF BIOSHOCK INFINITE.\n\nThis is without a doubt the best DLC I've ever played. I liked Burial at Sea Episode 2 more than BioShock Infinite itself. Maybe the reason why I enjoyed this so much is because I'm a huge fan of the original BioShock, but at the same time I really liked Elizabeth's character and the way she interacted with characters from the original game.\n\nThe Schrodinger's Cat stuff is still present due to this being an expansion of BioShock Infinite's story. This doesn't really bother me, though, seeing as the story is presented in a way where the player can actually take a moment to digest everything that's been happening - as opposed to BioShock Infinite. I'm not into the whole multiple dimensions thing, but if I absolutely had to have a story with it - this is how I'd want it done.\n\n\nPros\n- Stealth combat that feels fresh after BioShock and BioShock Infinite's manic gunplay.\n- A plot that isn't as hard to swallow as BioShock Infinite's.\n- Great atmosphere - fans of the original BioShock will love it.\n- A couple new vigors/plasmids are introduced for the first time.\n- A great wrap-up to BioShock Infinite and a fantastic prequel for the original BioShock.\n- Sheds light on a few previously unseen areas and factoids of Rapture.\n\n\nCons\n- The plot can seem kind of far out sometimes.\n- Plot holes, depending on how hard you want to look.\n- The Peeping Tom plasmid can kind of break the game's stealth mechanics.\n- The fact that the game tries to push you into playing stealthily as opposed to all guns blazing.\n- Going back to Colombia.\n- I wish it were longer!\n\n\nOverall, this is an amazing DLC that is definitely worth the admission fee. If you liked the first BioShock and didn't care too much for Infinite, this is basically a love letter to you from Irrational Games. Would you kindly kick back and enjoy your return to Rapture?","April 11, 2014","true","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First run review. Will update at end of game.\n\nAfter playing Bioshock 1 & 2 previous to this game I was a bit taken aback as the usual underwater confined space environment had changed greatly to a more open air less intimidating environment, as I am still at the starting stages I can't go into to much more detail.\n\nThe initial loading(using a elevator form) to start the story backbone hasn't changed much and still gets the needed info down.\n\nSo far so good. I'll be back later with more details till then 8/10 worth it's weight.\n\nEdit: Alright Review v2.\n\nI've now made some interesting progress but have to admit to a bit of a sin now xD this game has made me stay up till 5am in the middle of the working week! with this achievement done story is rated at, at least 8-9/10.\n\nGame play: Usual RPG FPS good at most parts, something that does spice it up a bit is the "tear", where you ask Elizabeth to pull an object/open a hole in the TimeSpace etc. Now I'm going to spare the theories behind all that but the concept and usage seem to have been implemented well :).\n\nRating 8/10.\n\nEDIT: Review v.3 final endgame.\n\nRight so before we get started I got something to admit. I came into this game thinking the with a bit of a snooze of this type of combat so normal difficulty caused me to miss the defence a bit in the final battle. That said.\n\nLe Usuals:\nGame play good very interactive, bit buggy on getting that bird to target sometimes with keyboard and mouse, attempted with controller similar issues.\nGFX: Bit bright at times but I guess that is the effect, setup on first run well worth it.\nStory:........\nRight so for le kiddies I gotta kinda star some of this out but lets give a moment just to say thank you Irrational Games! Right now... excuse my less intellegent version... It was a rightous skullf**k. I won't go into detail as that would absolutely destroy the point of experiencing it but wow thinking it over a few times really gives me the chills :) at the same time completely destructive effect. My brain hurts for over thinking the details but deffinately a story worth telling over and over. Wow.\n\nAgain thanks to Irrational Games for the solid mindf*** you just gave me.\n\nFinal Rating 9/10 Worth its weight in MUR!

The game looks great if you have the hardware to run it at high enough settings. The structures of the buildings, the designs of the vehicles, the character models, the music and ambient sound, and the dialogue all blend together to create a fantastic old-timey, early-1900's setting and enviornment that is mostly believable (it IS floating in the sky, though) and interesting to play through.\n\nThe gameplay is solid. It is more or less a straightforward FPS. It's simple to play, and the game gives you enough tools to have a little variety in how you kill the bad guys. Again, it can get a bit repetitive, but nothing that feels like the Halo: Combat Evolved level "The Library."\n\nThe story is fine. I liked the ending. Won't say too much to avoid spoilers.\n\nDefnitely buy the game, even if you decide to wait for a sale - it is better to play it eventually than not play it at all.\n\nOh, and the controls are fine. I switched to a gamepad for the more relaxed feel, but K&M work just fine.","July 18, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, when it comes to the third game, Bioshock Infinite, the developer has done a great job to bring the series back to its full glory.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nThe world in Colombia never lacks breathtaking beauty, whether it is in peaceful sightseeing or under brutal combat situation, I can't help but stop to admire the city in the clouds at times, it's all you can imagine in a lost fairytale.\nAt first glance, the city is vivid with people murmuring and birds flying, as you discover more truth, the environment shifts yet continues to impress you. There might be blocky props here and there if you care about the smallest detail, but it's clear that the developer tries to maintain the best balance between image quality and good performance.\nAll in all, "Colombia seen from the Skyline is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world."\n\nPresentation:9/10\nElizabeth is quite possibly the best female companion in a video game since Alyx Vance in HL2, her a.i. is excellent, the appearance is impeccable, voice-acting is top notch too, they certainly put a lot of fine work in creating the character. I also like her ability to resupply you during combat, having such an agreeable companion is much better than some painful escort missions commonly seen in other games.\n\nStory: 10/10\nBioshock Infinite may feature one of the most intricate storylines in video game history. After you've first beat the game, the ending will most likely leave you speechless for quite a while.\nThe returning to Rapture at the end makes you wonder the possible connections between Booker and Jack, Comstock and Ryan, Elizabeth and the Little Sisters, are they just the same projections in different universe? As Elizabeth mentioned to you, "There's always a man, a lighthouse and a city". It's more of a challenging test for the players' intelligence rather than physical skill.\n\nGameplay: 8.9/10\nThe combat in both previous 2 games is amazing, each gathering/hunting-down-a-big-daddy mission is a challenge by itself, but if the player plans carefully beforehand, the result is very rewarding. However, I cannot say the same about the 3rd game, surely all those guns look great, shooting them is satisfying too, the Vigors and skyline are also nice additions to the game, but the overall combat just feels tedious and falls into the generic run-and-gun genre, the difficulty is laughable even on higher settings.\nWhile the storyline is excellent, the gameplay is way too linear, I would love to enjoy mini-games as in the previous 2 games as well as more interaction with the environement, it's a shame that Colombia is full of details yet all the player can do is collecting coins/snacks/salts, etc, I think it's a missed chance for the developer, then again, nothing is perfect.\n\nOverall: 9.2/10\nBioshock Infinite has raised the bar for the art of gaming, it may be a generic shooter but a masterpice in storytelling, the mystery introduced by the awesome ending will make players come back for more.

The game also adds than extra layer of depth in the form of environmental hazards such as oil spills and Elizabeth's tears providing friendly covering fire or simply health/ammo points. These help the game feel fresh in an industry over populated with FPS games.\n\nThis game excels unlike any other when it comes down to its beautifully crafted world with its own unique art style. It is truly breathtaking at points. You could spend hours just wondering around it in without killing a single soul if you choose as the world is immersive.\n\nThe storyline itself is as engaging experience that needs to be experienced first hand. You learn more about both your own character and te character of Elizabeth as the game progresses but the game creates more questions than answers which enables the story to remain intense throughout. For a game with no real cut scenes and that is as first person as they come really to be so engaging is an achievement just by itself. The developers have done an incredible job here.

The 5 minutes of of time that it did run, it ran at a perfect 60fps constant, but then would suddenly the graphics would just lock up.  Sound would play still, video not so much.

All I simply had to do was disable my Killer e2200 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller.  For some reason computers with this type of network card don't agree with bioshock infinite while the card is still active.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tader-Tot/recommended/8870/","Tader-Tot","Tader-Tot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tader-Tot/","290 products in account","I'll admit that I'm actually quite afraid to write a review for Bioshock Infinite.\nThe immensity of such a game creates a aura that I cannot simply sum it up with mere words.  I guess I've given away, then, that this review is heavily favorable.  This may be the game with the best story I have ever experienced, in fact.  That is why I can barely begin to create any sort of assumption about it.  Let us start by dissecting it into the three classic categories a game can be ♥♥♥♥♥ by, in order to tackle this masterpiece.\nGAMEPLAY:\nI will not say this game is perfect.  It's not.  And I think the gameplay really shows us that.  Not to say that it's bad, no.  In fact, I love playing around in this game.  The guns are amazing, and the vigors are much more creative than the original Bioshock.  This time around, it's less about stealth and more about run-and-gun adrenaline-pumping pure action.  This is highlighted by the fact that your companion (yes, we'll get to that later) will constantly toss you item that I swear are always timed perfectly to fit your needs (your character even remarks on this, usually saying, "Right on time!" or something similiar).  However, although the gameplay is fun and upbeat, it tends to take away from game in a way that is similiar to what would happen if you took Telltale's The Walking Dead and added constant action.  It may seem like fun to the developers and people will eat it up at demos, but if you play the entire game the action ends up feeling like filler.  And although it's some damn good filler, at the end of the game it's only remembered as "those things I had to do to get to the interesting content."\nENVIRONMENT:\nI'm grouping the audio and visual together in "environment" for this game for the sole reason that the setting needs to be heavily discussed.  So let's get graphics and music out of the way.  Firstly, the game looks amazing.  Everything, even objects, feels alive.  The colors are bright, the people look fantastic and slightly whimsical, which is perfect for the game's setting.  And your companion looks, well, beautiful.  She's not explicitly hot or over-the-top cute, but she's a girl that you want to keep both alive and happy.  On sounds, well, the same holds true.  The game has upbeat and nature-esque ambient noise, and unlike Rapture does not contain random screaming, even towards the end of the game.  It always feels like you're walking though either a park or a factory, which is fitting considering that most of the time you are.\nNow for the setting.\nI'll try not to compare Columbia to Rapture too much, as there really aren't too many similiarities.  In fact, they're almost opposites.  Where Rapture was a place that focused on the intellectualism and the individual over the society, Columbia is a place that focuses on being a good citizen and the society, namely religion, over the individual.  Industry was not encouraged, with only one main provider for almost everything anyone would need.\nBasically, Columbia is an exaggerated version of America circa late 1800's.\nMonopolies, Social Darwinism, Racism, Nationalism, it was all there, and demands a rebirth that forms Columbia.  Despite being recycled from an earlier time period, Columbia still feels new.  In a society today where anti-racist sentiments have practically been crammed down everyone's throats by the media (not to say they don't have truth in them), Columbia manages to condemn racism in a new, subtle, fantastic fashion by not telling you that it's wrong, but simply showing you what was going on in the time period and letting you, the audience, think about it.  It's what Dr. Suess was so good at doing (The Lorax, anyone?) and is so not-understood by current media (The Lorax, anyone?).  The same holds true with the overzealous religious followers of the game, who are not evil, but need to change their ways.  You come to this conclusion by not being told that it's the right one by the devs, but by deciding it on your own.  It's a style that should have been adopted long ago by mainstream media, but is not because they decide to dumb it down for the average consumer.  Thankfully, we have people like Ken Levine in this world, and long ago, Ray Bradbury (Farenheit 451 more directly teaches this, if you're interested in reading it (which you should be)).  But, if you want the full experience, play it.  I cannot sum up in words the full extent of Columbia's social structure, but it's an amazing setting.  It's also pretty that it's floating, I guess, but that just seemed like an extra detail.  Oh, we made this city with beautiful social commentary, and it's suspended somewhere between 15,000-20,000 feet in the air by science.\nSTORY:\nNow we get to the hard part.  Actually, no.  GO PLAY THE GAME.  I will not spoil anything.  The beginning's questions deserve to be shown, not told by some guy on the internet.  The middle's pondering deserves to had by you, not me.  The endings answers deserve to be discovered by your doing, long after the game has ended, not explained by me.  The story is absolutely fantastic, which is why I make no mistake in telling you that any specific thing I compliment it on will chip away at it's overall experience.  I have not even mentioned the companion or anything that pertains specifically to her character, but just know that you will feel emotionally attached to her by the ending (not like that, you creep).  The Luteces are not only hilarious, but actually make sense in their strangeness by the end.  And Comstock, he does seem like a modern-day prophet (if by modern I mean 1912), ringing all the right bells for him to be an off-putting Jesus.  Everything about this is amazing, and the twist at the end is more amazing than any game ever produced, including the original Bioshock.\nIn short, go buy this game.","July 20, 2014","true","38.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Simple question, complicated answer.\nThe series has been delivering people a whole new world of FPS since Bioshock(1) with brilliant narrative and a handful ways of slaughter from weapons and Plasmids. Bioshock 2 story might be a bit plain but still fulfilling (just so you know, Ken Levine wasn't on this one) and there're huge improvements in gameplay, deliver you a variety of killing blow(to use) that you might puke a rainbow over it.\n\nBioshock Infinite bring you to another Utopia,"Columbia" , a new beautifully rotten world in 1912. There's architecture, music, fashion, people, weapons, even realife events you could relate to. It makes you believe a world of Columbia is real. Every scenario is beautiful and you get to play part in it.\nThe game is also very rich in story (I have a hard time thinking of words, let's just leaves it at that)\nMusics are great and were wisely used, every moment in the game has its own rhythm.\nThe narrative, lives up to its predecessor, blended in with gameplay perfectly and I mean it.\n\nIn this third game, you are given lesser yet enough resources to create fantastic fights. "How?", you asked?\nWhat if I told you you can send a flock of crows to attack and distract your enemies? What if I told you you can set a trap emitting mini atomic blast? What if I told you you can gun blazing into an army with magnetic shield deflecting bullet from you? What if I told you you could reel enemies in and shotgun them IN THEIR FACES? Also, you will be accompanied by the most brilliant AI partner in the world of gaming. Trust me, you gotta love her.\n\nThere's so many people whining over the game "it's not Rapture, it's not Horror, it's NOT BIOSHOCK."\nand I shall reply, "If it's not Bioshock so, Be it!"\nWe, Columbian, will secede from the sodom below and ascend to the sky! (Nailed it)\n\nCreating a good game is hard but making its good successor is harder. I'm the kind of a guys who questioned FPS gaming industry. Okay, it felt good shot enemy down one after another, oh man it's so satisfied, but is there a different in its own family? Bioshock Infinite has given me the answer.\n\nLet's put that complicated hundreds of word in a simplest way. What makes game a good game?\n"For such a long time in gaming....... I've never felt so good :)"\n\n(Only thing you will be complaining about this game is its save system, trust me.)","June 13, 2014","true","174.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That being said, this game is amazing. There are a lot of similiaries and differences between this and the original Bioshock. After all, they're all about a man, a city, and a lighthouse. I didn't enjoy the mechanics in this one quite as much as the original, but it was still pretty good. Plus, the skyline mechanic is a blast.\n\nLike the first one, if you enjoy good story and good atmosphere, I highly reccommend Bioshock Infinite.","April 1, 2015","true","27.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do what is wrong if it means no one will get hurt?\n- Elizabeth's ally skills\n\nCONS:\n- Not a large variety of enemy types\n- Random ammo locations and ammo drops makes it hard to keep the weapons you want\n- Over viscious enemies that will not give in\n\nBoth, depending on your preference:\n- Jumpscare (Only one, but you won't be expecting it :P )\n\nA bit of spoilers beliw, but the main spoiler is at the bottom, so you can rwad below, and not spoil the ending,\n\nThe game is about a Mr. Booker De Witt, the character the player plays as, arriving to a light house, where a letter claims that Booker De Witt must bring "The Girl," in order to repay his debt. While exploring the lighthouse, he stumbles upon a chair that shoots him up into the sky, where he finds a floating city known as Columbia. There the people of the city seceeded from the U.S. due to Abraham Lincoln's Civil War, and became its own "state." There, the people worship George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, and follow the prophet and leader of their city: Mr. Comstock. Booker, bewidered by the place he stumbled upon walks around, allowng the player to learn how to play the game and ue each vigor as a carnival is going on show casing the different abilities the player will be experiencing. Everywhere he looks he sees posters of Comstock, and posters saying how he is the greatest man ever, and other posters claiming to avoid the "False Prophet," created to "stray the lamb away." One poster in particular claims that the "False Prophet," has the letter "AD" engraved on his hand, at this point Booker raises his hand to show the player that "AD" is on his own hand. As you are walking through the street, a note is handed to you, telling the player to NOT get #77 when playing the raffel that the city is doing that day. Lo and Behold, when you go and play the raffel and win, you got #77. You are given a baseball bat, and a black woman and Irish man is dragged out onto the stage and the announcer tells the player to throw it at them as the couple begs them. Here the player learns that the town is racist. The player is given their first choice in the game, throw it at the couple or throw it at the announcer. [I chose to throw it at the announcer] The player raises his hand, where a police officer grabs his arm, and points out the "AD," is on his hand. Instantly, people run, and you kill the police officer, stealing his gun, and the real game begins. You use the gun to shoot at the officer. The game progresses like this until you reach a tower, where you learn that the tower holds a girl hostage, Elizabeth. You free her, learn she can open tears (doors into other dimensions,) and that she is possibly the daughter of Comstock. The rest of the game is trying to find out who Elizabeth really is, and how to defeat Comstock and fix your life.\n\nTo begin, the storyline is amazing, and is constantly keeping me wanting more. While I played it on hard (for the first time,) I was constantly having a challenge and to me, that was fun. The characters developed nicely, evolving as the plot developed, which also fitted nicely into the journey your character was embarking on. However, while I say that, the main character seemed to not develope in character as in how the character percieved certain things or how the player reacted to certain events, it was always the same, a gritty "I don't want to be here," attitude; while this may be part of his character, it did seem to get a bit repetative.\n\nGuns sounded nice, and did what guns are supposed to do. kill enemies in a realistic way. Upgrades could be purchased for the weapons and I admit that I did purchase a lot of them, but it is entirely up to player to buy upgrades, not only for the guns but for vigors as well. Vigors are powerups that the characters can use giving him special abilities, my favorite being possession; I rarely used the others however, but again, it is up to the player. Enemy variety is low, all characters that look one way also have the same type of gun, but do not carry the same gear when you search their dead bodies. These enemies range from anything to enemies with simple weapons and barely any armor (the police in the beginning,) to extremely hard (the helpers.) I will admit though, I did enjoy fighting all enemies when they showed up.)\n\nElizabeth, the character probably most people are familiar with, is an amazing ally. Constantly finding ammo, salts (item to use vigor,) health and pointing out items in the room you can grab. Without her, the player would have a hard time fighting. Her facial expressions are nicely done, changing as the story progresses. She mad at you? She will show anger, and talk to you differently. She will throw things to you without speaking, and show the player her anger by facing away from the main character: Booker De Witt.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ending to the game was not something I could expect, especially when you find out Elizabeth is your daughter. It really makes you think about how you treated her in the game, and all the stuff that happened to her. Bottom line, you sold her.","December 26, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's one of those rare games that hooks you from the very beginning, and goes all the way in creating an immersive setting and narrative. Needless to say that these are the central elements of this game. The flying city of Columbia is visually stunning, and the storyline is intense and intriguing. Prepare to have your jaw dropped every once in a while, due to an ingenius plot twist (and prepare to be mind-blown in the end!). As in every Bioshock, Infinite will provide you with brainfood in terms of an in-dept analysis of political ideals and the place of science in society. However, the storyline is more focused on the protagonists, compared to the previous games. Speaking of which, the main characters are wonderfully 'real', and you will develop a sense of care for them.\nSurprisingly, I found the combat less interesting. Yes, it's fast-paced. Yes, it has all the features that made old-school shooters great. But I can't help but considering the battles an unnecessary obligation. But don't be disappointed; you'll have a lot of heartpounding shoot-outs, worthy of rememberance. It's just that looking around looking for bits and pieces of the multi-layered story is what makes this game really great.\n\nIn short: a masterpiece, in every sense of the word.

The visuals are beautful, the story pulls you in, the voice acting is perfect, the guns feel like they have real wieght to them (especially when you combine them with Vigors/Plasmids), and Elizabeth is the best companion you could ask for. She helps you thoughout the game by throwing you money and ammo and also by picking locks. You really feel like these are real people and are really doing what they're doing. The ending will give you chills.\n\nThe DLC is even better. It connects this game to the first one by showing you the events that lead up to the fall of Rapture and also by answering many of the questons that the first Bioshock raised. In the DLC you dont get as much ammo and weapons that you get in the main game, and you need to use stealth in order to get by. Its just as dark and creepy as you remember.","March 26, 2014","true","35.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Tech is to the top. Except some low rez sprites on some objects, but with so much things animated on screen, it's quite understandable. The only thing is that there's no real surprise on Infinite. Plasmids are now called vigors but the gameplay is a pure Bioshockish one. Story is great but you feel events coming from a mile. Combats are more speed and nervous than those on the previous titles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurezan/recommended/8870/","kurezan","Kurezan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurezan/","425 products in account","Bioshock Infinite is firstly a first person shooter, and secondly an entry in the Bioshock series. This makes the game feel different from previous titles in  the series, in both positive and negative ways. It has a similar feel to it aesthetic-wise, there are various audio logs in the game, you go from place to place while given various directives, and the whole thing is rather linear. You are accompanied through most of the game with your companinon Elizabeth, who thankfully cannot be damaged by enemies, or the game's difficulty would be (pardon the pun) Infintely harder.\n\nThe story of the game is  questionable however, it is not difficult to understand for the most part, except the last part of the game which leaves me wondering "what the heck just happened?" I was shocked when I beat this game not because I was particularly blown away, but it was a sense of anger instead. I just went through all that to be given such a dissatistfying ending. I felt cheated. I probably wouldn't playthrough the game again, but it was still a half decent experience to go through. The environments and the overall feel of the game is very enjoyable, and the new sky combat which the game boasts is very fun and fast, through on ground combat is nothing short of the typical first person shooter action.\n\nI have not played the DLC's yet, nor do I intend to, as my values dictate that DLC are something to be avoided if at all possible.\n\nI'd recommend this game if you are a fan of first person shooters, and if you played the other bioshock games you might have a decent time, but find yourself wishing that your were playing Bioshock 1 again.","March 23, 2014","true","18.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
