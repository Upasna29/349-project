I was unsure on which agricultural simulator to buy, i ended up buying this one because it didnt seem too old to be out of date, nor too new to be all buggy. It was also because at the time of buying this, there was only one negative review, and, thats all the reviews there were. One. So i went and brought this i thought i should try and write a helpful review about my experience on the game.\n\nOh, and dont be decieved by the very low amount of game play i have, its just because steam and this game dont want to cooperate, but i have had more gameplay than just a couple of minutes.\n\nTook awhile for me to luanch it when i first did, but it luanched. Upon first viewing's at the main screen, it seemed that this was gonna be a laggy game; but i fixed that by tweaking some of the options later on.\n\nBeing a new player to Agricultural simulator and this type of simulator as a whole, i had no idea on how to start playing, how to play, what everything was etc. But through further playing and  investigating, by the time of writing this review i have a well good understanding of how the game works.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the game was laggy. When i got into actually playing it was laggy, but not so laggy that i couldnt see where i was going or what i was doing, but, yeah, still laggy. So i went and fixed that; problem solved.\n\nFor a game made in 2012, the graphics seem fine to be, then again im not picky about that stuff. When i turned down resolution in the options i completely changed the look of the game from the screenshots in the store page. But it isnt that big of a deal, i can still see everything i need to see fine.\n\nSo once i fixed all of that stuff, i figured its time to start playing. You start from the ground up; you have to buy all of your recources and equipment that you use, e.g: manure, tractors, equipment, livestock. It's all G though, you start of with plenty amount of money to buy all of the items that you need and want.\n\nOne thing that i noticed while playing that bugged me a little, was that while driving in the tractor, it tends to turn a bit while you drive. Not a lot, but, its worth keeping your eyes on the road.\n\nYour equipment can get worn, dirty and damaged. You have to refill the refillables; petrol, fertilizer. It's a simulator so you have to keep an eye on that stuff.\n\nYou can hire people to work on your farms, giving them set tasks etc. This is cool that you dont have to do all the work by yourself. And it gives me something to honk my horn at as i pass by. Yeah. You can honk your horn, aswell as use a parking brake to do some sick turns and some lights for safety. Not that they need the lights though. While i was hotdoggin around experimenting with the game i saw a car driving on the road, i was in a tractor. I wanted to ram him and squash his car. Instead i just drove right over it. No damage to the car :(, but i did after that find another car on the road and pushed him off the road. . . .  but the prick just drived calmly back on.\n\nSo thats some of the stuff you can do if you want to go hotdoggin.\n\nThere are no objectives, missions, main goals etc. Its completely your choice. You wanna make a farm first, you can do it, or you can buy some livestock. Whatever you want to do. This is also a little bit of mustard on your hotdog though, for me as i was new to this, i had no idea what to do or how to do it, and the stuff in options controls n stuff is sort of limited in ways, for the stuff not there i just searched it up though, eventually figured out how to get going.\n\nI brought some livestock in the game, but unfortunatelly i couldnt find where they had spawned :(. Except for a pig which i found but God help the sheep wherever they are. Im sure ill find them eventually.\n\nI havnt been playing this game for years or hundreds of hours. But in my amount of game play, i think its a good agricultural simulator, especially when you get it on sale like it did.","December 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","1"
