The 3 space games to date that I've put more hours into than any other game released since. And I was only 7-8 years old when I started playing these.\n\nBuild your base up, trade resources/medicines/weapons, build ships and missiles. build base defenses, research new technology, build another base on a passing by astroid, meet other races, launch missiles and send ships to attack said races, blow all their s**t up, watch their other astroid flee from you, build an astroid engine, go on a high speed astroid chase, run into another race, blow their s**t up, catch up with previos astroid, blow more s**t up, build more missiles, watch their counter attack fail against your brilliantly made defense, laugh and finish them off.\n\nor\n\nA random passing by astroid hits yours and you lose all your ♥♥♥♥ early on and have to start over.","June 30, 2015","true","12.0"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","95","39","41","11","5"

Even in fullscreen it's playable without too much of a hassle.\nOf course some of the GUI stuff is a bit 90's-style obscure, for example doubleclicking a building opens up a different info screen than single-clicking it, but other than that it runs perfectly fine on Win7 64bit.\n\n\nThis had such a lasting impact on my childhood, that even when playing GTA 5, encountering Lamar immediately made me think of Ancyra LaMarr, the Rigellian ambassador in this game xD\n\nSo yeah, this has something for everyone from a tycoon/business sim with covert agent actions up to the sparkly laser napalm space battles and planetary annihilation stuff with utter chaos.\n\nReally can't wait for a remake of this, but until then, the original is definitely worth the price of admission.\n","July 1, 2015","true","9.6"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","20","20","5","0"

Grandpa is going to tell you a story...\n\nThere was a time when I was still playing demos downloaded via dialup internet connections. This was the time when I found this game on sale at Best Buy (back in those days when you had to get your games at the store).\n\nThe game places you as the leader/executive of a mining operation as an employee of Tetracorp. As part of the company, you will engage in competition with other races who are also trying to get a share of the asteroid belt. The story is that a Federation treaty that was signed ended the war between the races, but that the "trade war" has continued between the races (but these battles are governed by "rules").\n\nThe game has a very well developed economy, with rising and falling mineral and goods prices. When things get hectic, you can hire some managers to help with the running of your asteroid colonies (so you can focus on war production and combat). There is a surprising amount of depth to this game (research, diplomacy, espionage, black market, employee morale).\n\nYou can customize your ships with different modules. You can build masses of weenie ships or a fleet of capital ships (or both, like I do). You can build a variety of different missiles to launch them at your enemy (or buy some illegal weapons and use them, at risk of being fined by the Federation).\n\nIt's one of the few games I know where after you spend time building up a missile bank and giant fleet, and you can finally sit back and watch in satisfaction (from a spy satellite) as your missiles fall down and make fireworks of the enemy asteroid. It is also hilarious to send asteroids crashing into your enemy.\n\nFor a game that is about 20 years old it holds up surprisingly well. Try watching some demos or videos and see if it's your kind of game. I highly recommend it.\n\nI have sank countless hours into this game years ago. The demise of Windows 98 forced me to stop playing this. It is still one of my favorite games. Back in thosed days, PC Gamer only gave it a 60% or 70% rating when they rated this game, and I'm not sure why.","September 6, 2015","true","15.0"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","18","19","6","0"

Played it since I was 12.  I forgot how hard this game made me rage.  I recommend it.  I really do.  Few games are so well developed.  However, every single time my asteroid gets attacked they knock out the 3 buildings that lead to instant death for that asteroid.  When I attack an enemy asteroid I have to destroy every single building down to the last one every time.  If they made a game this good today and balanced it I would buy it.  Just like I bought this old game.","July 12, 2015","true","10.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","1"

Then explore and expand on others asteroids but aliens races are here too to do the same as you so use diplomacy with caution and build defenses and war ships if not aliens missiles and ships may soon blow your mining bases.","May 3","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
