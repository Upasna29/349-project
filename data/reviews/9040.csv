"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/9040/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Quake Mission Pack 1: Scourge of Armagon is the first official expansion pack for Quake, developed by Hipnotic, aka Ritual, and released in 1997, few months after original. It focuses on single-player portion of the game, bringing not only new levels but new elements as well, making it the first id software related expansion that doesn't suck.\n\nLike original Quake, Mission Pack uses CD to play it's own soundtrack. And since Steam doesn't include it, you will have to go and find it somewhere. And then you will have to go through trouble of implenting it properly with _inmm if you have Windows Vista or higher, so music properly loops.\n\nAs usual, game allows you too choose if you want to play with software or OpenGL rendering. You probably should stick with software one, as it kinda looks less muddy and OpenGL one has some bugs. Like no overly-high lighting or no full-bright textures for light sources.\n\nWhen you launch the game, don't forget to write "+mlook" in console, to enable mouselook.\nThere is also bug of sorts where you will not be able to select game's new weapon - hammer. It's supposed to be on "0" weapon slot, but it doesn't seem to be binded to any key. You can fix it by writing "bind 0 "impulse 226"" in console.\n\nPlot of Scourge of Armagon goes: You arrived back into military base after defeating final boss of Quake. Yet it's too quiet and you read from console that base was sealed as reinforcements of Quake still keep coming through portal. So you decide that you should travel to another dimension once again and put a stop to it, somehow.\nThen again, wasn't "Quake" a codename for final boss you just defeated? It confuses me slightly. But I guess we can blame all these monsters on surviving member of Quake's order.\n\nAnyway, proudly and couragely, the mission pack throws atmosphere and abstarct level design into trash bin, instead bringing more realistical approach. You got to play through 15 levels or so divided into 3 linear episodes. Futurustic base one puts improves on original base levels of Quake, which felt a bit wasted. More looking like real places and it adds a new enemy for sake of variety too. Then come nest two episodes down in strictly medieval and then "ancient-runes" themes. And this is where I think that game drops the ball. Not only themes aren't that much interesting, but more realistical level design means less interesting level layouts.\nIt's kinda funny. Times ago when I did a walkthrough on Quake games, I prefered this approach over original. Maybe was more interesting this time around. But as I rebeat game recently, I was missing more abstract and complex approach of Quake.\nNot to say that level design is completely flat. No, it's quite good. Got interesting pieces. Like graveyard theme. When you also have to enter coffin to exit the level.\nEngine also got updated to allow things like rocks rolling down the slope, trying to kill you. Or force bridges. And levels use some scripted levels here and there. And sometimes they are build in such way, that you are very likely to get hit without ability to avoid it. Like, spawning thunder-throwing monster in open area.\n\nAs said, it also doesn't have same atmosphere. Now with brighter maps and with new rocking soundtracks, it's call for action. I don't get the same grim feeling. Something that made Quake unique. Not sure if I dig new music, but most people do.\n\nAnd yes, it introduces new monsters and new weapons. Weapons are gimmicky thigns that weren't needed to begin with. Like, grenade launcher that throws mines that stick to the surface. They are quite weak for mines and it's more fun to just shoot into face than expect for monster to find a path toward place where you are hiding. Or it got laser cannon and hammer, that waste same ammo as Lighting gun of Quake and once again, seem to be not-so-needed variations. Laser can bounce off walls, but it's mostly there to hit you back. At least hammer is useful without ammo as it can gib zombies.\nAnd yea, new monsters. Scorpions, tough enemies that increase variety in base levels, strafe here and there and shoot nails at you on the floor level. And gremlins, who behave like monkey and just have some gimmicks like stealing your weapons or spawning more of them by ripping corpses apart. Shame that they killed faster to really consider those things. And new flying organic "mines" don't make sense. They increase speed when you aren't looking and are usually put in such way that you will be unaware that one is behind you. Just no idea aside from making you reload a save.\nOh, and it got a new final boss. Who isn't gimmicky and is proper one, unlike final boss of Quake. So it's better. If forget that he will die under half a minute from all the ammunition that player was given by that point. Still better.\n\nActually, if you wished Quake to have more of Doom atmosphere in grey-brown setting while having more realistical level design, that majority of gamers prefer over abstract, then this mission pack will be better than Quake itself. But if you liked original Quake, then eh, it doesn't get all things in same way.\nI am actually surprised that I didn't like it as much in recent walkthrough as I did years ago. But oh well.","June 21, 2015","true","5.4"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/9040/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","FPS games have always been short relative to, say, RPGs, so it's not surprising their DLCs or 'mission packs' tend to be even shorter.\n\nBut you don't want to hear about that. This is the good ol' days, back when mission packs and DLC actually meant something! In fact it's almost as big as the original game itself!\n\nScourge of Armagon boasts new weapons such as the laser pistol and proxy launcher - useful tools when faced with limited options in some face-off scenarios. Example: you might be having trouble with scorpions. Answer: mine the corners with proxy grenades! And while the laser pistol is frowned upon by some (the kind that can't aim properly and end up shooting themselves with reflected shots), it can be a godsend on Nightmare difficulty, where enemies often start shooting as soon as you see them, and keep shooting ceaselessly, regardless of their gun's clip or shell capacity. Shooting reflected shots around corners could save your bacon.\n\nAs with Quake, you'll need Ultimate Quake patched in to enable the in-game soundtrack, and the tracks are good enough to be worth worrying about. They help to evoke a sense of atmosphere that the graphics may not be able to accomplish on its own.\n\nAll our favourite foes from Quake return (except its boss, for obvious reasons). New enemies include the gremlins and aforementioned scorpions, the latter of which will probably grief you the most. Other odds and ends include force bridges and shields, an actual boss fight this time, nice graveyard scenes, entering coffins. There are now also giant flying bombs ("Vor bombs are not enough, must add more bombs," babbled the lead developer to his team)\n\nYou liked Quake? Then get this. It's like a box of chocolates. One box of Quake is never enough.","September 29, 2015","true","15.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/9040/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Quake: Scourge of Armagon is an expansion pack to the original Quake that introduces new enemies, new weapons and a slew of new levels to shoot your way through. The most noticeable difference from the get go is the amazing new soundtrack added to this expansion. While the original Quake had creepy ambient music that put a sense of dread to the environment the music in this is either heavy metal or some rather dark sounding techno that will have you involuntarily headbanging. This new soundtrack suits the game as the levels are filled with far more enemies at any one time so you'll be shooting more often than not. Unfortunately like the original Quake the soundtrack in this has been cut out of the game leaving it with nothing but sound effects. If you are not willing to mod the music back in I would suggest you skip this expansion all together as it just isn't Quake without the soundtrack. This expansion is far harder than the original game and will require you to put your former experience to the test as they can and will throw tons of high level monsters at you at once.\n\nEnemy placement is also far more cruel and you will often times be face to face with the likes of a Vore (spider demon). It is necessary to keep your finger on the fire button at all times as any delay can lead to your untimely death. This expansion pack is not just a bunch of levels to shoot your way through as the level design is also quite different in that it has an Adventure game like feel to it. For example you will be running from falling boulders, trying to squeeze your way through spinning grinders to press a switch and a few narrow steel beams you must cross over bottomless pit. Most of these environmental hazards that differentiated it from the base game are only found in the first few levels and then it's mostly shooting bad guys in your face with the gun of your choosing. A new weapon added is a grenade launcher that shoots grenades and won't detonate until someone steps near it, whether that be you or the enemy it doesn't differentiate and may cause your death if misused. The next weapon you will encounter is a laser weapons that fires bouncing balls that is very useful for shooting enemies around a corner. Last but not least is a mighty hammer that will electrocute any surrounding enemies though it does take up cell ammo.\n\nYou will need all the help you can get as the new enemies are equally as deadly as your new found arsenal. One of the first new enemies that you will meet is a giant robotic scorpion that shoots nails at you. It is a very deadly enemy as these nails move quite fast and are hard to avoid. The next one is called a Gremlin which leaps at you and will steal whatever weapon you are holding. It also has the ability to chow down on corpses and spawn more Gremlins so taking care of any you see should come as a priority if you don't want a small army of them after you. Lastly is a floating hunk of meat called a Spike Mine that will explode in your face if you let it get close enough. It sounds like an easy enough task to simply not let it close to you but these guys are pretty sneaky and while they do emit a distinct sound it is rather hard to hear, making it too late once you see it flying overhead like a deadly piñata. One hit is all it takes for these guys to kill you so while they are the weakest enemies they are also the most dangerous. All of the monsters from the base game are back and ready to rip you in half though thankfully the Slimes are only encountered once in this expansion. You will be facing a lot more of the grunts and Rottweilers as the entire first episode is set on Earth.\n\nThere are three episodes overall and it is quite a lengthy expansion pack considering it took me about 6 hours to complete while the base game took me 8. The story is as unimportant as ever and involves a creature called Armagon taking control of the hellish forces after the demise of last game's bad guy and attacking Earth yet again. It is up to you to go into hell and take him down. Thankfully there is an actual final boss fight in this unlike the underwhelming ending in the original. The story is as minimal as ever and will only give you a few lines of text at the end of an episode. The environments you will be exploring are pretty interesting and range from a church, some type of building floating in pitch black darkness and some levels with rivers of blood. Some environments can now blow up in certain set sequences and annoyingly enough the debris from the wall can still damage you for some unknown reason causing you to wait around until they disappear so you can walk to the objective safely.\n\nNew items include the Wetsuit which will allow you to breathe underwater and reflects electric type attacks. A rather strange shield that reflects half of the damage you take back to the enemy and last but not least a horn that summons friendly monsters. These monsters will follow you around until they die and what monster you get is up solely to luck. Secrets are plentiful and as difficult as ever to find though it does help to keep an eye out as ammo can be rather scare at times. Running out of ammo is a death sentence as the axe does little damage and has very short range, even if you are lucky enough to have the hammer it has the same range as the axe and it is a rather bad idea to face someone with a chainsaw for an arm or a giant scorpion in melee combat. When all is said and done this is quite a meaty expansion pack with all that we loved about Quake but cranked to 11. If you didn't like Quake the first time around there is nothing here that will convert you though for those that loved the original, Scourge of Armagon definitely lives up to the standards set by the original developers ID and may actually be even better given that you prefer pure action and more difficulty. Why they took away the soundtrack is unknown to me but if you are willing to put in the little effort to get it back this will definitely give you more of what you loved about Quake.","January 13","true","5.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","1"

But the authors decided to bet on spectacularity, and it did pay off - scenes of Armagon's arrival and death are impressive, and there's even nice unexpected cutscene at the end.

The level themes are immediately recognizable and you can tell they really put a lot of heart and thought into them, unfortunately some of these levels can become a bit labyrinthine as you lose track of where to go and what new pathway has become available to you.  Fortunately, there's no time limit.  The new weapons buff your arsenal with some needed variety and the new enemies also become quite a surprise in their strength.","March 26","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My, my. Pretty badass, of course.\nThe 'couple new weapons are alright I suppose. I found myself ignoring most of them though.\nLevel design is worse than the original Quake's, and also the second expansion, IMHO. Might be my memory, having played the original QUAKE time and time again even as a kid, but, if I'm not complaining about the second expansion's level design, then I'm pretty sure there's something definitely wrong with this one. It annoyed me throughout the whole damn thing. I know it's meant to be tough, but damn, it's pretty overkill, so much I swear I ragequitted or couldn't deal with something a couple of times, and I rarely do that with single player shooters. Damn.\nThe new powerups are nice. A welcome break from all the original QUAKE's ones, I suppose. Nowhere near as good, though. I kind of like simple things like Quad Damage and Invincibility better. :P\nAlso one of them gives you an AI ally. I've got to say, for its age, I understand why they're so terrible at following you, but you're better off leading an enemy to them rather than let them find the enemy. Seriously.\nFinal boss fight is lame but I understand given the fact id sucks at pulling bosses anywhere outside of games like Quake III. I just spammed rockets at the guy and called it a day. After a handful of attempts, of course. And it was my first time throughout the expansion. Oh, and it was Nightmare. Yeah.\nOverall...I'd say it's alright for an expansion, buut...do not get it if you're not that big on Quake. I think. I'm a bit of a challenger-type gamer that always goes for the hard difficulty, so if you're not actually planning on playing on Nightmare, and/or are (maybe even very) patient at stuff like, say, taking a grenade to the face and scarce medkits, then I'm sure this expansion's fine for you. If you get mad at stuff like that and  think this expansion isn't worth the trouble, then yeah, don't. If you are big on QUAKE then go ahead, like everybody else here says.\nIt's...alright, I guess. Have fun with it if you do get it though! :D","April 1","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
