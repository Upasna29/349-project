It's definitely geared toward kids and if there were no combat it would be perfect for extremely sheltered young'uns -- though maddeningly twee and boring for adults. Without combat it would be mind-numbingly dull.\n\nCombat is very simple, you choose your weapon and click on the enemy and it auto-fights for you. It has a very basic skill tree where you are able to choose if you want to put xp points into weapons, or into passive skills or into other benefits.\n\nThere is no voice acting, but there's reams of reading between conversations you have with other characters and in books you find.  If there had been voice acting I would either have been telling the screen to shut-up or skipped all dialogue options about half way through, so no voice is a positive rather than a complaint.\n\nThere are a number of different puzzles you have to solve to advance, and if you play a lot of puzzle games you would probably find them easy.  If you don't, then a couple of them will be frustratingly difficult.  Kids will probably need help with several of them.\n\nMost of your time in the game is spent looking for plants to pick and objects to pick up, many of the latter are hidden under or behind furniture which you are able to drag out of the way.  You can craft simple potions and a few weapons once you find or buy 'blueprints', as well as being able to buy what you need from several vendors.  Overall, the game is a really good training RPG.\n\nI have one big complaint about the game though, enough of one that I can't recommend it.  The game makers want to share their love of God with you.  One of the hidden books you find in the middle of the game, if you are a diligent searcher, has the entire Old Testament in it with the disclaimer that you aren't expected to read it if you don't want to but the Devs need to share their belief.  After that, the amount of times your character is told to pray because of danger is infuriating.  When I buy a game, especially a fantasy game, I am not paying for the Devs to evangelize at me.","December 29, 2014","false","29.9"," 74 of 102 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","74","102","5","3"

The (married) couple who are the devs really put their hearts into it, and it shows.\n\nIt's pretty family friendly and naive in a cutesy way, great for a younger audience, but the humor still hits home even for an old sod like me. The story is, like I stated quite linear, and it's very derivative of other RPGs, but it's presented in a way that I can't help but enjoy every second of. Besides there are a few really original sidequests in each area that give you plenty of stuff to do (and laugh at) while you play.\n\nOne thing I dislike are the slightly preachy Christian undertones, but it doesn't stop me from greatly enjoying this little gem. Very highly recommended for the price, and with bigger mods incoming you might get even more bang for your buck.\n\n*I played this before the steam release, but in it's final release.","January 3, 2014","true","0.1"," 91 of 135 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","91","135","0","0"

An extended love letter to Ultima VII and other adventure/RPGs of its era, it may not look like much, but it's a game with plenty of soul. While the plot isn't particularly amazing or original, the writing is consistently very light-hearted, genuinely funny, and manages to make even minor characters unique and memorable in just a handful of lines. It's rather short, but manages to feel like a complete, fulfilling experience all the same.

There are only a couple dozen different loot items, a bare handful of potions you can create, you can only play as a male character, and the religious undertones get more and more annoying - it starts off as a couple of monks and quotes (mostly harmless, but then there are a few about intellect being bad and faith being good). And then you find a copy of the entire new testament of the bible under a bookshelf. Games really shouldn't be a showcase for the developers' religious inclinations. Bad move.\n\nAdditionally, there are many plagiarised quotes where the author has not been noted, as well as the entire Black Knight sketch from Monty Python, again, with no credit.\n\nI'm glad I only paid $2.50 for it. But honestly, save yourself $2.50.","January 13, 2015","false","9.3"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","34","48","0","3"

Your father has been taken by the evil King Ixal and it’s your job to save everyone. Hey why not, everyone wants to be a hero right.\n\nDriftmoon is an action RPG somewhat like the old school classic Zelda. You return to your home to find the whole village turned to stone except for one of your friends. He tells you all what happened and that your father was taken hostage by the evil King Ixal. Your father has one of the crystals needed to raise the dead and become immortal.\n\nCollect weapons and armor, craft items, and complete missions to help level up. Each level you get one stat point and one skill point to build your character stronger. It was pretty fun to play for a while but I grew tired over time with the mass amount of reading in the game. Enemies also became tedious in fighting since it was mostly a small variety of different types. This is understandable though as it’s not a big budget game.\n\nOverall the game is worth checking out. The story was pretty good and had some laughs and can give you plenty of play time with the main game. There is also editing tools to make your own mods. There were a few mods out for it when I played but nothing that peeked my interest and I also did spend any time creating any because I’m just not skilled enough for that.\n\nBaer Rating: 7/10","March 21, 2014","true","18.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","2"

The game starts a bit slow, but the pace improves quickly and then you will be hooked. The sensation of 'What is next?" is present throughout the game.\n\nThe skill and stats trees are simple but effective, you won't feel overpowered so combat needs your attention everytime or you will die more often than not. It is a system that makes things interesting because combat is a nice distraction from exploring, chatting with npcs and completing quests.\n\nI have not touched the technical aspects of the game for a simple reason, you have to consider the small budget and team who developed the game. Obviously the graphics are outdated, the music is scarce but I prefer a game with a good plot and characters rather than a visual masterpiece with a hollow heart.\n\nAll things considered, I wholeheartedly recommend anyone to sink into the story of Driftmoon, you will be back asking for more :)","September 7, 2014","true","9.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It looked pretty cool though, so I thought I would give it a try, and I am glad that I did.\nIt's not the sort of game that will blow your mind, but what it does, it does well, and is the true definition of a solid game. An RPG that has similarities to Zelda-esque games as far as art style and even mapping to an extent, but without really trying to be that at all. In fact, I would say this game does a good job of establishing its own identity, even though you will find it to be similar to other games. You are basically witnessing the developers influences, but enjoying their own vision.\nThe game incorporates a lot of pop culture references. The Holy Grail references will be the most identifiable, but there are plenty.\nThe story itself is solid (pretty much the "a great evil has entered the world and you must try to save the world and everybody in it" type tale), as is the gameplay. The combat is fun and real time, there are plenty of traps and some decent puzzles. It's really a nice (pleasant even) game that does everything right and really nothing wrong, without trying to be something it's not,and manages to do all that without falling into the trap of doing more than it should. In a way, it is hard to describe this game because it is so uniformly solid, that, while not a great game, is in fact a very good game and one worthy of your attention. It took me about 9 hours to finish, and I'm not the fastest gamer I imagine you could finish it in under 4 if you really wanted to, and weren't worried about completing everything.\nI recommend trying it out. I think it deserves 7 out of 10, and probably 74 out of 100.","July 26, 2014","true","11.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

I can't even remember when or how I got it but it always seemed to be the game I passed on as it looked boring. Finally started it over the Xmas holiday and boy I am glad I did. I went into the game not knowing to much about it, I thought I would play for 5 mins and turn it off, maybe this is what made it good as I had no expectations of it at all apart from thinking it would be bad.\n\nThe game itself has some pretty rubbish graphics, graphics do not bother me anyway but the graphics did add to the charm the game has. The music was well done and never got on my nerves, the combat in this game is pretty bad but again that also adds to the charm I think. This game really shines with the story and the character, I do not want to give away the story although it is a pretty simple story it was told really really well. The characters were all good none of them bothered me at all, the humour was also pretty spot on.\n\nAll in all I spent about 17 hours in the game, some of this time I was AFK doing stuff so I think a more realistic length if you read everything would out you around the 14/15 hour mark of total gameplay. I have roughly 600 games on Steam and I was going through a patch where all games bored me after 5-10 mins. This one had me hooked all the way through from start to finish. I have no idea why the game does not get much love unless people all thought it would be rubbish like I first did.\n\nThe game is a very simple RPG but it was a lot of fun and  I am very glad I played it in the end.\n\nSolid 7/10 is my rating and I look forward to what this Dev team does next and I will buy it without a second thought.","January 2, 2015","true","17.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

The writing is infused with a very European sense of humour, and it wears its influences proudly. The story isn't particularly deep, but the characters are witty, eccentric and weird, including pirate-talking crabs and condescending panthers. It's all set in a rustic world that's packed with little details and witticisms, and while the graphics and art aren't going to set your world on fire, the simple physics and lighting system is enough to sell it. I thought its only weakness was the combat, which is best described as serviceable: click on monster and you (plus companions) auto-attack, with damage and attack speed based on your character's stats. You can also "cast" various abilities and buffs to assist, but really there's not much strategy to it except at the higher difficulties, but that seems somewhat counter to the gently charming feel of the world for some reason. I was happy to move on from combat and continue the story, and meet another of Driftmoon's crazy inhabitants, then bumble along beaches and caverns looking for tantalising goodies. And if you like searching for hidden items strewn across the maps, behind doors and under tables, you'll be right at home.","September 27, 2014","true","12.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I have not had such fun in an RPG game for sometime. But I must say for a two person team Driftmoon is excellent fun indeed. Some of the NPC's are rather unique and have some interesting story interaction, querky comments, and the oddest of vendors you find here and there.\n\nI have had a great time already playing through Driftmoon, and some fun looking around trying to find everything I can on each and every area. I recommend reading al the comments from the NPC's (As I know a lot of us skip through the conversations quickly in most rpg's) read the books and notes you find, they give you a lot of clues to your quests, and lore of monsters around the world.\n\nThe quests though not brain taxing to work out, fit into the gameworld well, make you think just enough so not to get yourself flustered about how to complete the quests and I have had a good chuckle or two reading some of the dialogue from the npc's that assist and also attack you.\n\nSkill system is rudamentary, but works really well, you also have a stats section for Strength, Constitution, Intel, Dexterity and Agility. A talent system with passive and activated skills to use on your travels. A basic crafting system to make potions, arrows etc - which is made from found bits and pieces around the world and from creatures.\n\nIt also comes with a mod toolset - not looked into much yet, but does seem to be interesting. There is already some mods out and I am sure many more to come.\n\nFor the price on Steam, Driftmoon is a great addition to anyone who enjoys RPG games.\n\nWell done to the Two person Dev Team to bring a great little title out to the RPG gaming community.","January 3, 2014","true","3.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Driftmoon reminds me of earlier RPG games,  with a twist of Harry Potter and Little Big Adventure thrown in. I have read reviews criticising the game's soundtrack and graphics, which in both cases were not an issue for me. I wouldn't expect a game with AAA graphics for the price but everything here is well crafted and works. I really like the humour within some of the characters and the item names. The dev(s) have known when to use sound thoughtfully, and there are no annoying voice overs either. It is text-laden in character dialogue, i'll admit to skipping a little of this in order to advance!\n\nThe puzzles are simple but make you think, and inventory is well organised borrowing from a Torchlight style UI. The only big criticsm I have is that one of the game's useful mechanics (being able to move items around with your mouse to find hidden items) isn't really mentioned in the initial area of the game - I stumbled over this by accident, and would have liked to have known from the start. Lots of secrets, puzzles to solve, questing, levelling up and cool characters.

There were low-fi graphics, point-and-click pickups, skill trees that were obviously more useful than others, and tutorials of questionable utility. In many ways, Driftmoon reminds me of Runescape. The graphics are a bit better, the game tries along the way to sortof let you know how to play but not really, and some of the skills are clearly better than others. They are similar enough that I almost missed the mining bots taking up all the resources and the griefers trying to kill me every 30 seconds. Almost.\n\nThis game had a small production crew, and it shows. Having said that, this game is also gotod for what it is. The story is decent, albeit predictable. The music becomes part of the background, and while it isn't remarkable per se it at least does you the favour of not breaking your immersion. Quests are well-defined and none of them seemed to be broken.

You can even feel good or bad for the characters if you are some kind of sentimental person.\n\nI recommend this game. Not for its full price maybe, but its fine with a discount.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #51 - Driftmoon\n\nAt first glance, Driftmoon doesn't seem that impressive.  The visuals don't exactly stick out, not to mention being stuck in a top down view with very limited camera movement.  This isn't one of those RPGs where you get to customize your character, or even pick a gender for that matter.\n\nBut, if you are willing to put these things aside, what you get in return is a rather casual, but fun adventure game.  While you can't customize the look of your character, there are a number of other RPG elements.  You have a "skill tree" of sorts that you can spend points on each time you level up.  And you'll definitely be upgrading your weapons and armor as you go.\n\nCombat itself is fairly simplistic.  You have your choice between melee or ranged attacks (once you find a bow), and you also have a hotbar which you can equip with items or skills.  You'll be disappointed if you are looking for strategy, as it's pretty much a click fest.\n\nIt really seems like Driftmoon is most focused on telling it's story.  In my first hour, I did get into some fights, and found various items, including equiment upgrades for my character.  But the majority of my time was spent exploring the starting village I was in.   Driftmoon wastes no time in dropping you right into a mystery involving your parents, and your search for them in the village and eventually beyond.  Driftmoon doesn't try to overwhelm you with details about the world at large, but rather doles out bits here and there as you go.\n\nAs you might expect with a story driven game, expect to be reading lots of text.  You'll run across quite a few books to read.   Conversations are all text based, with no voice acting.  Many conversations will have multiple dialog options, but these options aren't exclusive.  Instead you are just picking the order in which you say things or ask questions.\n\nI liked some of the characters I met, and there's definitely a light-heartedness and charm to the game.  There was a point in the game where I got in a fight with a talking crab over some arrows I stole.  It definitely made me realize this was not your typical fantasy elves and dwarves setting.\n\nOverall I had fun, but whether you like it or not will really depend on what you like in RPGs.  If you like games like Dark Souls that are heavily focused on combat, then you probably won't be into this.  But if you enjoy exploring, finding hidden items, and reading lots of story, then Driftmoon will feel like a natural fit.","March 16","true","1.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Completing it actually made me feel satisfied, achieved, and bittersweet. I never could expect what was going to happen next in regards to the storyline... and I was very surprised at how random, yet inevitably connected the interactions and quests with the NPCs all around were. Battle-wise, it was starkingly simple, but I had no problem with that. It allowed me to explore all around more without being hindered unnecessarily. However, I felt that it was quite a waste to have no need to make the items available via blueprints. My plundering spirit collected a load of stuff that just stayed useless in my inventory all the way through.\n\nI really enjoyed Driftmoon. It's more than just a game to play; it's a wonderful story told by becoming a part of it. There were always new things to look at, to do, puzzles and mini-games that... sorta made sense, and there was never a dull, dragging moment. So... I'm going to play it again. :)\n\nThank you, for producing this lovely game.\n(P.S.: I'm glad that my efforts in peeling off every chair and sarcophagus off the ground were worth it.)","August 10, 2014","true","13.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The graphical style is very attractive but not overly demanding on my poor processor and video card. Don't play it expecting a challenge, however: the final boss took me all of about 15 seconds to beat, and it really didn't get any harder than that throughout the game. There is a food system but the base game doesn't offer any real risk of starving, since food is so plentiful. Crafting is useful, but, again, resources are so plentiful that there's no worry of running out of potions or arrows. I liked the combat system (just pick a target and then focus on maneuvering/dodging and strategy while your character attacks automatically), but the base game just isn't designed to be a challenge. It's not so much about difficulty as story.\n\nThe story is interesting and quite well-written, though the moral overtones and dialogue options got under my skin a little at times. Many times there are "options" which are really just a choice between being "good" to progress, or losing the game by choosing "evil" (and having to reload from your last save). Not a lot of flexibility as to how you play - you be the hero exactly in the way the developers intend, or the game ends (or, at least, it fails to progress until you pick the right option).\n\nThe real draw for me, though, is the potential. Mods appear to be fairly easy to create, giving users the freedom to develop their own games. There are a lot of possibilities here. You can write your own story, create a game where your goal is to survive without starving to death, create really challenging combat situations, add more difficult and complex crafting, and so on. There are already simple mods like one allowing you to play as a girl (THANK you), and even a few stand-alone stories. I expect to see this grow as more users get into making their own. As the library of available mods grows, Driftmoon will be worth getting even if you have no interest in the base game, because of the many possibilities of playing.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing through the game, and look forward to seeing what mods crop up (and if I can find the time, I'd like to make one of my own).","January 11, 2014","true","7.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The graphics are simple, the controls are straightforward, the story is definitely aimed at the younger set and the skills aren't terribly complex.  That said, combat is quick and fun, with just enough variation and challenge to be enjoyable without being overbearing, and there are enough skill choices and options to feel like you're both making progress, and making the lead character your own.\n\nIf anything, my biggest complaint is that there isn't quite enough game to fully explore the possibilities of crafting, gear and harder enemies that might have come into play with a larger game or a longer story.  Not that the story provided is too short -- it's exactly the right size.  And even if it was too short, there's a modding tool, so there may be community offerings soon too.\n\nGraphics 2/5, Gameplay 3/5, Story 3/5, Overall 4/5.

I didn't expect much going in but was pleasantly surprised at how high quality the game turned out to be.\n\nGameplay is mostly pretty simple with standard WASD movement from a top-down perspective and realtime autoattacking combat with a skill hotbar.  The unique element is the physics system which lets you drag many objects around, revealing hidden objects and clearing/blocking paths.  It is also utilized for some puzzles making them pretty unique among RPGs.\n\nThe real strength of Driftmoon lies in the writing which is not only high quality for an RPG but surprisingly humorous which can be quite difficult to pull off, especially when the game has no voice acting.  While the game is pretty short for an RPG, it maintains that quality throughout.  Most players should expect more than the 5.5 hours it took me as I clicked through the dialogue pretty fast and tend to play games in a time-efficient manner (and don't forget the game lets you fast-travel between points of interest within each area.)  The game also has mod support which can add some additional playtime.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick humorous RPG, look no further.

There are more than a few of the big games that have slight or small bugs with its UI but Driftmoon basically has none of them.\nWithout spoiling anything, Driftmoon had a good and relaxing story, maybe a little more climactic for the younger audience, especially the RPG and item mechanics, but the story itself seemed to be rather good for all ages. Though, a bit predictable for those who are seasoned in stories, plots, and can guess at what's to come. The story includes many amusing scenes or quests as you come by them, though still for the younger audience it still made me laugh too.\n\nDriftmoon is most likely worth the $17 (CAD) if you're up for a good adventure story, just don't expect any fancy graphics from those $70 games to go along with it.","March 30, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely recommended, even if you're a newbie to RPGs.  While the storyline is  linear and it's always obvious where your next checkpoint is, you still have decent freedom to explore a large and detailed map to discover sidequests.\n\nPros:\n- You can equip your companions with your own equipment.\n- When your companions follow you around the map, they will automatically comment on things that are interesting to them, e.g.  Word's comment when he passed by a petrified statue of his father in the final dungeon\n- Instant teleportation to different points on the map\n- Lots of craftable items to collect as you walk around\n- Inventory that allows you to hold most of the items you pick up during the game\n- Auto-regeneration of health using the food system (food is plentiful throughout the game)\n- Varied enemies\n- Plenty of side quests\n- Secret areas\n- Most small items can be dragged around to possibly reveal hidden treasures\n- Fluid controls\n-  All the characters you've built a rapport with come to support you in the final dungeon.  I really liked how it's a reminder of the friends you've made in the game.\n- Interesting NPCs, all of whom have their own personality.\n- The game automatically pauses right before you're about to die, giving you time to take a health potion.\n- Multiple endings depending on your actions near the end of the game!\n\n\nCons:\n- Lots and lots of dialogue.  They can be funny and helps to imbue the NPC with personality, but sometimes I just get bored and click through it rapidly.  Most of it isn't necessary for advancing the plot.\n- The final boss was a bit too easy.\n- I would really have liked to be able to explore the entire world after the story ends, so that I can continue my search for the silver feathers.","April 2","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although I always prefer in a game like this for there to be options in regards to gender, the game has a wonderfully open mod system, reminiscent of Dink Smallwood. This means the entire game can be replicated and played through as another gender, for example, or an entirely new game built from the existing assets and code base. Achievements are supposed to work while playing through the mods, but I haven't tested that yet. Multiple difficulty levels are available, and the puzzles in the game are not complex or difficult to execute. The script is often witty, rife with references to nerd culture, and more often than not the player can talk their way out problems. The player is also better rewarded long-term for choosing virtuous paths over less virtuous, which is a refreshing change right now. The latter two are probably informed by the developers' Christian beliefs, which affect the narrative and led them to leave two New Testaments in the game. It's unobtrusive though, and anyone who enjoys Tolkein or Lewis will likewise enjoy this game (I'm not Christian, myself).","May 7","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Driftmoon fits into that category very well, having been made over a period of 7 years by a couple with children. That's an insane amount of time to dedicate to finishing a project, but the love, care and attention shown to the game has resulted in something quite interesting and special.\n\nDriftmoon is an RPG in the mold of Diablo, although very much simplfied and nowhere near as well polished. I'm not saying that to detract from the game, it's just the reality of having not much in the way of a budget and building an engine that isn't as powerful. While this game's combat sections leave something to be desired, where Driftmoons shines is in its strong writing and well-developed characters. There's nothing terribly original about the story, but it's all well-written and filled with funny, light-hearted moments. There are references to Monkey Island and The Hobbit woven in, and while these references are perhaps a little too on the nose it's still a sign of how much the two developers love these properties. You can feel a surge of passion and dedication throughout the experience.\n\nI managed to finish the game comfortably at nearly 9 hours in, and I did a lot of exploring and looking around for items. You could probably squeeze more hours out of the game by looking for all of the goldfish and the silver feathers, items you'll come to understand more about as you play, but I felt happy that I'd finished the game, completed all the quests and met some interesting, unique characters along the way. I definitely recommend Driftmoon, as its charms are easy to see even with all of the rough bits and lack of polish. This isn't a game you're playing for the looks or even a great combat system; you're playing for the journey and for the writing, and in those aspects Driftmoon is a strong success. Give it a go.","February 13","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I do reccomend this game however I would wait for a good special or a bundle somewhere, the price tag is a bit steep for the lack of content and duration seeing as most of the "game" is coming from the conversations being had between the various characters you meet throughout your journey.\n\nOn to the one negative...\n\nI also have one major complaint about the game in which can easily be overlooked, but thankfully with a bit of exploring you can come across this rather irritating piece of content. I'll just quote it from ganmelajo[/b].\n\nI have one big complaint about the game though, enough of one that I can't recommend it. The game makers want to share their love of God with you. One of the hidden books you find in the middle of the game, if you are a diligent searcher, has the entire Old Testament in it with the disclaimer that you aren't expected to read it if you don't want to but the Devs need to share their belief. After that, the amount of times your character is told to pray because of danger is infuriating.

The game overall feels like it would be something I'd let my young child play if they were interested in a role-playing-game. The dialogue is very child like and the world is super colorful and vibrant. The combat is very easy (even on hard) and exploration is time consuming. The game functions though, and within its self it is fun to play, and fun to explore the environments. It feels like the type of game I'd hand my son for his first rpg. I don't feel like this game is for everyone, even hardcore rpg, dungeon crawler fans. It's an acquired taste.\n\nI'd give it a 7/10, because of the poor visuals, poor music, and child-like dialogue. It's definitely fun in its own ways, and I think that there is a select audience that will cherish this game.","January 16, 2014","false","0.7"," 24 of 48 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","24","48","0","0"

I basically never turn my computer off) . ...\n\nIt has some awkward moments.\nSome are based on the fact that the game teaches you early on to move everything you can move in order to find everything. So you are often move heavy things around .... which move awkwardly slowly... taking almost forever.\n\nSome are based on the wired life death mythology in the story and background story ... and the often all too present ingame god which is looming over ones head all the time.\nIMHO I have figured out the reason for these two more below.\n\nSome are based plot holes ... and that character come and go seemingly for not good reason at all and spurting all the stuff you gave them all over the floor ... all the time.\n\nAnd some are based on the interface ... it is the first time that not only the hotbar seems kinda useless ... since 1st you can pause the game any time and 2nd the game is also paused when in inventory mode, but also dangerous since you actually drop things (on the floor) that you pull out of your hotbar. No other game does this. It took me some time to figure out why I was missing (important) stuff ... and which was the save game I had to go back to.... (lost at least half an hour of playing)\nIn general there is also too much text ... and I couldn't figure out why I didn't feel to read any of it... in other games I often read ahead of the (here missing*) voice acting and skip it one I am done (and the actor is at most in the middle) ... since childhood I also have read many books and even read some in English (which is ... since it is not my native language ... sometimes more tiresome).\n\nAlso the game for some reason didn't recognized any achievement I made... I am sure I almost have all of them (not sure if I found all goldfishes***, and I surly didn't create a mod****)\n\nAnd there is at least one NOGO in this game ... a hidden book ... a (whole) Bible ... and the author of the game blabbering directly about his faith. Aside from that people of faith tend to have be a tremendous stupid side since they literally literally believe in fairy tales ... which they outright call stupid if they would be appear anywhere else than THEIR holy book, it also does  nothing to do with creating a game.\nKEEP YOUR FAITH TO YOU, WILL YA?\nI can't see this as nothing other than a very ♥♥♥♥ty attempt to spread "the good news".\n... actually no ... I was about to ranting on about this ... but I am stopped myself doing it ... since it also has nothing to do with a video game review ...This also explains IMHO some of the awkward mythology and that there is 1st only one god and 2nd that he is constantly mentioned** in this game.\n\nAnyway if it wasn't for this NOGO I would recommend this game. (If Steam would let me I would neither recommend it nor the opposite ... but since I don't have this option I only can't recommend it)\n\n------------\nFootnote(s):\n*= To keep it fair here ... that game is on the cheap side and voice acting (as long as you don't have a bunch of volunteers ... not only for the acting but for the editing as well) is expensive ... and the author probably even didn't know if he would sell enough copies to have a black 0 at the end of the bill if he does it...\nSo expecting voice acting is a little too much.\n**= So to speak omnipresent.\n***= While thinking about it ... it this another wired Jesus thing?\n****= Awkwardly enough it only allows one mod at a time ... so I couldn't use the mod with the better inventory backgrounds at the same time as the sister mod ... Yeah, ... I only played it as female character... maybe the mod bolzed the achievements up.\n\nSorry ... since Steam has no preview I was in need of editing it a few times.","May 18, 2015","false","30.8"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

While I can see Driftmoon could become a great game one day, it's not currently in a very enjoyable state. I'm struggling to see at this stage what it's going to offer other than another playable, top-down Diablo-style RPG. The combat feels like an MMO, with auto-attack and skills about as far as it goes. It just doesn't feel like it's going to offer anything different or fresh at this stage. Additionally, this writing is verbose and hit-and-miss in my opinion. Some of the characters and conversations that are clearly intended to be funny fall flat and just seem plain wierd. The other conversation options present reems of unneccessary dialogue that only really serves to bore you into clicking past it.","June 22, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I had a different opinion on it compared to 99% of the playerbase, I knew I had to agree with the majority and I knew how many downvotes I would get If I decided not to.\n\nSo now I'm reviewing the game again in more detail and saying exactly why I decided to give it a negative review.. but I don't think I can do it. I was capable of playing the game perfectly but I couldn't enjoy the combat and boring, mostly Point & Click gameplay. I am biased because Point & Click games aren't my thing. I always wanted to give Point & Click games like Driftmoon a chance but I know I can never truly appreciate them like a casual player of console games can't appreciate the better gameplay options of a PC. I couldn't tell exactly why back then because I was so embarassed to say it, but now I confess. I didn't like the game.\n\nThe game was my biggest attempt at getting into adventure games... Driftmoon was bringing the best of Point & Click gameplay and combat design to the new brilliant medium of adventurous RPGs.\n\nEven though there's a spark of love left for the fans of this genre, I'm pretty sure deep down inside I can't give it more than 6/10 myself.","June 17, 2014","false","0.6"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","0"

I really enjoyed this game, though I didn't finish it.\nPROS\n- Its filled to the brim with funny quips as you explore the world. Though a bit cheesy or quirky, it still made me smile.\n-Combat has many intersting abilities to keep things interesting.\n-World is very well fleshed-out and detailed. Many things to discover and collect - many sidequests.\n-Characters are fun, quirky and have nice portraits -  a nice touch. They are very optimistic and friendly, EVEN SKELETONS!\n-Story makes you go through many cool places - a nice adventure - and you even get companions sometimes! Don't forget boss fights!\n\nCONS\n-Music is amateurish from the get-go. Its kinda cute and happy, but it still got annoying after a while. Sound effects aren't great either.\n-Graphics aren't the prettiest, but coming from an indy dev, its to be expected.\n-Combat doesn't evolve very well. What I mean by that is that though you get many new abilities, there is no incentive to use them - you can just stick to 1-3 skills and wail on enemies along with your companions and phone it in.\n-Your saves aren't transfered over to the cloud. This was a big issue for me because my computer got a virus and I had to wipe everything. Unfortunatly, I lost all my progress and I never finished it.\n-No replayability. Its perfectly linear and has no branching paths. There might be other possibilities with the game engine, but I didn't check those out.\n-Puzzles are frustrating and clunky. Mainly they have to do with moving blocks around or whatever and it was just tedious and not fun.\n-No co-op. There are often if not always a companion with you so its shame a friend couldn't hop in in local play.\n\nAll in all, I really recommend this to anyone that's looking for a cute, happy, cheerful, funny little RPG to have a jolly good time.","September 17, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
