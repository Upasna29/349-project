I had to do the tutorial, a short scenario and watched a couple of youtube videos. The battle mechanics are similar to HOI3, it's even more detailed because you are actually fighting for ground and not just provinces. There is also a little more micro management of units because the divisions are split into various parts. For example Panzer 1 will have 4 separate Panzer brigades, so you will have to move each one separately or as a group. in HOI 3 you just move the entire division around from province to province.\n\nJust one mooooore tuuuuuurn.\n\nP.S. I opened the game for about 30 minutes so steam would let me do a review. But I've played for much longer.","May 10, 2015","true","0.4"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","15"

Each turn You get some amount of equipment of different types (different models of guns, armor, trucks, infantry, speciality units, etc.). Unused equipment is automatically stockpiled in Your main HQ unit and then it is distributed to the frontlines, where it is needed. You can even force Your units to redistribute some equipment back to the HQ resource pool and then back to other units that needs that equipment more. You can designate a new type for Your division and it will automatically get a new equipment to fulfill that role. You will need to keep supply routes open for that and need a bit of patience because it will not happen automatically. This is really nice feature to play around and see how Your force evolves.","November 26, 2015","true","66.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Even on easy, i still havent managed to get passed the second scenario on time. Frustrating as that is though, it does leave me wanting to try again , and so i guess in that sense , its very good value for money.\nThe larger campaign maps are very large indeed,  dare i say a little too large for my liking, as i find them difficult to control. but they seem very detailed and its quite the job keeping tabs on whats going on.\nSadly the time clock doesnt seem to work in days , rather 2 or 3 days increments ,  which i find a little odd, as it makes hard work of the plan making and also knowing how many moves you have left.\nBut all in all, its really good fun. and despite not being very good at it yet, i promise i will  try harder. cheers.","January 16","true","54.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It has all the operational fun with new strategic considerations.  Dictators set objectives, allies and command can paralyze, reinforcements and replacements come in based on perceived importance of the front, etc.  This is all the fun of DC1, but with a new strategic aspect and longer term considerations.  Do I really want to bash Wiking through that river, or should I let them rest and rail them to the center?\n\n10/10 wish I were better at PBEM.","July 9, 2015","true","128.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Historically accurate simulation of Operation "Blau" from both the German and Soviet perspective of the 1942-43 campaign in Southern Russia. Well worth the money spent on the game.","July 6, 2015","true","146.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
