It actually must of taken this guy a decent amount of time to sort out all these models and levels in the style he wanted. The music is the game could have been vastly improved however overall a decent little punt for £2.37. I couldnt help but record a montage for it xD\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um6TP4X8HbQ","March 19","true","0.5"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","17","27","6","0"

Don’t write this game off before you’ve given it an opportunity. That’s the easiest thing to do when looking at the game’s screenshots and the trailer video. The game doesn’t look like much from some simple sampling. But there’s been an unbelievable amount of work go into the artistry and the development of the game and honestly it’s well worth your while to give it a play. The reason why I say this is because I almost laughed the game off without giving it an opportunity myself. The game play initially reminded me of the type of first year game developers classes that various universities are offering around the world. It reminded me of my first year IT programming unit. But I’m glad that I sat back and asked if I was giving the game the chance that it deserved to which I very quickly realized that I wasn’t so I engaged myself with the content and found that I was having more fun than I thought that was possible.\n\nIn One Man is Not No Man you control the combatant of your choice against hordes of enemies who are trying to dethrone the king. It’s a pretty simple concept that is well executed and well designed. Each of the four characters that you can play are significantly different from the other with each having their own special abilities and powers. You control your hero with the WASD keys and attack using the left and right mouse buttons. These mechanics are easy to play yet the game becomes difficult to absolutely master the further into the game you play.\n\nWhat makes the game stand out is that each and every character in the game is made out of modelling clay. This provides the characters a distinct and unique look when compared to similar games. This would have taken such an insane amount of time considering the detail that they are given. It somewhat reminded me of\n\nAs always I would love for all developers of Steam games to incorporate achievements and trading cards into their games. They’ve both become very important marketing aspects of the product that they’re pushing to the consumer and without them they’re losing some of their potential purchasers to other games that have incorporated them into their games. That’s truly the biggest flaw with the game in my opinion. The game can become a little bit repetitive but given that there are four characters that you can choose to play as this is somewhat minimized.\n\nSo please give One Man is Not No Man an opportunity. I believe that you will be pleasantly surprised that you did.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This will get you the best food of the surrounding areas. You can choose between a lots of different weapons like short swords a triple crossbow and many others. You can also choose between survival and story mode. There are also many different power ups that make the Game even better!\nThe Game itself and all its figures are made out of modelling clay which makes the Game look awesome, and the in Game cursor is the most awesome I have ever seen. The controls are also very easy to master and together with the simple Game mechanics this Game is great fun to play. Also the sounds are very nice and the humour of the Game is really entertaining.\nYet I haven’t discovered any bugs and the developer seems to be very friendly. I suggest you to give this awesome Game a try. In my opinion this Game is very well done and it’s worth the $4.\n\nRating:\n7.9/10\n\nPros:  Well-made Game\nNice Game mechanics\nSimple Controls\nA lot of different Items\nWorks also on older devices\nWell-chosen music\nNice Game design(modelling clay)\nCons:   No Achievements + Trading Cards\nHardware Information\n\nHardware   Type     Monitor   BENQ 24 inch 1ms    Headphones   Apple Earpods    Keyboard   Dell Basic Keyboard/ Integrated Alienware Keyboard     Controller   Xbox 360    Mouse   Zelotes T-90    Microphone   Integrated Laptop Micro    OS   Windows 7","March 21","true","3.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Feels like a newgrounds flashgame, worth the money (kinda). Something's missing.\n\nI think this game needs improvement, seeing that there's only five enemy types. The health seems perfectly balanced, though. So I don't really care about the hordes upon hordes of enemies.\n\n\nAll in all, I think this game deserves a sequel. It's worth the four bucks for its unique style and gameplay, but rewards aren't exactly something that will keep driving everyone back to play more and more of this game.\n\nWhat I'd say is, if that there's more things. Maybe more enemy types, more classes, more areas, maybe skills. I don't know. I don't make games.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's (kind of) worth the money, if it's at a huge discount. (E.G PAST %25 OFF), I'd reccomend it. And if you have some spare change lying around, I'd say go for it. But alone, as it is. It feels like there's something missing. I even beat the game in one go, not going past %50 HP.\n\nI rate it 6/10 Kevin Bacons. It's not even close to being 'meh', but it's not close to being fantastic or bad. Indie games have done way better, and have been way bigger. Reach for the stars, and you'll make a better game. And I'll be there to buy it.\n\n\n(Jim F. Ing. Sterling army Represent.)\n\nP.S, how did you guys make the soundtrack? E.G, what program did you make it in, if any. Did you make it by hand? I kind of dig it, but it is, too. Missing something.","March 21","true","0.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
