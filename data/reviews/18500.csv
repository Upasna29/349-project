Being able to place your towers in such a way that it forces the baddies to take longer paths is extremely enjoyable and challenging.\n\nKey features:\n\n- Block baddies just as they're getting near your cores, forcing them to re-route.\n- Bounce a train of baddies back and forth between two paths by repeatedly opening one and blocking the other.\n- Unspent money earns interest so if you build just the towers you need, you'll have even more money later on.\n- Create "kill zones" with your most powerful towers + slowing towers + bonus money towers to maximize efficiency.\n- Cool story with some great DLC (The Portal cross-over DLC is top notch)\n- Alternate modes/achievements will keep you playing for a long time","June 28, 2014","true","241.9"," 70 of 75 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","70","75","0","0"

The game is very simple to play, pick a tower type, choose where you want to put it, watch it kill aliens. The aliens are trying to steal power cores, your job is to kill the aliens before they can make off with them. You start with limited money, but gain more by killing aliens. The challenge comes from making the best tactical use of that money. You need to pick the optimum type of tower for the available locations to place them in. Some of the maps are cleverly designed to let you place towers  and divert the path the aliens take to the cores. Choose wisely and your towers will kill lots of aliens, earn you more money for more towers, and the power cores will be saved. Choose badly and you will slowly be overrun and the cores lost.\n\nAll of the maps have massive replayability with different modes offering different objectives. Your scores are also ranked against everyone else who has played. Think you found the optimum way to play a map? Take a look at the highscores and think again! Scores are based on the number of cores you managed to save, the money you have left at the end of a map and the sale value of the towers that you have built. The less you have spent, the better your score will be. Getting the highest scores requires using the bare minimum of towers leaving you constantly on the edge of failure.  Experiment, improve your tactics, watch your name rise through the ranks. There are literally 100's of hours worth of gameplay to be had from the main game, and 100's more from the DLC, which is all excellent.","November 25, 2013","true","556.3"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","59","64","0","6"

For perspective, it came out only a year after The Orange Box did. When it was first released, it was undeniably the best tower defense game in the world -- but that's not surprising, because its only competition was Desktop Tower Defense and a handful of other shoddy flash games that were starting to ride the trend.\n\nA lot of time has passed since then, and hundreds of weird and interesting tower defense games have been released. So, is Defense Grid still the best? ...Honestly, I have no clue. I haven't played as many tower defense games over the years as I would have liked, and I blame it all on the quality and longevity of this one.\n\nThe people who made Defense Grid understand where tower defense came from. Everything about this game is built to look, feel, and sound like retro StarCraft, from the isometric view, to the color choices, to the tower types and damage types. Gun towers are basically bunkers of marines, inferno towers are bunkers of firebats, cannon towers are bunkers of ghosts, and so on. They’ve even borrowed some classic towers from other games, like the tesla coils from the Red Alert series. Even today, it still hits me with that old 2002-era nostalgia of searching for tower defense maps on Battle.net and that pumped feeling of starting the map with a full lobby of people (because, of course, you needed a full lobby to even have a chance!)\n\nThe biggest reason why Defense Grid is so great is because of its scoring system, which rewards even the tiniest improvements in performance with exponentially more money and score. It appeals greatly to the gamer's OCD, since the better you play the beginning of a mission, the more freedom you have to build deadly mazes for the remainder of the mission, the easier victory becomes, and the more often you can see your score skyrocket into the hundreds of millions. Fast-forward and checkpoint-rewinding controls make it simple to re-do every wave until it is perfect. It also creates an ultra-hardcore metagame with a massive curve of leaderboard scores, if you’re into that kind of competition. You’ll need to learn some really annoying advanced techniques if you want to break into the top 100 on any mission, or you could choose to compete in maps and game modes where the techniques don’t apply. Or you could simply choose to compete with yourself and your friends, or just aim for the pre-set gold medals. It’s really up to you.\n\nI've got over 130 hours logged into this, and I'm finally coming down the home stretch of getting all the achievements. God, this game has a lot of content, thanks to over 4 years of continued support and expansion sets. The expansion sets are quite solid, too; at one point I thought I had found a strategy which works on any mission, but then the DLC campaigns came and changed all the rules, and made me rethink everything.\n\nIs Defense Grid still the best? Probably not, and I will have a lot of tower defense games to explore once I’m done with this one. But one thing is for certain: this game is the sole reason why future tower defense games had to start trying new things, because it got the basics about as perfect as they can possibly get… at least for those of us who still occasionally see hordes of zerglings filing through mazes of bunkers in our waking dreams.","April 19, 2015","true","139.6"," 46 of 46 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","46","46","4","1"

The balance and learning curve are manageable, with just the right level of challenge for players. The Voice acting is way above expectations for this price level, and the script is both funny and tragic in places. Once you've completed the story, the journey continues in a wide array of DLC, which is reasonably priced and well-sized. Also the range of "Challenge" levels like Go back through this stage using only machine guns make you rethink a map and re-creates it for you. If you only play one TD game (and you should try everything once, except incest and folk dancing) make it this one.","November 28, 2013","true","156.9"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"

The base game has plenty of maps and a great selection of different towers to place.   The game is very challenging to find all the right combo's of towers and also the placement of the towers.\n\nPlenty of different aliens make their way onto the map, learning what aliens are on each map will really affect what towers you will use.  Right clicking on an alien will provide much needed info about the alien to help you make tower choices. The UI for the game is very good, making it easy to get towers placed quickly. The wide variety of maps and types of games you can play on each map keeps the game fresh and keeps you coming back to play once again trying to get all gold medals on every type of game.\n\nThe story line also makes the game fun as well. I'm still playing the base game right now and nearly have story mode complete and already have 70+ hours logged on the game and am not bored with it one bit and I still have all the DLC to get into as well.\n\nI highly recommend this game as a good challenge but something you can sit down and play anytime.","May 26, 2015","true","98.5"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","5"

Tons of content.\nThe game allows for a ridiculous amount of customization, you have so many towers to choose from, and you will definitely have your favorites. There must be hundreds of ways to effectively crush the enemy.\n\ncombination of towers + tower placement and which towers you will upgrade first + the resource system (that gains interest depending on how much you have in the bank) gives you so many options for strategy.\n\neach map, and there are a lot, will have different challenges and modes - that allow for huge replay potential. different layouts and enemy pathing has you thinking tactically about how to maze the aliens into oblivion. easy checkpoint system that lets you go back in time in set intervals, meaning a small error will not force you to restart from wave 1 if you are going for that perfect run.\n\nPractice mode give you a ton of cash to perfect a strategy you want to apply once you play the map for real. Great voice acting for a tower defense. its just an amazing game.... I cannot think of a single fault for it. Enemies are varied wth nice animations. Towers look and sound good, upgrades improve their looks and fire effects.... its just obviously handled with a lot of care and love.\n\nIf you like tower defense - you would be hard pressed to find a better one than Defense Grid.\nIf you do, LET ME KNOW, because i would instantly buy that game too.\n\nI highly recommend this game for yourself, or even as a gift to strategy loving friends.\nThis game is AWESOME.","January 8","true","17.9"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","0"

Sometimes I'll settle into a favorite scenario that I know I can win, but do it with imposed restrictions -- not allowing myself to use certain towers.  Some just to zone out.\n\nI have enjoyed DG2, but not nearly as much.  Not sure I can pin down why.  Weird.  Too many voices, perhaps, and poorly delivered dialogue.\n\nDollar for dollar, Defense Grid is a super value.

I liked every aspect of the game. Level design, tower design, tower diversity, enemy types, economic system, soundtrack, effects, difficulty level, extra playable modes, the fact that tower placement shapes the aliens path. Everything is designed very carefully and delivers a perfect playing experience.\nI got all achievements and I'm still playing to earn the gold metal on every single mode of every level.\n\nI admit that the first time I played DG I looked down on it because it looked like a "small" game. That was on a friends computer before I finished the main campaign. Then I played it again a year later on my brothers computer and finished the main campaign again! Finally, this summer, I got it for myself and finished it again, plus every expansion that was available.\n\nI'd like also to note that the voice of Jim Ward, who voices the AI assisant, is a big plus for the game. It gives you the feeling you're together into the fight, with a person that shares his personal moments with you, even his craving for raspberries!!\n\nThe Containment, You monster, Resurgence and Borderlands expansions add greatly to the game, in playable levels but also in the story.\n\nAnd above all else is the Strategy. You may beat easily a level the first time, but it's certain you will come up with a better plan the second time you play the same level. And different game modes (like "out of bullets" or "shredder") will force you to adopt a completely different approach to beat the level. And all of this is done by placing just 10 different types of towers on those tiles. The game depth is incredible.\n\nI give this game a 100% with honors!

For example, the camera can't be rotated or zoomed out very far (which makes the range of some towers almost impossible to judge), the mouse cursor doesn't move freely (it just jumps from button to button), the UI is rather basic and text-based (no easily recognisable icons), and (perhaps more annoyingly) there is no way to see your score before you finish each map (which is just incomprehensible, since some of the challenges involve aiming for specific scores).\n\nAlso, there are almost no graphical options, no way to enable antialiasing in-game, no manual saves (it auto-saves at predetermined checkpoints, but you lose those checkpoints when you finish a map), and everything seems to have been dumbed down slightly to work on consoles and touchscreens. To give credit to the developers, those limitations aren't nearly as annoying here as in most console / tablet ports, but they still make the game worse than it could (and should) have been.\n\nFor the price I paid (under 3€), it's definitely worth a buy, and the same would probably hold true for anything under 10€.","October 2, 2015","true","88.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game has classic maze building maps and a plethora of towers  at your disposal. You play as a defender of your planet against a volatile alien race that must be destroyed at all costs. To help you accomplish this, you must protect power cores important to your planetary defenses. And what better way to increase your chances of success than an old soldier from the past, that has dealt with them before, whose consciousness is downloaded into a computer to aid you in this undertaking. Alright, maybe the story has a little cheese, but most people play tower defense games for the challenge and difficulty.\n\n\nThe graphics of Defense Grid are pretty good considering most tower defense games. I like how the zoom in feature has a lot of detail and eye candy. The sound effects are generic futuristic sci-fi. The game has music soundtracks on the levels to help set the mood and they aren't all bad. (OK so you wouldn't play this game for the music.) This game scores you on a badge system, bronze being the worst. To get a higher score you have to finish the level with a higher resource number, which can be a challenge if you are use to spamming towers. (So, just don't.) There are also different types of modes/challenges per level which will have you reloading plenty of times. (Yes, the backspace key is your friend.)\n\n\nDefense Grid: The Awakening will have you hooked for hours trying to get gold badges and achievement hunting. If you like sci-fi settings and tower defense games this game is a must have.\n\n\nHappy gaming.","April 19, 2015","true","52.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

These type of games are all about strategy and experimentation.  You have ten different towers available in each level and have to find the best way to kill all the enemies before they can escape the map.  Unlike the early tower defense games in Warcraft III, Defense Grid has a set number of places where you can build so it becomes important to learn how best to use the space you have and what towers should go where.  You can also shape the paths that enemies take (you always want them to take the longer and more difficult path) which is a cool innovation for the genre.  The designers were smart to put a fast forward button in Defense Grid.  It helps more experienced players get through most maps in 10-15 minutes.  The only downside is much like the Run button in Final Fantasy 7, you have to hold down the F key for long period of times which does get tiring.  It is almost as if a slow down button would have been better than the fast forward.\n\nThe most important thing is that this game is fun and even addictive at times.  There are over hundred-fifty different modes in the base game alone.  A new player to Tower Defense may find that this game can be challenging without a good strategy so I highly recommend checking out Youtube for any levels that give you trouble as there are lots of good strategies already out there.\n\nStory - Like a lot of action-oriented games, Defense Grid tries to have a story when there really isn't room for an interesting one.  It is more like there is an "announcer" for the game who makes comments about certain things and encourages you to beat the game essentially.  The story does not get in the way or waste any of your time which is probably for the best.\n\nPresentation (Graphics and Sound) - The graphics in Defense Grid are not very impressive but that isn't the reason you play a game like this either.  The textures are not very detailed and look aged, but this has a nearly top-down and zoomed out camera so it is hard to make the graphics look that great anyway.  The effects of the towers do look good and the game never lags no matter how much action is going on.  This is a plus because old tower defense games could not handle huge waves of enemies.  The sound is good with nice explosion sounds and the announcer is charming and never gets annoying.  What little music is in the game is very good.  If you play through everything in Defense Grid, the music will eventually get repetitive and you'll probably want to listen to something else instead but that is true of any game you play for a long time.\n\nOverall Score - Defense Grid is a great game if you enjoy Tower Defense.  It is probably daunting to a beginner, but if you know you like these kind of games, this is easily the best 2D one on Steam at the time of this revew.  This game is now cheap and if you catch it on sale, it is an incredible value.  There are three DLC packs and all three of them are pretty good and add new level designs to the game.  One is tied into Portal so if you like Glados,  you will definitely like that.  While it took me just over 100 hours, this game is pretty easy to get all the achievements.  A few achievements are a grind, but every achievement is pretty easy to get and there are plenty of videos on Youtube to help you figure out how to get them.  I never expected to play this game so much, but the fact that it is fun kept me playing for over 100 hours.\n\n8.0 (out of 10)","February 23, 2014","true","103.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game has a tantalizing blend of simplicity, planning, general enjoyment and even graphics. One of the largest pluses to Defense Grid is that it allows you to progressively shape the path your alien foe take. You can also set up "kill zones," places where you concentrate your best towers and where most of the killing happens, hence the name.\n\nAnother huge twist in Defense Grid is that your enemies have to go to a central hub to take a power core, essentially hitpoints. If you kill an alien who is holding a core, the core will progressively float back to the hub unless another alien grabs it. This makes strategy much deeper than "don't let them get to the end."\n\nYour AI friend who is booted up in the prologue is your constant companion, giving you tips and commenting on how you're doing or what's going on (this has saved my ♥♥♥ many times when I was focused on improving outer towers and he told me that aliens had their grabby little hands on a core, and they wouldn't left the map with it if my AI friend hadn't told me in time).\n\nAnother great, possibly unintentional twist is that your AI friend has a British accent. This somehow makes his warnings more spoken and his cheers more cheerful, plus it sounds so classy when he says "bloody hell."\n\nSome maps also have multiple levels to them, where aliens have to go up in a spiral to get to your cores. This opens up a huge amount of possibilities for towers that help cover multiple levels.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say Defense Grid is one of the best if not the best game you'll find in the Tower Defense genre. Your Tower Defense collection can't be complete without this game. Definately get this if you're into Tower Defense.","August 2, 2014","true","19.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It doesn't differ too much from other TD games, but it's pretty fun once you get a hang of it. Most of the standard mechanics associated with TD genre are here: a good tower variety, a good enemy variety, rock-paper-scissors tactic of using the right tower against the right enemy, scoreboards, and so on.\n\nGraphically the game is very beautiful. Though at times I wished the towers looked a bit more different to one another, otherwise it can get confusing what is what. I do like the whole colour scheme of green towers being basic, yellow advanced, and red the best. The musical side of things could've been a bit better though. Most levels have between 20-30 waves, and can take a while to play through, so it would've been nice to have it spiced up with more memorable tunes. The A.I. narrator most times provides a nice commentary and keeps you entertained with his colourful personality, though at times he can be annoying when he keeps telling you about cores being stolen. *shakes fist*\n\nMost levels had a very interesting design and forced you to think hard on how to channel enemies down a longer path and where would be the points of highest offense. They provided a nice challenge. A few felt like difficulty spikes and seemed unnecessarily convoluted (looking at you, Waste Disposal), but most were a great fun.\n\nThere were a few aspects that annoyed me slightly, so might be worth mentioning them. First one which I noticed straight away was how much punishment the enemies could sustain before going down. Even the weakest, most basic enemies could absorb a fair amount of damage, which in turn made many towers feel too weak. And this brings me to another one. Majority of towers are very situational and tend to have a lot more shortcomings than strengths. The only tower that I felt was all-round good at just about everything was the Cannon tower, and these usually formed the meat and potatoes of my defence, with all the other towers just acting in supporting roles. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it means there is a bit too little room for experimentation with various setups.\n\nAside from the story mode, each map also has a variety of other modes, most providing some form of a new challenge, like enemies being tougher, or the cores which you must protect not going back to their starting location, and so on. So there's a lot of stuff to try out here and the completionists can easily sink tens or hundreds of hours in this game.\n\nOverall, it's a fun TD game. Don't expect anything new and extraordinary, but if you like the genre, then you should definitely grab this game.","October 23, 2015","true","14.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","10"

Rather than the enemies reaching the end of the map, this game has the enemies collecting 'cores' from a specific point on the map and then moving towards the exit. Because of this , your strategy has to be a bit different when placing your towers. In addition the more resources you collect the more interest you earn, thus spending your resources to build/upgrade your towers may not always be the best strategy especially in the beginning of a level.\n\n+20 Main missions and 28 DLC missions. Every map is completely different from the last, some maps have multiple entry and exit points, core locations, pathways. Every map almost feels like a new puzzle, trying to figure out how to make the optimal path to win.\n\n+ The DLC missions are unique and fun. The best DLC levels is mixing the portal universe with this one. Each level is unique and provides an interesting twist to each level altering your strategy.\n\n+ Every mission features a variety of different modes. The modes that cause you to rethink your strategy are probably the best ones. For example, one mode has the entry and exit points reversed, another you can only build level 1 towers, etc.\n\n+ The game features a variety of different towers each one with a unique purpose. The type of tower and the placement plays a big role in the game.\n\n+ Great graphics and effects for this type of game\n\n+controller support\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Other than a variety of different modes per level, this game offers little new.\n\n-Some modes can be very repetitive. Once you figure out what works in a level, you can play different modes with the exact same layout. However these modes are optional.\n\n- The game feels like it was designed with the controller only in mind.

By all accounts, this was a great game to start with, and after many hours of playtime, I have to agree. To summarize the game (as much as I can within the character limit), basically it boils down to this: a bunch of aliens walk down a preset path and it is your job to lay down various towers to stop them from stealing your stuff. The challenge comes in figuring out which tower types to use and managing your resources. The game features tons of levels in the main campaign, along with various alternate challenges for each level. A number of add-on campaigns are also available.

Is it worth your time and money?\n\nThe short version: yes it is.\n\nThe long version: keep reading.\n\nTo start of with the best part, Defense Grid is a TD that focusses on plotting your layout. There are no close to a hundred different tower types here nor are the levels a micro frenzy of having to click at spots at just the right time. Defense Grid is a game about strategy. It's about being so shrewd that your placement of only a handful of towers will obliterate wave after wave.Having only nine towers is a good thing as it focusses attention. You have these nine to master and no more. The learning curve is found in how to combine them.\n\nLasers set aliens on fire, meaning they deal damage even after they left range. But they are useless against shields, which means you need guns or cannons to bring those down. But what if there are speedy aliens in the wave? You need lasers again, or perhaps temporal towers. It's a game about combinations both in placement and upgrades. And speaking of upgrades, there are two upgrades for each tower, each merely increasing the stats of the tower. More damage, more range, faster firing speed. This again, simplifies the learning curve yet the doubling in price for every upgrade still makes it an important choice. You can upgrade two green towers to a yellow one for the price of upgrading one yellow to a red one. Which is better? Well... what's your layout like?\n\nThe aliens themselves offer variation as well, although it's not so much the power each alien type possesses. It is when these powers are combined within waves that real danger appears. You even might need to take the next wave into account. A wave of very fast aliens, having sped by your defences, stole cores. That's fine, you think. They are all low health, I get them when they re-enter my grinder on the way back. Unfortunately, the next wave arrived already and contains aliens that shield other aliens. And just when you plan your killing blow, the shield envelopes the thieves from the previous wave. Leaving you to hit backspace a couple of times to revert to a previous save. The smoothest quick load I ever encountered in a game.\n\nEven the resource gain has a strategic consideration in the form of interest. This mechanic will steadily increase your resources based off a % of what's available. Less spending means more income, requiring you to look ahead. That's the reason why at the top of the screen the next wave is already approaching as a set of clearly identifiable icons.\n\nThe DLC offers new gamemodes and maps, Ranging from modes where building of the towers is changed, to modes where the behaviour of stolen cores is changed. Each brings only subtle change, but instantly changes the dynamic of any map.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of the game is found only in the scores. Everyone on your friend list who owns the game will show up with their scores provided they played that map/gamemode combination, thus inspiring an ever increasing optimization race to eke out just a few more points than them.\n\nOf course, afterwards you switch to the global highscores and you will cry silently in your hands as you didn't even realize numbers as big as those existed.\n\nThe downsides then.\nThe biggest problem is that once you get good at this game several of the gamemodes lose their lustre. Especially the Grinder modes become a bore, having to wait for a hundred waves doing nothing. Not even the ability to speed up the game can make this time go by fast enough.\n\nAnother problem is that the Tesla tower grows useless. This isn't because it is, but because its intended role as a fail-safe tower, isn't required for a good player. A good player doesn't need fail safes.\n\nAnd finally, there are people who continuously manage to hack/cheat themselves into the top of the highscores somehow, leaving Hidden Path to squat them down again and again. As beating highscores is the endgame for Defense Grid, this is an annoying thing to face.\n\nTLDR; There is a demo. Go try it.","November 26, 2013","true","163.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are plenty of levels to keep you interested, and it’s the type of game you can just keep on playing and playing. All in all, highly recommended.\nIf you want multiplayer, then buy Sanctum. If you want solo play, then buy Defense Grid. Simple really!\n","January 1, 2013","true","33.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love the quick nature of levels, and the thrill of feeling like a pro when you end level with loads of money left over. The range of abilities of the towers makes each level unique. Will you slow a pack of aliens, in a gauntlet? Or maybe zap them over and over with a laser... either way, very fun.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'd give this game an 8/10. Game play is awesome, and the quick nature makes it easy to pause and get some water. I do wish you could level a tower up more than 3 times. Additionally, I found the menu a teeny bit clunky.","June 30, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a large number of achievements which if like me you are an achievement hunter will take you a good while to get. This coupled with the steam cards and the ability to instantly compare your level scores with your friends and your world ranking makes it a competitive game.\n\nAll in all I would certainly reccomend this and I am looking forward to the sequel.

Though this game only have the simplest form of tower defense genre: tower, and the only thing you can do is just put them at the proper position, though its art design is just so-so at the present time, but it still give me much fun, excelling many games lying in my library. Its goal is simple. Its learning curve is smooth. It has many different playing mode. Whether you're a hardcore fan of tower defense game or not, you can always find something satisfying you.\nIf you're amateur in this genre, its fighting is intense enough to grab your eyes. When you are a little experienced, its advanced strategy needed to achieve higher goal is easy to understand and learn. And if you have progressed to become a hardcore fan like me, you will catch the art of positioning towers and the timing to position and remove them. Most importantly, you only need a mouse to play. That means you need only one hand, therefore you can play when lying on he bed like a lazybones.

There is a nice leaderboard, with constant records that you can beat, medals to earn and such.\nThere is always space for progress and accomplishment. The best tactic to defeat your enemies is to know how and when to place your towers correctly so you can beat your enemy with maximum presicion and prevent any unwanted consequences.\nIf you're looking for a game where you can relax and still have fun with, look no further then Defense Grid.","December 27, 2011","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everyone probably asks whether it is worth buying when there are so many free TDs out there. And I think it is. The game mechanics seem well balanced, gameplay is seamless and there also is an attempt at a story. :)\n\nYou will proceed through a series of missions in different environments, building towers, upgrading them and repelling wave after wave of enemies. In some levels the enemies take a mostly predetermined path, in others you may shape it, which is yet another important element of your strategy. Over time, you will gain access to an orbital cannon that, if used correctly, can save your hide quite a few times.\n\nAutomatic checkpoint-based save, quick reloading of checkpoints and a 'fast forward' button provide enough control over the game to avoid boredom and repetition.\nThe biggest con is that even upon completing the game you can't play any mission with all the towers. Only the ones from Story mode of that mission are available.","May 19, 2011","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The single biggest factor in your ranking will be how well you underconsumed, saved, and gained in interest.  The game itself is pretty easy, but getting a high ranking is difficult.\n\nThe only real flaw with the game, as strange as this may sound, is they introduced too many modes for each map.  As I said, the challenge isn't in completing the level, but in getting a high score, and there's so many maps, with several modes for each one, that there's no way to spend the necessary amount of time with each.  A prime example of how less can be more.  Even still, highly recommended for TD fans.\n\n","January 5, 2014","true","189.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The towers are well balanced and are all useful at some point.  Both tall (few upgraded towers) and wide (many low level towers)  builds work on most levels. The levels often have flexible path possibilities. Multiple modes for each level get you to think about the level and tower placement in new ways, and often force you to throw out your old strategy. Compound interest really rewards patience. Checkpoints are great for helping you fine tune a strategy, get perfect placement timing, or back up just a bit when you mess up.

It's 3D, but it's only really playable in the default viewing mode. There's not much point in zooming in, other than to witness the carnage inflicted by your defence towers when you're feeling particularly confident that you've covered every angle and none of the aliens is going to slip through your net of flames, bullets, incedniaries, lazers and tesla coils.\n\nI like the fact that the map is a simplified grid, which makes it easier to adopt a definite strategy. It's why I prefer these sort of tower defence games over other more polished real-time stratrgy games like Starcraft and Command & Conquer. The maps in Defence Grid don't get so big that you have to fret about what's happening off-screen.\n\nThe optimum strategy may not be entirely evident at the outset and successful strategies tend to emerge as a necessary response to unforseen threats and limited resources.\n\nThe gameplay has been finely tuned, with statistical targets to hit for achievements and medals. There's also a high-score leader-board, and downloadable content.

Everyone probably asks whether it is worth buying when there are so many free TDs out there. And I think it is. The game mechanics seem well balanced, gameplay is seamless and there also is an attempt at a story. :)\n\nYou will proceed through a series of missions in different environments, building towers, upgrading them and repelling wave after wave of enemies. In some levels the enemies take a mostly predetermined path, in others you may shape it, which is yet another important element of your strategy. Over time, you will gain access to an orbital cannon that, if used correctly, can save your hide quite a few times.\n\nAutomatic checkpoint-based save, quick reloading of checkpoints and a 'fast forward' button provide enough control over the game to avoid boredom and repetition.\nThe biggest con is that even upon completing the game you can't play any mission with all the towers. Only the ones from Story mode of that mission are available.","May 19, 2011","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The single biggest factor in your ranking will be how well you underconsumed, saved, and gained in interest.  The game itself is pretty easy, but getting a high ranking is difficult.\n\nThe only real flaw with the game, as strange as this may sound, is they introduced too many modes for each map.  As I said, the challenge isn't in completing the level, but in getting a high score, and there's so many maps, with several modes for each one, that there's no way to spend the necessary amount of time with each.  A prime example of how less can be more.  Even still, highly recommended for TD fans.\n\n","January 5, 2014","true","189.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Defense Grid will have you assist the awakening of this AI during an alien invasion. While you keep fending off hordes of nasty aliens and work your way through the campaign, your AI buddy will educate you on the different kinds of towers it unlocks for you, and will provide intel on any new kind of alien appearing on the battlefield. In addition it will comment every now and then on whatever is happening on the field, always with its distinctive british accent.\n\nEvery battlefield can be played in a number of different modes, each providing a different challenge on its own, with different waves of aliens and different perks/limits for you to enjoy different playstyles. Visuals are great. Battlefields encompass railroad stages where aliens will be moving on a fixed path and you'll only be allowed to put your towers on the sides, and stages in which you'll be allowed to alter the alien's path by building a maze of towers. The game won't prevent you from blocking the way to the core, but aliens will only follow the path you draw for them so long as there is a legitimate way to do it: you block the way, they'll ignore the maze and just follow the most direct path. You play fair, they do it too.\n\nYou can speed up the game a little but there is no pause button, so stay focused. Luckily the game provides a well-designed checkpoint system, allowing you to rewind to any one of the save points for that match should the aliens manage to steal a core or two.\n\nDefinitely recommended!","December 26, 2013","true","60.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After that there are more challenges available.\n\nThis game wins on so many levels:\n\n1.) It is insanely and maddeningly challenging. You will want to replay every mission in the campaign and try not to have any cores taken.\n2.) The game rewards you for strategizing and tactics. Incorrectly placed towers will lead you to scream in frustration. Correctly placed towers will give you a huge sense of satisfaction as you correctly and accurately reroute aliens.\n3.) You can level up each tower with resources gained from fallen aliens.\n4.) An insanely high replayability factor. You can replay different missions and see what towers and where works.\n5.) The voice acting is pretty good, I have to admit. You are kept company on each mission by some British dude talking about his family, his son Zeke, etc. Hammy but a nice touch as you fight off the alien columns.\n\nIf this is on sale, grab it. One of the better tower defense games. Very, very well done.\n\n","January 10, 2015","true","24.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Basically you plant towers to defend your base.  It's hard to explain.. but there's a lot of towers and you have to use them as a means of defense... I wish they had a name for such a genre...

As usual, the first few missions unlock new towers as you go, but you have all tower options available for the vast majority of the game (rather than only the last couple levels like many TD games). There's no experience points or carry over from level to level. All towers can be upgraded twice, increasing their range/speed/power. Tower variety is really good.\n\nStory (8/10) - For a tower defense game, this is probably the best storyline you'll ever find. It's touching, believable, and satisfying. The voice acting is superb, which really helps with the immersion. While I've not played more than a few hours of Portal, even I can appreciate the ties to the game in a hidden bonus console, as well as an entire DLC devoted to it. The game is worth playing through on the easiest difficulty simply for the storyline.\n\nGameplay (10/10) - Levels are very well balanced. Zoom features are great. There's a "rewind back to a checkpoint" button that autosaves every few waves (and you can rewind back through multiple checkpoints). Different levels force different tactics, so you'll use almost every tower at least a bit. Artillery can miss. Rewinding can alter the rest of the mission simply because it resets where all the bullets are, and some may/may not miss. Fast forward feature works flawlessly. There's both fairly set path levels, as well as completely wide open levels that you can maze up to 'til your heart's content.\n\nReplayability (11+/10) - Every level has a whole mess of "challenge" options, such as "out of bullets" (no towers that use bullets), "reverse" (level is reversed), "hard", "no upgrades", "poison" (the objects you're defending kill the enemies if they're dropped), and on and on and on. There's a leaderboard, and multiple medals for each different option on each different map. This is literally hundreds of hours of content. The DLCs are equally as impressive, with a stronger showing of "open concept" levels, they are much harder and present countless different ways to win, and it's rewarding to replay them to find those ways.\n\nSound (7/10) - The effects are good, cannons and explosions are satisfying, ambient noise/music is fitting although you'll probably turn it off if after the first 30 hours (which is pretty darn good anyway). I put the voice acting under the story, but there's fairly consistent comments from your sidekick during the missions that somehow never got annoying even after the millionth time I heard them.\n\nGraphics/UI (7/10) - Solidly above average for a TD game of its age. You can zoom in quite close, or zoom out for a view range that's more than far enough. Things look like they're supposed to, enemies are all easily distinguishable. Faster enemies will sometime "outrun" where something hits them, so the bullet hitting animation can be slightly behind an enemy (fairly minor problem). The levels show a really good variety without ruining the believability. Menus are very well laid out, as is the ability to see at a glance how you did on each mission (great if you're trying to get all the medals). Nothing here will blow you away, but nothing will annoy you, which is awesome for a TD game.\n\nAchievements/Steam Cards (10/10) - They are there, and work flawlessly!\n\nOverall (9/10) - For what it is, it might very well be 10/10. I, personally, enjoy continuity between levels, which is the only thing I would have changed to make it perfect in my eyes. Questions like "Is clicking on specific towers easy, or is mis-clicking common?" are questions that just won't come up in this game. There is nothing that will detract from the fun of this game, nothing clunky, nothing annoying. You will like it, or not, based on the game concept itself, because the execution is simply done right.","December 14, 2014","true","250.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

After booting it up the feeling remained. But only until the hitting the play level button. It didn't take long for me to feel embarrassed. I bet if I could, I would've slapped my past self!\n\nThis is a futuristic tower defense game.\nThe graphics are nothing phenomenal, but one of the best in the genre.\nThe Soundtrack could be a better as it becomes tedious quite fast.\nThe plot and story could be far more engaging however these two are compensated with an A.I. with an active and engaging dialog with e a cheesy/fake(?) British voice.\nAnd finally it holds great gameplay mechanics. Far better than any other I've tried in the genre, taking the strategy element to whole new level.\n\nIf you appreciate a good strategy or tower defense you should try this.","June 30, 2011","true","21.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And it's hard to find good strategy games that I haven't played already and got bored of them. Now, what I love more than strategy games? Tower defense games. And this is the only good Tower Defense game I've seen in Steam so far.\n\nThe story is okay. I wasn't really expecting something good as Half-Life anyway, but it makes the job. The enemies are generic aliens who want to take over the world, and you, and some sort of IA have to deal with them using towers. Is that simple. Now, what makes the game good? A nice amount of strategy, lots and lots of maps, a good number of towers to use, and LOTS OF MODES to play. And not only that, but there are maps made by comunity members.\n\nThe DLC's are, most of them, worth it. Good and cheap maps with extra dificulty. If I have to choose one, it's quite obvious the Portal DLC is the best one. And if you're a guy who doesn't want to buy lots of DLC's, just buy this one and ignore the others.\n\nI still play this game from time to time. And I had it for like, a year or even more. If that doesn't show that it's good enough, you might want to try it yourself, since it had a lot of sales and price drops during events, like the one going on now.\n\nNow, if companies made more of these games, instead of more generic FPS...","December 30, 2013","true","37.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It'sa VERY basic TD.  There's no persistent upgrades, no customization of your loadout, not much story (even for a TD), no optional goals (no rewards for speed, extra cash, perfect no loss, etc..  In many maps you don't even get to choose tower location, the game only gives you a handful of platforms to build on.  I've played better TDs for free on my phone.  MUCH better ones.\n\nThe upsides are good graphics, lots of maps (if you do like it, you won't run out), and the AI helper is entertaining.  His backstory (what there is) is far more interesting than the story you're playing (kill invaders, the end).\n\nI bought it for 2.50 on sale.  For that price, sure, get it.

Unfortunately, you are also an intergalactic hobo forced to scrape together every last penny you own to purchase the towers you so desperately need to hold back the alien menace.  Once you own some towers, you can improve them.  Well, you would be able to improve them except that you are far too poor to afford it.  And then at the end of each board, if you manage to hold back the aliens, any money you did manage to accumulate over the course of the board is taken away so you can be returned to a state of abject poverty in preparation for the next board.  Your performance is graded partially on how successful you were in defending the 'cores' (your main objective) and partially on how 'wasteful' you were with your meager funds.  Apparently you are supposed to defend the cores with an absolute bare minimum and if you do manage to build a secure defense that stops the aliens dead in their tracks... well... you've done something wrong and need to be penalized in terms of score.\n\nThe layouts of many of the boards are interesting and provide you with many options on how you can halt the oncoming horde... if you had the money to actually carry it out.  I also had the feeling in many places that although it appeared that I had many options, there was a particular way most boards were 'supposed' to be done.  This gives the game the unpleasant feeling of a guessing game where you set up a defense only to find out that the designers had something else in mind, and as the aliens burst through your defensive line you are (as usual) flat broke and unable to change your strategy without backstepping to an earlier point and simply making a different guess.\n\nThat said, the base concept still makes for an interesting tower defense style game.   The graphics are good and the voice acting is very good.  The towers types are interesting and the ability to actually shape the path of the aliens by blocking some access points with towers gives this game an edge over other tower defense games.  However, I feel that Defense Grid 2 carried these concepts out in a better and more entertaining way than this game.","January 2, 2015","false","20.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

You have to quess right order and right time in which you build (or upgrade) right tower, so there comes attemp-fail scheme and frustration of course.\nWas suprised by controls but got used to it fast. Flying aliens have different paths (different from ground units) its great idea, cause you have limeted number of spots for towers and you have to think more wisely. Also towers are obstacles for each other, so one tower cant fire through the other etc. some game mechanics are great.\nReal minus for me is that\nyou cant zoom out or pause the game (well, you can honestly, but you will see only menu then) - there is also no minimap or something, so you cant stop and think about your strategy/next few moves. This game really wasnt meant to be played on small screens/resolutions and slow.\nI can imagine that with proper hardware the impression can be different, cause presentation is great (graphic, voiceacting, additional content... ) but ... im not sure.

The maps are big and there are so many ways you could lay out your defense.... yet, as each defense you try fails or barely succeeds, you get the feeling that there is actually only one or two ways to beat each challenge. That isn't fun to me. I think tower defense games need to choose whether the "solution" to a challenge is intuitive and you can find it after a few tries, OR whether you can decide how to build your defense and there are many ways to win. When a tower defense game gives you many options AND requires you to play a very specific way, I call that TEDIUM. You have to play the whole challenge (they are quite long) over and over until you find out the successful layout.\n\nYou could say I'm just not that great at the game, but I never consider "you're just not good enough" or "there are people out there who can do it" to be a strong defense (no pun intended) for a tedius and difficult game. I think if I play video games pretty often and I tend to be good at them, I should be able to achieve moderate success in a game without investing hundreds of hours. For that reason, I can't recommend this game. Non-hardcore tower defense fans will probably enjoy this game up to a point then realize that it's is either hopeless or way too time consuming and demanding.","March 7","false","7.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It has a solid base and levels achievements are earned by not spending too many resources and keeping all your power cores from being stolen. Everythign works as expected, however I cannot recommend this game.\n\nThe Awakening is just too basic to get through as a good TD that costs money. I can find many more entertaining games back from the era where everyone was hanging out on Xgen-Studios. There are no upgraded between levels, only the most basic tower models and a nonexistent story. The only thing that this game has more of than most TDs is grapics.\n\nThere is no motivation to re-play a campaign than any stupid handicaps you can put on yourself, every session is closed in itself and you do not take any bonuses to the next level. Enemies are very boring (5 types of walkers with scaling health, fast ones, flying ones), they only offer the most basic enemies.\n\nThe game got boring very quickly and I had much more fun playing other TDs for free.","June 7, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

They throw in some interesting ideas of what towers can do (sniper/tesla/command). Unfortunately there are entire levels where you never want nor need most of them - a real waste of options and menu space.\n\nSadly, the gameplay grinds along at what can only be described as "inexorable". Pacing was not a high point of this game's design, evidently. Waves of enemies came and went, but all I really wanted the entire game was a speed toggle instead of having to hold down a key to accelerate gamespeed. I really only looked forward to getting it over with, by the time each level was finished.\n\nLevel design was interesting but quickly became too big and too bulky. Getting to the end of ten minutes of planning out and building a massive gauntlet, just to find that a single unit can still make it through, was met with dread instead of a curiosity or anticipation. There is little room for error in most of the levels - if you want a good score, that is. Placing a tower that blocked unit pathing was allowed and suddenly they could just walk through your towers with no ill effect. Lastly, fine-tuning the towers (with upgrades) was never needed or necessary - new towers are just better and there is always room for more towers.\n\nThe final flaw was that each level was far too isolated, lending to a disruptive lack of cohesion in the story. Lost a core (life/hitpoint)? It'll be back in the next level! Lots of resources at the end of one level? Too bad, they're gone! There was great opportunity to build a bank&store system with persistence in campaign, but they obviously missed those chances.\n\nThe game has some intriguing ideas and some fun DLC (GLADoS content is always good!), but they introduce an obnoxious relay/replace gameplay mechanic that only serves to frustrate and annoy. In summary, the game under-delivers on the core elements of tower defense and underwhelms with its thinly-veiled attempts at innovating on this genre. I cannot give this game a recommendation rating, but it's worth throwing a couple of bucks at it (Steam sales! Woo!) just for the story mode and a single playthrough.","July 13, 2014","false","18.1"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

It has excellent game mechanics, intuitive features, decent graphics and it's just plain fun! This game really got me started in the tower defense genre where other games had failed to do so before. You can pick up and play Defense Grid for 5 or 10 minutes, or play for hours trying to beat the best scores on your friend's leaderboards.\n\nI like this game so much that I think I've purchased it somethingl iike 10 times for friends to play and on different platforms for myself!\n\nI highly reccomend this affordable and FUN game!

Each of the 10 or so towers you can build are unique enough that even late game, you are using a wide variety; there's no "best" tower. Every tower can also be upgraded for more damage/faster fire rate/increased range.\nLeaderboards are done extremely well in this game. Your score is ranked worldwide, but then you also see your friends and their scores. This gives it a much more competative feel since you can see how you measure up to your friends per scenario.\nThe story isn't anything fantastic, but compared to other tower defense games (which usually have no story), it's good.\nThere is no multi-player and no map editor. Check Defense Grid 2 if interested in these.\nThis game is my benchmark for other tower defense games, and most fall far short of this one.","December 21, 2014","true","183.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the game is a few years old, it has stood the test of time.  The first few levels start out light and integrate a tutorial with game play, and then later levels introduce you to more advanced concepts.  Many of the later levels also allow you to get creative at times by giving you wide open areas to design your paths.  The value here is tremendous as there are many levels and different modes to play.  Adding to the addictive nature of the game are community high score lists so you can see where you rank amongst thousands of players.

It's a good one, but the various levels are not nearly as free-form as you might initially believe. Many levels can be beaten in multiple ways, but many levels favor a particular layout of towers. After playing through a dozen levels or so, you realize certain consistent strategies to victory: make the path the aliens travel as long as you can, and build a lot of cannon towers. Yes, there are nuances beyond that, but the strategy isn't really all that deep.\n\nBut that's okay. It's an easy game to play in 30-minute chunks; the lack of save game slots (as opposed to the acceptable-but-not-ideal checkpoint system) is annoying, but mildly so. (Although, to be fair, that might be just my own over-saving nature speaking.) It's rewarding, pretty, nicely paced, and has a decent enough plot.\n\nI bought it for something like $2.49.

But then, I don't play tower defense for storyline.\n- Absolutely critical hints are given as pop-ups throughout the game, which can be easy to miss.  (Looks pointedly at the backspace and 'F' keys.)\n\nLiked:\n- The game is a pure tower defense.\n- The challenge level of the game is excellent.  There are maps with no-lose easy modes, and maps for which getting the gold medal will require trial and failure of many different strategies - which means when you finally find a working strategy, you feel like a genius.  Really excellent attention to level balance must have been paid at some point.\n- The checkpointing/back up to checkpoint mechanic is essential.  I didn't know it existed for the first tens of hours I played the game, and enjoyment went way up when a friend told me about it.\n- The fast forward capability 'F' is awesome.\n- The game is pretty.  You don't need absurd gaming hardware to enjoy the visuals.  And, if you have absurd gaming hardware, the visuals look great.  I have midrange hardware and the game is beautiful to behold.","July 1, 2014","true","136.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are simple in design, yet force you to think of how you want to lay out your design carefully. Some levels push this a bit farther, giving you multiple ways to maze and build. This really comes into focus during the later maps of the Story Mode, where the enemies have literally a dozen pathing options.\n\nOn top of the typical story mode there are also many different challenge modes for each map, giving hours of enjoyment. Modes include: Grinder and Super Grinder, 99 waves that get progressively harder as you go; Green Towers Only, where you can't upgrade your towers at all; Story Reversed, that swaps the direction the enemies travel; and much more.\n\nThere are also a few extra campaigns available through DLC, as well as community driven content with tons of maps to try out.

Fun, quirky, and at times really challenging, but without going overboard into wanting to smash your keyboard.\n\nThe challenge here is all about pathing - there's plenty of different towers to try, and each is good and bad against different enemies - but in most cases, the main issue is figuring out where you can steer the enemies with the available map and towers at your disposal.\n\nCouple of things I really like about DG:\n\n1.  You can complete levels without being 'flawless' - the goal is to stop aliens from stealing your 'cores', but you can finish a level without keeping all of them.  As a bit of a completionist, I always wanted to get through them perfectly with all cores intacts, but the point is you're not blocked from getting on with the next level if this isn't for you.\n\n2.  The balance is excellent, in that your basic gun turret tower is useful from start to finish in this game - there's no sense of "once you get tower X just spam that".\n\nIt's a great game, hard to go wrong buying it.","March 15, 2015","true","74.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't just one of the best tower defense games ever made, it's one of the best games ever made, period. There's a finely honed balance between clever level design, basic resource management, and tower type & placement. It all adds up to a truly nailbiting experience, with just enough brain-teasing frustration to make you feel accomplished once you beat a campaign.\n\nIt's a superb example of what game designers can accomplish by layering simple gameplay systems on top of each other, and fine-tuning through play balancing. Post-release support and free DLC updates only make the game that much more replayable.","August 29, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each of the 10 or so towers you can build are unique enough that even late game, you are using a wide variety; there's no "best" tower. Every tower can also be upgraded for more damage/faster fire rate/increased range.\nLeaderboards are done extremely well in this game. Your score is ranked worldwide, but then you also see your friends and their scores. This gives it a much more competative feel since you can see how you measure up to your friends per scenario.\nThe story isn't anything fantastic, but compared to other tower defense games (which usually have no story), it's good.\nThere is no multi-player and no map editor. Check Defense Grid 2 if interested in these.\nThis game is my benchmark for other tower defense games, and most fall far short of this one.","December 21, 2014","true","183.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are simple in design, yet force you to think of how you want to lay out your design carefully. Some levels push this a bit farther, giving you multiple ways to maze and build. This really comes into focus during the later maps of the Story Mode, where the enemies have literally a dozen pathing options.\n\nOn top of the typical story mode there are also many different challenge modes for each map, giving hours of enjoyment. Modes include: Grinder and Super Grinder, 99 waves that get progressively harder as you go; Green Towers Only, where you can't upgrade your towers at all; Story Reversed, that swaps the direction the enemies travel; and much more.\n\nThere are also a few extra campaigns available through DLC, as well as community driven content with tons of maps to try out. All in all, it's a very solid pickup for any of you Tower Defense fans out there, and an enjoyable game all around.","June 30, 2014","true","53.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I’ve given this game some time, and I plan to continue playing it later, but I’ve by no means had a chance to experience everything it has to offer. But I can tell you that the levels are beautifully designed, and well thought out. No matter how you position your towers, there’s almost always something you forgot. There are alternate routes, multiple levels of depth to pay attention to (first floor, second floor), and sometimes the enemies need to come full circle, other times they’re just fighting their way towards an exit. The level designs are creative, and some even feel mildly inspired by great nods Sci-Fi films and games of the past. Don’t forget to check out community-designed levels, as well, for a literally limitless supply of fun.\n\nDefense Grid: Containment knows its audience – they funded it.

Of course you have.\n\nHave you ever played a Tower Defense with 3D models? Who hasn't!\n\nHave you ever played a 3D Tower Defense with Aliens, 15 different game modes, and Community Made levels? No?\n\nYou have now.\n\nDefense Grid: The Awakening is a very tense game, that takes Bloons, Throws it in a blender, adds some 3D and Aliens in, and gets drank like a protein shake.\nIt has specific Aliens, which react to different towers; Including Aliens with forcefields that require taking bullet damage before flaming towers can finish them off, and boss battles. (but what TD doesn't?)\nKeeping up the good graphics, considering it's a six year old game is always good, and while it's not the most important thing, is still one thing that gets my attention in a Tower Defense, making it Non-overhead view.\nWhile it has nice little touches, like towers getting in the way of each other and Aliens going through your towers to grab something, and take it back, there is one thing that I wish they'd had more of.\n\nTowers.\nOf course, they have a ton of maps, I mean, variety is what you want in a Tower Defense. But only having 8 or so different towers makes the gameplay repetetive and boring.\nWhile they have community made maps, it'd be nice to also have custom towers, because growing up playing on the internet in 2006 or so, I loved how they had a good amount of towers/monkeys to keep the gameplay fresh and add new strategy.\nAnother thing that is quite bothering is how EASY the main story is. In a regular Tower Defense, you'd have the enemy come from one direction, and head to another. In this game, You have them come from one direction, go to a spot where they have to pick up these "cores", then go to the path they came in BEFORE to get a second mow down while carrying the cores. (of course not all levels are like this) Except when they die, the core gets returned and goes on a reversed path slowly to the point of which it was taken. I like how they evened it out with enemies being able to carry 2 to 3 cores, but i've completed half the story as of this review and not struggled once. The most cores i've lost are 3 out of 15 or so.\n\nBut if you want to have some quick and strategic fun, while the game looking pretty, look no further than Defense Grid: The Awakening.","August 22, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No real complaints about the game except you can pretty much complete all maps using just two or three of the turrets. Not a bad thing but be nice to have a reason to use the others. Well executed, no bugs, and a great brain teaser. Use the "F" key to fast forward. Absolutely a necessity for determine turret layout for channeling the aliens.

Along the game you start to get More Blueprints inorder to make New towers while the story Preceeds. - Yes, this game has a STORY! A Rare occurence with games like these.\n\nBesides playing the Story mode of each map, You can also play different versions of the same map with a new twist. There is also the "Community Maps" That has new stuff added each time, also there are Mini games that you can do if you wanna take a break. Before the DG2 Kickstarter, there was a Console from the PotatoFoolsDay Portal 2 ARG. I think there might be some way to get it back but i have no idea.\n\nOverall, Defense Grid: The Awakening is a Breath of Fresh air for the Genre and this is a game i seriously recommend.","February 11, 2014","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels do get pretty hard, especially if you're looking to get the achievements.\n\nI think the biggest problem with this game is the steep learning curve, which could be a problem if you haven't played a tower defense game before.

All the DLC is worth the cheap price because it adds some new levels to play and ways to think about defending crystals in the game. Only problem for me was that there was no sound on my PC with Windows 7, and I suffered for a while until a good patch was released, so it was stable enough to play, but I think the game is in working order. It will run on almost any system, so it’s not a graphics hog, yet it still can be a pretty game on lower settings. Enjoy","December 29, 2010","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Protection of power cores which can be stolen by enemies and retrieved -- but if an airborne enemy steals a core, it's lost forever!\n5.

The stage designs are no gimmick and certainly add several factors to consider when deciding what a hot spot would be for maximum impact turret placement, both in regards to damage done and wave routing.\n\nIf you make a mistake or realize your plan won't work, you can easily rewind via checkpoints all the way to the beginning, or if your mistake is small enough you might be able to use your superweapon (on a timed cooldown) to compensate.\n\nDoing this all from the comfort of a gamepad is easily preferrable.","December 21, 2010","true","77.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it includes upgradable defenses, and a variety of defenses as well. Story progession, etc, all common elements of defense games. However, this one has some unique challenges and a compelling story with excellent details. This particular game stands out amongst most 'defense' style games. The graphics are not too complicated, so most systems can run the game pretty decently, and the gameplay is quite rewarding. Protect your cores from alien insurgents, and get financial rewards for not only each kill, but for having cores docked, and earn interest as well. The tower types are fun to strategize with, and certain combinations are more effective then others.

The levels are also very varied and interesting there are loads of avenues of replayability either by the set modes or just simply by making things up in your head like this round I will try and win just using gun towers.\n\nHowever i will put a but in here aside from the positives of this game I will throw in one big negative in my viewpoint. There is not enough variety in the aliens and the towers themselves are neither negative or positive at taking out anything. I built up a bunch of teslas to take out bosses when I finally realized what a boss was (I was expecting something much bigger) my very basic cheapo turrets had wiped the floor with them long before they got to the tesla turrets which are supposed to be the boss killers (maybe some defensive bonuses could have been added to them to make other turrets less effective at them).\n\nBut conclude on the good if you want a great tower defense game that will keep you busy and on your toes this is certainly a great purchase.","February 10, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As the name would lead you to believe, it's a defensive strategy game.  It is fun and easy to play a mission here or there when you have time and not worry about being disconnected with a great story (because there isn't much of one).  One of the best aspects is with all the different modes of play there is solid replay value and it great bang for your buck.","July 12, 2012","true","49.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
