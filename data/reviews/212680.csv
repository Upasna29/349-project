"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/212680/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","There's nothing like the feeling when a game which wasn't even on your radar comes along, completely blows you away and reminds you why you love this hobby very dearly. And that's paramount. Even the best of us lose our faith sometimes. Faster Than Light is one of those games that comes out of nowhere and makes you a believer again. It is a testament to the brilliance of design over budget and as such is a shining beacon of this medium.\n\nIn Faster Than Light, the player takes on the role of a starship captain whose singular goal is to defend the Federation from a rebel threat. The concept is simple, you have to make it through seven grueling sectors to face the mammoth rebel flagship which will mercilessly put your nerves and skill to the test. It employs tough but fair school of design in which you will dearly pay for every single mistake you make, no matter how small. You may not even realize your mistake until it is too late.\n\nYou start with a barebones crew and equipment which you'll want to heavily upgrade by the time you reach the end. You'll achieve that by travelling through the galaxy, doing quests, fighting or aiding other ships or just buying whatever you can afford. This is a roguelike so every playthrough is completely different with randomized quests and loot drops. Sometimes you may feel slighted by the item drops or the difficult situations you find yourself in, but almost every piece of equipment is useful in some way and there's almost always a way out of a sticky situation. Being a roguelike also means that if you die, you have to start all over again. The sense of urgency is further heightened by the oncoming rebel fleet which won't allow you to roam the galaxy however you wish. Absolutely everything in Faster Than Light is subject to careful forethought and planning, otherwise you might just back yourself into a corner.\n\nAs the ship's captain, it is your duty to take care of absolutely everything that goes on your ship, the design is meticulously detailed. You have absolute control over a variety of systems including engines, shields, weapons, medbay, oxygen supply, helm, sensors, even doors. You also control every single crewmember. There are different races in the game and each specializes in a certain trait (except for humans). For example, Engis repair damaged systems faster, the Rock are immune to fire whereas the Mantis are great for ship intruders.\n\nThis all might sound overwhelming and there's actually a lot more various nuances to talk about here, but the tutorial is fantastic and you'll get the hang of the game quickly. This is a classic case of easy to learn, difficult to master.\n\nThe universe in Faster Than Light is pretty basic, it borrows liberally from various other sci-fi sources. Nevertheless, it is expertly put together. It is a very believable universe in which you'll learn about what's going on mostly through direct gameplay when interacting with other races and factions.\n\nThe Advanced Edition adds more content to the game most notably a new race with a new ship, fantastic new weapons and new upgrades such as mind control, cloning bay and hacking. The completely free expansion fleshes out the universe even further, but much more importantly it adds a myriad of new combinations of tactics that are at your disposal.\n\nFaster Than Light is an exceptional work of game design. Its biggest accomplishment, which so few games manage to pull off, is that it draws you in, hooks you and never lets go. It is extremely addictive, even when you lose horribly and quit the game, all it takes is a few seconds and you're thinking about what you could've done differently and what tactics you will use next time you fire it up. And then you click play. Again.\n\n10 OUT OF 10 (MASTERPIECE)","April 25, 2014","true","138.4"," 887 of 922 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","887","922","0","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IceoAwesome/recommended/212680/","IceoAwesome","Iceo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IceoAwesome/","238 products in account","FTL: Faster Than Light  was my summer in Paris, if Paris was actually Somalia and summer was hot enough to melt my face off. And you want to know something about my trip? I loved every second of it.\n\nFTL is a sci-fi lover's (like myself) dream. Filled with references here and homages there, it never slows down, the action is always frantic yet methodical, and it's an absolute delight.\n\nFTL is a Real-Time Strategy game (with a turn-based element). You control a ship and it's crew from an over-head, side on perspective. There is no movement of ship to control beyond jumping from beacon to beacon.\n\nWhen it comes time to fight your first ship (probably in the tutorial, seriously, do the tutorial), you can pause time by pressing the space-bar, to assess your options and your tactics, in a similar way to that of games like  Dragon Age: Origins  or  The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.  You must make sure at all times that your crew are alive and your hull (your health meter) isn't about to reach zero, or it's game-over. This is easier said than done, because the amount of micro-management is ENDLESS, to the point where it is all micro-management and there isn't any priority management, per say. You need to make sure you have enough power to all systems, no intruders are going to come on board, that you are doing damage to their ship, and if not, charging your FTL jump (your "I NEED TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!" button), among countless other things.\n\n\nThis game is  BRUTAL.  There are 3 difficulties (if you use the Advanced Edition, a major free DLC added to the game in 2014, you can still use the Vanilla version that was the original release): Easy, Normal, and Hard. The only real difference between them is how long you can hold out before being smashed. You need to get through 8 sectors and 1 final boss to complete a run (and subsequently, the game). The final boss is so hard, that even nearly 70 hours into the game (at the time of this review), I STILL haven't beaten it... even on easy.\n\nAnd yet, despite this massive, massively overwhelming difficulty, I wouldn't have this game any other way. Because without it, this game would have FAR less replay ability. But with it, each new run feels completely different. New tactics you might need to try, new ship purchases in hope of finding that Magnum Opus that is your favourite weapon, new dialogues, everything. Without this difficulty, all that wouldn't matter, because after beating it, you would feel less compelled to try differently, and get bored a lot quicker, something I am only realizing after so many hours.\n\n\nEverything this game does should be a set example for games in future years. It gets everything right, the customization, the balance of every factor, excitement. Even it's techno music (I just hurt the souls of many electronic music fans), something I don't particularly enjoy, is absolutely fantastic in this game. To put all this into perspective, I got my Dad to play this game, and even he has since clocked 30+ hours of his own time in the game.\n\nSo with my melted face from my time in the Somalian weather, I must insist everyone who considers themselves an open (to all games) gamer, to play this game. It helps new players find their feet, then punches them down when they have the hang of it. It screams in the face of master strategists and sends them cowering. It is one of the most soul-destroying, exciting, charming, addictive, challenging, fun games out there.\n\nIt's the best Strategy game I have ever played.\n\nPROS:\n+Good tutorial\n+Fun, Challenging\n+Good Interface, Music.\n+TONS of replay ability\n\nCONS:\n-Your face may melt off\n\nI'm giving  FTL: Faster Than Light  9 out of 10.","February 10, 2015","true","72.5"," 262 of 280 people (94%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","94","262","280","93","2"

But if you cause a hull breach, you can effectively make a system’s hit points go below zero (since you have to repair breaches before you can repair a system). Therefore, destroying a system and then nuking it with heavy lasers (killing the crew trying to repair it, and causing hull breaches) is still effective!\n\nYou become a lot better the more you play.

It promises a starship captain experience where the player can manage both crew and ship in relative detail.\n\nThe player takes the role of a Starship Captain with vital information that will help turn the tide of war in the on going conflict between the Rebels and the Federation. The player is allowed to select and manage a variety of ships, each having their own set of crew and abilities which can expand as you progress. Once again, upgrade your ship, expand your crew and try to stay alive till the very end.\n\nPROS:+ Gameplay over Graphics: - The game sports simple pixel art graphics that invokes a retro feel, and, in my opinion, suits it very well. The gameplay is what makes this game shine however and as stated in the INTRODUCTION, this game attempts to simulate a Starship captain by letting the player assign crew to man the ships internal systems, order power to be diverted to different parts of the ship, focus fire on an enemy ship's weapon systems and many many more.\n\n+ Stratigically Brutal: - Easy, Normal or Hard, all extremley unforgiving. This is a game where you need to bite down hard and take the consequences of your actions and choices like an adult, much like all 'Rogue-Like' games. You die, then you start all-over again. Learning from your mistake is part of the game's charm.\n\n+ Wide Variety of Stuff: - Good varriety of ships, weapons, and crew all of which unlocks as you progress. The unlocking system was set up to ensure that every new game will be different and provide unique experiences.\n\n+ Soundtrack: - Great soundtrack from a small indie game. Bigger game developers should learn that not every game needs orchestral pieces to make a game's music pleasing.\n\nCONS:- No ship customization: - Aside from purchasing weapon system and ship components, you won't be able to customize the ship's looks or the layout since said layout is on a preset. I would have liked to construct my own ship.\n\n- One Game Mode: - The only available game mode is the default escape scenario. It would be nice if they would add new campaigns or scenarios like, escort mission, defense campaign etc. It would definitely spice things up. A much more expansive map would also be welcome.\n\n- Crew Interaction: - Being able to talk and may be train your crew outside combat (specially if you find an empty system) would be a welcome addition. More interaction is needed like basic dialogues between the people on your ship to give it more life. It would be a statisfying feeling if you have resolved a conflict between two crew members.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME for a great price. It's definitely not for everyone, specially people who has no patience for Rogue-Like games. This games requires 25% skill, 25% planning and 50% luck. Everytime you start a new campaign it would be a different experience from the last. The game allows most sci-fi fans to totally immerse themselves in the shoes of a Starship captain much like the heroes from the great Space Travel franchises such as Star Trek, Firefly, Babylon 5 & Battlestar Galactica.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

What makes this one special though, is that instead of controlling a single character, you control the crew of your ship.\n\nThis game puts you in control of almost everything: You order your crew to specific rooms, be it to provide your ship with a bonus, repair a broken system, patch a hull breach, fight enemy boarders or put out fires.\n\nMeanwhile you as the player has to make smart decisions which involves opening or closing airlocks to "kill" fires or suffocate enemy invaders, managing your reactor's power to decide what do you want operating at full, partial or no capacity at this particular moment, and figuring out which enemy system you want to try and take out with your ship's weapons.\n\nAlmost everything in this game is randomly generated with very few exceptions such as your ship's starting equipment.\n\nThis game also features achievements (general and ship-specific) and unlockable ships: You can have 9 different ships, each with 2 different layouts for a total of 18. They are really different in playstyle and can make your game way easier or way harder depending on your choices. This can provide you with some replayability, if you are into "collecting". Some ships can be really hard to find, however.\n\nThe difficulty may discourage some people from playing it, but that's a fact with nearly every rogue-like. The way I see it, this is how it goes: When you start a run, there's a chance you will fail and that chance will never go away. What you can do about is use what you can find and devise good strategies to make that chance of failure as minimal as possible.\n\n\nThe graphics and soundtrack are not "high-tech" but are very artistic instead. If you are a fan of pixel art and chiptune music (which you can also buy as DLC). This game delivers an incredible experience in that aspect. Not everyone likes those though, so I recommend you watch the teaser to get a feel of it if you haven't already.\n\nFinally, if there's anything bad I can say about this game is that the random encounters/events are kinda limited and you'll soon figure out the best course of action for most of them. They could use slightly more variety. A very minor complaint, in my opinion.\n\nSo, if you are after a game that will provide you with a unique "star-trek-ish" crew/ship managing experience based on randomly generated elements, then FTL is well-worth the price for you!","November 28, 2013","true","282.7"," 182 of 204 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","182","204","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/212680/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","A bit about the game and developers.\nFTL: Faster Than Light is a space simulation game developed and published by a tiny indie company that has just two members, Subset Games. Great job developers!\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nSo, as I said, FTL is a space simulation game. In it your objective is to fly from one point of the galaxy to the other. You're being chased by rebels, because you've stolen something from them. I say that this game is space simulation because you need to tell your ship crew what to fix, where to go, where to put fire down, and so on and on. You also decide where will your ship shoot at your opponent.\n\nDon't let this game fool you. It looks very fun and relaxing, but it is actually quite complex! Imagine how much you have to attack next - enemy's shield, or maybe guns.. Maybe their engine so they couldn't dodge... Or maybe their medical area so their crewman can't heal - while you have to make sure that there are no hostiles on your ship, and if there are, you have to order your crewmen to kill them. Then you have to put down the fires, fix your guns, fix your shields, fix your oxygen and so on and on.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. This game is amazing! Also, in case that your ship gets destroyed, you have to do everything from the beginning. And that is what actually makes this game hard. There are never more than just one opponent (at least I've never faced more than one!) in one battle, but it's still quite hard to beat them. There are a lot of ships and ships skins that you can unlock as you progress in the game. Sadly I don't know what is your reward for beating the game, since I've only got to the half of it after trying the game out many, many times.\n\nIn the game there are a lot of other areas in which you can jump to that can actually hurt your ship. In those areas there can be either meteors, which can "beat your ship" to death, or you can come too close to the sun which will then make your hull get damaged, which means you can die! There are also some random planets on which you can, randomly, get more crewmen on your ship. They can all even be different races! Every race has their own bonuses, but sadly I don't know them so I can't talk too much about that.\n\nGraphic and Audio\nGraphically speaking, the game is very pixelish. Well of course, it's an pixel, indie game! And I have to say, it's very well done! I love the artwork, the explosions, the space, the look of ships. It's very well done. Audio is very relaxing as well. I really enjoy all of the background songs in the game.\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- A lot of ships to unlocks (and skins!)\n- Very nice background pictures and audio.\n- Cheap!\n\nCons:\n- Quite hard.\n\nFinal grade:  8/10\n\nExtra info:  Get this game. You won't regret it! It's just amazing.\n\nThank you for reading my reviews!

As for a real review/message to newcomers in case if people get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by my quick and unoriginal comment, here:\n\nThe game is fun, but can be RNG based, so a great deal of luck is needed for a beginner to win at first. After you start learning your own tricks and tips, the game will be less RNG reliant and more based on skill since you can use that skill to make the best out of a terrible RNG result or maybe even avoid an RNG tragedy entirely.\n\nLearn to play different ships since they are EXTREMELY varied because one may be more fun or easier for you (Those Lanius ships, horry ♥♥♥♥ lol they are fun and easy to command).\n\nYou can board, shoot, hack, set aflame, and send drones to kill off a ship.\n\nDon't be discouraged by early deaths since there will be a learning curve. It will get increasingly fun until you actually complete it. Also, Advanced edition made the game very fun. I highly recommending it for a first playthrough.\n\n9/10","November 26, 2014","true","109.4"," 236 of 282 people (84%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","84","236","282","48","1"

Its fun, challenging, diverse and random. There are some real difficulty spikes that lead me to believe that its a dead end and impossible to beat that specific random challenge. But that's what random is. This is one of the only games that I sank time into and it was fun doing it.\n\nYou are tasked with traveling through the galaxy, visiting sectors along the way. Each sector is like a game map with several locations. When you enter a sector, you see all the locations as dots on your star map. From there you need to plot a course in your mind to the exit of the sector. Each one of the locations is a gamble, will they have an enemy ship? Maybe a friendly ship? Perhaps a quest that will ask you to visit a different location on the map. It is all random. There are ship upgrades that will let you see various things on the map like where hostile ships are or if its a dangerous location.\n\nAt its core, FTL is a real time strategy game with a pause.  For the most part you'll be fighting other ships, one on one. This is where the real thrill comes in for me. A game of chess. Weapons will power over time and you can fire them one by one, or save up all your weapons to use them all at once. Its all point and click with a few hot keys. The combat feels relaxing, fun and engaging with some tense moments, like having to fight next to a sun, hoping the flames don't burn your ship from the inside out, but its never stressful.\n\nThe ship's hull is its health. Even if a crew constantly repairs everything you damage, they can't repair the hull without visiting a store to replenish it. To get to the hull, you need to get through the shields. Torpedoes can go through the shield but cost you a torpedo. Beam weapons won't affect the shield at all. Lasers will damage the shield, but unless the shield room itself gets damaged, the shields merely regenerate. There are ion weapons that temporarily disable rooms or shields. You can teleport over a party, but if the ship gets destroyed or escapes, your crew will be lost!  The teleporter has a cool down after its used. They're stuck on the ship until the teleporter is ready again.\n\nEach ship is different, even if it looks the same on the outside, the rooms and weapons are different. Most ships have bridges, engines, shields and weapons. There are other rooms like oxygen, medbays to heal, cloaking to ensure enemies can't shoot you, teleporters to take a ship from the inside, oxygen, sensors, droid room and even a door mechanism room. Systems that all require power from the reactor. A free update for the game "advanced edition," added so many new rooms with new tactics and strategies. A mind control room that you can mind control the enemy crew. Hacking that breaks a room on an enemy ship over and over again while locking the doors of the room to ensure no one can get in or out. A clone bay that revives crew when they've died.\n\nThe game forces you to mix up your strategies. Sometimes you'll fly into a nebula that will drain your reactor power, so you'll have to chose what you want active. How long can your crew survive without oxygen, because you need more power to your shields, engines or weapons? Its up to you and it feels so good to have the choice and the variety.\n\nWhen you explore too leisurely visiting every location the fleet might catch up. You're always being perused and the enemy fleet will progress like a wave to catch you. Their ships are overpowered. You can survive the first ship or two, but the ships will always be at your next location if you let their wave of progress overtake you. The only way to reset the wave is to exit the sector and visit a new sector. You can slow the progress of the wave by visiting locations in nebula and other things that can slow the wave. This ensures that you never feel overpowered, but it doesn't hinder your exploration.\n\nYou have a limited crew and your ship has areas that get damaged, so you send the crew to repair those areas. If your engines get taken out you can't move. If your oxygen room gets taken out everyone on your ship will die. Holes get punctured in your hull from breaching weapons that you need to fix. Fires that start will spread from room to room. You can either have your people extinguish them OR you can open up the exterior doors of your ship and suck out all the O2. Enemies can then take out your door controls where you can't open or close your doors. These aren't just tactics that enemies use against you, these are your own tactics. Everything is balanced. Ships are just as sturdy as yours unless you're on easy difficulty.\n\nYou can purchase or find weapons from destroyed ships or in random events. The weapons have a lot of diversity. Missiles and bombs go through enemy shields. Lasers can damage shields and rooms. Various types of beams can't damage shields, only rooms and crew. Ion weapons disable room systems. Shoot the shield to disable the shield temporarily. Shoot the engine room to disable their engines. Every weapon has a different recharge rate so you need to time your attacks. There are also robot drones that have weapons too and swarm around your ship or the enemies. There is a lot of play diversity and different strategies for every ship.\n\nYou'll find plenty of alien races and learn how to deal with them all. Not just that, but you'll have them aboard your ship. The slug race is slow, weak, but has the ability to perceive what is in the rooms around them or see in nebula, so you won't need sensors. The Rockmen have a high defense, are fireproof, but slow. The mantis are great attackers, but can't repair as efficiently. The Engi have double the repair speed but they only do half the damage in hand to hand combat. The Zoltan can power the room they're in to spare power from your generator. The Crystal can lock down any room they're in, don't take as much damage from suffocation, but they move slightly slower. The Lanius will suck the oxygen from a room. Humans are the standard race that doesn't have any perk.\n\nYou can hire new crew from stores, or pick them up along the way. There are slave ships that you can liberate or buy them from. Each member of your crew will gain experience on whatever they're working on. So its better to have a dedicated engineer than someone that goes from shields, to engineering, to piloting the ship. Their repair skills will also increase as they repair things. So when you're not in battle, it might be a good idea to have the entire crew help repair things.\n\nThe game feels like Star Trek, while still being its own unique property. Helping civilizations, taking down space pirates, saving the federation from the rebel scum. The graphics might be simple, but you see exactly what's going on and you can even play it on some low tech systems. The music and sound design are excellent. The music is calming, spacy and enjoyable on its own.\n\nEach game lasts about 3 or 4 hours. Playing through and accomplishing goals will unlock new ships and new interior configurations for ships that you have. Each ship plays different and incorporates different strategies, not to mention the crew is different. Some ships start with a cloaking device, long range sensors, but no shields. Others have a super weapon, that cuts through other ships when its fully powered, but has a poor configuration. Still some ships are completely drone operated with only minimal weapons. Every game is a new way to play.\n\nThere is a lot of strategy, depth and replay value to this game. Do you take out your enemy's engine, shields, weapons or robotic drones first? There are random events that make new challenges. Its a wonderful game worth $10.\n\nThe game developer was nice enough to make a free update that adds even more content and replayability! The upgrades add a lot more quirky fun. Things like mind control, new weapons, a new race and new playable ships give you a lot of reason to return.","September 19, 2013","true","248.7"," 183 of 214 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","183","214","0","0"

Then, the fire catches on in the door control room, so I send the pilot, Hector, to assist.\n\nBoth Willow and Dolan begin suffering from smoke inhalation and 3rd degree burns, so I tell them to get the hell out of there! Hector is also beginning to lost the fight with the flames, so I have him run back into the cockpit.\n\nAs I try to figure out, wtf do I do now?... the fire catches on in the sensor room. In a short time I can no longer see any room on the ship other than those occupied by the horrified crew. It seems as if the end is here, after only 2 missions, when Hector gets the bright idea "Hey, what if we turn off the oxygen systems!" (You see, the rooms were not adjacent to the airlock, and even if they were, the door control room was destroyed so there was no possibility to remotely access them anyway.)\n\nSuch a brilliant idea! It put out the fires! Then hector goes in to repair the medbay, with only 6 hp, and because, idk, maybe the fire accelerated the rate at which the oxygen was drained from that room, he suffocates and dies. But at least his dying words informed the rest of the crew that the plan indeed worked. Hector died a hero.\n\nKnowing the risks at this point, Willow waited until the O2 systems restored life support throughout the ship before going in to repair the medbay.

They didn't even consider negotiating they just wanted our scraps and weapons.\n\nWe locked on to their ship and started shooting, but in a mere second we had a boarding party on our ship. My crew wasn't capable of fighting 4 enemies at once, Berkley rushed to the cockpit as Matthieu and Jason locked themselves in the door control room and locked down the entire ship. Jason quickly opened the airlocks and vented every bit of oxygen from the ship, except the cockpit, surveillance room and door control room.\n\nAs we were fighting with the intruders, our ship got devastated by enemy fire. Just after the intruders suffocated, we've got a direct hit on the life support system with a hull breach, but we managed to destroy their ship after all.\n\nCelebration had to wait, the life support system was down, we had a hull breach and the oxygen was escaping from the ship fast. Only 5% remaining, meaning there wasn't any oxygen left on the ship, but in the door control room and the cockpit. Berkley was wounded in the running and we had to make a decision fast. So I sent Matthieu and Jason to the life support system to repair it and the hull breach.\n\nJust before they closed the intercom channel, Matthieu said: "It was an honour serving with you Captain."\n\nThey knew they signed up for a one way trip to save the rest of us. They took a deep breath, held it and ran to save the ship. Matthieu was losing consciousness fast and halfway through the repair he started to ran back to the control room to get some air, but he couldn't open the door. A few bangs on the door and it was over. Matthieu was gone. Jason held it for as long as he could, Matthieu repaired the hull breach so he had to worry about the life support system. Struggling with staying awake Jason pushed one last button before he exhaled his soul into the empty space and the system was back online. Oxygen started to spread across the ship, me and Berkley can finally breathe up.\n\nWe rushed out from the cockpit to save the rest of the crew but it was too late. CPR and the med bay couldn't help them, they were already clinically dead. So it was only the two of us.\n\nBerkley started repairing the shield, the engines and the weapons system while I planned our route out of this wicked and cursed nebula.\n\nThe damage was bad. Berkley got everything back to operational status but our hull damage was worse than ever. The ship barely held itself together.\n\nWe managed to make it to a Long-Range Beacon and chose to go to a civilian sector now, hoping we would avoid any fight. The two of us could barely operate this ship, to be fully combat-effective, we tried to keep a low-profile until we get some crew members willing to join.\n\nAfter a few FTL jumps, I quikcly realized that no matter how hard I try to avoid a firefight, war doesn't work like that. No sectors are safe from pirates, slavers, rebel symphatizers and criminals.\n\nA pirate ship fully equipped and ready to blow us to pieces, required a toll from us to go past this sector. We didn't have too much scrap and it wasn't enough for them. We begged for their mercy but they didn't listen. One last fight, we locked on their ship and started shooting. It was only a few shot. With the first 3 shot they took out our engines, the surveillance room and the shields. Berkley got severely injured but was still trying to fight the fire in the engine room which came from the explosion, though due to his injuries Berkley was consumed by the fire in the end.\n\nShooting a few more rockets and laser shots in the enemy seemed like a hopeless effort to breach through their strong shields and the last shot have marked our fate.\n\nAs the ship was blown to pieces and I've got sucked out into space by the vacuum, there was only a few seconds to reflect on my life.\n\nOnly a few seconds until I became the frozen captive of the empty space.\n\nI strongly recommend this game!\n\nYou have the abilityto re-route power on your ship, vent the rooms to kill the intruders, while you are under fire and repairing severe damages on your ship, you have to cause damage to the enemy ship as well.\n\nCan't write much about it. Just simply amazing I always wanted to manage my own starship and crew. :D\nMass Effect was just a little demo to what this game offers for you. :D","January 3, 2015","true","4.9"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","87","52","60","18","2"

And while plenty of attempts at capital ship management have come and gone over the years, few seemed to capture the spirit of being a space commander like FTL. Featuring equal parts tactical combat, executive decisions, and airlocking tiny crewmembers, it's the one captaining sim that crosses over into whatever part of sci-fi tickles your fancy.\n\nIn a charming twist, you are a federation captain trying to outrun the dastardly rebellion with valuable intel on their next move. There are dozens of ships you can start with, all featuring their own armaments, crews, and gimmicks, and all needing to be unlocked through deeds in game. You then have eight sectors of space to cross without being blasted, eaten, stranded, or otherwise murdered by hopping from jump point to jump point, one step ahead of the ever-encroaching rebel fleet. Some jump points will have enemy ships to fight, some will have story encounters where you get text options, some will have merchants, and so on. There's a remarkable amount of things to run into in FTL, so much that even 30 hours in you may be encountering things that are new to you.\n\nA large part of that journey of discovery is going to be the enemy ships that try to kill you. There are many kinds across the different races and factions, each one randomly rolled with weapons and systems. This is where the combat system really shines, because your own weapons and systems can be targeted manually to focus on the rooms that are causing you the most problems. If they have really nasty guns, you can obliterate their weapon control. If they have teleporters to send over boarding parties, you can blast it. If they're trying to get away, you can knock their engines out. Battles play out in real time but at a very measured pace, and you can pause freely to assess the situation and give new orders. It's an armchair commander's dream come true, watching the little crews scramble around their ships, fighting and putting out fires, as both vessels trade volleys.\n\nThere's a lot to learn about the game, especially after the free update it got awhile back. Your ship can be upgraded with teleporters, drones, mind control, hacking, cloning bays, and more. Currency comes in the form of scrap, and learning how to best use your scrap might be the hardest part of the game since it needs to be spread across buying new equipment, upgrading your ship, and repairing your hull. FTL is a carefully-balanced game, keeping you a hair away from cold vacuum unless you've really mastered its intricacies. You need to know when to retreat from battle, when upgrading doors is more important that shields, and how long your crew can hold their breath. The learning curve is steep, but if you like the gameplay, having more to learn keeps the replay value high.\n\nExcellent, detailed pixel art and a delightfully atmospheric soundtrack round out this extremely deep package. With three difficulty levels and a bunch of unlockables and (internal) achievements to shoot for, FTL is an easy recommendation to anyone wanting a spaceship game in general. Your command over your vessel is so nuanced and gratifying that you'll find yourself caught up in the plight of your tiny crew over and over again. Mastering the art of combat and the delicate resource balance will take time and patience, but sticking it out to become a proper captain is a fantastically rewarding experience.","December 15, 2015","true","35.6"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","35","38","3","0"

At each beacon, you encounter an event. Sometimes it will be nothing, sometimes it will be a pirate fight, sometimes it will be someone in distress that needs your help. It puts you in different scenarios, where your actions determine your fate, your future, and that of the creatures around you. The great soundtrack of this game will easily get stuck in your head, and you still won’t hate it! With runs lasting up to 2 hours if you drag it on to the end, this game is fun and worthwhile, if not simply to get a couple hours for your money’s worth.\n\nThe controls are very simple, and most of the buttons have hotkeys to speed things up and make it easier. However, sometimes the controls are unresponsive. You can click and even press the hotkeys as much as you want, and it won’t work. I have played on multiple different computers, and have even talked to friends experiencing the same problem. This is one of the biggest issues with the game, as timing is often vital in battle situations and being delayed even a second can get you screwed in battle.\n\nWhile this game is very fun to start, and without a doubt quite challenging, it does eventually get boring and repetitive. There isn’t very much variation in the events, and you end up going through the same situations over and over again with very few different possible outcomes. The events are essentially what makes the game interesting, and I think having more to this aspect of the game would increase the amount of time you spend playing FTL by a lot. Even the advanced edition content added very little from what I could tell.\n\nAlthough this doesn’t affect gameplay at all and isn’t a big deal, I don’t like how you can’t have your own preset ship and crewman names, and crewman positions. If you want to set your own names, you have to reset it individually each time (aside from using the restart button to keep the same names as your last run). And every run, the crew will start in the default positions, so if you don’t like them, you have to move them every time. I often forget and end up moving them in the middle of the first fight, which isn’t a big deal, but can be annoying.\n\nBeing able to set the crew positions is one of the most useful features. You can have your crew running around and repairing things or fighting off intruders, and when they’re all done, send them all back to their positions instantly at the press of a button! It’s useful to keep everyone in position at all time. It’s also really helpful given that moving crew individually is kind of awkward. The left click-right click maneuver is weird, and annoying to get used to. Left click to select then left click to move would work fine, as it’s the same system used for the weapons. Then right click can be used to deselect. Currently it’s the reverse of the controls for weapon use, and this makes it even more inconvenient to get used to.\n\nWhile many people will tell you that this game is extremely difficult, I will have to disagree. I found that it’s challenging, but sometimes in the end you just kind of get killed by random events. Sometimes a random event will get a lucky shot in, and you lose a vital team member or just an unlucky sequence of shots that puts you in a really bad situation. Of course sometimes you will lose of making your own mistake or being new to the game and what not, but often it will be because of an unlucky bad situation you were put in.\n\nThe end-game sectors are where the game starts to legitimately get tougher. This is a good thing, because the progressive increase in difficulty forces you to adapt your strategy and equipment to take down shields more efficiently and make sure you can survive yourself. This transition into the more difficult sectors can be tough, and there’s really no way to get past it unless you’re ready for it coming out of the previous sectors. You need to upgrade your ship sufficiently, get better weapons and the system upgrades to power them, at least 3 levels of shield and probably a couple extra crewmen from the default 3. Sometimes this is impossible, and it can ruin a run, but it also forces you to think ahead a bit and prepare, which is good. In the end though, it should always be possible to win a run using just skill of the game.\n\nThe final boss is also the only extremely hard part of the game. You have to fight 3 phases of it, in between which you could in theory go back to a repair station and fix up your ship, but chances are you either won’t be able to get to one without it being taken over by the rebels, or on your way back after getting fixed up you’ll fight more rebels and get weakened again. The later phases honestly become close to impossible without certain exact equipment which you have to be lucky to get.\n\nOverall, this game is fun for a while, and if you’re willing to persevere through all the tough parts to get really good at this game, there could easily be more than 100 hours worth of gameplay to unlock all the extra content. But in the end, for your casual gamer or roguelike lover, this game is probably only worthwhile to get while it’s on sale (which does happen pretty frequently). For me, this game was fun for a while, but about 15 hours in I started getting bored of runs half way through and it stopped being worthwhile to keep playing.","July 19, 2015","true","20.4"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","38","44","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibernetik/recommended/212680/","kibernetik","Eddard Stark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibernetik/","542 products in account","There are some games, which you can easily describe in a sentence. Army man shoots another army man, the team of Russia, Aztecs and Rome gets destroyed by the sneaky Gandhi, survivor walks for an hour, finds another survivor and drinks bleach. Yet, as much as I try to put FTL into a single sentence, I keep failing. A space-ship commander simulator, which lets you relive your captain fantasies of Star Trek? An easy to pick up rogue-lite, which will make you scream as your three hours’ worth of upgrades are blasted into junk by the final boss? A story, with an outcome almost entirely the same every time you play, but with a journey worth an entire sci-fi novel by itself? All of those things and much, much more are present here.\n\nFTL stands for Faster Than Light. A term usually used in various science fiction works. Just like this game. You might command a ship consisting of a bunch of humans and a slug, going through the Rock homeworlds and getting ambushed by space pirates. You direct all your power to the weapons, blast them a few rounds and then masterfully evade their gigantic missile by activating your cloaking device. After the pirates beg for mercy, you ponder for a minute about how much scrap and fuel can you get if you’d leave them or destroy them. Moments later, their orange-and-purple ship is obliterated into thousands of tiny pieces in spectacular 2D graphics. Your crew has just finished fixing the oxygen bay and you’re ready to move out. As you’re about to engage your FTL Engine, you take a second to admire the gorgeous scenery, I mean, space. Space can be really beautiful too, you know. Three minutes later your whole crew dies to killer Rock-men, who boarded your ship. Time to start again.\n\nFTL stands for Flying Till Losing. Because once you lose you can’t fly. Unless you restart the game. But why would you restart such an amazing run with a space-monk Zoltan Cruiser. They might be weak in melee combat, but their super-shields disable enemy boarding systems, so killer Rock-men aren’t a problem now. Navigating through the map, you see a distress signal left by someone. Great, people in distress always mean there’s some money, err, scrap to be found! Bah, another pirate ambush. Oh well, all you have to do is send all power to the guns and… BOOM! Your ship is nigh-unstoppable. Oh man, in space nobody can hear you scream, but the sounds of explosion and lasers shooting are so amazing, almost as awesome as the battle music! The themes are just great, they accompany, but not overshadow what happens in the game. Well, time to move on. Six minutes later you find yourself unable to escape the pursuing rebels and clash against one of their giant ships. Your super shield is gone almost immediately, and you meekly Zoltan crew dies from the engulfing flames. Let’s restart.\n\nFTL stands for Failing To Leave. Basically, this is one addictive game. Yes, frustration might get you, since it’s almost inevitable that your game will end up as a loss, this game is that hard. However, various unlockable ships and layouts help give some sense of progression, as this is a permanent-death game. Still, after a break, you will want to play more. Boot the game up, maybe choose a different ship. Yeah, the Engi Layout B seems cool-enough. Different ships not only change the visuals, but essentially the way you play. Standard ships might use the “blast-and-away” tactics, but horrible space-bugs Mantis usually try to get their prey by boarding. Space-human-robots (seeing a pattern here? SPACE!) Engies love to use drones and that means that they rarely do all the fighting themselves, instead, relying on autonomous robots to protect or attack. Alternative ship layouts take it one step further, in Engi case, there’s only one crew-member on board, rest of them are drones. That would be extremely problematic, however, various updates and even mods help the game get even more complex. For example, Captain’s Edition mod allows the sole Engi create new crewmember holograms. With an army of holo-friends, my Engi is ready to win this game. Twelve minutes later, the Engi ship runs out of fuel, getting lost in deep space. We will try again.\n\nFTL also stands for Flailing Through Levels. Your Rock cruiser finally manages to reach close to the final stage. Take a moment, go ahead, and reflect what a run was that. You saved a space station from an outbreak, helped the Zoltans reach nirvana, beat the mighty Mantis pirate KazaaakplethKilik and even unlocked his ship. You fought countless pirates, saved a defective rebel and helped lay off a siege of a friendly space station. One last foe until you’re ready to fight what awaits at the end of the game. The huge rebel space-ship proves no match for your skills, as you seamlessly transfer power from guns, to engines, to clone bay, all while choosing which parts of the opposing ship should be destroyed. The dream scenario: a victory against a worthy foe with minimal losses. You take a deep breath, time to see what lies in the final level. Eighteen minutes later, you enjoy the final moments of a Rock cruiser, little flaming bits of it flying in space. The boss was so close to defeat, yet you still lost. We are ready to win next time.","June 18, 2014","true","48.4"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","4"

Let me just say that this game is extremely fun. It is extremely polished and it will keep you coming back for more time and time again when you die. And yes, you will die....ALOT. The main problem i have with this game is how it always seems like your opponents dont play by the same rules as you. This is laughably apparent when you encounter the flagship, but more on that later.\n\nThis is a game where the RNG (random number generator or random number god) holds your fate in its hand almost every time you do a jump. It does not matter how decked out your ship is, how many max level crew you have or how prepared you THINK you are. Like i said in the previous paragraph, the game does not play by the same rules as you, and you will find many enounters that feel unfair, or some that are flat out impossible to win against depending on what ship you pick.\n\nAnd that leads me to the games boss, the flagship. If you manage to get to this behemoth of a ship, you will probably do what i did the first time i encountered it. First you will be awe struck at how big and how many systems and weapons it has, and then when it fires that first volley of lasers and missles which seem to never end, you will sit back, laugh out loud and roll your eyes. I am by no means saying the flagship cant be beaten, because it most definitely can. The problem is in order to beat it there are really only a small list of ship "builds" that are effective, and even with those setups, grasping victory can seem very difficult. Alot of the time you have to rely on luck, because while you think that 55% evasion you have actually equals 55%, it will feel like 10% when a full volley of missles and 2 volleys of lasers all impact with almost no misses whatsoever.\n\nAs i said, the game is very fun, its definitely worth your time, and you will come back for more no matter how stupidly frustrating it can be.  Just realize that all the planning and ship upgrades in the world are just one or two jumps from ending up as space debris at any given moment.","July 13, 2014","false","86.5"," 313 of 511 people (61%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","61","313","511","12","24"

You really want to start on Easy, and use the pause button very frequently. It's really a turn based game don't try to play it in real time. Then just try stuff, explore solar systems, and have a great time. Normal mode is hard enough that lots of people never beat it, and then they added a hard more that really is tough.\n\nThe graphics are very simple but also very clean and clear. There is a lot more variation visually than you might think, but you will always know exactly what is happening at a glance. The music is really, really great. You don't need to be a fan of any specific type of music to appreciate how well the tone is constantly transmitted to you. Personally I wind up turning the music off in any game I play after a while, because you have heard it sooo many times, but with FTL I turn it back on, sometimes.\n\nThere is lots of content to see. The different types of ships can change the tactical combat hugely, all kinds of things will have effects on the interactions you will have. Some people get frustrated because they have a hard time beating the final boss of the game, but the truth is that exploring the galaxy in various ways and encountering various things, the basic gameplay itself, is the point. The first time I got to the boss it was an accident and I was disappointed because I didn't get to finish the delivery quest I was working on.\n\nI have over 100 hours logged into Steam, and this game has gotten me through at least one long internet-free vacation on top of that. Most of that was before they added a huge, free expansion pack, too. If tactical turn based rougue like lite whatever space exploration sounds fun to you, at all, you will get some time out of this.\n\nThe cherry on top of the FTL sundae is the price, it's been in a few bundles and goes 70-85% off pretty frequently. It's worth it at any price, really.","May 25","true","107.6"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

It is an extremely brutal game, which is good, because while excessive brutality is bad, I'd rather have that then have excessive hand-holding. As a review would do, pros and cons and neutrals will come next.\nPROS:\nExtreme difficulty, but not unfair difficulty. This game is very, very, VERY hard to actually win, in fact, in 26 hours, I have only won ONE TIME. Most of the times you lose, it is because you forgot to do something essential, such as repair the doors, put out the fire in the oxygen room before letting out all of the oxygen to put out the other fires, putting out fires, upgrading, etcetera\n\nA plethora (wow, who uses that word anymore?) of weapons. You got good weapons, bad weapons, pew pew weapons, BWEEE weapons, PCHEW weapons, VWABABA weapons, and more (in order, good weapons, bad weapons, laser weapons, beam weapons, explosive weapons, teleporting weapons)\n\nAll the replayability ever. I can 100% guarantee that you will NEVER play the same run twice. Sometimes you'll get the GLAIVE BEAM OF DEATH, sometimes you will get the basic laser of OH GOD WE CAN'T PENETRATE THEIR SHIELDS, and sometimes you'll get both of them and then you can actually do something\n\nSo many unlockables. There are I believe 10 or 11 ships, maybe only 8, I really don't remember. Every ship has 3 types of that ship you can unlock except for 1 or 2 of them, plus they all have 2 ways of unlocking them, except for 3 of them, and one of them is one you start with\n\nMusic. The music is absolutely amazing. That is all\n\nNEUTRALS\nThere are none\n\nNEGATIVES\nUuuuuuuuuuuuh... I can't think of any.

FTL is Very fun game if you don't mind a challenging experience and permadeath.\n\n\nThe storyline is basically you have to fly across the galaxy with an important objective, to warn your people of the incoming invasion, or something along those lines. The base gameplay is almost a turn based action game, with the ability to pause and select how and where you wish to attack. You command the basic ship at the start with the ability to unlock more ships as you progress through the game. The game is composed of 5 Sectors, each with ramping difficulty, but most players should be able to survive through them. The final stage the play must fight a boss ship, winning the game if they destroy it, but restarting all over if the fail.\n\n\nDepending on the ship you fly, there are all kinds of different mods, weapons, rooms, and crew members (of many races and abilities) to acquire, creating many different playstyles. These are purchased with scrap, the in game currency acquired by selling things at stores, completing side mission and destroying ships. Destroying ships also gives you drone parts, used for different types of drones, missiles, used for, well, missile launchers, and fuel. If you ship runs out of fuel in space, you can either wait for the bad guy army to catch up to you, or you can set a distress beacon. Throughout the game, the bad guys are chasing after you. You only have so much time to acquire resources and move on before you are overwhelmed.\n\n\nThe galaxy in the game is randomly generated each time, and each sector is randomly generated as well, and each area in each sector is also randomly generated. The game will never be the same 2 playthroughs in a row. This adds replayability into the game, making the permadeath seem less of a drawback and more of an opportunity.\n\n\nThe game, although retro looking, is actually beautiful. The graphic style suits the game very very well. The sound in the game is amazing, the music is so inviting and fits the game perfectly.\n\n\nFTL does many things right.\n\n\nReplayability\n\nMany play styles\n\na constant feeling that every choice you make has real significance\n\nThe graphic style of the game suits it very well.\n\nThe music and sound of the game are phenomenal and fit so well\n\nThe diverse races make the galaxy seem more populated\n\nThe random events and their consequences make the player feel more in control\n\nThe DLC/expansion is free\n\nModding community\n\nHas steam trading cards\n\n\nFTL does some things wrong.\n\n\nThe end boss is extremely difficult\n\nThere are a few bugs that still haven't been patched out\n\nThe game can feel tedious if played more than 20 hours\n\nSome playstyles, although fun, are near impossible to win with\n\nSometimes sectors are over populated, and you get into too many space battles\n\nThe “luck of the draw” feeling comes in as you continue to play\n\n\nThis game is very fun to someone who likes a challenge. I would suggest that the best way to enjoy this game is not look try to enjoy beating the boss, enjoy the journey through space. Or even too try to earn the achievements to give the game another perpous. The game has its issues but all in all it is a great deal of fun. The modest price of $10.99(CAD) Is worth is to someone who might put 15+ hours into it. If its on sale, i think everyone should pick up this game, it's a wonderful little nugget of gold in the vast desert that is the steam indie game section.\n","May 7, 2015","true","42.5"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","26","35","2","3"

I'm an absolute sucker for games with awesome soundtracks, and i fell deeply in love with FTL's beautifully soothing and atmospheric music.

Over the past two weeks I picked it up again with the goal of finally winning. Took about 20 additional hours for my first (and thus far only) victory on Normal mode. I feel a lot better about reviewing it now that I've got enough hours and a victory logged.\n\n100% recommended.\n\nYou are the captain of a ship. You have to micromanage your crew and systems (weapons, shields, engines, oxygen. and piloting being the primary systems that you start with, with various systems and subsystems that differ from ship to ship or can be purchased along the way. Your goal is to explore every sector of the galaxy, progressing towards an exit beacon that propels you into the next one. You have limited time in each sector, and every jump costs one fuel. You'll often stumble across shops that let you install new weapons, hire new crew, buy new systems, buy basics like fuel and missiles, sell things you don't want anymore, and repair your ship if need be. Tons of different events that you can encounter on your travels, all having various outcomes based on your decisions. You'll make decisions or run into hostile ships after each jump with the goal being to survive long enough to upgrade your ship, get better weapons, make it to the end, and beat the final boss.\n\nThat's FTL in a nutshell. Once you learn the ropes, the best ways to attack and defend, optimal ways to upgrade your ship, which events will punish you and which ones will help, you'll gradually make it further and further. On the surface the game seems completely RNG-based (and indeed, you can play perfectly and have a stretch of unlucky breaks that kill your run, or a stretch of lucky ones that win it), but the more you play, the better you get. You learn the tricks of the trade and suddenly you're relying way less on RNG and way more on your own skill.\n\nYou start with one ship unlocked, and can unlock more through various quests in-game or by beating the game with other ships. There are ten ships in total, eight of which have three layouts, two of which have two. That's a grand total of 28 ships to choose from each with its own starting strengths, weaknesses, and intended playstyle. Different starting weapons and systems really shake things up. Lots of replay value.\n\nGame has three difficulties now, easy, normal, and hard. Normal is punishingly hard at times and it will take you a while to beat. You're gonna die a lot, but that's part of the fun. Even on easy mode, it's unlikely you'll be winning when you first start playing, as the game is still challenging and you stlil need to learn the ins and outs. I didn't play on easy mode even once until I had cleared normal (which happened at the 45 hour mark, but again the first 25 hours were me playing totally wrong so let's say 20), and what I learned in normal means I can win easy almost every time now, while normal is still very challenging and hard mode is completely beyond me.\n\nCaptain your vessel, blow things up, die a lot, cry when your oxygen gets blown up and you suffocate from a hull breach, don't fight the giant alien spiders (they are no joke), get stranded with no fuel, go on a grand adventure, rinse and repeat until you win, and then rinse and repeat some more.

Sometime later I came across a tips and tricks thread and got a desire to play again.  I soon learned that I was playing the game poorly, and that it is not luck driven at all.  *See DarkTwinge's videos on Twitch.*  Shortly after I got my first win on easy... then my second... then my third.  I saw how fun this game can be.\n\nThen I took break from the game and forgot about it for a while.  Now that the free expansion was released, I decided to install it again and explore the content.  So I fired up a game and, 90 minutes later, I beat the game on my first try.  What a blast.\n\nIf you are having a hard time with this game, please do not give up.  Take a break if you need to.

Strategic play feels rewarded and the depth of combat rarely gets old. A variety of alien species, different ships, different layouts and random sectors/system help provide huge replay value. A winning run through the game can take up to around two hours.\n\nIt is not an easy game which is both a blessing and a curse. Losing a decent run due to the RNG (random number generator) nature to some of the events you might come across as you travel to the final battle can sometimes get to you. It's worth sticking with for those good runs, even if they end in failure, that see you score high or tell an exciting story.\n\nThe recent free content patch in the form of the Advanced Edition added a swathe of new features, events, ship systems and even a new race and playable ship. It has made a great game even better - even if it has also made the final boss even more frustrating and difficult!\n\nIf you want to check out some first impressions of mine on the FTL Advanced Edition feel free to check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVJvcDIXihk","April 11, 2014","true","52.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The only caveat is you have to enjoy roguelike gameplay where you build a sweet ship and then lose it all by doing something stupid.  Every time I die I learn something and come away with a new story.\n\nFor example, learning to board other ships instead of simply attacking them got me a few good stories about how I killed my crew and lost the game.  Some minor spoilers: The first time I did it, I accidentally left my ship's guns on autoattack and blew up the ship I boarded with my crew still on it.  The second time I did it, I boarded an "auto-scout" ship, which has no crew and therefore no oxygen, and my crew died before I could get them back.  The third time I did it I had the ship down to 1 health and didn't consider that we were in an asteroid field where it could blow up without me attacking it, and it did.  Eventually I got the hang of boarding ships and the payoff is well worth it.","June 19, 2013","true","27.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

I've been playing FTL on the iPad since last year.\nHere's what I have to say.\n\n10 reasons for a 10/10\n1. Dying over and over again, many times is the game. Unless you win the final fight.\n2. You will see giant alien spiders atleast once in every playthrough.(what I mean is you reach sector 8) Always reject them unless you have a clone bay.\n3. Ship layout doesn't always guarantee victory(even you Mantis B and Crystal B)\n4. Unlocking the Crystal ship is like winning the lottery. Match all three encounters and you win the prize.\n5. The game's soundtrack fits the game's theme perfectly, starting as a calm track; then becoming faster as you get into a fight.\n6. If you're surviving, you'll die. If you're thriving, you will die. If you're lucky, you'll win.\n7.  Boarding with 4 mantis/2 crystal & 2 mantis/4 rockmen with fire is extremely fun! Getting boarded, isn't.\n8. I love how stupidly powerful/stupid/powerful the enemy ships are. I wonder if they fixed the 5 shielded auto ship.\n9. The euphoria, ecstacy when winning a game will outweigh all of the times you lost before then.\n10.  Modding is extremely fun. Especially Captain's Edition, ship mods, and graphics mods.\n\nThose are ten decent reasons to buy FTL.\n\nP.S. ion intruders, ♥♥♥♥ off","April 3, 2015","true","35.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","12","14","6","0"

Usually these "infinitely replayable" games hold my interest for one full playthrough unless they are mind-numbingly boring or unplayably buggy, but I rarely ever start second playthrough (let alone complete one). I bought FTL at deep discount ($2.49) expecting to play through it once, kill a few hours, and get my money's worth. For once, I was incredibly suprised by a supposedly "replayable" game. I've spent about 30 hours on FTL, beaten the flagship once, and I'm still on the edge of my seat. There is something about the combination of true roguelike RNG and built-in replay mechanics that makes FTL something special. Though I've gotten many unlucky runs where everything seemed stacked against me, each crushing defeat felt truly unique. While FTL can be frustrating, it has never felt unfair. There is always something new to learn or try out. There is a real thrill that comes out of constructing a strategy, trying to implement it, and inevitably adapting it based on the hand you are dealt.

Looking at the gameplay, it is a roguelike game in which you travel thought galaxies, racing against the pursuing rebels and dealing with anything that deep space can throw at you: from pirates, slave traders to the giant alien spiders. This game forces you to make crucial decisions and will not hold your hand when you deal with the consequences of your actions. Planning ship upgrades wisely, commanding your crew - everything in this game is unexcpectably fun, even if, thanks to the randomized event generation,one false move makes your ship is torn apart.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are deep enough to support many different playstyles and the game knows it, giving you an opportunity to cruise with different ships suited for the specific playstyle. Macross Missle Massacre? Or you want be close and presonal with a Boarding Crew? Drones? Cloak? There are tons of replayability here and the game isn't a cakewalk either, so prepare for tons of spacin' hours.\n\nThe writing is very good. Even after multiple replays of the game, where many random events may repeat themselfs, some of the situations presented in FTL will decently test your sense of morality. Sometimes there aren't pure good decisions here... Well, unless one of your upgrades or crew members will reveal itself to be useful in the unusual way...\n\nAddicting gameplay, unique music and simple graphics (near non-existand hardware requirements).

There is perhaps an over-reliance on procedural generation that can make the game overly inconsistent in difficulty, but to many, that's the appeal.  At it's heart, FTL is a simple space tactical game that uses it's rogue-like elements with decent proficiency to create that often-sought "just one more game" replayability.

Its deceptive simplicity is betrayed by the room for strategy and tactics. This coupled with its rapid difficulty climb makes it absolutely engrossing. Its replayability is unquestionably high thanks to the game’s heavy use of RNG and its Oregon Trail-esque scenarios which can make a particular run easy or end it then and there. The game creates a retro vibe with its charming pixel art style and a very fitting soundtrack that definitely deserves to be sold on its own.\n9/10\nP.S. NEVER SEND IN CREW TO HELP WITH GIANT ALIEN SPIDERS IT NEVER  WORKS OUT\n\nFull Review:\nFTL: Faster Than Light is another edition to the ever growing rogue-lite genre. Affectionately reffered to as “Oregon Trail in Space,” FTL is about making your way across a galaxy to deliver vital information about enemy rebels to The Federation. Along this trip you must equip yourself with weapons, fight enemy ships, and make Oregon Trail esque decision that can either lead to great rewards or have your best crew member be eaten by a giant alien spiders.\n\nThe combat in FTL can be described as “semi-turn based.” Weapons require time to charge up before firing, however different weapons take different amounts of time to charge making it so weapons go off at set intervals but not strictly in turns. You can also target specific systems of the enemy ship to fire on in order to minimize damage taken and maximize damage dealt. For example, a common tactic is to use missiles, which ignore shields, to take out the shield system so that you may use your rapid fire laser weapons to take out their weapon system.\n\nThere are 4 different weapon types: Laser, Beam, Missile, and Ion, each which have their own merits and disadvantages allowing a wide array of strategy to be used. However arming yourself and manfighting any ship that comes your way isn’t your only option. Along your trip in FTL you will come across stores which can sell you new crew members, weapons, ship augments, and ship systems for scrap you collect by defeating ships or as rewards for random scenarios. One possible system you can arm yourself with is a Drone Control system, which allows you to let drone AI do all the fighting for you while you can just focus on defense. Another system you can get is the Crew Teleport system which you use to send your most combat effective crewmembers onto the enemy ship. This allows you to defeat the enemy without destroying the ship which yields more scrap and has a chance to get you a new weapon, drone schematic, or ship augment.\n\nAs this is a rogue-lite game, FTL makes extensive use of RNG. For example, you must make your way through 8 “sectors,” each sector has a procedurally generated star map with around 20 beacons each. The content and pattern of the beacons vary wildly with the only real guarantee being that you can make it from the starting point to the exit beacon that takes you to the next sector. Moreover, sectors are randomly made into one of three types, hostile, civilian, and nebula, each with their own race specific subtype. The sector type determines what is sold in stores, the likelihood of certain outcomes for scenarios, the types of enemies you face, and sector exclusive scenarios. While you can only go through 8 sectors in the game, the map will you give you multiple paths to choose from so you are not at the total mercy of RNG.\n\nFTL further elaborates its rogue-lite elements with its replayability. In fact the only overall progress possible in this game is unlocking new ships to start with. You unlock these ships by getting achievements, completing specific quests, and beating the game repeatedly. However the achievements required to unlock ships are seldom easy. The quests needed to unlock ships usually require you to make a few specific decisions across multiple scenarios while praying that RNG is with you. Not only that, beating the game is very difficult, as you advance across sectors enemy ships become better equipped to the point that making it to Sector 8 is a feat on its own. Then there’s what awaits at Sector 8, the Rebel Flagship, an enemy so strong it makes all other before it seem like shieldless auto-scouts.\n\nFTL has an almost retro feel thanks to its pixel art graphics. While not necessarily impressive, it works. It’s the closest thing FTL has as a weak point but in a way that only serves as a deterrent for those who wouldn’t be able to enjoy the gameplay to begin with. The graphics are complimented with the atmospheric chiptune soundrack. A soundtrack which definitely deserves to be sold on its own.\n\nPersonally, I have a strong affinity towards roguelike and rogue-lite games and FTL is no exception. The way that doing the same thing in certain scenarios doesn’t always yield the same result across playthroughs can be both exciting and incredibly frustrating. Likewise the placement of stores and the frequency of difficult enemies can make me want to destroy my computer. But that’s just part of the challenge and what makes this game addictive. But remember, never try to send in crew to help with giant alien spiders","May 5, 2015","true","40.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","1"

You have a mission to survive and there are so many ways to fail, yet so many places to explore and unpredictable events to unravel.\n\nWhat makes the game really fun is the decisions you make for your ship to survive and your strategy of micro-managing your crew, situations and resources in order to make it to your goal.\n\nDepending on the roles you give to each crew member will also depend which skills and strengths they develop.\n\nThere are some interesting species to encounter and play as in FTL, from fireproof rockmen to telepathic slugs. The random name generation is quite amusing too.\n\nAs a roguelike game, this means there is no mercy if you die and your ship explodes. Failling means the end and you will need to start all over again. The feeling is bad, but the desire to play again is always there, just to see if luck is in your hands next time.\n\nAlso, you can unlock ships, in-game achivements and layouts if you do keep playing over again, depending on what you encounter and how far you get.\n\nSometimes when played for too long with the same ship and crew, it's easy to become attached to the crew members.

Although, for newcomers I would recomend sticking with vanilla, then going to advanced edition, and if you love the game as much as I do, get some mods for it.\nThe other big problem I see people complaining about is to heavily luck/rng based. Yes, there are a few events that cannot be avoided. Do you cut the red wire or the blue wire? Do you want to pay a hefty price in order to have your crewmans life spared, or do you leave him behind to his fate? While there are certainly events that cannot be avoided, these are events that with enough practice, can be dealt with in the best way possible to know what outcomes there are so you know how to overcome much of the "luck" in this game. Sure, you couldn't help it when your defense drone failed to shoot down five missles in a row, but hey, sometimes you just get the short end of the stick. Either way, for probably at least 85% of the events in the game, you can always have the odds come out in your favor by knowing which options you should choose depending on which crew you have and which upgrades you have.\nAlso, I see a couple people complain about this game getting stale, and yes, this game can't be everybodys cup of tea, but as a said, 1. mods are a great way to improve the game to your taste, and 2. I believe that my hours speak for myself when I say that this game is hard to get stale.\nIn conclusion, this is an amazing game that I can recomend to so many people. If you are checking this game out and thinking that you will like it, then odds are, you will. So, if you are reading this, then that means you disreaged my previous information of "Stop reading this and buy the game right now." So hopefully I can help encourage you to get this game, and if you do and you like it, then that is great, A winner is you!\nIf anybody has a question about this game that wasn't answered in my review, or if you have any positive or negative opinions about my review, then just leave them down in the comments, section and I will get back to you ASAP.","January 5","false","689.7"," 258 of 483 people (53%) found this review helpful 153 people found this review funny","53","258","483","153","58"

After you learn the basics and all, It can become very, VERY, addicting. The day i bought it i spent 7 hours on it. Overall, Great game IMO. 9/0 would buy again.\n\nEDIT: After about another 3 hours, I feel I should add on to the review. The game is difficult and I almost guarantee you will not beat it in your first playthroughs. The goal of the game is to explore different areas of the map as the rebel fleet is chasing you. There are 3 types of the map. Nebulas, Civilian, and Hostile. Nebulas are areas of the map that block out your sensors, disabling you to see in areas of the ship that your crew isn't in. Nebulas will slow down the rebel fleet, but are difficult to traverse. Civilian areas are areas of the map that are mostly poulated by civilians. There are pirates here, so don't be stupid. I find plenty of merchants in this area so it is a good area to restock and repair. Hostile areas are areas mostly controled by hostiles, obviously. You can expect to battle nearly every checkpoint you travel to. Watch your hull, and make sure you repair it whenever you can. I hope this helps. If you have a question either comment on my profile or comment on the review.","June 24, 2014","true","48.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Although the tutorial will have you stumble along as you blindly try to remember what each and every little system and sub-system does, once you get started the game becomes really easy to learn.\n\nThat is, until you really start getting into it.\n\nAlthough at first you may be finding yourself dominating any ship that comes in your path, because of your beautiful, marvelous, non-AI brain, you'll be quickly fighting ships that, if exercise is not cautioned, will ♥♥♥♥ you up. Easy mode is probably what I'd start on first, since normal might as well be called "No-forgiveness mode".\n\nDespite the difficulty itself, the events and scenarios that the game will throw at you are varied and hard to avoid. Sometimes you'll have to fly through Nebulas where you're sensors will be effected, thus not allowing you to monitor your whole ship (or the enemies), you may think "How is it a big deal if I can't see inside some parts of my ship?" Well, smart guy/girl, if the opposing ship hits your ship, and causes a fire, you won't know where it is unless if you have a crew member in the room where the fire started, -OR- the opposing ship could beam its crew onto your ship, and they can go march about within your ship, tearing it apart from the inside and out, all while you fight an enemy spaceship.\n\nSpeaking of crew, you start out with three crew members, and can get more at any point in the game. They can man various systems to improve their performance, put out fires, fix broken/destroyed systems, and, with a teleporter, can be beamed on the enemy ship to wreck havoc.\n\nI could go on about how great this game is, but in short: Go and buy it.","December 27, 2013","true","23.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

Star Trek game. The game draws inspiration from this franchise but is not a rip-off at all. It has enough style and lore by itself. I'll be brief: graphics are good, music is too (love how themes change when you enter battle mode - it's the same theme only more tense), story is made up by you - a rouge-like experience where no game session is similar. BUT! One word:  gameplay . It is so damn deep and addictive! I loose several hours in a row in it though I don't usually play a video game too long in one session. Battle system is especially awesome. It's of a sheer joy to participate in tactical exchange between two starships: you control systems and subsystems, fix damaged ones, choose the right time to fire different weapons, harass the enemy with combat drones... It feels like gold to break enemy's shields and then cut their hull with laser! FTL got different unique races, augmentations, unlockable ships...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/recommended/212680/","Mittsies","Mittsies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/","72 products in account","Completing a game of FTL is a satisfying victory I feel every self-respecting person should experience at least once. I thought that after I had beat the game one time, I would be done with it and move on to something else. That was not the case. I had continued to play the game over and over, trying to beat it with every ship and I had found myself even re-using ships I'd already beaten the game with. Simply put, the game has great replay-value.\n\nAfter 100 hours of playing this game, FTL had become one of my all time favorite games. Some compare its gameplay to that of a rougelike, due to an incidental and randomized journey through space and of course: perma-death. However I'd say the game is too unique to be classified under any one genre, but it's definitely an exciting game of strategy and survival.\n\nThe game can be played at your own pace due to being able to pause and queue up commands at your own leisure, or it can be played as a brutally-challenging action-game that requires quick decisions. Even if you play the game slowly, it's still very difficult. The dastardly nature of the game makes it feel like all odds are against you and the only way to win is through sheer luck, but that is in fact not the case, as an experienced FTL player can beat the game (destroying the Flagship) consistently as long as they are careful and make the right choices. I've even wrote a detailed guide explaining this further.\n\nAlthough the game play is simple in concept, you'll notice it is fairly in-depth. You command a cruiser with up to 8 people on board, ranging from humans to alien bugs to rockmen -- each with their own unique traits and stats; i.e. Rockmen are slow, hard to kill and immune to fire while Humans' unique trait is being "boring". When you encounter an enemy cruiser, you must destroy their ship, flee or, when given the opportunity: negotiate. You have an arsenal of offensive options at your disposal such as weapons, drones, or boarding-crew. Additionally you have an entire ship of units to individually control in order to man certain parts of the ship (such as Pilot or Weapons room), repair broken systems, extinguish fires or fight off invaders.\n\nAt it's simplest level, you're basically just shooting a laser at the enemy's ship until he blows up. At it's most complex level... you're actively using your Cloaking system to dodge enemy missiles, teleporting your crew onto the enemy ship to kill their pilot and disable their shield systems, carefully micromanaging your boarders so they don't die, lining up a salvo of lasers and beam weapons so they hit the enemy ship in rapid succession for maximum effectiveness, moving your engineer to repair one of your systems while you micromanage the blast-doors on your ship to extinguish fires and stop enemy boarders from approaching your weapons room. FTL's game play has a lot of depth and variety.\n\nAnd finally, the aesthetics. The visuals are simple and beautiful, it's got this sort of retro feel to it and everything is crisp and well-designed. The soundtrack is incredible, too, and even after 100 hours I still find myself nodding my head to the music and enjoying the overall atmospheric feel of the soundtrack.\n\nSo to summarize: the game is amazing, challenging, has a lot of replay value, great aesthetics, and is definitely worth the $10.\n\nRating: A+","March 29, 2014","true","199.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

No seriously, this game rocks asteroids. Adventure, micro-management, combat, strategy, everything is as polished as a Naboo Starfighter. There is a real sense of progression and achievement as you conquer increasingly difficult galaxies while building up the strength of your ship and crew. Combat is smart and relies not only on your current build but also on your ability to adapt your tactics to the current situation. FTL being a rogue-like there is also a bit of luck involved, but I didn't find that frustrating as randomness in FTL creates a sense of tension and helplessness that adds a lot to the atmosphere. All in all, FTL is a great game that's easy to understand but challenging to master and you'll enjoy every last bit of it, slugs, zoltans and all!","December 21, 2013","true","97.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kylewastaken/recommended/212680/","kylewastaken","kyle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kylewastaken/","128 products in account","FTL: Faster than Light is a modern first person shooter set in the pre-historic era. Players team up with familiar faces such as Yoda from Cooking Mama: Hitler's Revenge, Dark Magician Girl from The Eldar Scrools: Minecraft, Kobe Bryant from Sleep Simulator 1966 and Cicero from Octodad: Ninja Warrior to battle against the evil forces of the Australian Government.\n\nThe main protagonist, Scratch Cat (Voiced by Dwayne Cena), leads his team of up to 7 cultists through Customs and Border Security as they try to free the Jewish slaves from the clutches of the Pharaoh with the help of Mike Tyson and the Duke of Deception whilst saving Christmas and trying to find Wally. The varying enemy types really brighten the song up as they provide the driver with new challenges at each turn. Personally, my favorite boss battle is the very first one against The Dynamic Duo; Sir. Lynch III and Dr. Breen where players are forced to endure being called an embarrassment for a whole month.\n\nA few negatives that I have about the game are that there aren't a lot of choices on the menu and the water is too cold. These may be only minor things that may only affect some people but I feel that it is important that I identify these things.\n\nSomething that I feel I should point out to anyone interested in this recipe is that the PvP aspect of the game can be very challenging and confusing to newcomers of the country. Though being a FPS, the LoL PvP suddenly changes the game into an open world MMORPG where monkeys rule the earth. This sudden change has been reported to give trees cancer and thus, caution should be taken when accessing the PvP feature under the sea.\n\nAll in all, Fire Emblem: Awakening is a really well developed game with a passionate dev team. The car has great performance, gameplay, visuals and add a dash of salt to seal the deal. I really enjoyed my first lap and I feel as if many other would too. I give Watch Doge: New Vegas a score of 32.33 uh, repeating of course chicken nuggers out of 10.","March 3, 2014","true","46.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There is a huge amount, I would even go as far as saying an equal amount of strategy to this game as there is luck. From what you buy, to if you decide to buy anything at all and instead choose to upgrade your ship giving it that extra fire power or hiding behind your many layers of shields. There are so many different ways of playing this game and a large amount of content if you bother to use it. You are able to unlock new ships and new set ups from completing runs and unlocking achievements along the way giving you an insentive to beat the unbeatable. This game is for the people who are prepared to get frustrated, pull out their hair, quit the game and then come back to it the next day with a fresh mindset and with the hunger to get further each time, learning more and more with every click of the start button. I have heard many times that the game is unfair and too one sided, let me just say "You is mad, cus You is bad".\n\nI think its more than fair to say a large proportion of the game will come down to luck and finding either exactly what you need at a shop/encounter or you finding useless items not worth the jump taken to get there. For me this adds to the challenge and gives the game more depth, without it there would be less need for exploration of a star system and a lack of increasing intensity that you might not find a shop before you run out of fuel or needed items. If you were able to jump to a shop and have the full range of items from the game to choose from then this game would be a breeze. If you land at a shop and find the useless crap we all dread to stumble upon after jumping strategicly to the only shop visible then move on! Discover another shop. There are multiple shops per star system it just takes planning and insightful purchases to easily discover most of the map before moving on. However this game is not all based on random blind luck and any one that tells you so well...... I question their inteligence and so should you. This game has been built for replayability and the challenge that comes with it. Of course if you decide to send you crew down to a planet to help survivors there is a good chance they will not come back..... so dont!. If you rescue a crazy man from a pod or planet DONT take him on board. "If you avoid risky encounters then you survive risky encounters". That is a phrase that should be forced upon people when they start up the game.\n\nAs for the lack of content....... well I have to say that I haven't encountered this as a problem. I understand the feeling of getting to the final boss with an almost perfect ship, defeating him and not being able to help but want to carry on. Surely this in its self proves that the game has been entertaining though. In my eyes if I come to the end of a movie and I am left wanting more then surely that movie was a success and made me feel exactly how it should have. Going back to pure content, I have played this game and have gone through so many runs of it. Obviously I have my favourite set up that I tend to repeat and replicate from time to time to beat the boss or at least see if I can get that far, but there are so many different ways you can play the game. There are so many different set ups to choose from and the thing is.... its all up to you. There was FREE DLC content that added even more if you thought there wasnt enough in the game, but beware it makes it more of a challenge.\n\np.s.

From manning the ship systems with your crew to weapons, shields, drones and ship's energy power distribution. During combats you can also pause the game any moment, thinking and planning your moves ahead which comes handy in most of the chaotic situations.\n\nDestroying enemy ships provides you with gear and scrap for which you can buy better stuff in Stores scattered over the space. Not only by simply destroying enemy ships you get victorious, you can also either disable their life support systems or send in the Assault team both resulting in killing the enemy crew, giving you much more rewards.\n\nGetting through the game makes you unlock more new ships or their new weapon/system/crew layouts after successfully completing achievements with each of them. Can you save yourself while getting through the space with Rebel fleet chasing your tail making you not to stop for long in each sector?\n\nPersonally I am not much of a fan of Rogue like games but this one can be hard, fun and still mannageable at once.\n\nTL;DR -> 8,5/10, Would buy again.","December 2, 2013","true","33.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The combat is gripping, the constant threat of an oncoming fleet of rebels keeps you moving, and the amazing scenarios make you want not. This fantastic game although great has its limitations and may not be for everyone. FTL is a hard game, even on the easiest difficulty it is no cakewalk. Advanced Edition Content adds new items to the game adding more complexity and difficulty to an already hard enough situation.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game plays rather smoothly. Each “jump” you do acts as a turn and allows for the rebel fleet to progress further through a sector of the galaxy. If you and the rebel fleet cross paths you enter a battle, which if you play your cards right you can escape or even win. There is a steep learners curve, but once you’ve figured out the general game mechanics FTL plays rather easily. You have the ability to pause the game during any battle in order to maneuver troops and properly decide how to place your shots. The game asks you scenarios and the result of them are entirely dumb luck, so be prepared to take chances. For example you may end up trying to communicate with an alien race and get great rewards or an equal possibility is that crew member may die. The battles can be very intense and there can be situations where you are perfectly equip and the luck of where an asteroid lands can completely change a guaranteed victory into a struggling brawl.\n\nDifficulty:\nThis game has a lot of luck involved, so about half of the difficulty in this game is the luck and not the skill. Although this may seem to make the game look bad, it offers variability that many games do not.

You and your crew jumps from Beacon to Beacon, from sector to sector, until you reach the 8th - and last sector, where you fight the rebel Flagship.\n\nThe game plays well, with there being many different options to suit your playstyle. There are atleast 6 species of the Galaxy that can join your crew, ranging from Mantis Insectoids to Crystal men. There are many upgrades that allow you to improve you ships firepower and overall stats - some of which are upgrades for how much power your Reactor and sytems take in and can hold.\n\nFTL can be very unforgiving, however it is relatively fair in how it throws you into situations. Many times it's a product of your own doing. Except for the Space Spiders. Never trust the space spiders.\n\nCombat consists of your crew powering up the weapons systems and then targeting parts of the enemy ship. It is very satisfying and is executed excellently. It is fun to play and very strategic (hint: press Spacebar to pause, you'll need it) whilst being easy to access for new players. Hitting systems can cause a variety of things that will turn the odds in your favour. The enemies can also do these things to you too, so it can screw you over too.\n\nThere are sometimes options for you to let your enemies live, in exchange for goods. You can choose to take this offer and show mercy, or kill them. These are "events" and happen throughout the game. Events help you to gather scrap and get special upgrades and ships. These were rather well done and are very high quality, with a huge amount of variety between them.\n\nI think this is a must have. FTL is very satisfying, with a huge a amount of replayability. There is a vast amount of content, and there is even more to come with FTL: Advanced Edition which is free to any Faster Than Light owner.","January 27, 2014","true","79.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brojoejoe/recommended/212680/","brojoejoe","Underdog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brojoejoe/","76 products in account","FTL (Personally known by me as, 'For The Loss') is a fantastic, yet brutal spaceship management simulator kind of game.\nNow, let me get this out of the way first:\n\nDo NOT let the graphics or any gameplay videos you may have watched put you off or mislead you.\n\nIt may seem boring, but I assure you, it is anything but boring! I would definitely put it up there with all of the most intense and nail-biting anxiety kind of games out there. Things will go wrong, and it will go, REALLY wrong. I won't spoil some of the awesome, random text based adventure type events you can get thrown into - many which require interesting decisions that could be risky or extremely rewarding. But I will tell you this: AVOID ALL GIANT ALIEN SPIDERS AT ALL COSTS.\n\nAnother aspect I like about the game is that it forces you to make many morally questioning decisions - and not have the added consequence of facing penalties or filling some kind of renegade-like bar. You could show mercy on a surrendering pirate for a bribe, or just blow it to smitherines and scrounge the extra scrap from their ship. That being a very basic example of what FTL has to offer. The galaxy is in chaos, and there won't be a Jiminy Cricket on your shoulders or any form of Devil's Advocate telling you what to do.\n\nWhile the game can be brutal at times, I love how most of the time, every time you fail and your ship explodes, it is due to you being that little bit extra over-confident. By not visiting every star system possible, by running out of fuel, by not having a good variety of crew member races or even just not upgrading your shields enough etc. Whilst some deaths may be a little unfair (with the rare events of random spawns of four enemy mantises instantly aboard your ship), most are justified.  You will fail a lot; it's taken me around 30 hours to fully complete one game on just EASY difficulty. A full game should only take around 2 hours to complete in the first place. I still must attempt to complete the game on Medium and Hard difficulty, unlock all the other ships in the game, unlock all the achievements, and even try out the recently added Advanced Edition with tons of new content. Unlike some short indie games, FTL has tons of replayability value, while still holding it's unique charm and memorable moments.\n\nNow, I don't think I can be bothered talking about everything, as this review is already dragging on, and I'd like you to find out many of the other surprises yourself if you get the game. But I'll just talk about the sound design now, which in my opinion, is AWESOME.\n\nThere's something strangely satisfying about charging up your lasers, and unleashing hell on a hostile ship. The pew pews could not be better, or any more visually satisfying, unless it was perhaps given a blockbuster budget and directed by Michael Bay, I suppose. The music can also really immerse you into the game, especially in the moments of exploring the systems peacefully, with some really catchy songs thrown in there. I've heard some complaints about the combat music being a bit bland, but I personally quite liked that too. Overall, Kudos soundtrack guy! :D (Ben Prunty).\n\nTL:DR: If you love Star Wars/Star Trex/Firefly/Cowboy Bebop/Any space sci-fi series, and always wanted to experience the kind of hardships of running a spaceship and crew successfully through the galaxy. Buy this game.\n\nIf you enjoy challenging games, which the industry has a huge lack of these days. Buy this game.\n\nIf this game happens to be on sale. BUY THIS GAME.\n\nI'd give it a solid 9.5/10. :)","June 21, 2014","true","49.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, I have not gotten bored with this one yet. There are so many ships to unlock, achievements to be gotten, and best of all, the game changes each time you play. Many people say this game relies on luck, and it does, but I like that. It means that there is no strategy that is guaranteed to work each time, which makes it harder, but a lot more fun. This is not a game you play twice and win. You can play hundreds of times and might still not win, but it's not the winning that's fun. It's finding that perfect weapon for your build, that teleporter just when you need it, unlocking a new ship. I could go on and on. This is a very hard game, and it's very unforgiving, but winning isn't what makes this game fun.

All this, while being chased by the Rebel force, nice setup.\n\nFaster Than Light relies heavily in random generated encounters since every time you warp to a location, you have hundreds of possible encounters with multiple outcomes, however this outcomes are sometime random as well, since the answer you gave on one playthrough might not have the same outcome on the next one. Often enough you'll feel the game cheated on you and that the result wasn't fair, however this also makes the game alive and filled with high risk high reward situations.\n\nThe combat system is pretty straight forward, when your weapons are loaded you can fire, when your enemy has their weapons loaded they can fire back, however you can assign crew members to certain stations, for example to the shield station which will make the shields recharge faster or to the engine station that will help you dodge incoming fire. Even though encounters are important you also have to make decisions inside your ship by choosing your crew members which unlock special encounters solutions but also come with their pros and cons. You'll have a whole bunch to choose from the Humans, the Engi, the Mantis, the Rockmen, the Zoltan, the Slugs, The Crystal and finally the Lanius.\n\nThe art of this game really stands out mainly the soundtrack that is masterfully done setting the perfect atmosphere for a game that leaves you on the edge of your chair, you'll know what I'm talking about once everythings starts going wrong and your entire ship is set ablaze or when you find yourself drifting  in space with no fuel, waiting for friend or foe to approach you with a helping hand or a loaded cannon.\n\nHowever not everythings perfect, even though the game is filled with Quests and Encounters they somewhat lose their essence after some playthroughs when you start seeing them repeat too often with outcomes that you are now aware and can predict most of the time. Also the difficulty even on the easiest setting might be too hard for the casual gamers, which might put some people off the game after some tries.\n\n\n+ Diferent Strategies and Aproaches\n+ Great Variety of Items and Races\n+ Amazing Soundtrack\n\n- Encounters get repetitive after a while\n\n88% Cool Game!\n\nJoin my Steam Group page for more reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/jereviews","April 11","true","30.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Let me get this off my chest right off the bat: This game is going to kick your ♥♥♥. Even on it's "Easy" mode, it took me multiple runs through the game before I even made it to the last sector. It took me countless more runs to finally defeat the boss, and let me tell you, the first time you defeat the enemy flagship it is immensely gratifying.\n\nEverything about this game is fun. The combat mechanics and how you manage your ship is very clever, and you have to be constantly vigilant in a fight, lest your enemy get in that fatal hit on you. In a lot of the text-based encounters, there's a risk-vs-reward factor, where going in and say, investigating an abandoned space station might net you some extra scrap metal, but you might also lose your best Pilot in the process. The variety in ships you use and of those you can encounter is aplenty, and any number of different playstyles can be used with varying degrees of success.\n\nThe little things about it are great too: there's just enough background information to hold the plot together, while also leaving lots to your imagination. The graphic style is quite charming, and every note of the soundtrack works perfectly in tandem with what's going on in the game.\n\nAll in all, a great little indie title, for a very reasonable price. 9/10","February 19, 2014","true","36.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I will update/finish it when I find the time.\n\nThis is currently my favorite offline game. Anytime my usual addictions are unavailable, I always head straight for FTL and tackle another playthrough. This game is easily worth the $10 USD price tag, if not more. The recent expansion pack only adds to this value, and I almost feel guilty for not paying for so much content. It could have easily been a $5 DLC.\n\nFTL is a roguelite space simulation game developed by Subset Games. It features perma-death, realtime strategy with the ability to pause and give orders, randomized level design, and nearly endless replay value.\n\nStarting off with the tutorial, you'll get a quick briefing of the plot and objective, followed by a rundown of the UI. After jumping to the next location, you'll find your first battle which offers some helpful tips like using missiles to take out enemy shield systems. After combat, upgrade your ships reactor and weapon system and you're all set. The whole tutorial takes about 5 minutes. If you can't be bothered with 5 minutes, skip it. You can mouse-over just about everything for detailed tooltips at any point in the game.\n\nMy biggest, and only notable, gripe with this game is that it doesn't support Steam Achievements. I find this very odd since it has it's own in-game achievements not recognized by Steam.","April 27, 2014","true","155.7"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","4"

Not to everyone.  Is it bad?  Hell no.  This game is remarkably polished in a number of aspects.  The problem is, the game isn't very fun.  At least not in the long run.  When you start off, you will be full of wonder, piloting your starship into unknown realms, trying to save the your allies from the rebels!  Then you'll die, lose everything and have to start over again.  This pattern will repeat for about 20 times before you become super frustrated and give up on the game.\n\nLet me reiterate...FTL is not a bad game.  It is damn good.  However, it fails in one crucial way.  It does not give you a feeling of incremental progress.  Some may like the challenge that that brings, but for a rogue-like to be worth your time these days, with so many other rogue-likes out there, it needs to make your time meaningful.  FTL is a time waster...it will kill you over and over again and it will be due to randomness, not to any fault of your own.  And seldom ever will the game change or improve.  Of the over 10 ships to unlock, I got...four.  After many failed attempts.  By accident.  Each death was just as frustratingly stupid and unavoidable as the last.\n\nIf you like that, fine, have at it, the game's mechanics are solid, but...FTL just wastes my time.  And I cannot recommend it on those merits alone.","February 20, 2014","false","22.0"," 396 of 765 people (52%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","52","396","765","6","62"

With an aura of adventure and strategy so other games cannot have, this is one of my favorite games. The game's balancing is excellent. The unlockable ships are not more powerful than the starter ship; it all depends on skill and play strategies. This game can weed out the unfit by having them rage quit because of the game's difficulty, but those who are in that crowd-myself included- can enter the Easy Mode which is less of a challenge. The permadeath experience causes you to mourn a crewmember's loss in two ways more than most games; Not only do you care about them, like in most games, but you also rebuke yourself for your foolishness if it is your fault and begin freaking out a bit when your ship starts failing. And the fealing of panic is spot-on. If there's a hull breach, then another, then six fires, you start panicking. This leads me to the excellent feature of the pause button. You can plan your attacks, repairs, and defenses. For those players who want more of a hardcore experience, you can test your skills without a pause button. The risks of death in random events are high, making you want to take part in less; this is a good feature as well. The overall experience of the game makes this incredible. The satisfaction of unlocking a new ship is incredible. The difficulty of a fire or a hull breach in your ship makes the experience even better. The difficulty and yet rewards in boarding parties is amazing as well. Everything in this game can be decided by a single variable in anything. If you have enemy boarders on your Engi ship, you're a bit screwed, but if the enemy has Human crew and you attack them with the Mantis, there is a lot less struggle. This game... Is incredible.","December 4, 2013","true","84.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With an aura of adventure and strategy so other games cannot have, this is one of my favorite games. The game's balancing is excellent. The unlockable ships are not more powerful than the starter ship; it all depends on skill and play strategies. This game can weed out the unfit by having them rage quit because of the game's difficulty, but those who are in that crowd-myself included- can enter the Easy Mode which is less of a challenge. The permadeath experience causes you to mourn a crewmember's loss in two ways more than most games; Not only do you care about them, like in most games, but you also rebuke yourself for your foolishness if it is your fault and begin freaking out a bit when your ship starts failing. And the fealing of panic is spot-on. If there's a hull breach, then another, then six fires, you start panicking. This leads me to the excellent feature of the pause button. You can plan your attacks, repairs, and defenses. For those players who want more of a hardcore experience, you can test your skills without a pause button. The risks of death in random events are high, making you want to take part in less; this is a good feature as well. The overall experience of the game makes this incredible. The satisfaction of unlocking a new ship is incredible. The difficulty of a fire or a hull breach in your ship makes the experience even better. The difficulty and yet rewards in boarding parties is amazing as well. Everything in this game can be decided by a single variable in anything. If you have enemy boarders on your Engi ship, you're a bit screwed, but if the enemy has Human crew and you attack them with the Mantis, there is a lot less struggle. This game... Is incredible.","December 4, 2013","true","84.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The "easy" difficulty is still practically impossible for me after 20 hours.

Combining 18 different ships (9 ships, but a second layout), randomally generated sectors and stores, along with tons of events which change every time you play plus augments (some exclusive to certain ships). It allows you to name your crew and ship....but don't...you'll get connected to them, then they'll be dismembered. The ships you fight can be defeated in a turn or can cleave your ship in half. The game forces you to think 'Do I need these shields upgraded' or 'Should I vent the broken oxygen supply when my ship's on fire along with several rooms and the Oxygen system and risk my crew'.\n\nThe music is amazing and over-all, I recommend buying FTL.\n\nMusic - 8/10.

You start with a ship, some crew members and a mission, get to sector 8 and defeat the Rebels.  While it's graphics and mechanics are deceptively simple, there is a lot of subtle depth to the game.\n\nYou will die alot (like any good roguelike).  Luck certainly plays a role in your play through and you can't always count on a specific strategy.   Sometimes you'll just have to work with what is dealt to you.  There will be moments of complete rage and elation.\n\nAll in all, I have probably logged more hours into this game than most.  I've beat it on normal numerous times now.  But I still feel the urge to fire it up and roll the dice one more time.\n\nEDIT:\nThe free Advanced Edition expansion just made the game even more awesome with even more strategies and toys available now.","October 11, 2012","true","202.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omyyer/recommended/212680/","omyyer","Dat Boiler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omyyer/","246 products in account","It's not often that a strategy game takes my interest, but when this turned up in a Humble Bundle (which I bought because of Bastion, Limbo and FEZ) it blew my mind away. I had heard of FTL of course and had seen it in the Steam Store, but it never received a second glance from me because the main image for FTL looks so boring! Just look at it for a second; about twenty orange ships moving lazily across a planet. There's no sign of speed or that they're going Faster Than Light, and it gives nothing away about what the game is all about.\n\nMaybe that's a good thing, because the game is bloody brilliant! You are the controller of a nameable vessel and you have information about the rebel fleet that is rapidly persuing you. Your ship has to travel through each area, making special Faster Than Light jumps between special beacon nodes. When you arrive at a beacon an event will take place, such as a battle, a trade or negotiations, where you choose wheather you will attack the ship, try to hide or even bring an alien crewmember on board. During a battle there's lots to do, which means a lot of work around the ship for your crewmembers (also nameable, although you'll probably get sad when one you named after your friend snuffs it). There are shields, weapons, drones, medbays and a reactor to power them all.\n\nThe soundtrack is lovely, as with a lot of indie games. When you enter a battle, the music for the current galaxy gets more intense, and will have you whistling all day long.\n\nThe great thing about the gameplay is that it can be paused at any time, even in the middle of a battle, so you can plan your next move. This is a great little aspect of the game, because it makes you feel like everything's happening at once and you have to choose your compromise, because this game is HARD. There are times when you feel like a pro and times when you wish you hadn't provoked the enemy, or wish that you hadn't destroyed a ship while your crew were still on board. A standard game of FTL: Faster Than Light can take about an hour and a half, and no two plays are the same.

Managing your available crew and resources such as fuel and scrap is an important gameplay element. Plan ahead so that you can make it to the next repair-station and re-stock on fuel, but at the same time taking the gamble to buy a powerful weapon or upgrading your ship might be more beneficial in the end, if you get that far that is.\nThe game is very difficult, and at first it will feel as if the games randomness screws you over repeatedly, but learn from your mistakes, and defating the final boss is a very rewarding experience.\nThere are multiple ways to bypass your enemies, some are strictly combat oriented while others are event based and you get a choice whether to attack or not. Combat is also fairly diverse with many different types of weapons systems such as lasers, drones or why not just straight up board the enemy ship, which earns you more resources and possibly crewmembers as well.\n\nMultiple ships and crewmembers that all come with special abilities gives this game alot of replayability, though most of the ships have to be earned by finishing certain encounters that rely on alot of things happening in a certain order.\n\nThe soundtrack is diverse and it is nice how the music seamlessly switches from a calmer exploration to the more agressive combat music as you engage enemy ships.\n\nThe graphics style is also really nice, with a spirite based style of graphics that is very pleasing to look at.\n\nAll in all FTL is a nice experience, though you will probably be frustrated with it a few times as you get no repair stations and slowly die with that awesome weapon you found early.","November 25, 2013","true","27.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/recommended/212680/","wrath-","Wrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/","145 products in account","This is one of the most unexpectedly wonderful games that I’ve encountered recently. It’s a rogue-like starship with a basic objective: destroy the rebel flagship and pick up as many supplies and resources on your way there as you can to help you do it.\n\nThe most wonderful part of this game is that you can control all of the nifty little features that a typical space ship game should have that never does. Example: There is a fire in your weapons room. You can order your crew out of the weapons room and into another one and then use the individual door controls to vent atmosphere out of the weapons room to snuff out the fire, close the doors, repressurize and then it’s business as normal. (same tactic also works for boarding parties). That’s just a tiny little feature, but it’s stuff like that which make it feel like it’s actually your ship and you have a range of options on how to deal with situations you run into. If you want extra power on your shields or engines or weapons or sensors or door controls, you can actually assign your crew there to enhance the system in a pinch or build their skills for significant aids for the big battle.\n\nMissile, beams, burst lasers, hacking, boarding parties, mind control, drones and automated boarding bots, med bays, clone bays, mines, etc. etc. The game has a host of systems and every play is unique, not only based on what your starting ship is, but the things you will encounter and what things you will pick up and the crew you will find. There’s disorienting nebulae, ion pulse suns, solar flares, asteroid fields and more. You can choose where you want to go in order to scavenge supplies and try to delay the rebel fleet. Some strategies may be to your advantage, others may not. It’s up to you and RNGesus.\n\nProbably the biggest thing to note about this game is that it’s short – like really short. It’s not meant to be a 125 hour campaign (hello Crusader Kings II), it’s meant to be an old fashioned evening board game. Consequently, it typically takes only 2-3 hours to do a playthrough, regardless of whether you win or lose. Personally, I think this works to the game’s advantage. Because you do get to remember your crew and what their skills are, the weapons you pick up, and a general attachment to your ship, but not overly so that you cannot stand losing it and won’t ever pick the game up again. You should feel good about how far you came and that you did well even if you lose and look forward to trying a different strategy next time or just rolling the dice again and seeing what you encounter next time. You will most likely get to see the rebel flagship on most playthroughs on most ships, and whether you win or lose at that point is up to your achievements. It’s far more fun just to get there.","October 8, 2015","true","23.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has a huge random aspect to it but normally there is a safe option which comes with experience, or at least some kit which will avert the one crew member or 5 hull point danger. For the first 5 or so runs it's all very frustrating, but I can whole-heartedly say this is balanced out by the enjoyment of it when you pass the learning curve. An easier mode would be beautiful, however. All in all I'd say it's worth the money - there are plenty of guides for how to collect the unlockables, beat the boss and generally how to manage your ship online and in the guides section. Random events are annoying when you haven't encountered them before enough to know all the outcomes, but that's half the fun - will you get 100 scrap or will your beloved Steve be eaten by giant spiders? And just because it'll usually be the latter, but unless you're going hardcore with the Vortex, other crew members will know how to steer the hyperdrive-capable vessel they've wound up in.","March 15, 2014","true","122.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The wide range of weaponry allows for a variety of play styles and can keep speedrunners and explorers alike entertained.\nThe real gem is the games combat system which allows for on the fly tactical decision making that can impact the fate of your ship and her crew, all at the slip of misplaced energy bars.\nThe graphics of the game are charming, and allow for those with lower end computers to enjoy the same fun as people with more expensive rigs. While it may be a turn-off for some, the simplified blocky art style showcases the gritty and fearful nature of the game and what lies beyond the great expanse of space\nProcedural generation makes it so that no 2 adventures are the same, however the same cannot be said about the specific encounters or battles as they will inevitably repeat themselves. This can become annoying over multiple playthroughs, but overall will not detract from the game as a whole.\nIn conclusion, I would reccomend this game to someone who has always wanted to be at the helm of their very own starship, or someone who just needs a casual breakaway from your everyday AAA-cookie cutter title.\n\nRating: 9/10","August 1, 2014","true","49.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

For example: while the Humans are generic (blah, HUmans), the Mantis have a nice bonus on Close Quarters Combat - the ultimate boarders.\n\nDuring the battles, you can choose which room of the enemy ship your weapons should hit. Weapons vary from lasers to different kinds of missiles, bombs, cannons and also drones with different uses (repair, defense, attack, etc).\nLate in the game you can also equip yourself with Teleport and Cloaking modules, enabling you to invade and eliminate the enemy ship's crew using the teleport, and render yourself invisible for a few seconds using the cloak, being invulnerable to enemy targeting.\n\nAnd don't forget about the subsystems: Sensors, Medbay and your Doors!\nLeaving them broken will let your enemy run around freely inside your ship, enabling them do destroy your Oxygen system to suffocate your crew into Permadeath (yes - crew Permadeath and savegame Permadeath)!\n\n9/10, the only thing FTL doesn't provide is a continous-play mode (aka sandbox), but that doesn't affect the amazing piece of gaming art the developers delivered at all.","November 15, 2013","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I would happily have paid $25. ^._.^\n\nThis is a game that lives up to its name - a game that is known for it's challenging and difficult rogue like scenario involving a ship trying to make it to it's destination to save the universe, with you choosing and influencing how you accomplish this goal. It also has quite possibly the greatest soundtrack I have ever had the pleasure of listening to for a game of it's calibre. ^._.^\n\nWith a vast variety of weapons and tactics, as well as endless encounters that for some reason, while limited, never seem to get old, this game is well worth the money. I cannnot reason why it may appeal to some like me more than others, but I must say, should you ever be unsure, wait for the game to go on sale at either a steam summer or winter sale and give it a go. You will not be dissapointed.\n\nAn amazing game, very underated and I only wish I could express properly just why I think it's so great. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game! Give it a go!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EasyUltra/recommended/212680/","EasyUltra","Ultra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EasyUltra/","39 products in account","Let me just start this review by saying that you can't go wrong with an indie game like this one.\n\nGraphics\nEvery single one of these elements will not be altered by mods, I'll leave that for my mods segemnt towards the end of this review. The graphics of FTL are simple yet extravagent, the game itself is simple, the UI is easy to understand and learn, and the different backgrounds/planets and stars all have their unique characteristics and look absolutely lovely. This game is simplistic, so I can't really take points off of it for having simple textures, it's meant to be that way.\n\nGameplay\nOkay so first off this is a difficult lil game to learn in it's own respects, you have to master the art of pressing the spacebar (pause) before and after every show you take, and every shot your opponent takes. If you don't, well you'll end up losing crew members (which some crew members could take the entire length of the adventure to level up, and a loss like that is devestating to your progress). The best tip I can give you is to prepare to press the number keys (for your weapon systems) and the spacebar (for pausing the game) quite often as that will help you plan your strategy of attack a lot easier than not doing so in the first place. Obviously, I didn't pay attention to the tips or numbers above every panel in the game so it took me a while to realize I could use hotkeys, which made the game a lot more difficult than it should've been for me when first starting to play.\n\nStory\nThis game doesn't have much of a story, you're the captain of your own warship that gets sent on a mission to find a stronghold. Along the way you encounter ships and planets/asteroid fielde and even colonies that try to brutally murder you and your crew within mere seconds of jumping into orbit. Your objective is to get to the end, with a powerful crew, upgraded subsystems and the weaponry to destroy the final boss (which is really, really difficult if you're unprepared). Overall it's an adventurious lil game and very, very addicting. You'll be racing to speedrun and beat highscores for hours if you get lucky enough to find good weapons along your journey.\n\nMod Support\nFinally right? This is one of the most amazing parts of FTL as literally every part of this game can be altered through modifications that the developers even asked the community to make. From the story, where you can make finite decisions, endless journies and even completely different campaigns and stories such as Infinite Space. To the graphic overhauls where you get new backgrounds and visual elements from mods like Better Backgrounds and Planets to a mod like Crew Diversity that allows you to have multiple crew members with different visual looks and personalities. Here's the list of all working mods at this very moment, I recommend starting off with Captain's Edition and seeing how you like it from there, as the base game was stupendous but the mods make it into a gem of an adventure. http://store.steampowered.com Go there for more information along with every mod your heart could desire.\n\nSummary\nSo in total, I've spent countless hours on this game and on experiencing the diffrent ways of playing through it, although the Infinite Space mod has no real ending other than you either becoming so overpowered that you literally cannot die, or you dying within your first two sectors, it's still lovely. I'd recommend that you buy this game because it's an adventure, it's a simple pleasure and it's enjoyable yet addictive. For a cheap pricetag, I managed to snag it for $2 through a steam sale a few years back. Obviously worth it, since I put so many hours into it and so much time into this review. Go buy it, it's worth it. Overall, a solid 9/10 from my perspective, if you were able to learn the UI elements more simply (before the tutorial was introduced, because that's when I started playing. Yes, all the way back in 2013, I believe) and able to learn how to maneuver through combat, then I'd give it a perfect 10/10.","February 5, 2014","true","106.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So now their FTL is delayed, and the cockpit is on fire, and the mantis that was piloting the ship is trying his darnedest to put out the fire that's slowly killing him (but you know that giant space mantis has a hard time holding a fire extinguisher, so he'll die before the fire goes out). So the guy at weapons control heads to the cockpit to help, but since he's a rock dude he takes 15 years to get there. And while he's on his way, the mantis has had to leave before being cooked, heading to the med bay.\n\nSo now the fire is spreading, entirely engulfing the cockpit and the hallway outside of it. The mantis, upon reaching the med bay, is surprised to find that it's not working because power has been routed from it to supply the weapons systems. So they reroute power to the med bay, taking it from the O2 supply. But don't worry, they'll bring that back up before everyone suffocates, hopefully.\n\nThe rock dude has finally made it to the cockpit and is stomping out the fire, when another missile hits the shield generator and the shields go offline. Right as the shields go down, a halberd beam rips across the ship, hitting mostly empty rooms, but causing the automated warning sirens to alert the crew that hull integrity is down to 50%. Immediately, the remaining crew abandon their posts and rush to the shield room to get them back online. All of a sudden, the internal view screens go dark as the sensors are knocked offline by another missile.\n\nThe crew is panicking now. The rock dude, having finally put out the fire, is starting repairs on the navigational systems (though the crew still wonders how a large humanoid rock man can fix a computer terminal by simply hitting it, but hey, whatever works). Repairs to the shields are around 50%, so they come partially online, stopping the halberd beam. The automated drone, knowing no sympathy (or any emotion for that fact), continues it's relentless assault. Missiles continue to hit the ship, some tearing holes in the hull, others starting more fires. The rock dude makes his final repairs and brings navigation back online. It's only got another minute or so before it resolves the jump trajectory, but the crew isn't sure if they have that long.\n\nAnother explosion and siren sounds, this time signaling hull integrity at 25%. The shields are now fully online, and the mantis is back at the helm. There seems to be a shred of hope after all. The rock dude heads off to the sensor room to figure that mess out. Explosions continue to rock the ship; another missile strike to the shields (bringing them back down), and another halberd beam across the weapons systems. No shields, no weapons, and the only human on the crew is pretty sure that if she sneezes the whole ship will break apart.\n\nThis is when the crew realizes that they never brought the O2 back online. They try to route power to it, but the O2 control was hit by a missile and is offline. And the room is on fire, along with a good portion of the rest of the ship. The crew will never know this though, because the sensors are still offline (the rock dude is sill on his way). No oxygen, an unrelenting missile barrage, and the heat from the out of control fire sap the rest of the hope from the crew. Will they make it?\n\nProbably not. But one thing is certain; they'll try again. And again. And again. Each journey a new adventure, a new story to be told. And maybe they'll get through to the end, to warn their friends in the space empire about the impending doom they all face.\n\nOr maybe they'll have all their doors open when the door control is hit by a missile and all the oxygen rushed into space. That'll happen at least once too.","February 17, 2014","true","173.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's an incredibly satisfying experience, and I get hooked every time I start it up. Expect to lose. A lot. But don't feel bad about it; dying is half the fun in this game! You learn better strategies as you keep playing (and inevitably being blown to bits), and once you finally beat the final boss... you're just on top of the world. I'm not a big fan of games that rely on luck as much as this game does, but this game is too much fun for me to care. ...Or at least justify having to care. It constantly makes you think and it rewards clever thinking.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/212680/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","If there's a kind of game that I can't stand, those are the Rogue-like games. They're, most of the time, luck-based, and you need to brain, skills, and sometimes you don't even need hands to play them. Faster Than Light is one of those exceptions that put the others to shame. While I hate the others, I just can't bring myself to hate FTL, it shines were others fail miserably. Is it perfect, though? No. As usual, I'll start taking the bad stuff out of the way first:\n\nThe biggest problem beyond the others, is that it's still luck-based. Not AS luck-based as the others, I might add, but being lucky is required in a lot of situations. Let me explain: During the game, you can choose what to upgrade or install. That's great, giving the player freedom. What's not cool, is some of those expansions being kind of needed during the final battle, and not having them meaning the difference between a last-minute Game Over, and achieving Victory. One of those being the Cloak. Being invisible and getting insane Evasion for a few seconds is NEEEDED during the Final Battle, but in one of my playthroughs, I ran to shop to shop (were, if they sell Expansions, only 3 will be available), AND I DIDN'T FIND IT, IN NOONE OF THE 13 SHOPS I RAN INTO. YES, I COUNTED THEM, THAT'S HOW MUCH IT ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME OFF. WHY!? BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO BEAT THE GAME! It was a perfect oportunity, had the best Load-out, and only needed the Cloak. Well, f#ck you too, Luck-based gameplay!\n\nThe other main issue here, is the lenght of the game. Yes, you can replay the game a sh#t-load of times and it won't get old that soon, but that doesn't make it easier to understand why they made it so short. You can beat it in an hour, less if you're lucky. But hey, you won't make it there without luck, so expect to start from scratch over, and over, and over.\n\nThe last issue is a minor one, really. Everything is randomly generated, as I said, but because of that, you often end up in hilarious battles that make no sense, and you can beat them by just staring at the screen. An example, would be the Auto-Scout ships with no shields in Asteroid fields. Those ships will only stand a few hits, but without shields, the asteroids will hit it non-stop, and the battle will last arround 5 to 10 seconds. Other times, enemies try to board your ship, even though you're using a Lanius ship, and that there's NO OXYGEN ON YOUR SHIP, so they pretty much instantly choke to death inside in some pathetic attempt of stealing your sh#t.\n\nNow, let's go to the good stuff. The gameplay is extremely well done, and without counting the IA and the Random generator doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crap, you'll have some serious fun being the tactical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you desire to be.\n\nWill you load your ship with missiles and just blow your way out of there? Will you mount it with more and bigger lasers than the Death Star? Will you use robots to do your dirty job while you other more interesting stuff? Will you just board them, kill them, and steal their crap? Or will you just ignore them all and run away? It's up to you, and there's room for strategy to be made, specially with the Expansions you can install. Some of them turn your ship invisible for a few seconds, making it impossible to hit, others let you mind-control one of them for a few seconds and turn it against them, others let you hack their ship's stuff, you get the idea.\n\nAnother big point in favor of the game, is the music. It has been done to perfection. It seriously fits the action, and it also changes really smoothly from ambient music to combat music. The sounds are also okay, but don't expect to hear any voices, since the game is done in a more "Old-school" and "minimalistic" style. There's also A TON of references to films, series and games, related to space or not...But a ton of them are from Star Wars. See if you get them when you see them.\n\nSomething that you should take into account are the mods. This game already has a sh#t-load of mods out there, and some of them seriously make it even better (like the Captain's Edition). I remember one, for example, that lets you keep ongoing forever, making playthroughs last as much as you want them. That's a fine example of  what the game needed, and thanks to the PC Master Race's best asset, the modding comunity, we got that fixed.\n\nI played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game on a DRM Version that a friend handed me over to play for some days, and got it on a sale. Let me tell you, it's worth the 3€ I paid for it, and I'd say it's even worth the full-price release if you're really interested in this kind of games. If you're not that much into it, then just do like me, wait for the good sale, and enjoy it.\n\nJust remember to not f#ck arround with giant spiders.

A proper rougelike, you never know what will happen during a run, and short of a proper ship layout, some luck, and a high level of skill, you probably won't get far often.\nHowever, like any good roguelike, FTL isn't about winning everytime.  Too many games nowadays have no consequence for death.  This is all well and good in some ways, but we need more games like this one to make us genuinely try.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, I couldn't be more satisfied.  A mix of real-time and something like turn-based gameplay (you can pause the action at any time and set up what will happen next) give you the time to react to a situation as you see fit, but how you react and how it is timed is essential.  Will your weapon charge and fire, knocking out theirs before they can fire back; or should you aim instead at their shield room to make certain that your future volleys get through?  Will draining the oxygen from the engine room put out the fire before they are destroyed; or should you risk your men in the blazing room to put it out and keep that engine running?  Is that heavily guarded ship worth it, or should you sneak past?\n\nEnjoy your runs in FTL.  My advice?  Avoid giant spiders.","June 29, 2014","true","80.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Travel across a series of star systems, surviving friendly or deadly encounters along your way, upgrading your equipment and accomplishing various quests. But time runs short as you are pursued by the rebel fleet, and only by making it to the last system quickly enough do you stand any chance of saving the Federation.\n\nPros: This game has plenty of replayability. For each playthrough, you have series of systems to fly through, and in each case a selection of branching paths, making each playthrough different. There is a bunch of accomplishments that unlock alternative ship designs. You can select your crew, depending on your starting ship species, from people you save, make deal for slaves of hire people on space stations, and your crew will get experienced in whatever they are tasked at doing. You have a limited amount of upgrades you can add to your ship, making where you apply these upgrades a critical decision on the type and quantity of equipment you can have and use.\n\nCons: I've said it before, but retro graphics just aren't my thing, and I'll leave it at that. The game doesn't allow you enough time to explore as much as you'd like to, as time is always a factor and you just have so many warp points you can travel to before you're caught up by the enemy fleet. Rooms are all pre-assigned, so you can't chose where to install your systems when you upgrade your ship: there's a pre-determined room in which it goes no matter what your defense strategy in case of boarding may be.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nIf you don't mind the graphics (or even enjoy them) and enjoy a simplified rogue-like challenge, this game may be for you. It's exactly what it's advertising to be, so if the game seems interesting to you, it probably will be.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 16, 2015","true","10.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The gameplay involves you mainly micromanaging your spaceship and crew as you travel through a number of random encounters trying to reach the other side of the map so you can deliver a warning to your rebel headquarters and defeat the final boss.\n\nFTL is a game that relies heavily on it's difficulty, being much shorter than your average rouge-like. You manage a number of fairly limited resources as you slowly improve your ship and crew. You gather fuel, missiles and money and hope for new and better weapons and drones as your crew members gain experience in whatever field they are working.\n\nIt is a well made game and one I'm happily recommending but it's also a game that has some rather annoying limitations.\n\nYour ship has very little customization options which makes repeat playthroughs somewhat dull, an unusual trait for a rouge-like. Choosing a different ship often yields much the same gameplay as even though your starting position changes a little, the only real change longterm is the configuration of the various rooms on your ship.\n\nAnother problem is the relatively short campaign you will begin to take note of once you've learned the basics and only the unforgiving higher difficulty gives it any sort of longevity.\n\nAll in all FTL: Faster Than Light is a nice little game, but it is also a game that needs something more before I'll agree with the underdog hype that seems to be going around everywhere these days. Perhaps strong developer support and a growing modding community will one day make this into the game it could be but as it sits now it is nothing special.","January 15, 2013","true","139.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Faster Than Light is a roguelike game, meaning that if you die, it's truly game over. There's no reloading savegames, checkpoints, anything. You have to start all over again, except for a few things (like new ships or layouts) that you'll unlock during your games.\n\nThe whole game is randomly created so you'll never play the same game twice. There's also a bit of micromanaging. Scrap the 'bit' part, in reality it's pretty important and you'll micromanage your crew in practically every battle. Your crew will have to repair important parts of your ship and setting them up correctly might make them reload your weapons faster, or recharge your shields faster. They'll even have to engage enemies in combat from time to time.\n\nKilled enemies will give you resources to upgrade your ship and buy stuff in shops. Stuff you desperately need in order to advance. In fact, soms of us might never even be able to complete the game, considering the fact that things are entirely random and it's also based on lots of luck. But it will never stop you from quitting the game. It's always fun, no matter what happens to your ship. You'll keep telling yourself; 'just one more game'. And isn't that what a game's supposed to do?\n\nFTL is a great game and anyone who gives it a try will absolutely learn to appreciate it. Maybe not instantly, but after a few games ? Absolutely !\n\n[Rating: 87/100]","March 5, 2013","true","15.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's a good game, that's for sure, and I don't regret buying it. I've only played 7 hours so far, but there's no doubt I'll sink in some more hours so... yeah, it's a good game.\n\nBut it's really not as marvellous and great and perfect as some reviews suggest. For one thing, this game does not have "awesome random events". The game IS one gigantic random event. There's really nothing you can do that you are SURE will bring in positive or negative outcomes. This total lack of control feels refreshing at times, but it's more frustrating than anything else in my opinion. Some randomness is good, but to me, things get old pretty fast when everything works on a dice roll.\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty hard and unforgiving. Good change of pace, considering the amount of titles that get thrown at our face where actions have no consequences. So don't get too attached to your crew... you'll see them die soon enough.\n\nSo... yeah. I like this game. But it's not the game of the century. It got so much praise that I guess I'm just a tad disappointed. Actually, I see it more as a time killer, kind of like Eufloria (yes, I did just compare FTL to Eufloria. Go figure).\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion. Grab it for 2 or 3 bucks on sale and make your own opinion, you probably won't regret it.","January 31, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This strategy game where you control a space-ship that is running away from the Rebel fleet in an attempt to save the galaxy is honestly one of the most difficult rouge-like's that I've ever played. There were so many times when I'd reach the final boss of the game with max health and soon find my ship completely destroyed in mere moments simply because they'd breach my defenses before I could even graze their ship. This unforgiving game only lets you have one life throughout the whole game, and finding that the game runs on the weirdest random number generator doesn't exactly make things a lot easier on the player. The different weapons and ships make this game a hell of a lot more interesting, as you constantly have to make changes to your every move throughout the entire game. One moment, you may be dominating a supply ship to the point where they try to flee; but they can't because you shot down their engines. The next, the exact same thing is happening to you. With the new Advanced Edition, the entire game pretty much was changed and rebalanced (Flak is the most OP weapon. Get as much as you can). This game deserves a 9/10, for it's only problem being that unlocking new ships is too vague for most people to get, and with it's weird random number generator it makes it nearly impossible to determine if "this gameplay will get me a new ship to use".","June 8, 2014","true","46.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fantastic piece of work that almost seamlessly melds roguelike and strategy that's unforgiving in the hands of a novice but nontetheless rewarding and worth replaying constantly. It has the best soundtrack of any indie game I've played thus far, and making it a dynamic soundtrack with idle and battle versions definitely helped that. The writing is also interesting and clever, and definitely making it worth a try for any fan of sci-fi. Advanced Edition, the recent free expansion, expands upon the game's content by at least a third and adds yet another reason to get back at it.\n\nRegardless, I've come to dread the end level. Strategy and luck seem to go out the window in favor of luck alone. Your only real hope at winning is having fully upgraded almost everything, and if you don't have the right weapons and/or equipment you cannot hope to last the three phases of the boss. The boss presents no surprise and beating it becomes pretty formulaic. The Advanced Edition upgrades help mix it up a little and make it just a little less mind-numbing, but it still puts a dent in an otherwise near-perfect title.\n\n9.5/10","May 11, 2014","true","182.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not only is it a game, it's a spaceship simulator. Oxygen levels can fluctuate throughout the fight, and fires can erupt toasting your crew and burning more of the precious oxygen. How will you defeat your enemy? Will you light the oxygen room ablaze and suffocate them? Send boarders over and watch the chaos ensue? EMP their shields, and blow up the weapons? Better yet, how will you respond to that?\n\nWill you send in your shields specialist to put out the fire, but leave your shields down? Will you lock the doors and cut of oxygen and suffocate the enemy? Will you be able to reroute your crew to get the shields back online?\n\nIronically, hilarious failures can be half the fun of the game. Whoops, forgot to close that door. Sorry pilot, didn't mean to suffocate you. Dang, forgot my boarders on the enemy ship!\n\nThe only flaws are the harsh learning curve, and the high difficulty can be offputting for some.

It's a good game, that's for sure, and I don't regret buying it. I've only played 7 hours so far, but there's no doubt I'll sink in some more hours so... yeah, it's a good game.\n\nBut it's really not as marvellous and great and perfect as some reviews suggest. For one thing, this game does not have "awesome random events". The game IS one gigantic random event. There's really nothing you can do that you are SURE will bring in positive or negative outcomes. This total lack of control feels refreshing at times, but it's more frustrating than anything else in my opinion. Some randomness is good, but to me, things get old pretty fast when everything works on a dice roll.\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty hard and unforgiving. Good change of pace, considering the amount of titles that get thrown at our face where actions have no consequences. So don't get too attached to your crew... you'll see them die soon enough.\n\nSo... yeah. I like this game. But it's not the game of the century. It got so much praise that I guess I'm just a tad disappointed. Actually, I see it more as a time killer, kind of like Eufloria (yes, I did just compare FTL to Eufloria. Go figure).\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion.

This strategy game where you control a space-ship that is running away from the Rebel fleet in an attempt to save the galaxy is honestly one of the most difficult rouge-like's that I've ever played. There were so many times when I'd reach the final boss of the game with max health and soon find my ship completely destroyed in mere moments simply because they'd breach my defenses before I could even graze their ship. This unforgiving game only lets you have one life throughout the whole game, and finding that the game runs on the weirdest random number generator doesn't exactly make things a lot easier on the player. The different weapons and ships make this game a hell of a lot more interesting, as you constantly have to make changes to your every move throughout the entire game. One moment, you may be dominating a supply ship to the point where they try to flee; but they can't because you shot down their engines. The next, the exact same thing is happening to you. With the new Advanced Edition, the entire game pretty much was changed and rebalanced (Flak is the most OP weapon. Get as much as you can). This game deserves a 9/10, for it's only problem being that unlocking new ships is too vague for most people to get, and with it's weird random number generator it makes it nearly impossible to determine if "this gameplay will get me a new ship to use".","June 8, 2014","true","46.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Felynes/recommended/212680/","Felynes","Wynter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Felynes/","161 products in account","REVIEW IS OUTDATED SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE ADVANCED EDITION\nMain Menu\nTutorial\nThe game has a short 5-7 minute tutorial that explains the basics of the game. It does not explain everything such as Alien race benefits or ion beams, but it is enough to get you started on the game.\n\nStats\nThe game has a detailed stat screen that lets you know what ships you were piloting when you got your top five scores, as well as what difficulty setting you were playing. Smaller statistics are also shown such as Session records, Crew records, and Records over the course of all games including how many games you played and how many of them were victorious.\n\nAchievements\nAchievements are a part of statistics but I felt it should get its own section since some completionists care more about achievements then overall stats. Achievements are sorted into three different sections; General Progression, Going the distance, and Skill and Equipment feats. General Progression achievements are exactly as the name entails, achievements that you will get over time just by playing the game. Going the distance achievements are the ones you will be fussing over and replaying the games many time with certain restrictions to unlock, such as the "No Redshirts Here" achievements that is unlocked by getting to sector 8 without losing a crew member (Any star Trek fans here?). Skill and Equipment feats are not as difficult as Going the distance achievements, but you will still have to go out of your way to unlock them.\n\nOptions\nThere is a fair amount of video options.You can have your game windowed or in three different fullscrene modes, Borders, Stretch, and Native (The native resolution for the game is 1280x720). Frame limit can be turned on and off although I suspect most people won't need this option since the game will likely not experience frame drops on most computers though this is a nice option to have nonetheless. You can turn dynamic background on or off. Colourblind mode is avaliable. For Audio options you have a sound volume slider and a music volume slider. Gameplay options let you rebind hotkeys if you wish.\n\nGame\nPreGame\nAt the start of the game you are allowed to rename your ship and crew, as well as choose what kind of ship you will pilot and the layout of the ship. You can see what is powered on your ship, what species of crew members you get, what weapons you start with, what drones you control, and the augmentations preset into your ship. After you are happy with the ship you have chosen, its layout, and its name you can choose your difficulty setting and start the game.\n\nDifficulty Settings\nThis game has two difficulty settings. Easy Mode and Normal mode.\nEasy Mode gives you more scrap and generates easier enemies. I would recommend this for a first time playthrough as it will still be a difficult game.\nNormal Mode gives you the scrap you are intended to earn and generates tougher enemies then you would find in easy mode. Choosing Normal mode gives you a 25 percent bonus to your ingame score.\n\nStory\n"The data you carry is vital to the remaining federation fleet. You'll need supplies for the journey, so make sure to explore each sector before moving on to the next. But get to the exit before pursuing Rebel fleet can catch up!" Once you start off your journey you are greeted with a message box telling you exactly that as well as an ingame tip. Thats about it for the story you get from the game. It's really up to you to imagine your own story as you are given up to three different choices in certain random events. You have a basis for a story and are left to your imagination and gameplay for the rest.\n\nGameplay\nThere are three things you actually do in the game. Battle with hostile ships, decide what to do for ingame events, and jump from location to location using your FTL Drive.\n\nGame Map\nyou can choose connecting locations to move from as long as someone is piloting your ship. You cannot travel everywhere however because you have limited fuel that you must find in drops or buy from stores, as well as worry about rebels catching up to you. Rebels get closer to you every time you jump from location to location. So you do not have to worry about them catching up to you due to a really long ship battle. There are Purple Nebula that slow down the rebel fleet thats chasing you when you jump through them. This does not come without cost however as your sensors are faulty and you can come across storms that limit your reactors power. When moving from one sector to the next the path is nto linier and has seperations. it is up to you to plan ahead and decide where to go as their are enemy controlled sectors, civilian sectors, and uncharted sectors (which are full of purple nebula. Civilian sectors have less hostilities, Enemy Sectors are full of hostile ships as the name implies, and uncharted sectors are filled with purple nebula. Purple nebula in uncharted sectors do not give you the benefit of slowing down the rebel fleet as they are prepared for it. but you still have faulty sensors in these nebula.\n\nBattle & Management\nThis is where you will spend most of your time in game. you can see the inside of your ship and its rooms (or the rooms your crew members are in only if you are in a purple Nebula or your sensors are broken). you can see what systems your enemy has nad where they are located. The Health of the Hull and their shields. You can power up your weapons and decide where they will target on the eneimies ship once ready to fire. you must be careful though as you have to constantly worry about the health of your systems and subsystems, Battle enemies that teleported onto your ship, keep your crewmembers at high health, and stop fires from ravaging your ship.\nSystems and Subsystems\nSystems are part of your ship that uses power from your reactor and subsystems provide their own power. your enemy can break these systems and subsystems so they no longer function. All systems and subsystems can be repaired by crew members and some systems even have added benefits if manned by a crewmember. Luckily the game lets you make decisions while paused so you do not have to constantly think in real time.\nThere are five main systems as well aso thers that you will find along the way. O2 is your oxygen supplies, without oxygen your crewmembers die so this system neds to be functioning at all times and taken good care of. Engines Charge the FTL drive and powers your ships evasiveness. If someone mans the Engines the chance of dodging increases. Shields sustain your ships defenses, if you shield system is manned your shields regenerate faster. MedBay systems heal your crewmembers as long as they are inside it. Weapons systems powers your weapons, when manned weapons take less time to charge. The pilot subsystems must be manned to have any use, it is used to evade during combat and jump from place to place. Sensors Enable view of your rooms and info on the enemy ship. Door subsystems let you open and close your doors. This allows you to take out fires by getting rid of oxygen in the room.\nUpgrades you can upgrade your systems subsystems and the amount of power in your reactor by spending scraps. Scraps are also used to buy items in shops so you must decide wisely if it is better to upgrade your ship or save the scraps to buy things such as weapons, augmentations, health, and missles.\nCrew\nYour crew can consist of many different species with different traits. they get better at what systems they man over time.\nWeapons\nThere are three types, Ion, missile, and beam. Missiles. Ion disrupts systems, missile is powerfull but uses bought ammo, and beam does not require ammunition.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack from this game is amazing and gives you a sense of technology and the vastness of space.","January 19, 2014","true","71.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It tries to give a cinimatic feel without using orchestral instruments, and as a result it has a distinct sound. Bonus points are given for utilizing a leitmotief, and even more for making it subtle.\n\nGraphically, there's not much to speak of. FTL has a very retro look, though kinda on the low-end of 16 bit or the high-end of 8 bit. The sprites are large and high-res, but there's no shading to speak of. The backgrounds feel a bit, well, stock, but look nice.\n\nFTL's gameplay is easy to learn but takes a long time to master. You can get the hang of the game very quickly, but the difficulty is notable. It's not the hardest game I've played, but it's definately a challenge.\n\nWhich brings me to why I'm hesitant to recommend this game. Saying the game "isn't the hardest game I've played" is not a very accurate way to judge difficulty, as I've played a few games that were so hard the average gamer would considder it torture (Exceed: Gun Bullet Children comes to mind). This game is definately out to get you (like any Roguelike) and is VERY obvious about it.\n\nStory-wise, FTL is pretty simple and a bit reminicent of one of the underlying plots of Star Wars, just in reverse. You've stolen the plans to the rebel flagship and are running from the rebel fleet. You must bring the plans to the federation HQ and then destroy the rebel flagship. There are a ton of side-quests and events that spice things up, and no playthrough is the same.\n\nOverall, I can say that this game is fun and challenging, and has a great soundtrack. However, the difficulty is definately something to note, and the graphics are only half-decent even for a retro-styled game. I give it a 6.5/10, or a solid 8/10 if you like difficult games. I also give it a recommendation, though be warned - this game is quite a challenge.\n\nRecommended for: Retro gamers who don't care about the quality of their pixels, fans of roguelikes, soundtrack junkies and anyone looking for a challenge.\n\nNot recommended for: "ub3r 1337 gamzorz 111" type players, casuals, graphics junkies or people who hate losing.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Fun, challenging, and a great soundtrack, but half-decent graphics and the shear difficulty level mean that FTL: Faster Than Light is not for everyone.","January 20, 2014","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Felynes/recommended/212680/","Felynes","Wynter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Felynes/","161 products in account","REVIEW IS OUTDATED SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE ADVANCED EDITION\nMain Menu\nTutorial\nThe game has a short 5-7 minute tutorial that explains the basics of the game. It does not explain everything such as Alien race benefits or ion beams, but it is enough to get you started on the game.\n\nStats\nThe game has a detailed stat screen that lets you know what ships you were piloting when you got your top five scores, as well as what difficulty setting you were playing. Smaller statistics are also shown such as Session records, Crew records, and Records over the course of all games including how many games you played and how many of them were victorious.\n\nAchievements\nAchievements are a part of statistics but I felt it should get its own section since some completionists care more about achievements then overall stats. Achievements are sorted into three different sections; General Progression, Going the distance, and Skill and Equipment feats. General Progression achievements are exactly as the name entails, achievements that you will get over time just by playing the game. Going the distance achievements are the ones you will be fussing over and replaying the games many time with certain restrictions to unlock, such as the "No Redshirts Here" achievements that is unlocked by getting to sector 8 without losing a crew member (Any star Trek fans here?). Skill and Equipment feats are not as difficult as Going the distance achievements, but you will still have to go out of your way to unlock them.\n\nOptions\nThere is a fair amount of video options.You can have your game windowed or in three different fullscrene modes, Borders, Stretch, and Native (The native resolution for the game is 1280x720). Frame limit can be turned on and off although I suspect most people won't need this option since the game will likely not experience frame drops on most computers though this is a nice option to have nonetheless. You can turn dynamic background on or off. Colourblind mode is avaliable. For Audio options you have a sound volume slider and a music volume slider. Gameplay options let you rebind hotkeys if you wish.\n\nGame\nPreGame\nAt the start of the game you are allowed to rename your ship and crew, as well as choose what kind of ship you will pilot and the layout of the ship. You can see what is powered on your ship, what species of crew members you get, what weapons you start with, what drones you control, and the augmentations preset into your ship. After you are happy with the ship you have chosen, its layout, and its name you can choose your difficulty setting and start the game.\n\nDifficulty Settings\nThis game has two difficulty settings. Easy Mode and Normal mode.\nEasy Mode gives you more scrap and generates easier enemies. I would recommend this for a first time playthrough as it will still be a difficult game.\nNormal Mode gives you the scrap you are intended to earn and generates tougher enemies then you would find in easy mode. Choosing Normal mode gives you a 25 percent bonus to your ingame score.\n\nStory\n"The data you carry is vital to the remaining federation fleet. You'll need supplies for the journey, so make sure to explore each sector before moving on to the next. But get to the exit before pursuing Rebel fleet can catch up!" Once you start off your journey you are greeted with a message box telling you exactly that as well as an ingame tip. Thats about it for the story you get from the game. It's really up to you to imagine your own story as you are given up to three different choices in certain random events. You have a basis for a story and are left to your imagination and gameplay for the rest.\n\nGameplay\nThere are three things you actually do in the game. Battle with hostile ships, decide what to do for ingame events, and jump from location to location using your FTL Drive.\n\nGame Map\nyou can choose connecting locations to move from as long as someone is piloting your ship. You cannot travel everywhere however because you have limited fuel that you must find in drops or buy from stores, as well as worry about rebels catching up to you. Rebels get closer to you every time you jump from location to location. So you do not have to worry about them catching up to you due to a really long ship battle. There are Purple Nebula that slow down the rebel fleet thats chasing you when you jump through them. This does not come without cost however as your sensors are faulty and you can come across storms that limit your reactors power. When moving from one sector to the next the path is nto linier and has seperations. it is up to you to plan ahead and decide where to go as their are enemy controlled sectors, civilian sectors, and uncharted sectors (which are full of purple nebula. Civilian sectors have less hostilities, Enemy Sectors are full of hostile ships as the name implies, and uncharted sectors are filled with purple nebula. Purple nebula in uncharted sectors do not give you the benefit of slowing down the rebel fleet as they are prepared for it. but you still have faulty sensors in these nebula.\n\nBattle & Management\nThis is where you will spend most of your time in game. you can see the inside of your ship and its rooms (or the rooms your crew members are in only if you are in a purple Nebula or your sensors are broken). you can see what systems your enemy has nad where they are located. The Health of the Hull and their shields. You can power up your weapons and decide where they will target on the eneimies ship once ready to fire. you must be careful though as you have to constantly worry about the health of your systems and subsystems, Battle enemies that teleported onto your ship, keep your crewmembers at high health, and stop fires from ravaging your ship.\nSystems and Subsystems\nSystems are part of your ship that uses power from your reactor and subsystems provide their own power. your enemy can break these systems and subsystems so they no longer function. All systems and subsystems can be repaired by crew members and some systems even have added benefits if manned by a crewmember. Luckily the game lets you make decisions while paused so you do not have to constantly think in real time.\nThere are five main systems as well aso thers that you will find along the way. O2 is your oxygen supplies, without oxygen your crewmembers die so this system neds to be functioning at all times and taken good care of. Engines Charge the FTL drive and powers your ships evasiveness. If someone mans the Engines the chance of dodging increases. Shields sustain your ships defenses, if you shield system is manned your shields regenerate faster. MedBay systems heal your crewmembers as long as they are inside it. Weapons systems powers your weapons, when manned weapons take less time to charge. The pilot subsystems must be manned to have any use, it is used to evade during combat and jump from place to place. Sensors Enable view of your rooms and info on the enemy ship. Door subsystems let you open and close your doors. This allows you to take out fires by getting rid of oxygen in the room.\nUpgrades you can upgrade your systems subsystems and the amount of power in your reactor by spending scraps. Scraps are also used to buy items in shops so you must decide wisely if it is better to upgrade your ship or save the scraps to buy things such as weapons, augmentations, health, and missles.\nCrew\nYour crew can consist of many different species with different traits. they get better at what systems they man over time.\nWeapons\nThere are three types, Ion, missile, and beam. Missiles. Ion disrupts systems, missile is powerfull but uses bought ammo, and beam does not require ammunition.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack from this game is amazing and gives you a sense of technology and the vastness of space.","January 19, 2014","true","71.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your journey is restricted both by your limited fuel and the approaching Rebel fleet, so grinding isn't really an option. Each game should take around a half hour to an hour and a half and there is a nearly endless combination of weapons and modules to experiment with. Everything is controlled by very simple resources and upgrade trees, keeping the learning curve short. All great things which make for a great game. What I couldn't get over, and what drains a good portion of the fun out of this game for me, is just how random a rogue-like. It is nearly impossible to set a goal beyond survival and success. Various weapon combinations might excite you, but there is no guarantee you'll ever get a shot at testing them. The trade off here is, of course, that each playthrough is unique and if that's what you're looking for, FTL is perfect for you. However, if you look to strategy games for intense planning and not the fun a constant wrench in the works makes for, this might not be the game for you.","June 16, 2014","true","31.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Caught it in the Steam sale over Christmas and have to admit I didn't play it straight away. But casually loaded it up last week and have been hooked!\n\nYou start with a crew of 3, with a basic loadout of weapons, fuel and the ability to get some drones to assist you with tasks like ship repairs, intruders, among others. Your mission? KEEP MOVING! The rebels are chasing you from one sector to the next. On your journey you'll be encountering events such as pirates chasing down defenceless ships (do you help them? do you accept a pirate bribe to stay out of it?) and you can sell scrap you collect to upgrade your systems (buy additional crew members to help with unmanned systems, buy fuel, rockets, new weapons...). You'll never have enough scrap to outfit your ship completely so it's very important to make the right decision.\n\nThe "random" element of the game is perhaps its best feature. No 2 games are the same, you can "jump" once and get an additional crew member, or you can jump and find yourself staring at a rebel ship wanting to shoot you to pieces.\n\n...and if you wanted more than something that was replayable, you've got a truly excellent soundtrack to listen to as you play that's atmospheric and draws you in.\n\nBest indie game I've played personally, and I'd definitely get it... whether you want it right now or whether you can wait til the next sale, at least add it to your wishlist, and look it up on YouTube :)","January 31, 2015","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm hooked.\n\nI thought that the fast-paced strategy would be chaotic and difficult to master. I was pleased to find out that you can pause the action at any moment and give orders, and that the mechanics are very simple and easy to understand. That doesn't mean that FTL is an easy game: plenty of choices and their consequences, as well as the random-generation make it quite the opposite. The game is never unfair to the player, giving many opportunities for upgrades and pacing the zones quite well.\n\nCritical thought and planning ahead are as important as combat in FTL; saving some "scrap" (the games spending and upgrading currency) could mean the difference between bribing a hostile pirate or having to engage in combat. Spending your "scrap" on ship upgrades could mean that you run out of fuel later in the game, or it could be the bump that saves your crew's lives.\n\nThe most aesthetically pleasing thing about FTL is the way it can be played with only a mouse. Pausing the action is bound to the middle mouse button, leaving your other hand free to grab a snack, pick your nose, or stratch that itch. More often you'll find yourself chewing on the nails of your free hand, as the action in FTL can get extremely tense in the latter stages.\n\nOverall, I would recommend FTL to anybody who enjoys difficult strategy games. Being a roguelite is also a huge plus for me. The art is great, the music is great, and there is a fairly high replay value with unlocks and achievements.\n\nA+","March 3, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Faster Than Light is simply stunning (especially for being made by two people) and has a great gameplay idea. You play as the entire ship. Not just the captain. You play the role of each crew member, and the ship itself. When your vessel gets hit, it feels like your main character is taking damage. The game has multiple unlockable ships which cause for even more extended gameplay as each ship has it's own advantage as well as a disadvantage.\n\nOne thing this game is lacking in is it's modability. At least, stock modability. With the download of a few programs you're able to mod this game like no other. With mods including completely new ships, gameplay overhauls, improved graphics new enemies and so much more. FTL has a great player base as well. Full of fun, intelligent people. Updates are fairly often, and it's possible to get into the beta updates without much hassle. The game is mostly bug free, with the occasional glitch here and there. Another thing this game is lacking is multiplayer. Though, as of 07/12/13 (mm/dd/yy)  they are planning on adding it somehow..\n\nAnywho, great game.

It's a roguelike space simulator where you control your crew and ship as you race through various solar systems towards the end game. An individual game maybe lasts an hour or two or until you die (can be much sooner), but while winning is the goal, trying out new tactics and combinations of weapons is the fun part of the game.\n\nYou control a few crew members in a ship with various parts. You can assign a crewman to pilot the ship, one to control the ship's shields, and have a third crew rotate between manning the weapons systems and doing ship repairs. When you get into a fight, your ship takes localized damage that interferes with your ship's functions in every way. Thus, combat is a game of maintaining your ship and taking out the enemy as quickly as possible to minimize the mayhem they cause. Sometimes your ship will be boarded and you'll have to determine how to kill the enemy crew who are breaking stuff and attacking your own crew while trying to destroy an enemy ship that is likely still shooting you. The game has a million tactical possibilities every playthrough and is wildly popular.\n\nIt's cheap, and if you've got enough patience to play a game where the journey is the enjoyment, not the ending, you'll probably like FTL.","January 5, 2014","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is not too hard, but at the same time, not too easy. The random events gives different experiences on every journey, some good, and some bad. The game frustrates you at times, but at others it rewards you. The main mechanic that drives the game is the Permadeath feature. No saving the game and reloading it. There is no room for error in FTL, if you are destroyed becuase you didn't purchase better weapons, tough luck. It gives a feeling of individuality. When you are on the final sector of the game, you know this is it. One way or another, you'll never see your ship again, and it makes us feel sad for the poor crew. You have to manuever and plan out as the story progresses, or else you will be destroyed. Would I recommend it? Yes. I think it is one of the best Indie titles out there. With the new expansion, the game feels even more immersive then before. One of the best improvements was added customization, the fact that every journey would be even more different then before.

If you can remain adamant in your will to achieve victory perhaps you'll discover one of the many winning formulas that will lead you to continued success.\n\nThe general flow of the game consists of choosing a weak starship and slowly building your combat ability through weapons, crew, and supporting systems as you flee from a seemingly unstopable foe; all while trying to maintain a balance of key resources like fuel which could mean certain doom if you run out. The game features many event choices that can reward your decisions with new weapons or could cost you the life of your crew, by adding certain facilities to your ship you'll be able to choose from a more expansive list of choices that  can sway the event in your favour.\n\nThe combat consists of two ships (yours and your foes) divided via a split screen, while waiting for your weapons to charge you can shuffle the power around your ship to boost different systems, have you ever wanted to yell something like "Diverge all power from the engines into forward shields."? Well now you can. When you weapons have finished charging you can decide 'where' on the enemy ship to fire, do you want to disablew their weapons or perhaps for the more twisted at heart you may consider targetting their o2 and watching them suffocate- with greater loot to boot.\n\nThe soundtrack for ftl is very atmospheric and memorable, you'll ocassionaly find yourself humming to it. There was such a demand for the sound track that it is also available for purchase.\n\nLength, replayabiliy? An average run through the game from beginning to end with a single ship could take you anywhere from 1-5 hours, but it is often cut short when you learn that death lurks around every corner of the universe. The meat of the game lasts in it's replayability, you can spend close to a hundred hours unlocking all the different ships- each with a unique theme and style of play. There are so many different random events that no two runs are alike, just when you might think you've lost a run a lucky weapon drop could suddenly swing things back into your favour.\n\nThis game is not for everyone, it is very cruel to newcomers. While it may all appear to be luck and rng based, it is rather more about controlling probability. Prepare to spend at least 20 hours of experiencing loss and learning from your mistakes because the game can be beaten with relative ease once you understand how it ticks.\n\nGreat game for those willing to put somesolid effort into understanding.\n","June 23, 2014","true","136.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are many ships to unlock, each one with a second layout to unlock. You start out with the Kestrel, which is a fine ship with a human crew. Each species has advantages/drawbacks. Humans, however, have neither. The story is amazing and there are a few things that you might not pick up on, so check out the wiki/fan theories.\n\nIf you're going to play this game, play it on easy.

Despite the linear "plot" to the game (make your way through eight sectors of a galaxy and defeat the final boss), you are given a huge number of options in terms of HOW you tackle this task. Whether you use boarding parties, drones or just arm yourself to the teeth with powerful weapons is entirely up to you, and there is an excellent balance that makes these all viable options.\n\nA playthrough doesn't take too long, so it's the sort of game you can play (and probably finish) in a couple of hours, or you can try out different things if you have longer. This means that it's a great game to play in either short bursts or a longer session.\n\nThe unlockable ships and hidden easter eggs are the cherry on the top that may well make you come back and play this game again and again- I know they did for me. I've now gotten 72 hours out of a game that cost barely anyting- and it's been a better experience than a few games five times the price.\n\n","December 8, 2013","true","78.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not only is it a game, it's a spaceship simulator. Oxygen levels can fluctuate throughout the fight, and fires can erupt toasting your crew and burning more of the precious oxygen. How will you defeat your enemy? Will you light the oxygen room ablaze and suffocate them? Send boarders over and watch the chaos ensue? EMP their shields, and blow up the weapons? Better yet, how will you respond to that?\n\nWill you send in your shields specialist to put out the fire, but leave your shields down? Will you lock the doors and cut of oxygen and suffocate the enemy? Will you be able to reroute your crew to get the shields back online?\n\nIronically, hilarious failures can be half the fun of the game. Whoops, forgot to close that door. Sorry pilot, didn't mean to suffocate you. Dang, forgot my boarders on the enemy ship!\n\nThe only flaws are the harsh learning curve, and the high difficulty can be offputting for some.

Its an arcade like style of play as though you only have 1 life per gameplay, but thats the idea to die! lol, As every gameplay you do they will be different and random events and sometimes you do good and sometimes you dont.... You use ur own strategy everytime you play and what you run into things along your trip, but this could also affect it by what you run into.... So if you like a good strategy game and kind of like a board game movement with some awesome space combat action being 2D time base lol I would recommend this game to you!","October 6, 2012","true","50.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This strategy game where you control a space-ship that is running away from the Rebel fleet in an attempt to save the galaxy is honestly one of the most difficult rouge-like's that I've ever played. There were so many times when I'd reach the final boss of the game with max health and soon find my ship completely destroyed in mere moments simply because they'd breach my defenses before I could even graze their ship. This unforgiving game only lets you have one life throughout the whole game, and finding that the game runs on the weirdest random number generator doesn't exactly make things a lot easier on the player. The different weapons and ships make this game a hell of a lot more interesting, as you constantly have to make changes to your every move throughout the entire game. One moment, you may be dominating a supply ship to the point where they try to flee; but they can't because you shot down their engines. The next, the exact same thing is happening to you. With the new Advanced Edition, the entire game pretty much was changed and rebalanced (Flak is the most OP weapon. Get as much as you can). This game deserves a 9/10, for it's only problem being that unlocking new ships is too vague for most people to get, and with it's weird random number generator it makes it nearly impossible to determine if "this gameplay will get me a new ship to use".","June 8, 2014","true","46.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even if you don't really like RPGs, the game's space combat is easy to pick up but hard to master.\n\nIn FTL, it also helps to be lucky. Depending on that, you can get more valuable scrap material to buy weapons from stores or upgrade your ship. You can also randomly get quests to unlock more spaceships, so there is variety in that aspect to.

Your journey is restricted both by your limited fuel and the approaching Rebel fleet, so grinding isn't really an option. Each game should take around a half hour to an hour and a half and there is a nearly endless combination of weapons and modules to experiment with. Everything is controlled by very simple resources and upgrade trees, keeping the learning curve short. All great things which make for a great game. What I couldn't get over, and what drains a good portion of the fun out of this game for me, is just how random a rogue-like. It is nearly impossible to set a goal beyond survival and success. Various weapon combinations might excite you, but there is no guarantee you'll ever get a shot at testing them. The trade off here is, of course, that each playthrough is unique and if that's what you're looking for, FTL is perfect for you. However, if you look to strategy games for intense planning and not the fun a constant wrench in the works makes for, this might not be the game for you.","June 16, 2014","true","31.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Caught it in the Steam sale over Christmas and have to admit I didn't play it straight away. But casually loaded it up last week and have been hooked!\n\nYou start with a crew of 3, with a basic loadout of weapons, fuel and the ability to get some drones to assist you with tasks like ship repairs, intruders, among others. Your mission? KEEP MOVING! The rebels are chasing you from one sector to the next. On your journey you'll be encountering events such as pirates chasing down defenceless ships (do you help them? do you accept a pirate bribe to stay out of it?) and you can sell scrap you collect to upgrade your systems (buy additional crew members to help with unmanned systems, buy fuel, rockets, new weapons...). You'll never have enough scrap to outfit your ship completely so it's very important to make the right decision.\n\nThe "random" element of the game is perhaps its best feature. No 2 games are the same, you can "jump" once and get an additional crew member, or you can jump and find yourself staring at a rebel ship wanting to shoot you to pieces.\n\n...and if you wanted more than something that was replayable, you've got a truly excellent soundtrack to listen to as you play that's atmospheric and draws you in.\n\nBest indie game I've played personally, and I'd definitely get it... whether you want it right now or whether you can wait til the next sale, at least add it to your wishlist, and look it up on YouTube :)","January 31, 2015","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It tries to give a cinimatic feel without using orchestral instruments, and as a result it has a distinct sound. Bonus points are given for utilizing a leitmotief, and even more for making it subtle.\n\nGraphically, there's not much to speak of. FTL has a very retro look, though kinda on the low-end of 16 bit or the high-end of 8 bit. The sprites are large and high-res, but there's no shading to speak of. The backgrounds feel a bit, well, stock, but look nice.\n\nFTL's gameplay is easy to learn but takes a long time to master. You can get the hang of the game very quickly, but the difficulty is notable. It's not the hardest game I've played, but it's definately a challenge.\n\nWhich brings me to why I'm hesitant to recommend this game. Saying the game "isn't the hardest game I've played" is not a very accurate way to judge difficulty, as I've played a few games that were so hard the average gamer would considder it torture (Exceed: Gun Bullet Children comes to mind). This game is definately out to get you (like any Roguelike) and is VERY obvious about it.\n\nStory-wise, FTL is pretty simple and a bit reminicent of one of the underlying plots of Star Wars, just in reverse. You've stolen the plans to the rebel flagship and are running from the rebel fleet. You must bring the plans to the federation HQ and then destroy the rebel flagship. There are a ton of side-quests and events that spice things up, and no playthrough is the same.\n\nOverall, I can say that this game is fun and challenging, and has a great soundtrack. However, the difficulty is definately something to note, and the graphics are only half-decent even for a retro-styled game. I give it a 6.5/10, or a solid 8/10 if you like difficult games. I also give it a recommendation, though be warned - this game is quite a challenge.\n\nRecommended for: Retro gamers who don't care about the quality of their pixels, fans of roguelikes, soundtrack junkies and anyone looking for a challenge.\n\nNot recommended for: "ub3r 1337 gamzorz 111" type players, casuals, graphics junkies or people who hate losing.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Fun, challenging, and a great soundtrack, but half-decent graphics and the shear difficulty level mean that FTL: Faster Than Light is not for everyone.","January 20, 2014","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Through an intoxicating mix of luck, strategy, and permadeath, this game presents players with countless scenarios and tools that can be used to progress throughout the galaxy.  The gameplay is incredible and very rogue-esque allowing for a modern incarnation of a game viewed as a classic by many.  The atmosphere generated by the universe of the game encourages great immersion and the soundtrack within FTL is one of the best I have ever heard.  Oh, and kudos to Subset Games for their uncommon chivalry in making a huge expansion pack for the game free to all players.  This sort of thing is not seen much anymore and it is a testament to just how much the developers care about the players who have invested in this amazing experience.

It's a good game, that's for sure, and I don't regret buying it. I've only played 7 hours so far, but there's no doubt I'll sink in some more hours so... yeah, it's a good game.\n\nBut it's really not as marvellous and great and perfect as some reviews suggest. For one thing, this game does not have "awesome random events". The game IS one gigantic random event. There's really nothing you can do that you are SURE will bring in positive or negative outcomes. This total lack of control feels refreshing at times, but it's more frustrating than anything else in my opinion. Some randomness is good, but to me, things get old pretty fast when everything works on a dice roll.\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty hard and unforgiving. Good change of pace, considering the amount of titles that get thrown at our face where actions have no consequences. So don't get too attached to your crew... you'll see them die soon enough.\n\nSo... yeah. I like this game. But it's not the game of the century. It got so much praise that I guess I'm just a tad disappointed. Actually, I see it more as a time killer, kind of like Eufloria (yes, I did just compare FTL to Eufloria. Go figure).\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion. Grab it for 2 or 3 bucks on sale and make your own opinion, you probably won't regret it.","January 31, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This strategy game where you control a space-ship that is running away from the Rebel fleet in an attempt to save the galaxy is honestly one of the most difficult rouge-like's that I've ever played. There were so many times when I'd reach the final boss of the game with max health and soon find my ship completely destroyed in mere moments simply because they'd breach my defenses before I could even graze their ship. This unforgiving game only lets you have one life throughout the whole game, and finding that the game runs on the weirdest random number generator doesn't exactly make things a lot easier on the player. The different weapons and ships make this game a hell of a lot more interesting, as you constantly have to make changes to your every move throughout the entire game. One moment, you may be dominating a supply ship to the point where they try to flee; but they can't because you shot down their engines. The next, the exact same thing is happening to you. With the new Advanced Edition, the entire game pretty much was changed and rebalanced (Flak is the most OP weapon. Get as much as you can). This game deserves a 9/10, for it's only problem being that unlocking new ships is too vague for most people to get, and with it's weird random number generator it makes it nearly impossible to determine if "this gameplay will get me a new ship to use".","June 8, 2014","true","46.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you can remain adamant in your will to achieve victory perhaps you'll discover one of the many winning formulas that will lead you to continued success.\n\nThe general flow of the game consists of choosing a weak starship and slowly building your combat ability through weapons, crew, and supporting systems as you flee from a seemingly unstopable foe; all while trying to maintain a balance of key resources like fuel which could mean certain doom if you run out. The game features many event choices that can reward your decisions with new weapons or could cost you the life of your crew, by adding certain facilities to your ship you'll be able to choose from a more expansive list of choices that  can sway the event in your favour.\n\nThe combat consists of two ships (yours and your foes) divided via a split screen, while waiting for your weapons to charge you can shuffle the power around your ship to boost different systems, have you ever wanted to yell something like "Diverge all power from the engines into forward shields."? Well now you can. When you weapons have finished charging you can decide 'where' on the enemy ship to fire, do you want to disablew their weapons or perhaps for the more twisted at heart you may consider targetting their o2 and watching them suffocate- with greater loot to boot.\n\nThe soundtrack for ftl is very atmospheric and memorable, you'll ocassionaly find yourself humming to it. There was such a demand for the sound track that it is also available for purchase.\n\nLength, replayabiliy? An average run through the game from beginning to end with a single ship could take you anywhere from 1-5 hours, but it is often cut short when you learn that death lurks around every corner of the universe. The meat of the game lasts in it's replayability, you can spend close to a hundred hours unlocking all the different ships- each with a unique theme and style of play. There are so many different random events that no two runs are alike, just when you might think you've lost a run a lucky weapon drop could suddenly swing things back into your favour.\n\nThis game is not for everyone, it is very cruel to newcomers. While it may all appear to be luck and rng based, it is rather more about controlling probability. Prepare to spend at least 20 hours of experiencing loss and learning from your mistakes because the game can be beaten with relative ease once you understand how it ticks.\n\nGreat game for those willing to put somesolid effort into understanding.\n","June 23, 2014","true","136.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not to mention that using built-in exploits and leadership skills (read: tag-teaming boarders and fires, or luring said boarders into the med bay and fighting them with heals) can be pretty gratifying. However, I find a large margin of error to be the fact that it's just as fortuitous as, well, real space travel and war... in our present with our technology. Seriously, what kind of faster-than-light spaceship crew doesn't have anything better than a fire extinguisher? Why can't we isolate the cabins to vent oxygen only from the ones that are on fire? What material did they build it from that is so mysteriously flammable? And once you think you've got the timing of the weapons right and everything, and you've fully upgraded your shields and you've got decent weapons and a dependable dodge rating, the flagship puts up a kind of underwhelming fight... at least until suddenly your entire med bay is on fire and your crew drops dead because the system is too damaged for heals while you're still getting battered by the flagship but since all hands are on deck (and dying) to put out the stupid fire then your shields reload as slow as molasses in a vaccum and then you just die. Like you never even spent any time working your butt off to get your ship the best it can be, all those thrilling escapes and chases by the rebel fleet and the times you went six jumps with three hull points left and got to a repair station by the skin of your teeth, like those never even happened. And why? So you can do it all again. Nothing compared to the rush I get when I start off a fresh adventure, but it's agonizing to have to start from the bottom every time, considering this is the only permadeath-upgrade-your-way-unscripted-rpg game that I own or have ever played. No idea why I keep coming back to it, but I do and I can say I'll keep playing until it manages to really ♥♥♥♥ me off, and considering the way I died against the flagship on easy and I've still got the stomach to hit restart, I can't see myself rage-deleting the local content anytime soon.","February 28, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The Creator of Its Own Genre for A Reason.Genre: 2D Strategy Sci-Fi Rogue-Like.\nDeveloped & Published by: Subset Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and Mobile.\nBusiness Model: Base Game + Free Expansion\nCopy Gifted By A Friend Read the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nI had seen this game get featured in various articles before its release and I'll admit that I kind of let this game slip under my radar until after release. Since this happened, I've been working on ways of preventing this from happening in the future. But I digress. After seeing what the game was about post-launch, I was interested in picking the game up very soon though lack of funds prevented me from getting the game initially. Thankfully, a good friend of mine gifted me the game. FTL: Faster Than Light is a rogue-like, real-time spaceship simulator. In FTL, you must fly your spaceship through hostile space, fight pirates, make diplomatic decisions, and avoid losing your entire crew and/or ship to the cold blackness of space. This game has you flying through various sectors of space collection equipment and scrap (currency) to improve the ship as well as meeting new races and seeing new regions of space. All the while, you must outrun the Rebel fleet that is trying to catch you before you reach the waiting Federation fleet.\n\nThe Story and Gameplay.\nYou're the captain of a starship for the Federation fleet that is being pursued by the overwhelming Rebel fleet. Why? Because you've learned important tactical information on how to defeat the Rebel fleet. You must deliver this information through a harrowing gauntlet of star systems and planets, avoiding overwhelming danger and surviving the odds. There are eight very dangerous sectors of space before you arrive at the Federation's Last Stand. There are up to four different paths you can take in each sector where a randomly generated situation will either benefit or debilitate your situation. After surviving the eight sectors, you'll join up with the Federation fleet to take on the invading Rebel fleet. At which point you must attack the Flagship of the Rebels directly while the Federation fleet attacks the Rebel fleet itself. Its game over if your ship or crew die at any point. For the most part, your choices have immediate consequences which will build up over time and may lead to success or failure. There are only a couple of choices you can make that will affect anything in the long-term. Generally, there are the prerequisites to acquiring new cruisers.\n\nEach new cruiser you acquire is built and balanced differently from each other to fit a certain play-style. Some are better at stealth, some have better offensive weapons and some are better at taking over the enemy ship or removing all of the crew members. Each cruiser also comes with a B-layout that changes what crew, weapons and modules are included on your ship as well as the color of the ship. There is a great variety of ships for FTL, its just unlocking them can take a long time. When starting the game you get to choose the ship, the layout, the name of the ship and the name of your initial crew, as well as which gender your Human crew are. You can also choose the difficulty setting easy or normal. However, I think they mislabeled these and its more like hard and insane. Not that its a bad thing, but "normal" is not as easy as you would think in most games. Once you've done all this, your ready to start out on your adventure through the stars. You can choose which planet you get to jump to from the galaxy map. Just keep in mind that every jump you make means that the rebels come that much closer to catching up to you. Even if they do, you can fight them off. Its generally not recommended because the only reward you'll get for beating them is one unit of fuel and no scrap. Scrap is the currency you use to repair your ship, buy new weapons and other miscellaneous items.\n\nWhile the main story may not be that strong, the real story is the journey you take in this harsh universe. Will you lose most of your crew in a freak accident only to survive all the way to the last sector on a wish and a prayer? Or will you escape from a sun's solar flare only to jump into an asteroid field and watch as your ship gets ripped apart by the asteroids and the nearby pirate's lasers? Or do you send your crew down to a randomly planet's distress call only to lose some of them as they are attacked by rebel forces? The story is played out with a lot of different text screens as you jump from one place in the galaxy map to the next. You'll encounter many different races, each with their own set of needs and personalities which you'll then have to decide what's best for your ship's continued survival. That's the fun with games like this is that you get to create the story in your head as you go along. It happened more than once that I would say "ENGAGE" at my monitor as my ship escaped a brutal battle or mourned over the loss of a comrade who bravely defended invading forces from taking over the ship. So, while the base story might not be much, its what you create from the universe that will really engage your interest in the game.\n\nAdvanced Edition Thoughts\nFTL: Advanced Edition fleshes everything about the game out, it's that simple. The new alien race adds a new mechanic where they suck the air out of the room they are in. There's new ships as well. It also comes with more music, weapons, encounters to overcome and UI enhancements to boot. It's a free expansion so no reason not to enjoy it. It can be disabled if you're wanting the vanilla FTL experience.\n\nPC Settings\nFTL's settings are a bit lacking. You only have a few options to control the size of the game on your screen. Those included are: windowed mode, full-screen (stretched), full-screen (black borders) and full-screen (FTL's native resolution) which is not your monitor's resolution. You also have no control over key bindings, though the default keys are pretty smartly placed. There are also a bunch of other minor settings you can enable or disable to your liking and you can see in the screenshot above. Overall, my biggest criticism of the settings choices would be the lack of resolution options as I'm not a bit fan of the current ones but they should work well enough for you. The game also features a good tutorial to get you up to speed on how to play. There is also a Stats screen which contains your best performance and achievements for each ship you've flown. The game is well polished as far as being free from any bugs or crashing problems are concerned.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nFTL is a fantastic game and I don't think I'm saying anything new there. There's plenty of content and challenge, as I got 30 hours out of it. Though the RNG can easily ruin a run and I'd classify it as overly harsh, but there's something to enjoy every run. It's one of the few games that genuinely gives the feeling of being a starship captain. If your looking for a starship simulator that is an enjoyable, simple, and well crafted experience, then give FTL: Faster Than Light a look. This became my Game of the Year in 2012.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","March 9, 2013","true","53.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will guide that lost civilian to their destination, find out it was a rebel trap, and smile. You will relish every victory.\n\nYou will have to sell that Burst Laser III so you can upgrade your engines. You will open that Mantis escape pod because you are desperate for someone who can board ships. You will lose the last bit of your ship's HP to an unfortunately timed missle. Failing to make it to the end of a roughly 6-hour playthrough is what makes your victories significant.\n\nFTL is visually very simple, a hallmark of its indie production, but as much as it could benefit from a bigger-than-1280x800 resolution or perhaps even 3D graphics, I love how I can run it on my integrated graphics laptop.\n\nFTL is a tremendous value and important landmark in the history of crowdfunded games.

Well now is your chance but it is not for the faint of heart.\n\nIn short get this, it is an awesome rogue-like space simulator and you will not regret it. Also buy the soundtrack too, it’s very catchy.\n\n\nThis game is great fun. The ascetics are very retro and remind me of games from yesteryear. The gameplay itself is fun, challenging and highly addictive, you will want to play it through time and again. Even when the odds are against you, and they often are, you will want to fight on and try to be the hero despite your impending doom.\n\nThe in game universe is already vast and highly diverse, you never know whether the next warp will be to a friendly planet, devastated space station or rebel ambush. The whole game is more or less procedurally generated so you never have the same experience twice, which keeps it fresh each time you retry.\n\nAs the captain you manage what systems you have installed in your ship, what weapons you have equipped, even which crew members fly with you. There is even a basic rpg system for each crew member, so if they do die you feel a sense of lost. I remember getting very attached to the little guys.\n\n\nThis game will kick your butt and laugh at you whilst doing it yet that is a price that is very easily paid considering how enjoyment you’ll get. This is a 100% recommend even at full price, on sale you would be crazy not to get this. And due to a recent update it’s even better. There are also mods that can be applied for an even better experience, I recommend the Captain’s edition\n\nHave fun ^_^","May 5, 2014","true","27.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This means that it's a great game to play in either short bursts or a longer session.\n\nThe unlockable ships and hidden easter eggs are the cherry on the top that may well make you come back and play this game again and again- I know they did for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bortington/recommended/212680/","bortington","Bort","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bortington/","86 products in account","This game is brilliant.\n\nIt looks simple, and it is, very simple, to learn to play. Mastering it, however, will take a lot longer.\n\nThe game revolves around your ship, fleeing Rebel forces and trying to reach the Allied Fleet. You start off with a few crew, some minor weapons, and few empty spaces on your ship for improvements and new systems. How you develop from there is entirely up to you.\n\nYou can use your scrap to upgrade your weapons, turning your ship into a powerful gunship. You have the options of buying new, stronger, weapons as the you locate stores, or traders. Or, if you are really lucky, you'll just find a random weapon floating in space.\n\nOr, perhaps you'd like to capture enemy ships instead of destroying them. Then you want teleporters, and Mantis crewmen. Mantis are the insectoid race, and they are excellent in combat. Beam them into your enemy's ship, and watch as they tear through the crew until the ship is yours.\n\nOf course, these are just two of the ways you can play this. With the Advanced Edition upgrade, you get new systems to play with, which provide you with even more options.\n\nOn top of all this, there is the hangar. Even if you beat the boss, there are another 9 ship classes to check out, and most of those have three variants, so there is still loads to do.\n\nThen you have the various quests and missions to do, 8 randomly generated sectors of space to explore in each game, and even the chance of discovering a lost lost system... If you are lucky. All while on the run from the Rebel Fleet.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this game. FTL is loads of fun, and rather addictive. And even if you do get tired of playing (eventually), there are many, many mods out there for it which will change up your gameplay.","June 12, 2015","true","154.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A sci-fi, tactical, procedurally generated, customizable, spaceship game is something that I imagine quite a few people have been waiting for, even if they didn't realize it. The player takes the role of the crew of a small starship attempting to cover a certain distance of space to reach the Federation homeworld. The catch being that you are being pursued by rebel forces that are seeking to destroy you because you're carrying data that could result in the downfall of those forces. You jump from point to point interacting with rebel forces, pirates, science expeditions, galactic forces, etc., while attempting to maintian your position in front of the ever encroaching rebel force. Hijinks ensue.\n\nFTL is incredibly replayable, very challenging, rewarding, very engaging, and fun. For those who enjoy the genre it's a game that they will derive much enjoyment from, and for those who aren't sure of the genre, FTL is a great place to start.

The final boss is basically a checklist to make sure you're incredibly overpowered or have a some kind of way prepared to cheese it. Really, have so much as one weakness, and the Flagship will use it to tear down your hull to nothing. I had a fully decked out arsenal, pre-igniters, maxed cloaking. My one weakness might've been my modest crew size of 5. Then, my gunner is mind controlled. Make that 4 crew. 2 Humans board. Well, it's hard to get away without piloting the ship in the final fight. 3v2? Seems it'll have to do. Just gotta keep trying my best plugging away at the Zoltan shield. It's a bit tougher when I have to keep my weapons from taking damage when an enemy combatant I both don't want to kill yet need to constantly fight is in the same room as them. Ouch. A wayward rocket in the medbay while cycling injured fighters in. Goodbye crew member. Oh boy. 2 more humans boarding. No use in trying to man the blast doors, they're right on top of me. Just gotta vent them out into space. Now let's fix up my weapons.  Here I am with 2 crew with a silver of health left each. Could I possibly finish the fight? (cue power surge just after I cloaked to avoid a barrage)\n\n\n\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, no. I didn't finish the fight. And legend has it, the salt remains in the heart of this review's writer to this very day. Or not. I'm writing this at 1 AM just a few minutes after it happened. It sure feels like it'll stick with me for a long time though. Maybe I'll upload this review, if not just to relive the bad memory the next time I wonder\n"Wait, I 've reviewed games on Steam?"\n\nThat reminds me. This is supposed to be a review, not a blog to vent about my shortcomings in video games. FTL fun if you delude yourself into thinking that luck isn't the main deciding factor in runs. You always know deep down that it's something of an elaborate gamble. Sooner or later you'll remember, and it'll lose some of its appeal in gameplay. You'll see all of the beaconevents before too long, and every conceivable dramatic, emergent comeback or situation will occur to some degree if you play a bit longer. Once those lose their charm, it becomes harder and harder to come back to. At least it has for me.\n\nI suppose a ten dollar indie game doens't advertise infinite replayability, so you know what, I'm going to begrudgingly reccomend it despite coming in here to fervently denounce the game with the hopes that maybe my spite would be resolved if I was lucky enough to see the positive review percentage drop by a digit following my submission. I've had a lot of frustration with this game, but I think overall, if I look way back to 2012 (when good indie games were released on Steam on a regular basis, if anyone can imagine that.) I've gotten more out of it in fun than what it has taken from me in the form of torn out hair and swear jar change.","March 23","true","132.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are a starship captain and it is your job to warn the Federation of the impending Rebel threat. You must decide which sectors to explore, while staying ahead of your enemy, and doing all the good things good starship captains do; like going tromping into a seemingly abandoned space station, all because of some faint life signs you can’t identify. Sometimes things will go great, like getting a new crew member or some much needed supplies, while other times ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan and everyone dies.

Each time you start up a new game, you will get a fresh ship and crew, which you must help survive through all the sectors until a final boss confrontation at the end.\n\nWhether you complete your mission or are destroyed, nothing carries over to your next playthrough, but you are able to unlock  several new ship types and alternate starting loadouts for the ships.  There is some slight customization, you can rename your ship and each starting crewmember, and adjust crewmen colors.\n\nWhen presented with options, you'll have to weigh the safety of your crew with the chance to acquire extra scrap.  Remember, noone is safe in a galaxy of terror, so try not to get attached to your crew.  You'll have the chance to recruit new members through hiring at space stations or rescuing them from slavers, and it is an enjoyable experience trying to preserve their lives while at the same time trying to protect your ship from enemy attacks.\n\nYou'll often have to make decisions that will have serious consequences.  Do you hang around in one sector longer in order to aquire extra resources, at the risk of the rebel fleet catching up to you and forcing a fight with an elite enemy in order to jump to the next sector?  Do you choose to travel into a nebula where your sensors are useless and your engine's power is halved, but giving you more time to improve your ship while the rebel fleet moves more slowly through the nebula as well?\n\nThe simple graphics are charming in their own way, the sound effects adequate.  The tension from fights are relieved by the ability to pause at any time to queue up actions, but you'll still find yourself tensing up whenever the enemy ship fires rockets, to see if they harmlessly fly by or hit a key system.\n\nAs for combat, their are multiple ways you can set your ship up.  You can focus on rapid fire enery weapons that knock down shields fast and allow you to use heavy beams to sweep across several rooms of the enemy ship.  You can focus on building up drone units, that launch and circle the enemy ship doing constant damage, or defensive drones that knock down missles before they can hit, or drones that travel throughout your ship, repairing the hull and fighting intruders.  You can install a teleportation chamber and send your hardiest crew members directly over to fight the enemy crew.\n\nThe total package makes for an engaging experience that first party companies try to achieve with huge budgets and complex systems.  It is a game you can play as a small diversion when you have 20 minutes, coming back to your save when you can, or you can spend hours at a time cruising the galaxy.  If you can appreciate the gameplay despite the dated presentation of the graphics, I would definitely recommend FTL.","June 22, 2014","true","32.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Stranded civilian ship want to trade 5 missiles for two of your fuel? You run out of fuel before you can resupply at the next store, and die. Refuse a pirate trader and wind up fighting? The extra hull damage to your ship causes you to explode in the asteriod field down the way.

The Creator of Its Own Genre for A Reason.Genre: 2D Strategy Sci-Fi Rogue-Like.\nDeveloped & Published by: Subset Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and Mobile.\nBusiness Model: Base Game + Free Expansion\nCopy Gifted By A Friend Read the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nI had seen this game get featured in various articles before its release and I'll admit that I kind of let this game slip under my radar until after release. Since this happened, I've been working on ways of preventing this from happening in the future. But I digress. After seeing what the game was about post-launch, I was interested in picking the game up very soon though lack of funds prevented me from getting the game initially. Thankfully, a good friend of mine gifted me the game. FTL: Faster Than Light is a rogue-like, real-time spaceship simulator. In FTL, you must fly your spaceship through hostile space, fight pirates, make diplomatic decisions, and avoid losing your entire crew and/or ship to the cold blackness of space. This game has you flying through various sectors of space collection equipment and scrap (currency) to improve the ship as well as meeting new races and seeing new regions of space. All the while, you must outrun the Rebel fleet that is trying to catch you before you reach the waiting Federation fleet.\n\nThe Story and Gameplay.\nYou're the captain of a starship for the Federation fleet that is being pursued by the overwhelming Rebel fleet. Why? Because you've learned important tactical information on how to defeat the Rebel fleet. You must deliver this information through a harrowing gauntlet of star systems and planets, avoiding overwhelming danger and surviving the odds. There are eight very dangerous sectors of space before you arrive at the Federation's Last Stand. There are up to four different paths you can take in each sector where a randomly generated situation will either benefit or debilitate your situation. After surviving the eight sectors, you'll join up with the Federation fleet to take on the invading Rebel fleet. At which point you must attack the Flagship of the Rebels directly while the Federation fleet attacks the Rebel fleet itself. Its game over if your ship or crew die at any point. For the most part, your choices have immediate consequences which will build up over time and may lead to success or failure. There are only a couple of choices you can make that will affect anything in the long-term. Generally, there are the prerequisites to acquiring new cruisers.\n\nEach new cruiser you acquire is built and balanced differently from each other to fit a certain play-style. Some are better at stealth, some have better offensive weapons and some are better at taking over the enemy ship or removing all of the crew members. Each cruiser also comes with a B-layout that changes what crew, weapons and modules are included on your ship as well as the color of the ship. There is a great variety of ships for FTL, its just unlocking them can take a long time. When starting the game you get to choose the ship, the layout, the name of the ship and the name of your initial crew, as well as which gender your Human crew are. You can also choose the difficulty setting easy or normal. However, I think they mislabeled these and its more like hard and insane. Not that its a bad thing, but "normal" is not as easy as you would think in most games. Once you've done all this, your ready to start out on your adventure through the stars. You can choose which planet you get to jump to from the galaxy map. Just keep in mind that every jump you make means that the rebels come that much closer to catching up to you. Even if they do, you can fight them off. Its generally not recommended because the only reward you'll get for beating them is one unit of fuel and no scrap. Scrap is the currency you use to repair your ship, buy new weapons and other miscellaneous items.\n\nWhile the main story may not be that strong, the real story is the journey you take in this harsh universe. Will you lose most of your crew in a freak accident only to survive all the way to the last sector on a wish and a prayer? Or will you escape from a sun's solar flare only to jump into an asteroid field and watch as your ship gets ripped apart by the asteroids and the nearby pirate's lasers? Or do you send your crew down to a randomly planet's distress call only to lose some of them as they are attacked by rebel forces? The story is played out with a lot of different text screens as you jump from one place in the galaxy map to the next. You'll encounter many different races, each with their own set of needs and personalities which you'll then have to decide what's best for your ship's continued survival. That's the fun with games like this is that you get to create the story in your head as you go along. It happened more than once that I would say "ENGAGE" at my monitor as my ship escaped a brutal battle or mourned over the loss of a comrade who bravely defended invading forces from taking over the ship. So, while the base story might not be much, its what you create from the universe that will really engage your interest in the game.\n\nAdvanced Edition Thoughts\nFTL: Advanced Edition fleshes everything about the game out, it's that simple. The new alien race adds a new mechanic where they suck the air out of the room they are in. There's new ships as well. It also comes with more music, weapons, encounters to overcome and UI enhancements to boot. It's a free expansion so no reason not to enjoy it. It can be disabled if you're wanting the vanilla FTL experience.\n\nPC Settings\nFTL's settings are a bit lacking. You only have a few options to control the size of the game on your screen. Those included are: windowed mode, full-screen (stretched), full-screen (black borders) and full-screen (FTL's native resolution) which is not your monitor's resolution. You also have no control over key bindings, though the default keys are pretty smartly placed. There are also a bunch of other minor settings you can enable or disable to your liking and you can see in the screenshot above. Overall, my biggest criticism of the settings choices would be the lack of resolution options as I'm not a bit fan of the current ones but they should work well enough for you. The game also features a good tutorial to get you up to speed on how to play. There is also a Stats screen which contains your best performance and achievements for each ship you've flown. The game is well polished as far as being free from any bugs or crashing problems are concerned.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nFTL is a fantastic game and I don't think I'm saying anything new there. There's plenty of content and challenge, as I got 30 hours out of it. Though the RNG can easily ruin a run and I'd classify it as overly harsh, but there's something to enjoy every run. It's one of the few games that genuinely gives the feeling of being a starship captain. If your looking for a starship simulator that is an enjoyable, simple, and well crafted experience, then give FTL: Faster Than Light a look. This became my Game of the Year in 2012.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","March 9, 2013","true","53.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Mastering it, however, will take a lot longer.\n\nThe game revolves around your ship, fleeing Rebel forces and trying to reach the Allied Fleet. You start off with a few crew, some minor weapons, and few empty spaces on your ship for improvements and new systems. How you develop from there is entirely up to you.\n\nYou can use your scrap to upgrade your weapons, turning your ship into a powerful gunship. You have the options of buying new, stronger, weapons as the you locate stores, or traders. Or, if you are really lucky, you'll just find a random weapon floating in space.\n\nOr, perhaps you'd like to capture enemy ships instead of destroying them. Then you want teleporters, and Mantis crewmen. Mantis are the insectoid race, and they are excellent in combat. Beam them into your enemy's ship, and watch as they tear through the crew until the ship is yours.\n\nOf course, these are just two of the ways you can play this. With the Advanced Edition upgrade, you get new systems to play with, which provide you with even more options.\n\nOn top of all this, there is the hangar. Even if you beat the boss, there are another 9 ship classes to check out, and most of those have three variants, so there is still loads to do.\n\nThen you have the various quests and missions to do, 8 randomly generated sectors of space to explore in each game, and even the chance of discovering a lost lost system... If you are lucky. All while on the run from the Rebel Fleet.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this game. FTL is loads of fun, and rather addictive. And even if you do get tired of playing (eventually), there are many, many mods out there for it which will change up your gameplay.","June 12, 2015","true","154.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is about management skills rather than maneuvering skills. There are 9 unique ships total, each with 2 different layouts, 7 different crew races with unique traits, and tons of weapons, including your crew that may be used to board enemy ships. But what makes FTL unique is how brutal this game is. One single tiny bad decision may turn a so far good run into a nightmare.Battles can get really hectic and will keep you on your toes. Pausing the game to think your way through a fight is the rule. The fear of death, always present. Once you're dead, either start a new game or cry. No second chance. All of this, plus the fantastic soundtrack, makes FTL a very emotionally engaging, tense game. Its random nature makes every run unique.

I pour so many hours into this game it's starting to become a problem.\n\nFTL is a roguelike that puts you in control of your own federation starship on a mission to travel to and destroy the rebel flagship; sounds pretty easy right?.  Apparently, the rebels are winning because this federation has miniscule resources and as such you recieve a ship that's severely under-equiped for the job.  It is up to you, and your crew, to find the resources you need to make it to the end and defeat the flagship, a task that can be challenging even on the easiest difficulty.\n\nI refrain from calling it hard as it's really not as long as you make all the right decisions.  The word 'unforgiving' is a better description, as one mistake is all it takes to get a game over.  You can pause the game at any time during combat so there's no presure to fast click and multi-task in the heat of combat so the only reason failure is your own poor decision making, and that really appeals to me.\n\nSince you can name your ship and starting crew I'm tempted to call this "Oregon Trail in Space", and that's probably all I needed to say.  It has all the same appeal, difficulty, and unforgiving environment "Oregon Trail" had just that instead of choosing starting resources you choose a ship.","February 20, 2014","true","47.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's just good. It properly makes you feel like you are in space, you are on a journey in space, and perfectly conveys emotions with it's soundtrack. All of the music fits in perfectly, whether you feel like 'Wow, look at those stars.' or maybe you feel like 'Oh s***, this it it!', the soundtrack just DOES it.\n\nFTL's Graphical style is very unique, it's top down and you see into the ship, and the characters are little sprites. But, this all goes into plan..\n\nFTL's graphics are done the way it is for a reason. It's to help with the gameplay, which is the biggest part of the game.\n\nIn FTL, you fly a ship. You are in space. Now, just imagine some space combat with a giant ship shooting at another ship. What do you think goes on in both the inside and outside of the ship?\nAre you in a nebula? Then you have no sensors, you can't even see the inside of your ship without a clear visual. Your ship may or may not be on fire... Maybe there are intruders, but you can't see them. Ok, now we fly out of the nebula. Turns out, everything WAS on fire. Hot. But there's no fire in space right... Why is there no fire in space? Oh right, oxygen.\n\nYou can open the airlocks and remove the oxygen in a certain room. It will remove the fires, without having you to burn your crewmen.\n\nIn FTL, you'll need to have crew. Why are crew important? You need crew members to man the systems on the ship. Who's gonna fly?\nIf all of your crew members die. You fail. Also you fail if the ship blows up.\n\nOuch.\n\nFTL has a permadeath system. There is no checkpoints. No savestates, or whatever. No going back until you die or complete your mission.\n\nSo, how do you survive?\nOk, you can survive by playing smart, making correct choices and stuff, that kind of thing.\nWant to take a risk to send your men on mission? They might not come back...\nBut, what if you succeed? Who knows what you'll get? A new crewmember might be nice.\nWouldn't mind a Burst Laser Mk.2...\n\n\nThe Combat in FTL is a vital part of the game. Weaponry decides the battle, and so do defenses.\nCan you evade long enough for your weapon to fire? Will your shields hold up?\nWill your weapon even penetrate the defence?\n\nIf you can manage to damage the enemy... What do you aim for? That's all you.\nYou can target their engines, or their piloting system. They can't evade if those are destroyed.\nMaybe their shields are annoying you. Destroy the shield system!\nMaybe you can't take another hit... End their weapons before YOU are ended!\n\nSame goes for you. If your shields are down, better hope you can evade the next few shots.\nIf your weapons are down, you'd better fix them quick.\nIf you have no oxygen on your ship, you better hope you can breathe long enough to fix it AND survive the rest of the encounter.\n\n'But- I taut dis was speace'\nIt is.\n'No Aliuns?'\nThere are.\n\nThere are different species, all with different benefits.\nHuman - Trains skills faster\nRockman - No Fire Damage, 150 Health, slowed movement.\nZoltan - Provides 1 free power to room, 75 health, explodes on death.\nEngi - Repairs fast, terribad at combat.\nCrystal - Less Oxygen Damage, 125 HP, 'Crystal Lockdown' ability.\nMantis - Extra Movement speed, extra melee damage, Sucks at repairing.\n\n\nAs I said, there are different playstyles. Most of them are due to what kind of starting ship you have.\nYou may like boarding the enemy, and stabbing them with your mantis-crew.\n\nYou may be defensive, and focus on high evade and high shields.\nOr you may be offensive and try to outgun them.\nThe choice is yours, but also the game's.\nSometimes, you don't decide what you get, you may end up with stuff you don't like.\n\nYou also have to manage resources, don't run out of fuel, or the rebels might catch up on you.\nYou need scrap too. Scrap is like money. You also use scrap to upgrade. Hurray for scrap.\n\nThere's a ton of replayability in FTL.\nIf you die, you want to try again.\nIf you beat it, you want the rest of the ships.\n\nIt's also a very fun casual game, maybe you need something to do for 2 hours. From beginning to end, those 2 hours will fly quick.","September 12, 2013","true","103.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The final boss is basically a checklist to make sure you're incredibly overpowered or have a some kind of way prepared to cheese it. Really, have so much as one weakness, and the Flagship will use it to tear down your hull to nothing. I had a fully decked out arsenal, pre-igniters, maxed cloaking. My one weakness might've been my modest crew size of 5. Then, my gunner is mind controlled. Make that 4 crew. 2 Humans board. Well, it's hard to get away without piloting the ship in the final fight. 3v2? Seems it'll have to do. Just gotta keep trying my best plugging away at the Zoltan shield. It's a bit tougher when I have to keep my weapons from taking damage when an enemy combatant I both don't want to kill yet need to constantly fight is in the same room as them. Ouch. A wayward rocket in the medbay while cycling injured fighters in. Goodbye crew member. Oh boy. 2 more humans boarding. No use in trying to man the blast doors, they're right on top of me. Just gotta vent them out into space. Now let's fix up my weapons.  Here I am with 2 crew with a silver of health left each. Could I possibly finish the fight? (cue power surge just after I cloaked to avoid a barrage)\n\n\n\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, no. I didn't finish the fight. And legend has it, the salt remains in the heart of this review's writer to this very day. Or not. I'm writing this at 1 AM just a few minutes after it happened. It sure feels like it'll stick with me for a long time though. Maybe I'll upload this review, if not just to relive the bad memory the next time I wonder\n"Wait, I 've reviewed games on Steam?"\n\nThat reminds me. This is supposed to be a review, not a blog to vent about my shortcomings in video games. FTL fun if you delude yourself into thinking that luck isn't the main deciding factor in runs. You always know deep down that it's something of an elaborate gamble. Sooner or later you'll remember, and it'll lose some of its appeal in gameplay. You'll see all of the beaconevents before too long, and every conceivable dramatic, emergent comeback or situation will occur to some degree if you play a bit longer. Once those lose their charm, it becomes harder and harder to come back to. At least it has for me.\n\nI suppose a ten dollar indie game doens't advertise infinite replayability, so you know what, I'm going to begrudgingly reccomend it despite coming in here to fervently denounce the game with the hopes that maybe my spite would be resolved if I was lucky enough to see the positive review percentage drop by a digit following my submission. I've had a lot of frustration with this game, but I think overall, if I look way back to 2012 (when good indie games were released on Steam on a regular basis, if anyone can imagine that.) I've gotten more out of it in fun than what it has taken from me in the form of torn out hair and swear jar change.","March 23","true","132.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A sci-fi, tactical, procedurally generated, customizable, spaceship game is something that I imagine quite a few people have been waiting for, even if they didn't realize it. The player takes the role of the crew of a small starship attempting to cover a certain distance of space to reach the Federation homeworld. The catch being that you are being pursued by rebel forces that are seeking to destroy you because you're carrying data that could result in the downfall of those forces. You jump from point to point interacting with rebel forces, pirates, science expeditions, galactic forces, etc., while attempting to maintian your position in front of the ever encroaching rebel force. Hijinks ensue.\n\nFTL is incredibly replayable, very challenging, rewarding, very engaging, and fun. For those who enjoy the genre it's a game that they will derive much enjoyment from, and for those who aren't sure of the genre, FTL is a great place to start. Great recommendation.","March 29","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's literally what it is; Star Trek: The Game.  Want to divert power from weapons into shields?  By gum, you can.  Want to use your scanners to avoid enemy ships?  A valid strategy!  Do you not take a deal with the Slugs because they tend to rip you off?  Well, depends on how much you need it.\n\nOfficially, FTL is a rouge-like-like.  Each round is short, usually playable in one sitting, and will vary from every other round immensely.  With fantastic music and brilliant story situations, I would highly recommend this to anyone that sees games above a simple entertainment venue as well as anyone who wanted to be Captain Kirk when they were a kid.  Both categories of people, and many more at that, will be completely satisfied.","June 23, 2014","true","42.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've always wanted to be a captain of my own ship and this game simulated it brillently. Being hunted by the rebals and low on fuel I was forced to steal some cargo from a civilian ship, That then later took a bite out of me as the rebals finally caught up because I made the mistake trying to take a short cut.
