The problem is that the characters are 2 dimensional, and the story, is by all means pretty terrible. While not trying to spoil it, the whole experience is a failed attempt at a guilt trip for the player character, constantly sputtering stuff about how this guy had a child, and now he's dead possibly because of you etc. etc.\nIt's guilt for something your character did before the game, the actual reasoning is pretty dull, and the girl whom you play, alex, is void of character, any real dialogue, any sense of personality, and any ability to relate as the game keeps going "Alex is a bad person" with no real resolution or thought behind it, with an ending that's just saying that again for no reason, because it hasn't been hammered home enough anyway.\n\nIts lack of focus on survival means that it fails as a simplistic but fun space survival romp a la gravity, but it's attempts at quiet moments and interesting story are far surpassed by its contemparary's such as Firewatch.\n\nIt's a real shame,\nwhat we have here is tech demo with so much potential,\nBad writing, bland repetitive design, and a 4-5 hour game length that really begins to drag on when the story fails to have any kind of redeeming value breaks something that leaves me with nothing but bitter disappointment.\n\nA lot of love clearly went in this game, sadly it seems it was wasted on a narrative thread that only comes off as pretentious by the end, I'm sorry game, I really wanted to like you, but I can't!","March 28","false","4.5"," 310 of 378 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","310","378","12","6"

On one hand the game is absolutely beautiful. Moving around the debris field of a crumbling space station while looking down at Earth is simply amazing looking. The animations of Alex reaching out at items, turning them around and just moving around the airlock all look fantastic. The lighting system in the game is amazing as well. Past the visuals however, I found the game to be pretty boring and empty feeling.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you traversing an extremely damaged space station in an EVA suit. Since it's zero-G you use thrusters and momentum to move you throughout the station. Your thrusters are powered by the Oxygen system of the suit, which you also need to... Y'know. Breathe. So throughout the ENTIRE game you have to manage your oxygen levels by constantly finding oxygen containers/stations. It can be a bit tedious but these containers/stations basically lay out the way you're supposed to go for the next objective so they are more than just life saving air. But at the same time the Oxygen meter always makes you feel rushed so you can't look at the amazing visuals.\n\nWhile moving through you'll find computers, audio logs and radio calls that fill in the story of what happened to the station and the interactions between characters. Even with these logs I never felt any profound connection to any of the characters. Which makes the entire game feel lifeless. Alex never talks other than a literal handful of words through the game, even though she's constantly in contact with base command trying to get her back home, even after fixing the relay that is supposed to allow her to talk to them.\n\nFor a game having such amazing visuals, I found the soundtrack and sound in general to just be pretty poor. I had a lot of popping in my speakers while playing throughout that I have never had before. At a few points in the game songs will just come out of nowhere. While these are okay for a minute or two, I had one song loop a 10-15 second loop for 30 minutes until I restarted the checkpoint. It really wore me down.\n\nThe one thing I was REALLY looking forward to was the quote I saw floating around a lot. "It's like being an astronaut!" It isn't at all though. You move from room to room pushing a button at a terminal that says, "Do you want to repair?" and it repairs itself. I was really looking forward to using some tools or something like that. But you just use a keyboard so it makes me wonder why Alex is even needed if it can all be fixed with a signal.\n\nThe game mainly consists of,\n\n1. Find colored disc\n2. Follow objective marker to another terminal/computer\n3. Gather oxygen and intel as you move\n4. Reach computer and put disc in or press button to upgrade suit\n5. Repeat\n\nPros:\nAmazing visuals\nThe movement of the EVA suit is fun but slightly clunky in spots\nReally great animation\nCons:\nShort, I completed it in just over 3 hours and don't really feel the need to play it again.\nDidn't care about the characters\nGameplay consists of just going to terminals and pressing a button\nOxygen meter forces you to feel rushed when you want to just look at how amazing the game is\nDoes NOT feel like being an astronaut","March 28","false","3.3"," 138 of 182 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","138","182","3","7"

However, the gameplay is monotonous and painfully slow. I realize for the sake of realism, you're not supposed to be flying around with crazy speed, but the overall pace of the game is at best relaxed and at worst, a maddening crawl.\n\nThe game basically consists of traversing a damaged space station in microgravity, repairing various sections of the ship in order to get the return vehicle operational and get home. Meanwhile, I suppose you're supposed to piece together what happened to the ship and the rest of the crew (more on that later). You also deal with your EVA suit problems by constantly hunting down O2, which is pretty much everywhere. The physics are relatively accurate, so that's a plus. Only thing that irked me there is that somehow electrical shocks translate into kinetic energy and knock you off course if you touch an exposed wire...?\n\nThe game mechanics, while extremely repetitive, were just as visually appealing as the scenery. I was hoping that eventually your suit would be repaired to the point you no longer needed to scrounge for oxygen, but that aspect of the game didn't bother me as much as it did other players. What confused me is that entire section of the game was devoted to repairing the communications array, but even after it was repaired, the player character still didn't speak. What's the point of fixing communications if you aren't going to talk to mission control?\n\nThe story(?) is buried in audio tapes and uninteresting emails that don't appear to make sense if you don't find and read/listen to them all. Despite finding a lot of them, I couldn't seem to see how any of the dialogue shed any light on the situation at hand. Most of the dialogue was bland and I found it difficult to relate to any of the characters. I didn't understand the end scene's dialogue in the slightest, probably because the poorly communicated storyline didn't register. I finished the game feeling like I wasted time trying to find a deeper backstory or plot that wasn't there, and I really don't want to have to play this game again to find it, given the repetitive nature of the gameplay.\n\nOverall, this is one of those games you'd love if you can manage the incredibly slow pace and are willing to deal with it to the point of collecting all the dialogue tapes and piecing together the story. I'm not a little kid who expects the game to play itself, but I have to draw a line somewhere. While I was initially excited by the incredible visuals and potential for a great story, I was let down when I couldn't find the latter.\n\nMy recommendation: don't play it unless you have a VR headset and it's on sale. The visuals are worth the $10 I paid when it was on a promotion, but IMHO, it's not worth much more than that, and would be better used as just a gimmick to introduce yourself or others to VR.","May 30","false","3.0"," 92 of 119 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","92","119","6","0"

(along with a load of other tiny nuisances). In addition the solution for the failed/unready lifeboats seems to be to reboot some computers which leads to 2 questions: Firstly why do the lifeboats depends on the station computers? And second why was such a boring mechanic chosen when the concept of repairing, reinforcing and macgyvering worked so well in The Martian and would have been a perfect fit here.\n\nThe map system is atrocious with the 3D world very poorly interpretted by the 2D map and objectives aren't actually marked - only the closest of a series of waypoints to follow which left me very confused about why they wanted me to backtrack away from the objective I had floated to (they wanted me to weeve in and out of some debris rather than jsut head straight past).\n\nThe mechanics are dreadful which leaves the experience as an interactive story but the story is so weak with the repetitive mechanics and fairly sparse character detail (the all alone feeling plays well until you realise that oxygen isn't an issue and you get bored rather than afraid and alone) kinda leaves it falling flat.\n\nAs an experience the first 40min is great, but as a game, a interactive story, or a piece of entertainment it falls flat soon after. Which is a shame because the underlying system is strong and a real opportunity was missed here by not giving it a more interesting story and a better set of gameplay objectives and mechanics.\n\nNoteably I also crashed every 20-30min although I was recording at the time so I'm not the best example on that.\n\nWasn't playing in VR although I doubt that'd fix my gripes.","April 2","false","5.6"," 102 of 139 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","102","139","8","1"

Traverse the haunting debris of your former space station as you carefully pilot your EVA suit on limited oxygen while unravelling  the story of what led to the destruction of your crew.\n\nPROSStunning visuals\nVery detailed game environment that simulates space and the damaged space station\nIncreasingly tense gameplay as you progress\nFree roam to complete the mission as you wish\n\nCONSShort gameplay\nNo puzzles or deep story content\nNo scripted action sequences\nCan be easy to get lost from one checkpoint to the next\n\nFRENCH PRESSED FULL CUP REVIEW\nI grew up in a rural town with an open sky and stars to stare at most nights; no city lights to drown them out.  When the moon was dark, it was the best thing about living outdoors.  You can look up for hours at the Milky Way Galaxy if you find it intriguing.  Constellations, planets, nebulae, the occasional shooting star - sparkling and pulsating with light in the empty blackness.  So, when playing Adr1ft I looked back the other way, down at the planet amidst the debris from the sky.  It was breaktaking until you realize you will die soon without oxygen and need to begin surviving. Yes, there is a game and story here but the real draw is being an astronaut stranded in that dark firmament.  In my opinion, this is Adr1ft's greatest achievement  - creating a game that gives me that same sudden gasp of captivation when lying on my back staring at the night sky.   The amount of thought and detail into making the environment realistic is astounding.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAfter a brief tutorial on how to move around in an EVA space suit, you start out as a lone surviving astronaut floating in the rubble of a catastrophic space station explosion.  The whole station is torn to pieces and scattered in a trailing jumble of plants, solar cells, insulation, and metal.  It’s your job to survive amidst this devastation and figure out a way to get back home.\n\nThe first order of business is getting oxygen.  There is plenty around, it’s grabbing it that takes some practice. I’d say it’s akin to catching a butterfly, except *i* am in the glass jar instead of the butterflies.  Often you are just shy of reaching it or you miss, overshoot, and pass right by it.  If you run out, you die and start over from the last checkpoint.  It’s not overly stressful, but it does require some patience to get good at grabbing oxygen.   It comes in little spray-can sized canisters, so an essential part of the gameplay is surviving from one tiny container of oxygen to the next unless you locate a oxygen fill up pump or an EVA repair station.  Time is always running out on your oxygen, so it’s constantly on your mind.  Not only is it needed to breathe, but it’s your only method of propulsion, so it really doesn’t last long before you need a refill.\n\nYou maneuver around what is left of the station and attempt to repair the cerebrum, it’s control center. I was hoping for some survival gaming with crafting materials or stockpiling oxygen, but that’s not the case.  It my opinion, the game doesn’t feel like you are meant to camp out, but to get the missions done and move on.  While it would be a neat add-on to the game, I think survival crafting would likely slow the game down to a crawl, drastically affecting the pacing.\n\nMissions are linear, but you have a free world to move about in to complete it.  At first, it was straightforward finding each checkpoint by using my little HUD on the screen and scanning for objects nearby.  At certain points, though, it’s easy to get lost in the debris.  The areas just look all too similar and you end up traveling through a labyrinth of space station sections with bits and pieces of data recordings and oxygen strewn about.  So, after awhile in each mission I got utterly lost.  The best way to figure out where I needed to go was drift up and check for something big or blinking that I probably had not visited yet.  Sometimes I made it there, other times I would run out of oxygen and die, restarting over again.  This isn’t too bad at first until you have to maneuver through dangerous areas, using up all your oxygen.  Traversing those areas is very fair, though, and it’s more a matter of me not driving my EVA suit carefully  than it is hard or frustrating.\n\nEach mission consisted of repairing a portion of the space station by activating something and then locating a data core to fix it up.  There were no puzzles that I encountered or major cut scenes that disrupt the game.  From what I see, this is a first person explorer game.  The actions of exploration and using the suit while trying not to die is the whole of the gameplay.  You come across audio data files, crew member personal items, and collectable SSD’s that give you insight into who your crew were and what your role was on the space station.  Towards the game’s end, the story becomes forefront as you find more audio files and listen at monitor login stations more often than before.  Crew personal items are floating about here and there, and if you are lucky you come across some to collect.  I found about half of the them, but I was expecting some personal notes to read once I obtained them - that didn’t happen.  All the personal moments came from the audio files and a few emails.  I’m guessing the personal items are  more for achievements, but I could be wrong.  The story is mostly conveyed through the extremely well voice acted dialogue on the voice recordings.\n\nGRAPHICS\nOften, despite my dangerous trek through my ninja-blendered space station, I’d stop and look at the Earth below.  It was stunning. Especially, the night scenes where you see all of Australia lit up like an LED Ikea lamp.  You could say this game is eye candy, and you’d be right.  I feel no shame is saying this game is worth playing just for the pretty factor.  It’s gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.  You may need to lower the settings a bit if your card cannot handle it, but I stuck my settings on high with my meager set up and enjoyed the scenery all the same.  As for crashes, I had only a few and it was at startup.  Once the game was rolling, at most I’d get a hiccup frame here or there.  I did notice several hiccups in framerate happened before my controller vibrated.\n\nCONTROLS\nI played this entirely with a Xbox 360 wireless controller; no issues to report. I’d venture to say it’s probably the better way to move about.  I wish I had a VR, this title SCREAMS play me in VR. With the immersive graphics, the single player movement, and motion of the EVA I would assume the VR look to the game is mind bending.\n\nSUMMARY\nI wish I could say more without giving anything away, but the game is not exactly long.  I’d say an average player would spend 5-7 hrs to complete this game.  I’m a slow-poke who also tends to explore a bit, so I took 10 hrs with a few hours AFK in there.  The EVA Free option without worrying about oxygen is there if you need it.  I enjoyed the interesting juxtaposition of the green, vibrant plants amid the station's destruction in the vacuum of space.  It was so striking to travel through the obliterated pieces of the station followed by the peaceful dance of leaves floating about; the live plants defying the inherent carnage around me.\nThe story is well acted, yet very sparse to the point of barely being there.  It’s all about exploring in an EVA suit and I think it hits the bullseye. Don’t expect a survival exploration crafting game or a giant fleshed out story exposition.  What you should be looking for is a short but beautiful game about surviving in a space station explosion.  If you have that in mind then this game is for you.  7.5/10.","April 24","true","10.8"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","39","50","0","15"

Think about it, in the last 20 years we have jumped from mostly sidescrolling, top-down, or isometric visualization to cutting edge visuals and satisfying gameplay. So many different games are thriving and dozens of different games have developed their distinct style, tone, story telling, presentation and what not. The market is spilling with dozens of great games -(and some bad apples among them).\n\nAdrift is quite original, putting you in the shoes suit of an Astronaut, lost and adrift in a crumbling space station floating above Earth, your task is to navigate the station amongst the beautful visuals, attempting to repower parts of the station, finding a way to escape the wreck and make your way home.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPros:\n\n+ exceptionaly great visuals\n+ original setting and premise\n+ effective, isolated and beautiful enviroment\n+ well crafted physics (as you would expect from a simulation-like game)\n+ good optimization (running on 'epic' at 60fps stable with a gtx 970)\n+ wide range of customizable graphics options\n+ works well with VR (proof of concept for VR)\n+ frequent checkpoints\n+ an interactive tutorial teaches you game mechanics\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCons:\n\n- controls not rebindable\n- backtracking will be necessary\n- navigation is confusing, the game does not provide clear navigation or update on objectives\n\n- the backdrop story of your fallen comrades does not have any impact (in part because of dissapointing voice acting and no reaction by the player)\n\n- suffers from the tedious A to B, while making sure that to pick up Y (flashlight batteries oxygen) to not die,  press X here for story\n\n- therefore not much tension in between as you may have witnessed in 'Gravity'\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\ntl;dr\n\nIn short it can and will be described as having some story sprinkled throughout while drifting through beautfiful space and gazing upon our beautful earth. It is another case where I'm dissapointed I can only upvote or downvote.\n\nIs it worth 20$ - it's up to you to decide that. I enjoyed it for the most part and recommend it.

Finished Adr1ft (VR version--Oculus Rift DK2) last night and dreamt in zero-gee all night--some part of my brain was utterly convinced that I had just returned from space.\n\nThis is easily the best VR experience I've ever had. It's a perfect marriage of setting (microgravity) and medium (VR). The gameplay really comes down to just learning to orient and navigate in zero-gee. No shooting, no saving-the-earth-from-aliens, very little typical videogame BS overlaid on the experience. More than anything, it's a spacesuit simulator, in one of the most visually and auditorily stunning environments ever created for a game.\n\nThe story is subtle, fragmented, revealed in perfectly bite-sized pieces. In the end it has a similar effect to the game mechanic--it leaves you feeling disoriented, perhaps a little upset, definitely transported into another person's life.\n\nAdr1ft feels like the first game to define the possibilities of a new platform, or even a new medium entirely. The comparisons that come to mind to me are Blade Runner, the nineties CD-ROM game which finally did something with that much-abused technology, and Ico, the PS2 title that showed that a console game could have depth through the sheer force of its gameplay, pacing, and environmental design.\n\nIf you have access to a VR headset you have to try it. Yes, you might get a little sick at first--it happens to real astronauts, too--but hang in there, that's part of the challenge. Eventually you get your space-legs, and then it happens, you get to live every child's dream of being an astronaut. Afterward, when you're out of the headset and back home, your conscious mind may tell you that you were only playing a game, but your dreams will tell the truth--you were there, in space.","March 30","true","5.5"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","31","44","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/recommended/300060/","himmatsj","himmatsj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/","138 products in account","Adr1ft was one of my most eagerly anticipated games of 2016. I am a huge fan of the First Person Experience genre and have played almost all of the major games of the genre (such as SOMA, Firewatch etc) in the recent past.\n\nSadly I must say, I think I hoped for too much. The game is not at the level I expected it to be. There is a compelling lack of narrative or action.\n\nAdr1ft is less similar to Gravity (the movie) than it is to Gone Home. Make no mistake, there is much more interactivity here and some actual gameplay mechanics (such as collecting oxygen tanks to stay alive) as compared to Gone Home, but at the end of the day, on a 0-100 scale, I would say it tends to Gone Home more on the lower end of that scale.\n\nThere is no real actual narrative, aside from collecting audio logs that shed light on the backstory of the characters on the station. You have to do 4 missions to restore your EVAC vehicle. All those 4 missions are the same thing. I was really surprised. There are no action scenes. The oxygen tank mechanic is actually something I felt irritated with, cause when you "die" you have to restart from a previous checkpoint and it just seemed immersion-breaking. The navigation is really disorientating (maybe it was designed this way intentionally, so I give them the benefit of the doubt).\n\nAdr1ft does do some things correctly. I think the atmosphere is spot-on. I didn't play in VR, but the visuals and physics felt decent. I did feel "heavy" myself after playing the game due to the floaty nature of gravity in space. The optimization of the game is fair I'd say - not particularly outstanding, but not outright terrible either. Expect to take around 4-5 hours to complete on your first run, or maybe more if you get lost while navigating around.\n\nAdr1ft isn't a bad game per se, but it didn't manage to meet my expectations. This could have been so much more. From a narrative perspective especially, I think the devs could have tried harder. Perhaps, I could say this isn't worth $20. But do get it once it hits half of that price or lower.","March 30","true","6.3"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","25","38","0","3"

It puts you alone, floating high above the Earth. Oddly for a game that has you fighting for each breath, it also given you room to breathe and to think. It's not so much about filling the game world with things to do, but instead tells a story that encourages reflection on things you have done. The sensation of floating in space is truly awe inspiring. Even on the DK2, looking down at Earth as you hang in the void of Space is an amazing site.\n\nAdmittedly I'm only half way through, but so far the game is a joy.

Unreal 4 really shines in this title, with the exception of draw distances and pop-ins, it looks nearly flawless. Just floating around and staring at the Earth was one of my favorite things to do. Textures are really good too.\n\nThe Physics worked really well. If you ran into something, it would push it away and crash into other floating objects. Sometimes when I really needed oxygen I would be speeding to it trying to grab it, and just knock it further away from my grasp.\n\nThe controls were one of my favorite parts. I played it with an xbox 360 controller and it felt really smooth. I became an EVA expert (or so I thought) in a matter of minutes. I didn't use  MKB, but I'm sure it works fine.\n\nThe Survivability aspect was simple, but kept you on the edge. There are floating oxygen tanks around the map, and eventually you unlock charging stations for your suit. At some points, you had to decide whether to go the longer, safe way around, or take a shortcut and risk running out of Oxygen before you make it to your objective. Also, the further you get into the game, the more things on your suit you repair. So there is a sense of progression besides just getting closer to the end.\n\nThe voice acting was very good. I wasn't expecting there to be much voice acting or really much of a story, but I was thourghly surprised.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\nThe Story was good, and I enjoyed listening to the recordings scattered around the map. However, you kind of have to piecemail the plot together to get the full picture. Since there is some backtracking and repeated visits to locations, it's difficult to orgranize everything. And since the game trys to be simple, there isn't an inventory menu to keep track of stuff. However, you will get "random" transmissions during certain points in the story that will include messages from Houston, personal excerpts from your crew, and instructions from your commanding officer. On top of this, I wasn't a fan of the ending and lack of a real climax. It was a little too safe for my taste.\n\nThe minimap. I kind of hated it. I think a 3D minimap is hard to create, but having a 2D map in a 3D landscape is hard to read. This includes the rest of the HUD, which is cool to have, but sometimes I wish I had some sort of "select" button to access a bigger map and objectives. But maybe confusion is just part of the immersion ;)\n\nDo I recommend?:\n\nAll in all, I liked it a lot. It's a pretty short game, and has some imperfections, but I felt like I got a great experience for the money. I would love to play this game in VR one day to truly expericnce it, and for those of you like me that still game the old fashioned way, I do recommend this game once it hits a sale. But you won't feel gypped if you purchase it for full price :)","March 31","true","3.0"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

Adr1ft is a beautiful but slow-paced space adventure,  with a lil' bit of a story, set on a futuristic ISS in the year 2034 where things have gone totally wrong. Unfortunately there's no introduction / intro video at all. Also O2 is pretty rare in space, but the broken space station in Adr1ft has plenty of it floating - steady - everywhere. Another downer for me was the fact that I didn't got the scary feeling of I am in outta space (e.g. ELITE: Dangerous), and I am afraid of heights... And last and least, i ran into two problems; 1st: "It often felt like I already did that before." & [/i]2nd:[/i] "The astronaut's movement strongly reminds on <wire loop>*, but you are the wire."

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/recommended/300060/","Azralynn","Azralynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/","472 products in account","ADR1FT is an atmospheric space walking simulator where you are stranded in space, and must find a way to survive and get back home.\n\nCheck out my Quick Game Review here: https://youtu.be/gl5CAj3jVu4\nThe game is meant to be played using VR, but VIVE is not available yet, so I played without using VR. The game focuses a lot on having a stunning environment. The inside of the stations are very nice looking. I love the beads of water just floating around inside, it looks so neat. The visuals are absolutely beautiful outside of the station, and everything looks so pretty.\n\nThe game plays like a walking simulator, except, it’s in space. The zero gravity requires you to move in all directions to keep yourself from bumping into things. If you bump into anything, your helmet becomes cracked, and if you bump into things too often, it will start leaking oxygen at a faster rate. If you run out of oxygen, you suffocate and die. I like the idea of the suit becoming damaged because it forces you to maneuver yourself more accurately, but I wish they had made it so that it takes your velocity, and the location of impact into account. It makes no sense that my helmet becomes cracked if I slowly descend, and bump my feet.\n\nAs you use your thrusters to move around, you will consume your oxygen faster, so you have to grab fresh oxygen canisters or refill at an oxygen station. When you are floating from one part of the station to another, oxygen is consumed faster out in the open. I like that there is some importance in getting new oxygen, but the canisters are so plentiful, as long as you don’t spam your thrusters, it doesn’t usually become an issue.\n\nPros:some VR capability, and full controller support\ngorgeous graphics, and a very beautiful, immersive environment (this is the main focus of the game, and the main reason to play it, and they did a fantastic job with it)\nvoice acting in the audio logs, and ambience sounds are well done\na separate game mode that unlocks after you complete the main story, where your oxygen doesn’t deplete, so you can take all the time you want to explore and enjoy the graphics\nCons:VIVE support won't be available until May 2016\ncontrols are not customizable (most people will be fine with the defaults) movement feels a bit awkward in small areas when trying to grab items\nhorrible music in many parts of the game that actually take away from the immersive experience (you will want to turn this down or mute it completely)\nreally annoying beeping sounds when you are outside the station and losing oxygen faster (even if you have full oxygen, it beeps the whole damn time you're outside)\nstory was bland - basically, you are stranded in space, you have to fix things, and try to get home\nlack of connection to the characters\nhelmet cracks when ANY part of you hits things, even at super slow speeds\nmap indicators aren't always clear about which way to go to get to the objective\nI would have liked more backstory via audio and video log files. In a world so beautiful and immersive, I found it really hard make a connection with any of the characters. I didn’t learn enough to care about the crew or even the character that I was playing - she never speaks or reacts to any of the information I discover, so why should I care if even the character I'm playing doesn’t seem to?\n\nThe main story took me just over 5 hours, but it would have been shorter if I didn’t get stuck. The map indicators were telling me where the objective was, but not how to get there, so I got lost outside, and didn’t know how to get back in.\n\nI can’t see wanting to replay the main story, but ADR1FT does have a bunch of achievements for finding various items, and with the infinite oxygen mode, I will be playing the game again when the VIVE is compatible to explore more and check out the beautiful environment in VR.\n\nThe game is too short for the cost. Even though it was such a beautiful game, with the lack of connection to the characters, and the dull story, I would suggest waiting for a decent sale.","April 3","true","5.7"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","30","49","2","3"

As an experience it's hard to match, but if you strip it down it's super basic\n\nThe visuals are stunning, Genuinly jaw dropping if you have a facination with space.\nThe gameplay is quite simple, go to each of the 4 cores and fix them then return to the central hub.\nAll the while refilling your Air supply (that you have to use for movement & breathing) and not smashing your delicate suit. The air is quite abundant so you rarely feel criticaly rushed but always urged to keep moving, The only real danger is the Electricity capacitors you encounter that send you flying AND drain a chunk of your air reserve.\nGetting lost/confused can be an issue but with the mini map & computers back in the hub what you need to do is well indicated you just kind of dont always see it.\nPlot is slim & told via audio logs/computer terminals. It's servicable but I didn't pay much attention to the back story.\nCharacter movement is slick & smooth with a nice feel once you get to grips with the 6 way movement.\n\nDespite it's simple gameplay ADR1FT is well worth the experience and I highly reccomend it if it sounds like your kind of game. It's not action, It's not guns it's simply the best spacewalking sim out there...\n","April 30","true","6.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The navigation with six degrees of freedom can be confusing but the game cleverly minimizes problems. Even the simple narrative meshes well with the theme and game speed. Like the first spacewalk in history, it is not without problems; in this case, the simple and repetitive tasks, bizarre audio log mishaps, and occasional disorientation. It might be too slow for some, but the spacewalk experience is soothing even under the constant threat of suffocation. Listening to a Beethoven sonata as you drift away from the safety of a space module is relaxing and facilitates introspection. ADR1FT’s careful design and basic mechanics will earn lasting respect after you come back down to earth.\n\nRead full review[www.newgamenetwork.com]","April 4","true","6.0"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","2"

I was anticipating this release after building a new computer. I wanted something with beautiful graphics to see just how well the new computer could handle it.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that I do run 3 24" monitors on an eyefinity setup. There is no support for this so far. I run at a 1920 1080 resolution and all 3 monitors will display the same. If I make the resolution bigger, I can stretch to the end of all three but I lose quite a bit off the top and bottom. mainly the hud.\n\nAfter 2 hours of playing I feel as if I haven't accomplished much. This is a game of patience. You slowly drift around the wreckage of a space station. It takes a while to get used to navigating. You're in zero gravity, you can easily get disoriented (not a complaint there).\n\nAll in all, it's beautiful. Listening to the audio is entertaining while drifting to your next location. Reading emails on the computer system is a little boring. Its a nice new concept of a game. A nice change of pace from the mainstream shooters, racing. strategy, and rpg games.\n\nBest part of all, $19.99 for a game just released?!?!?! Are you kidding me? Thats a frickin deal! If they release the capabilities to utilize eyefinity on a later patch I would be estatic. I already find myself holding my breath when I am looking for more oxygen, and being fully submerged into a 3 monitor setup would take the feel of this game to a whole new level.\n\nSo if you need a game that would be a nice change of pace, I recommend this.","March 31","true","5.0"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

It really is a visual feast and I felt the game (using a monitor) really gave a great sense of awe and scope.  If I can grab a VR set in the future, I very much look forward to playing this game again using them.\n\nWith regards to the controls, a lot of other reviews have stated a clunky feeling.  I used a contoller for my playthrough, and it was quite a nice feeling.  The force feedback was used well and contributed to the sense of environment.  I also found the analog sticks and triggers worked very nicely with the slower more precise form of maneuvering required for this game.  I cannot speak for mouse and keyboard users.\n\nThe sound design was strange, imo.  Most of the time, atmospherically, it was fantastic.  Other times the music was forced upon you and it could be very disjointed, almost headache inducing.  With the inability to disable music in the main options, this was a disappointment.\n\nI really enjoyed what was available regarding the characters and story, but I won't speak to details so I don't ruin any spoilers.  I will simply say, I really wish they had gone a bit deeper, using a bit more creativity with regards to interactivity with the station and crew.\n\nA victim of their own amazing design, in the sense that so much more could have been achieved with this concept, Adr1ft still provides a very interesting and otherworldly experience that any space or science fiction fan could enjoy.","March 30","true","6.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

I'm actually amazed this was such a big issue for some that the developers had to make a unlimited oxygen option.\n\nAnyways i digress. My Thoughts: The game is beautiful, the story is rich, the voice acting is superb, i was very much invested in what shi* went down here.

It was a very unique experience, but unfortunately, a flawed one.\n\nMany people romanticise the state of weightlessness as something pleasant, magical, similar to flying. The truth is - the sensation is rather disorienting - you are not "weightless" as much as you are in a state of constant free-fall. Think of these brief moments on the airplane commonly known as "catching an air pocket", or going down in an express elevator. Now multiply it by a 1000. That's about it. Non-stop. Your inner ear confused, not sure where's up and where's down.\n\nADR1FT certainly sells this feeling perfectly. Playing on an HMD I was constantly disoriented, slightly nauseous - nudging myself in the general intended direction but mostly out of control. I’d guess many players won’t be able to stomach the sensation for longer stretches of time - personally I am glad to have played it, but I won’t be opening the title again.\n\nThe art direction is phenomenal. The damaged space station orbiting above Earth, the contrast of scattered debris against hermetic interiors - the game is a looker. The voice logs are intriguing enough, well recorded and varied. There are also text logs - but I have to admit - I did not read any. Primarily - since you are constantly running out of oxygen and I did not want to waste time. Secondly - reading text on an HMD is not very pleasant.\n\nMy two big problems with the game are the repetitive gameplay and navigation system. I didn’t discover the navigation (lower-left of the HUD) until well into the game, and until the very end I did not fully understand it’s UI. Additionally, deviating from the plotted path will mess up the navigation, so going around a checkpoint will direct you all the way back to it even if you are at your goal. A more adaptive system would be great as I found myself dying multiple times simply because I could not read the directions.\n\nThe gameplay brings “Doom” to mind. 4 colored sections, each needs a colored key card. Sorry. Colored “core”. Navigate to the fabrication station. Fabricate core. Come back to the central hub. Insert core. Repeat 4 times. You’re saved.\n\nVR is a young medium and there certainly are still many many lessons to be learned. ADR1FT is an awesome early effort - well worth the price of admission if you can stomach the simulation sickness and don’t mind suspending your disbelief of space station engineering in order to experience something truly new and different.","March 30","true","4.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It really needed something else to break up the constant slow passed travelling from section to section, like a simple puzzle each time you fabricated a new core or something catastrophic occuring. However in saying that, the experience of Adrift is a hauntingly beautiful one that only becomes more and more nightmarish as the story progresses to the point where you wonder, for the character, if it was all worth it in the end. If you’re looking for a game that provides that Gravity experience that puts you on a space station than Adrift may be what you’re looking for, if you were expecting a more high tense desperate game in space, Adrift doesn’t really provide that.","April 7","true","3.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Equipped with only the oxygen consuming thrusters your suit, you're propelling yourself about in zero gravity looking for other suvivors and clues to what happened, before hopefully finding a way to get back home.\n\nI guess you can call it a first person survial game with only 1 resource type (Oxygen), which comes in 2 shapes: Canisters floating about and wall mounted oxygen dispensers.\n\nSo the core gameplay boils down to controlling your thrusters precisely (or die quickly) and efficiently (or die slowly) while solving the only real puzzle this game has to offer: Figuring out where the F... the 2D indicator wants you to go in 3D in order to reach the next mission objective. At first it's very straight forward, but towards the end of the game there's one part in particular where I wasted over 30 minutes doing something that in retrospect is comedy gold, simply because the game failed to convey what I was supposed to do. I didn't have the capacity to find it amusing at the time.\n\nI know I suck, and that I should just "git gud", but looking at forums, youtube walkthroughs, and review sites, I am one of MANY!\n\nThe one big thing this title has going for it is the presentaion. It's looks GREAT, and the atmosphere is perfect and if it wasn't for some technical problems it is a VERY immersive experience. It has a "Intense" VR rating on Oculus home, and I've read many complain about nausea, but despite definitely NOT being immune to "VR sickness", I actually found this game pleasantly relaxing.\n\nSound effects and voice acting is excellent, and while I enjoyed the atmospheric ambient music, I reckon the monotony of it might annoy some.\n\nThe 3D engine performs poorly on two accounts:\n\n-Framerate. I got a I7 2600k@4.7ghz and GTX980TI and this game has LOTS of dips FAR below 90hz. It's VERY apparent, and only tolerable due to the great asynchronous time warp implementation in the Oculus SDK/runtime.\n\n-The dynamic LOD implementation. It's just way too crude, which is VERY apparent when outside the spacestation. I literally had HUGE spacestation debris chunks appear from out of nothing in an instant (taking up like 10-15% of my FOV).\n\n\nThe game took me a little under 4 hours, including said involuntary detour. (Started in steam, finished in Oculus home version).\n\nI'm pretty undecided about this game. It has so many flaws, yet offers an experience that I feel like repeating once the technical issues are settled.\n\nI'm giving it 65%, but there's potential for so much more.","April 20","true","1.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This is a space VR tech demo disguised as a walking simulator, there is no gameplay other than pressing buttons to progress. I played through the entire thing in one sitting and it took 4 hours. That being said it can still be confusing at times (mainly due to 2D compass).\n\nAlso, while the game has fantastic art assets and sound, the music is absolutely terrible. It's not the ambient tracks that kill it, it's the god-awful 30 seconds obvious looping techno music that pounds into your ear drums at nonsensical times and can not be turned off. Never before has video game music made my head hurt. The music is so terrible I almost refunded the game before I finished it, thankfully the horrible noise can be snuffed out by completing certain objectives. Once I disocvered this fact racing to turn off the music became more pressing than finding oxygen.\n\nIf you're anything like me, the ending will leave you pretty indifferent, as the story doesn't really build to a proper climax and the only reason to play the game again would be to show off the graphics to your friends or collect all the audio logs and misc. garbage. I like the little universe they established here but it's really only a snapshot.\n\nOverall it's an OK game, it makes me wish other space games had the attention to detail, immersion, and cool aesthetic. This game's ability to create a realistic feeling outer space experience is why I recommend it, because it's uncommonly good in that regard. (it's nice to have a space game in my collection with mostly realistic sound)\n\nHere's the question you have to ask yourself: is going "woah cool" to yourself a few times over the course of 3 hours worth 20 dollars?","March 30","true","6.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Basically you have to fly around repairing your suit and various systems of the station - if that sounds appealing you should enjoy this. That said there is no logic to the plot or the mechanics - everything is contrived for gameplay reasons, and you have to be willing to look beyond that. The biggest problem everyone seems to have is that this deserves to be a AAA game with the polish and action of Call of Duty - but it isn't, so everyone comes away feeling underwhelmed.\n\nThere is a mp shooter called Shattered Horizon that is pretty similar in theme so check that if you want a shooter.\n\nMusic is pretty jarring and the audio levels break the immersion [being fixed]\nThere are no control issues (with keyboard at least)\n2D radar is pretty dumb (elite got this right in the 80's with a vertical line to indicate up/down)","March 29","true","4.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Looks great, runs great, really flows well. It's linear and always tells you where to go, but since you do play as someone intimately familiar with the location, that makes sense. Lots of influence from 2001, Gravity, Alien, and the EVA sequences from the Dead Space titles. According to Steam clock i'm like 3 hours in, but i think it's more - maybe 4?

As a foreword, I will be updating this review as I am further in the game and/or have beat the game.  But first thing's first:  This game dropped my jaw from the title menu.  A true showcase for VR.  This makes such wonderful use of the 3D imaging within the R1ft while having stunning and atmospheric graphics and sound design - all leading to some of the best immersion you can imagine.\nIn regard to comfort while playing this game in VR, it can be intense during particular cinematic when you are not necessarily in control of the movement you experience.  In these moments, if you're becoming sick, you can hold B on the controller and all but just the very center of your view becomes obscured reducing almost all sense of movement.  During regular gameplay I rarely felt uneasy.  The only times are when you hold X to interact with a computer screen and the movement brings you very close to a screen very quickly which made me cringe once or twice.\nWill update further down the road.

I don\'t understand why it gets so many negative reviews beeing it is very well made. You can see that a lot of effort was put into it\'s development and it definatelly paid off. True, it\'s not action packed, there is no heroic hero not looking back at explosions nor epic car chases but those were not the goals here. This game provides amazing and immersive experience of beeing in space, while keeping you busy trying to survive catastrophic event on the orbital station you are at. There is also a background story which highlights lifes of crew members of the station and chain of events that lead to the accident. And while I have not played it with VR i can see this games positive rating would triple if only more people had an opportunity to try it, as this game was obviously made to enjoy it the most in VR.

I played using the Oculus DK 2, and I must say.. it was incredible. At points I actually found myself taking in a big gulp of air... like the lack of oxygen is actually effecting me :P\n\nHowever, there is a reason I don't recommend this game to the average player..\n\nPROS\n\nExcellent VR: There are some issues where small debre seems to float straight through your visor, however the overall feel is great. After a few hours of playing I needed a break as my stomach was starting to turn a little, but I soon got back into it after a bite to eat.\n\nAudio acting: Brilliant, just brilliant, you really start to connect to the people you once worked along side.\n\nCONS\n\nOk, technically there are more cons than there are pro's which is why I can only recommend this to players with a VR headset, simply for the experience.\n\nStory: I'm sorry, but the story was aweful.. without spoiling it, you get through this game wishing you hadn't.\n\nSurvival: There are 2 survival elements to this game. ONE not dying due to lack of oxygen, and TWO, not dying through failure of suit degradation. There's simply O2 everywhere and after the first part of the game is complete, you have more than enough to last you till you get to a station where there is an UNLIMITED supply.\n\nLength: 3-4 hours play time max. I only have 6 because of AFK time.\n\nCopy and paste: There are 4 main tasks.. they're all the same essentially. Find this, do that.. all they do is throw debre at you or expose some wires to give you a taste of something different. In all honesty I only finished playing just to find out how it all ends, and I was so immursed with the Oculus I wanted to get myself back to earth and to safety.\n\nNothing made sense: So your suit is damaged when you start the game, not long into the game you find a suit repair station, which... doesn't sort 4 of your major systems out. You need to complete a task in order to unlock the repair for that component, but why? YOU'RE AT A SUIT REPAIR STATION!!. Also, why is my suit constantly losing o2 out in space, but in a station, where windows are broken and venting any kind of atmosphere, I lose next to nothing?? Why are there o2 canisters everywhere on a station with an atmosphere? Why is everyone else dead, yet in their EVA suits... Why are they even in their EVA suits??\n\n\nOverall, this is a great game experience for VR users. I thought it was incredible, and that forgave allot. Enough for me to recommend it. However, it's definetely not worth the price, especially for non VR users. I'm sure plenty of people will still buy and like the game, however, I know now having completed it in 6 hours, that I would not be happy without the Rift.","April 16","true","6.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

After a time though, I feel like I need to hurl chunks.   Your mileage may vary.  It's probably "moderate" on the comfort scale.\n\nThere are options built in to help you recover from nausea when needed, and they helped.  A little.  But not in time.  I need a new keyboard.\n\nThe sets are decent... lighting is above average.\n\nIt's a VR toy in my view... and a good way to introduce friends to VR.","March 29","true","9.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Don't own an Oculus, so I can't say what that's like, but floating around in space, looking for the stories left behind by the crew, trying to piece it all together, that's pretty cool.\n\nI felt completely lost at first. No idea what to do. Just kinda felt my way through the game, totally unsure what to do. The more I played, the more I got it. The more I got it, the more fun I had. Some people have complained about the repetitiveness of the objectives, and I mean, I guess, sure? But it honestly doesn't stick out too much when I'm actually playing the game. I'm way too focused on trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B without running out of oxygen. Should I take the riskier route with no clear oxygen supplementation? Would it be better if I stuck to the path? It seems like there are things to get that can't be obtained just by following the main path, so there's a bit of a worry there.\n\nIt's well written, too. The audio logs and stuff are great; the emails are even better. For $20, it's totally worth the price of admission. It makes me want to get an Oculus so I can replay the whole thing in VR. The game is seriously breathtaking, and one of the best-looking games I've seen in years.\n\nSo, yeah, I could say the game's a must have "for a VR game," which is something that could be said for plenty of VR games, but Adr1ft is better than that. It's a game that let me be in space, even on my 27" monitor. It's a game that actually does what walking sims try to do that actually works. It's a game with some really cool environmental storytelling (keep an eye out for the Puerto Rican flag ;D) and a pretty cool story on its own. I've played a lot of bad FPX/walking sim type games over the years. Adr1ft is the only one that ever sucked me in like this.\n\nOnly real complaints I have are that bumping into stuff seems to do a lot of damage, and sometimes I grab things that I think I should be able to grab, but apparently I don't, but those are pretty minor complaints. In general, I'd recommend you play Adr1ft, even if you don't have a VR headset.\n\nDisclaimer: I bought the game myself from iam8bit, but then received a key from the developers prior to receiving my purchased key.","April 8","true","5.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

So if you want to know the story of the game, read all the E-mails and find all personal logs. You'll learn about the characters and story at the same time. That's where the game gives the + side to the story, makes the player engage and interact with the environment to learn about what's going on and what happened.\n\nPROS & CONS\nPros:\n\n+ Amazing visuals\n+beautiful enviroment\n+ optimization. I'm playing with AMD FX-6300 and a GTX 970. 60 FPS with an ocasional drop to about 50 to 55.\n+ lots of graphical options\n+ plenty of checkpoints\n+ tutorial teaches you how to play and work with the mechanics of the game.\n+ Sound design is amazing! I\n\n\nCons:\n\n- You can't rebind the controls.\n- navigation is confusing, I feel it should be more clear on where to go.\n- Story/characters are forgettable, besides your own.\n- A to B, progression while making sure you pick up oxygen so you don't die.\n- lack of stress and tension. (no real threat of dying or debris flying at high speeds towards you every X amount of minutes)\n\nRATING\nMy rating would be 7/10.\n\nIf they updated the game where Oxygen tanks were harder to find and they made some sort of debris field orbiting the earth and hitting the station every 10 or 15 minutes so you have a higher risk of dying or your EVA suit being damaged and leaking more oxygen..then it would get a higher score of about 8.5.\n\nTL;DR\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. The $19.99 price tag isn't that expensive, if they asked $39.99 I would say buy it on sale but seeing how it's only 20 dollars I recommend you pick it up.\nWould I replay it to get all achievements and hidden gems? Yes.\nStory is okay.\nGame looks great, runs great.\n\nGreat solid game with some what of bland characters that don't really matter.","March 30","true","6.3"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","12","21","2","0"

Was really excited to play this since I love space and the idea of surviving a disaster on a space station sounded interesting. But I cannot recommend this game. All you do is float from one spot to the other and click on things. There are no puzzles or real challenges. Oxygen is so prevalent, that it is never an issue. The only challenge to this game is knowing what you are supposed to do and where you are supposed to go. It boils down to being told some random thing is broken, you have to fix it for some reason, and you have to gallivant off to the other side of the space wreckage to get a part to fix it. Rinse and repeat. The direction indicator on your visor that lets you know where to go is a 2D circle with arrows on it. You are floating in 3D space. I found the 2D indicator on where to travel in 3D space to be almost useless. Don't tell me to turn left or right when it is off in another direction altogether. Give me the actual vector! After following the arrows, avoiding massive electrical arcs along the way, to only arrive full circle where I started, making no progress, to be a huge pain. I was often lost and didn't know where to go or why. And why should I care? I'm bored out of my mind. There are no real challenges besides navigation. The emails and voice logs are entirely uninteresting. The whole thing is extremely repetitive. Don't bother.\n\nOh, and how is it that every floating piece of space debris is powered and sparking? Is there a power plant every 2 feet?","June 4","false","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

During the game you can repair your suit bit by bit by achieving some goals and finally take the emergency shuttle to earth. The problem of this is that the goal is always the same. Insert a core module into a computer and go on with the next module.\n\nAlso the space station rooms are lacking of variety:\nAs the player you get the feeling that you have seen this part of the space station already. If I wouldn't have had the radar I would have been totally lost in space as orientation with space modules like this is really hard. Sometime I was really struggling with the radar as it was turning in one direction and then imediately in the other direction until I finally realized that the way to go was directly over my head. Perhaps the developers can do something about this problem.\n\nOculus Support:\nI bought this game as I wanted to play it on my Oculus DK2. As the movements from the camera are partly executed by a game script animation I was getting always terribly sick. Especially rotational movements and movements from the game animation (opening doors, refueling oxygen, going to a computer terminal) were the source of this. Finally I was very happy to see that the game is also playable without my rift. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have achieved the end.\n\nStory:\nAlso from the Story I missed a lot of things. When I passed almost two thirds of the game I realized that I was totally missing the oportunity to scan the rooms. as I thought the audio recorders that you spot when opening the doors are everything that you can spot, but there's a lot more like computer terminals (not the ones you need to pass for completing game goals= or personal rooms of the crew are stuffed with things you can enjoy and find out more about the story. One of the things that might be improved is when you finish the game that you can read through everything and listen to all audio from the game again if you want without having the need in floating around again.\n\nTo sum this up:\nIf you are a gamer enjoying in floating around space and discover story elements without thinking about using your Oculus Rift I would recomment this game for you. Also the price of the game is reasonable as the play time is about 4 hours (I needed 6.4 hours). But what I like to see is more variety and challenges. Not that the oxygen levels are reduced like others claim as this would kill the discovery approach as users were forced to rush through the game but instead having more goals despite inserting just cores and continue with this job.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying a game specifically for the Oculus Rift go ahead and buy Chronos. Absolutely worth the price and made for VR as you are not getting sick like with this game.","April 2","true","6.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mind you, narration is very minimal if not almost non-existent, those tips & stories you are able to find from items you interact are absolutely optional and have almost no impact on the game other than your playing experience and is non-engaging. But since it's cheap and i'm able to play it without VR.

Its a beautiful, yet haunting experience that allows you to see what it is like to float around in space.  Its pacing is slow which is perfect for this type of game as you take more time to find audio clips and read computer terminals to learn more about your situation.   The quickly depleting oxygen reserves is a great way of adding stress to to keep the game interesting, but there is enough oxygen tanks floating around so the player DOES has freedom to explore.  The one problem I had with this game is the navigation, and though there is a map with waypoints, it is hard to determine if the direction you are going is the right way.\n\n\nPROS:\n-Great visuals\n-Unique style gameplay\n-Mix of fast and slow pacing to keep the game interesting\n\nCONS:\n-Navigation can be difficult\n\nCONCLUSION:   Overall I would give this game an 9/10   It is very versatille and can be engaging to those who love FPS games as well as those who prefere strategy and or puzzles.

You want a game that makes you feel like you are really in space? Buy this. Seriously.\n\nAlot of kids won't like it, they are used to running around with a gun in FPS shooting things and constantly keeping their characters darting around. This takes that all away from them in one fell swoop.\n\nBad music? sorry didn't bother me at all,some classical music? it was nice to listen to as I floated throught the void,  there was not alot of sound either, but I would hope not in a realistic  Space simulation.\n\nPros:\n\nI have heard some call this game a "Tech Demo" but that is not really fair. It is a game based around being in EVA and for doing that, it gets 11/10. It beats anything I've played with an EVA.. the water bubbles, the tree in side.. wow.. and im not even using VR.\n\nOxygen is so easy to get the game is not really difficult, which is good because you spend most of the time looking around going "oooh... ahhhh"\n\nCons:\n\nI have only gotten the first cerebrum, so I guess by the looks of it I need 2 or 3 more and the game will be over, which is a little predictable and sort of dissapointing I guess. So I repeat the same mission 3 times and that's pretty much the game - sounds small right? well, its a very slow paced game. Looking at reviews I assume about 4 hours play tops. Free EVA is sorta ok, turbo boosters would be nice.\n\nOnly gripe with texturing at 4K resolution, the earth has some holes in it and you can see the ocean under the earth layer, but other than that it really is a unique game. Yes it is totally worth the money, even just to float into that med bay with the glass bottles and water droplets suspended in zero gravity.\n\nVery few controls, can't seem to find a key for external view of my character like i've seen in screenshots.","April 16","true","4.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You have little clue of what's going on or who you are in the first instances of the game and love that mystery. Visually the game is absolutely gorgeous. The best use of the Unreal Engine 4.

You have to head to the accomodation wing and repair the suit, then proceed to find your way home.\n\nGameplay\nThe overall game is extremely short, in fact there is an achievement for completing it in under two hours. To achieve that goal you wont be hanging around taking in the storyline or farming the collectibles and will probably most likely have to gain some experience in movement over several playthroughs.\n\nThis does not mean that you cant simply relax and take your time either, as there is also achievements for completing the game in full or in a longer time frame.\n\nDo not purchase this game thinking that you are going to be obtaining space lasers and shooting enemies, your the sole survivor of the accident and your mission is too get home. Space command requires you follow protocols of course meaning that the core games missions are of a reparing nature in order to back up data from the crash.\n\nEach of the four systems, require a three prong repair, completing these results in one of the four suits functions being fully repaired along the way. Whilst the princple behind each of the four sets is the same, there are variations between them.\n\nThe games largest selling point is in the experience to be had, and sure whilst its a quick affair and short lived storyline, over time you will begin to appreicate what this game offers and is indeed about...\n\nSpace\n\n\nMy Computer Specs (average 60fps) ...

It's a glorified Tech Demo. On one hand the graphics are amazing and thats putting it lightly. But on the other hand the gameplay gets old very fast. It makes you do the same repetitive things over and over again. The first 1 or 2 times is okay but when it starts making you do the same objective 4-5 times it starts to get a bit repetitive. Espcially since its about 3-4 hours long. Also the game can be VERY difficult to navigate even with the HUD. About 90% of the game is just floating around going to the next objective. They took a 30 minute game into 3-4 hours. Now the other 10% is rather nice. But it's not enough. The voice logs give you a lot of info on the crew, what happend etc. Voice acting is very good aswell. I beat this game 3 times to give it a fair review score. So should you buy this game idk? I'd say wait for a sale at about 9.99$ and pick it up then.\nMy score 5/10\nWouldn't recommend it at full price.

Its similar to the movie Gravity, where a person is stranded in a destroyed space station and needs to find a way to get off. The game is entirely played in first person perspective which does set the mood. It is very atmospheric, playing on the fears of losing oxygen and ultimately dying from not breathing. The graphics look great for a 3D indie game, with some impressive visuals and seeing the Earth in the distant.\nThe story is very simple, and is present in some audio transmissions and audio logs which works in this scenario, however sometimes audio logs can be hidden so personally from my experience, I wasn’t quite sure of the full story. I was still curious none the less, and the ending was quite interesting and did make me look up a story synopsis to see what I was missing from the game.\nWhen I started playing the game, I loved the concept and had fun, however it got old very quickly. When they started introducing more obstacles to add to the challenge, it piked my interests again and it made me feel minor anxiety worrying about when I am going to get my next air source.\nThe biggest problem I felt with the game was the inconsistent radar, it just worked when it felt like it. Quite often the radar alluded to me that the objective was in the room, when it was actually in the next room over.\nThe sound design was very cool, and the game captured the essence of being alone. It almost felt like a horror game, without the jump scares and monsters. The only enemy was yourself from panicking and not planning ahead with your air supply.\nThis game was definitely designed with VR in mind, and although I thought the game was good, I think it would’ve been completely a much better experience when fully immersed in VR.\nA tough game to recommend, but I enjoyed it. Watch my play through to help make a decision, but kudos to the developer for taking a risk making a game like this, they deserve respect.\n\nFox Plays","May 19","true","5.2"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","14","29","3","0"

It delivers in every capacity, to bring to life a single vision. You're an astronaut, stranded in a wrecked station in Earth's orbit and you've got to repair the escape pod to get home. That's it.\n\nSome may find its slow pace, simple objectives and vague plot to be lacking in excitement but for me Adr1ft was welcomingly refreshing. A leisurely pace, in a painfully beautiful space lead to moments of slow, quiet danger with your oxygen slowly dwindling without your noticing.\n\nYou can end up caught between two distance pieces of wreckage, your air trickling away, tyring to decide whether to use some more of your oxygen for a boost or hope that your trajectory is right, that you'll land true and find another canister of oxygen.\n\nThis recurring loop, of complex navigation and measured/daring leaps across empty space is wholly satisfying to me, made more compelling by the desire to unravel the events leading to the disaster. Around the station you'll find audio logs and e-mails, as well as some personal belongings, that disclose the backstory. Whilst the audio log collection is a bit cliché, it's delivered by some great voice acting, writing and complimented by enough incidental details to make it engaging in spite of the familiar setup. The story is also left nicely amibguous, to leave you thinking and keen to return to the station.\n\nBut Adr1ft is an experience worth having simply because of just how unique and well executed an experience it is. Every bit of visual feedback and sound is perfect in pulling you into the role of an astronaut, trapped in space with only one means of returning home. It's a marvel of smart yet simple design and benefits from a keen understanding of exactly what kind of game it wants to be.\n\nAdr1ft is more than what it says on the tin but if all you want to do is pretend to be an astronaut for a few hours, there's no finer experience out there than this.","March 29","true","4.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

There's virtually no story. You stumble accross tapes here and there that play back useless logs of characters you'll never meet nor even care about. The controls take a little getting used to but they work. Though sometimes you'll tap a wall or ledge and start spiraling aimlessly and that can get annoying quickly. It's very, very, short. I dont understand how people say they get a solid 6 hours out of it. I have 3.3 hours in. Once you do the first objective you already know what needs to be done. There's no curve balls, no change in gameplay, just suit upgrades that make an easy game even easier. The whole time my thoughts were that this could have been amazing. Using this games tech, some real gameplay, and an actual story, we could have Interstellar the game on our hands. But we dont. We have Gravity the game.

Its physics and lighting are well done with Unreal 4.  It made floating through the space station’s wreckage and gazing back at Earth in zero gravity enjoyable.  However, the gameplay and story were quite dull for me.  The tasks of retrieving discs, repairing, and revisiting computer terminals quickly became repetitive.\n\nThe constant resupplying of oxygen was a nuisance and contradicted the tenseness of the survival aspect as there were oxygen tanks generously scattered throughout.  For me, the storytelling was lackluster, it just wasn’t strong enough to engage and elicit an emotional connection with the characters unlike, for example,  SOMA.\n\nAside from certain nonsensical technicalities, such as escape pods functioning only if all main systems are activated, the points at which the developer decided to inject an audio log or music by Weezer just wasn’t complimentary to the experience.\n\nPerhaps I’ll enjoy this game in VR, but mainly to be immersed in space as a float simulator.","April 7","false","3.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The architecture of the space station is incoherent, uninteresting, and repetitive. The few sections that stand out are those that make you clumsily dodge incongrous dangerous moving parts (often instakilling), made worse by the lack of intuitive physics in your movement. Your objective is to go to a distant part of the station, push a button, return to the center and push another button—repeated four times.\n\nThere are bits of story—some of it revealed automatically through audio logs, and more scattered through collectible items and computer terminals; but I (appropriately, I thought) was focusing on survival and escape, so missed nearly all of it.\n\nAdr1ft tries to include believable space physics, survival systems, and a compelling story, but fails to scratch more than the basic surface of these aspects. The result is disappointing, tedious, and at times frustrating. But it does look gorgeous. If you have a Rift, it might be worth a purchase just for the space vistas; if not: avoid.","April 1","false","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Finally the day came where I could play this game. But I have to say, after playing it for at least a good 5~ hours, I sadly can't recommend this game at this time. For all the aesthetic plus sides, I find the game frustratingly too difficult to navigate. The game has very useless, two-dimensional "guide arrows" to show you where the next objective is. It's VERY hard to find where to go or understand what you are supposed to do. Maybe for other people this wasn't a problem, but for me, I found it extremely frustrating to the point that I gave up on the game and never finished the storyline. I will openly admit I am a gamer that gets extremely frustrated very quickly when video games confuse me or don't give me clear instructions on what to do or where to go. That being said, there is a saying in the industry; there's no such thing as a stupid consumer, only a stupid product. Something as simple as a waypoint system could have made this game way more enjoyable and easier to navigate.

Button simulator/EVA simulator, no REAL repair simulation.\n\nIf you don't have VR wait till it drops in price and they work the bugs out.. and maybe even add some real gameplay before purchasing unless you are buying it purely to float around and look at the beautiful design.\n\nPros:\npretty stellar graphics... :)\n......\nGreat art direction.\n\nCons:\nRelatively shallow storyline\nBoring gameplay.. hope you like holding F.\nFrustrating controls.. (though, this may be pretty realistic.)\nNO MAP! that I could find other than what the stations terminals provided.\n\nThe Full Monty:\nIf you have a VR headset and are foaming at the mouth for content this game would definitely be worth having. For an average PC gamer already oversaturated with game options, I see it as of far less interest.\n\nThe gameplay can be categorized as Incredibly Repetitive button simulation. Not a single true "repair" situation. It says "Manual repair needed" at one point and I got real excited because I think it will have some sort of modular system/puzzle situation where you get to try to figure out how to repair a comms system with a manual in arabic or something. You know... something interesting and stressful... maybe even fun.\n\nUnfortunately the closest to repair anything I did was press a few buttons and listen to friggin soundbytes.\n\nI spent about 5 hours in this game and finished almost 3 modules. I ended up stuck in mobilis module. I was locked out of the main station and the final portion of mobilis wouldn't load. Which doesn't say much for the length of the game considering 2 or 3 hours of that 5 hours was spent going back and forth in Mobilis module making sure I had done everything. I've watched a couple of walkthroughs and didn't miss a single step but still the last door never opens. So at this point I've asked for a refund. :( (which Steam will not grant)\n\nThe game plays so painfully slow, I didn't care to return to the beginning and play through again. No thanks.\nI fully understand the idea of taking this game slow, but in my opinion there should be a quicktravel map once you've gone through the mission. There are no old saved games and you can only go to the beginning of the closest checkpoint, Which in my case, was the last checkpoint before the end of the mobilis module. Which didn't help reset whatever bug kept it from opening.\n\nAlso, I understand disorientation is one of the games "features" that make it more of a game but having no Map or objective reference at all is frustrating. You can press G to show little icons of interest on things floating around, but this only happens within proximity. Doesn't help to find your way really.\n\nI wish there were a "Maybe" option under recommendation, rather than just yes and no, Ultimately my answer would be NO unless you have a VR headset.","May 4","false","5.3"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

It appears they expanded on their initial design to make the game longer, at the expense of repeating the same quest 4 times (with a slight twist) before being able to blast home. However an annoying reminder before you leave shouting "Get all the collectables!"\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful - Gravity the Game\n- Physics worked well - about what I assume being in space would be like\n- Designed for VR, will be worth playing with a VR headset.\n\nCons:\n- Short, poor story - Story telling didnt tell much, a mash up of random recordings and some boring email strings to tell you whats happening - All I know is it's my fault cause im greedy... Lots of unanswered questions and empty plot points.\n- Poor HUD / Waypoint system. Most of the time was spent trying to understand where to go. Wasn't impossible, could have been better.\n\nSynopsis:\nA beautiful proof of concept of a game, excellent use of new unreal technology and stunning visuals probably built for an outstanding VR experience.

Graphically stunning, handles well but lacks substance. Feels like a VR demo rather than a full game. The story doesn't develop, and there are many weird things that leave a bitter taste; EVA suits not being able to take a small knock or containing more than 15 seconds of oxygen; many conveniently placed oxygen tanks lying around all over the place, and an inability to carry them; memory loss cliché with walls of text in emails to read. These could have been structured more and used more sparingly. Tie that with a more interesting story line, e.g. talking to ground control/another naught while questioning everything you are doing or your own sanity while giving more freedom to have organic exploration and this game could have shaped up to be something worth playing.","March 29","false","1.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Both the sound and graphics assets for this game are of incredibly high quality. However, most of the game is spent doing menial tasks that barely constitute gameplay and certainly don't qualify as mechanics. Calling this game a "survival game" seems almost like mockery. Even disregarding that, I can see very little reason to play this game since there is no story to speak of either. Spending 20$ on a VR demo seems extremely excessive to me, especially since most people don't even own a VR headset at this point.\n\nFull review on  YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv_vXyAtGA0","April 3","false","10.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fooblah18/recommended/300060/","fooblah18","GOD IS DEAD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fooblah18/","64 products in account","When I learned about this game sometime in 2015, I was really excited because someone actually made a game that's set on space and moreso its immersive. Additionally, this is one of the first games to actually support VR (not a fan really but it ticks a pretty good feature so why not!). So when it did came out I didn't made any more thought of not buying the game. But whilst playing it, I realised that this game really doesn't impact me in any good way whatsoever.\n\nOf course the game has pretty darn good visuals but with so many non-mobile games also have this kind of graphics fidelity, I don't see this as a good selling point. (Though that cherry blossom tree is just wow...) Also the way on how the player would control is just wonderful, it may be clunky at some point in time but it really gives the player an idea how one would control something in space (I guess?)\n\nBut what really makes me sad about this game is that, for me, the game overall is bland. Sure you get to have a "First Person Experience" (honestly, why the heck did they trademarked this) of an astronaut but I don't see really any good reason on why should I connect with this character. I don't know anything about the character I'm playing besides she's a commander of a crew and she ♥♥♥♥ed up something bad that leads to the events of the game, and there's also her crew. At one point in time I was really really curious about that British guy doing his sharing with his peers but it just abruptly ends. It left me hanging wanting to know more what did that guy do with the commander.\n\nAnother pain point in this game is its lousy navigation system, sometimes I have to use my intuition to get to places because the navigation markers are not doing any justice navigating me to where I should be going. And did I forgot to mention the frigging minimap is 3D? eugh. At one point I was just cirling around something trying to find where the heck is the navigation marker leading me.\n\nMy last gripe with this game is the buggy game progressing logic. I actually can't finish the game because I forgot to charge up my oxygen tank and died going in the life raft(?) room. When the game places me back to the checkpoint, the door leading to that room is locked and I have no way of going in. I almost also got stuck on another point in the game where I just finished alinging Vocalis antennaes and about to go back to the main chamber, the door is locked. Good thing I just have to go back to one of the antennae rooms to fix this.\n\nIn conclusion although the game did made me initially excited, it did not really lived up to the hype it made. I'm not going to refund this game because I give credit to the developers for making such a unique game. But I do wish they took their time on polishing the game story, especially the characters, more and those dreaded progression bugs! I'd probably not going to finish my current playthrough and probably this game would gather thick dust first in my steam library before I have the motivation to play it again.","March 29","false","2.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The classical music comes in at awkward times and the the techno music is god awful.\n-Overall very dull  game experience for what you would think would be a very tense and adrenaline rushed game.\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to start off with I thought this game looked and sounded awesome pre-release. From the trailers I thought this game was going to be a gritty fight for survival after a catostrophic disaster occured on a space station. This game is the complete opposite. The game starts moments after the disaster, you play as commander Alex Oshima, your goal is to repair the 4 main systems of the station in order to get the escape pods functional so you can get back to Earth....sounds reasonable enough. It sounds reasonable until you figure out the the process for repairing each system is the same exact process... which is a slow, repetivie, tediuos process of floating for 10 minutes fixing the power node thing then floating for 10 minutes then making a new core for the station then floating for 10 minutes and putting the new core in the cerbral cortex thing. you have to do that 4 times in a row. :/ :/ :/. Thats all the game is 3 hours of repeating the exact same process four times in a row. There was no elements of survival or danger at all. The only survival mechanic in the game was you had to replenish your suits oxygen supply which wasn't even a challenge becuase there was an over abundance of oxygen stations and oxygen cans lying every 10 feet in the station. Don't even get me started on the awful techno music. The only thing that this game has going for it is its graphics. There were moments where I enjoyed looking at Earth below, but grahpics cannot fix the repetitive and dullness of this game. The story of this game is also really lacking, Im not really sure what the message of the story is trying to say to me.","March 29","false","3.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I have it at 3440x1440 on EPIC mode and it's not even that pretty either.","March 30","false","3.8"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","0"

This game proves why. Set in the year 2037, a sapce station goes ♥♥♥ up and your left drifting through space while your eva suit sucks up your oxygen quicker than passing out on a Friday night. all in all a great game with intense survival.","March 28","true","7.0"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

The game runs well on a AMD 290x, settings are on Epic. one of my favorite parts is flayin through the bubbles looks so nice. Ive died 2x now once to looking at the earth to long and could not make to some air. 2nd time I got lost and no air to been seen.\n\nGraphic are stunning to say the least, like I said before I love to play is in VR. I still have not beat most of my time is looking at stuff, and trying to not run out of air casue of this. One thing I found funny is you need to restore the Space Station to launch the escape pod. Id figure this be on it own system, but would make for a short game. other then this I have been having fun so far. and yes running low on oxygen gets your heart pounding","March 28","true","5.0"," 18 of 61 people (30%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","30","18","61","6","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slashandburn/recommended/300060/","slashandburn","SlashAndBurn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slashandburn/","478 products in account","I have completed the main game and generally I would say it's pretty, but thats common for a [insert verb] simulator.  It took me a while to understand how to actually play the game.  At the start I just followed the triangle symbols from place to place.  After I completed the first 2 big plot items, I started to actually understand what the game wanted me to do and how the radar worked.\n\nFlowI'm kinda dissapointed in the game's flow.  The first part is get to X.\nOnce you're at X, touch a computer, goto Y, come back to X, put mcguffin into recipticle and repeat 3 more times.  Now the 4th time did shake things up a bit, but not that much.\n\nPuzzlesI would not really say this game has puzzles, but it sure does have death traps.  Why would the company build death lasers, jumping power and other nasty things inside the halls of a space ship?\n\nLogicWhat powers all this stuff?  There are chunks of the station that are literally broken off and floating by themselves in space, but are still functional.  I can understand from a game's persective, but I would assume 1/2 of the stations weight is batteries, or they perfected wireless power.\n\nThere are other stations floating around, why arn't there other people?  I'm guessing this large station only crews 6, but it seems like it could have had more.\n\nIt seems like the entire station was built for everyone to wear EVA suits all the time.  There's an O2 charging station in every module.\n\nI'm really amazed by the "repair" system.  When you complete one of the four main goals, one of your 4 main systems is fixed.  Kinda think in real life if an amazing thing like that existed, it would just fix everything.\n\nRantI'm kinda disapointed by the ending logic, you must fix these four systems to escape.  What if mobilis fell into suborbit and burned, guess the escape pod would never work.\n\nGeneral Points For the longest time I thought the velocity indicator was the "where to go indicator".\nI could only play in 45 minute chunks, after that I started to feel ill.  I think it was the moments when the game took away control, it atleast happens 6-8 times.\nThere are many dead end audio logs.  If your on a segment for a person, only their logs will work, all others are damaged.  I kinda wish the audio computers were just collectables so I woulden't need to sit and listen.","June 5","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I nearly didnt get it due to the mixed reviews, but after playing I am very happy i bought it. The visuals are stunning in vr, and theres no feeling quite like simply being lost in space.","June 5","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole space station is truly beautiful and there's a lot of small details to look at, even though I kinda lost orientation once, but that was my fault, not the game's. Sadly the game gets boring after a while and the ending was a little bit disappointing. Still, I enjoyed playing it and I think it's definetly worth a try.","June 5","true","6.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I get nowhere near 90fps with a i5-3570k + GTX970. Until the developers create a graphics options menu, I simply can't enjoy this game in VR. Shame, because it looks like it would be an awesome experience.","June 6","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
