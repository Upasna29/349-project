The battles themselves are set in various arenas filled with crates that contain anything from a wheelbarrow load of coins to special limited super-weapons that can clear half a map out if you don't die getting to them.\n\nThe big issue here is the comical imbalance of the weapon system. You find new guns and melee items as random drops in encounters, all of which would traditionally have their own advantage/disadvantages but the minute you lay hands on the shotgun, GIBZ goes from beating your head in with a mob of corpses to standing helplessly by while you reduce that mob into red yoghurt with your double-barrelled death cannon. I can imagine that it becomes easier to roll with an automatic rifle in multiplayer with the mass of enemies split between more than one person but really, you'd just be handicapping yourself. None of the guns have any sort of ammo count so there's absolutely no reason to ever switch them out or even use a melee attack. Add to that a perk that turns the shotgun into a golden super-weapon after a killstreak and you're really just clicking to exercise your fingers after a while.\n\nGIBZ does start to feel inescapably repetitive after a couple of hours or so, by which point you should be well on your way to clearing out the majority of the bosses and grinding out the last few character perks but there's room to expand and tweak the parts that need it while it's in EA.\n\nFull review below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjCoaREDMMg","May 20","true","2.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","13","19","4","0"

Fun boss fights and a little perk system that is addictive.\nHaving local co-op and co-op with freinds over steam really adds alot to this title. For $5 it's a good little game, but don't expect anything too amazing. Just a bit of fun.

But even with the bugs we beat the content that was there in under 2 hours, and even on hard, it was all pretty simple.\n\nOnce you've beaten each of the generic and uninspired bosses, you're left with little to do. The "Minigames" like Zombiesurfing and Gattling defense aren't very much fun.\n\nZombie surfing plays like a chore, with you trying to avoid boxes on a far too slow moving screen with slightly unresponsive movement controls.\n\nGattling defense has you using a Gattling gun that overheats to hold of waves of zombies, but by the time I figured out how to use it, everything was already killed off by my brother and cousin who were wielding machineguns in their hands.\n\nWith more guns, a more in depth upgrade system, and more content, I'd be inclined to change my mind, but as the game stands and with the devs calling the game "Almost finished" I just can't, in good conscious recommend this to anyone. The idea of it is more satisfying than the experience.","May 25","false","2.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However the graphics are nicem the weapon system is good and the music and sound effects are well made.","May 22","false","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","5"
