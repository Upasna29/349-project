In my first fight I challenged against a grey haired person, only after battle ended I realized it was a very weird drawn woman =.=" but all women look that weird in this game.\n\nGame features: very bad resolution, very poor fighting mechanics (do the same hit all the time, preferably a jumping or range one on your opponent...repeat it until it dies), 3 "fight" buttons (kick, punch & grab), very bad drawn characters, a "tutorial", no controller support(there are some controller buttons shown in the "tutorial", but this game doesn't need it even if it had support, since the controls are that poor that controller is too much), no achievements, confusing menu.\n\nGood features: Steam Trading Cards :D Since this game came from "vote us on Greenlight and get a free copy" it makes only some benefit, when selling cards. Some ppl say soundtrack is good, maybe a little. And also the character creation, but it's not that great really, just lot of games don't have it.\n\nWhat's good about the game besides Trading Cards?....nothing.","June 12, 2014","false","1.4"," 78 of 87 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","78","87","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/291330/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Final Slam 2 is, to put it quite frankly, an abomination of a game. It falls below poorly designed shovelware into something that feels like an insult to other games in the genre. As a fighting game it fails on a fundamental level with a horribly shallow pool of moves, awful controls (which includes a complete lack of gamepad support), and broken systems that make fights feel entirely reliant on luck. Every aspect of the game, from the tutorial to simply the menu navigation, manages to be far more convoluted and confusing than it should ever be, making something as simple as changing the screen resolution unintuitive.\n\nThe art design has the dubious honor of being possibly the worst of any retail game I've yet seen, with horrendous character designs, blurry textures, an inadmissible lack of detail in every scene, and horrendous animations that can hardly be called as such. It's like MS Paint got exceedingly drunk, and this is the aftermath that it threw up the next morning. The over the top and misogynistic dialog from the story mode is just the last nail in a terribly constructed coffin.\n\nIf it was possibly to revoke my copy of Final Slam 2, I'd gladly take the chance to never have to glance at it again in my library. It's one of the worst games I've had the displeasure of playing on Steam, and I shudder to think that people are actually paying for something that would compare unfavorably to the average flash game. Please, for your own protection, do not partake in playing this game, it will give you nothing back and devour any last hope that there is still some quality control on this platform.","June 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","21","24","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/recommended/291330/","Stoneth","Stoneth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/","1103 products in account","Final Slam II is a fighting game originally made in Flash. And as a Newgrounds submission Final Slam II is pretty decent, but unfortunately it doesn't hold up compared to other independently developed fighting games, especially those released on Steam. Final Slam II goes for the simple with it comes to combat. You use WASD and GHJ (no gamepad support which is typical for Flash games) to control your fighter but the way fighters move, jump and punch seems very much unnatural, like a combination of the original Street Fighter and the original Virtua Fighter. As to be expected there is a story mode (a cliched and confusing one) in addition to a tournament mode.\n\nThe best thing that Final Slam II has going for it is the character creation system. Using a large variety of body parts, colors and a few sizes you can create your own fighter with special moves, stances, poses, and voice chosen by you. Unfortunately this is also one of the game's biggest flaws because all the characters already in the game were created this way, and use the same "custom mannequin" creation method. There's no expression or animation outside the movement and rotation of body parts and it gives you this strange feeling that you're playing with jointed paper dolls instead of martial arts masters. On top of this is the fact that the only difference between male and female fighters is the large set of boobs pasted onto the male torso.\n\nI've played a lot of fighting games in my lifetime from Street Fighter, most games on the Neo Geo and Skullgirls to more obscure titles like Yatagarasu and MONSTER and in my opinion the quality of this game does not merit the price. If you want to try the game for yourself before paying, you need only head to Newgrounds and play Final Slam II there for free. The only real difference between the paid version on Steam and the free version is the full Story mode, a Season mode and more custom fighter slots.\n\nYou can find much better fighting games on Steam. Not recommended.","June 13, 2014","false","2.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

Nothing about the game is very... professional. I understand it's "indie", but many indie games have a quality about them that really shows you that the developer(s) knew what he/she/they were doing. This game does not.\n\nThis game is playable on Newgrounds for free, so if you're buying it here on Steam just to get 4/8 of the trading cards, you'd be better off just buying the cards from the marketplace because you will save money that way (you don't have to own a game to craft a badge). It's just not an interesting game at all. Even if you wanted it for the story mode, which I don't know why you'd want a fighting game for a story mode... but if you did, this game's story is really lame too. I hate to say "why play ___ when you can play ___" because comparing two games isn't always good practice in reviewing, but in this game's case, I just wouldn't play it over any other fighting game for any unique reason of its own. It has no draw to me.","July 1, 2014","false","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I haven't played it much, but i'll try to give it the best review I can.\n\nThe characters and animations looks rediculous. The animations skips all the time and are super buggy, the graphic settings are very poor: ( Music: High/Low/Mute, Volume: High/Low/Mute, Quality: Best/Good/Low and Resolution: Windowed/Wide/Full. ) Also the A.I. is pretty badly designed, either it spams stuff at you or lets you kill him. This game is available for free with less content on a popular Flash Games website and it only got about 25,000 views compared to tons of other games with 10,000,000+ views.\n\nThe tutorial is a bunch of text that you need to click ''Next'' in order progress through it. The Steam overlay dosen't even work in game, you cannot take screenshots, this game features no achievements... All it has available is Single-player or Local Co-Op. The best part of the game is the fighter creator: While the UI and general appearance is still quite basic, it does have alot more customization options than in many games. At least you get Steam Cards as a reward for playing this game!\n\nAll in all, the game UI is terrible, the gameplay is not fluid and there's no multiplayer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAccused/recommended/291330/","TheAccused","Mind Crushed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAccused/","370 products in account","Genre: Casual 2D Traditional Fighting Game\n\nSummary:\nFinal Slam 2 is a simplistic 3-button fighting game in the vein of Mortal Kombat-style footsies (emphasis on special attacks).\nThe system mechanics include MK-style special inputs, an auto-dodge while blocking (occurs based on the amount of health), and taunting to heal health.\n\nPros:\n- The character customization, in regards to appearances, allows for a lot of user input with it's variety of options.\n- It's possible to script the A.I. in a detailed manner.\n- The tutorial is brief and concise.\n\nCons:\n- Elements such as auto-dodge and mashing for speed attacks detracts from strategic play.\n- No arcade stick or controller support.\n- No training mode\n- There a down throw as opposed to a back throw.\n- The character designs are generic, blocky, and well, ugly.\n- Every character feels like they use one of three move sets.\n- Animations are choppy due to the game's low frame rate.\n- The stages are bland.\n- The voice clips are generic.\n- Being able to customize attack SFX is a bad idea, since fighting game players use them as cues.\n- The attack and taunt animations are all boring.\n\nNeutral Points:\n- The music is alright, but it's also not very memorable.\n- Simulation mode is pointless unless you're really bored; nobody wants to watch CPU's fight.\n- There's an option that makes K.O.'s unavailable unless a special attack finishes the opponent. This waters down the game but at least it's optional.\n- Cutscenes consist of text dialogue with a character sprite.\n- Customizable character can select any stance for their fighting style, which is bad idea, but hardly matters since this isn't a competitive game.\n- No online, but that's fine considering the quality of this game.\n- You can select a faction to fight for in versus mode, which doesn't add to anything.\n\nPersonal Opinion:\nThis is a fighting game targeted at casual gamers. Regardless of that fact, this game is shoddy and lacks a lot of polish and originality.\n","July 7, 2014","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I actually rather like kusoge, finding a strange joy in seeing how hilariously bad games can be\n\nFinal Slam 2 is not kusoge.

I got this game for free with admittedly high expectations as I had gotten like 3 really good free games in a row. In theory it sounded great. Simple fighting game with a story and full character customization with 80 whole spots to save them in. Well ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\n\nFirst thing is the character customization and everything else looks like crap. All of it. Which is very disappointing because I love making custom characters. I don't doubt that somebody tried, it has a ton of options, but knowing your game looks like that why would you think that I would make 80 characters? And girl fighters are out of the question, they look like dudes regardless of choosing "female". Probably why they showed the character creator running at the speed of light in the tutorial. Alright fine, I made my dumb looking character now I get to make him punch things. Except wait, all of these moves look horribly unnatural. Whatever, I guess he's just dumb, It'll probably look better with game play. Except no, again, the graphics are entirely horrible and the bots will spam throughout the entire match. The only way to beat them half of the time is with more spam with the moves you picked that are meaningless anyway. Why? Because you can punch the guy all day and the second he decides he doesnt want to lose, halfway through the fight, his punches that used to barely dent your health bar suddenly obliterate it. I can't say the story was any good either because I don't even know for sure what it is. What I can get from it is overused nonsense that can't decide what genre it wants to be. Angsty sports movie conversation, therefore you have to win the tournament! Random robot battle! Steryotypical Asians doing wise Asian things! Suddenly magic! And also the apocalypse so now screw the tournament, save the world\n\nYou can't say I didnt try to play it, I played long enough for my card drops at least, but this is the worst game i've ever played. Ever. No contest except maybe with another free game I recieved around the same time as this one but I guess I can't complain to much because, you know, free.
