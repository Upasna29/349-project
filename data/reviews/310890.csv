Yes, this included ranged attacks.\nCertain quests would not show progress or complete.\nFriend tried breaching a door while I kicked it down, his character froze in place.\nOur party wiped once, we reload from a save and the game no longer registered input from my controller or keyboard/mouse, luckily I was able to Alt-F4 out of the game to restart it.\nMy friend experienced several moments where the game would completely freeze for him for extended periods of time, personally my game crashed a few times.\nIt is apparently possible to drop your loot for others to pick up, it just takes a few tries since the item returns to their inventory when you pick it up and sometimes it'll successfully dupe the item.\n\nFurther, I find the game's options to be lacking.\nNo settings for sensitivity (Aiming mode is extremely sensitive) or camera speed (It turns very slow with a controller).\nNo rebind options for controllers.\nKeyboard controls list axis inputs when rebinding.\nHUD lists hotkeys for different input devices (Playstation lists Xbox buttons or keyboard buttons at seemingly random throughout the game).\nThere is no confirmation dialogue for several important in-game menu options and a misclick can easily result in undesired actions.\n\nAnother extremely annoying thing is that regardless of your equipped weapon the aiming reticle is always 5m away from your character even though every weapon has a much longer range than that, even trying to snipe with a sniper rifle (which has a listed range of at least 35m) is difficult since you can't reliably aim at distant targets. Trying to hit distant targets is sometimes impossible anyways since the camera loves to go at a complete top-down angle at times which limits your vision greatly.\n\nOther than that the game lacks another very important feature, the ability to easily create and customize new characters for joining co-op, it really defeats the purpose of going co-op if you can't customize your crew when joining to ensure that your team still retains a versatile setup.\n\nTL;DR: If you're buying this game for the co-op gameplay, DON'T.\nIf you want it for the single player, you're probably better off playing the first game, at least until they actually finish developing this game, which they clearly haven't despite claiming to be officially released.","July 21, 2015","false","10.1"," 173 of 211 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","173","211","7","5"

But TL;DR for those of you who have already played the Original Breach and Clear and enjoyed it: get this game.  It's BnC, but with zombies.  I mean, really -- that is pretty awesome.\n\nGraphics:  Nothing ground breaking, but given that the original Breach and Clear was meant for portable devices, that isn't a big surprise.  It still looks great for what it is, and the UI is very serviceable.  The visuals certainly add to the mood, and remind me of certain areas of the urban areas of old school Resident Evil games, which is high praise in my opinion.\n\nAudio:  Music is nice and moody, and adds to the atmosphere nicely.  The audio shifts when entering into tactical mode, which is a nice touch in accenting the feel from live-action to turn-based.  When the music shifts, it gives a feeling of 'alright, lets do this'.  Sound effects are pretty satisfying too, gunfire sounds hefty, explosions are, well, explosive.  Very solid.\n\nGameplay:  It's Breach and Clear, man.  Very entertaining tactical action, especially given the circumstances.  I can't say I've ever thought about approaching a zombie apocalypse with military tactics at my finger tips, but it works really well.  In fact, having four well-armed militants at your disposal might seem unfair at first, but not all zombies are created equal, and you'll be surprise how quickly you can get overrun by either sheer numbers.  Using your soldier's abilities (like grenades, mines, tagging enemies, and provoking the horde) goes a long way to keeping your head above water.  Loot crates spread through out the stages encourage exploration, and finding ammo and medical crates when you are low really makes mowing through that horde worth the trouble.  Over all, very engaging game play.\n\nGripes:  Well, it IS alpha, so I'll try to be easy on it.  Complete lack of tutorial is a bit of a pain, and there is not much in the way of VO, save for when you select your squad mates.  There are bugs, of course.  Getting behind cover can be a pain in the ♥♥♥, as the game doesn't like to give you that shield icon when it damn well should.  Also, the squad AI needs some touching up.  Sometimes, after setting up, they would shoot enemies in the very back, while three are about to eat their face.  And when you are controlling a solo-guy live-action style, sometimes the squad follows you, and sometimes they don't.  And the crates!  Several times I had the item pop out and go right into a car, making it impossible to grab.  And there are a few more things, sure, but again, this is Alpha.  Most of these problems are minor, and don't stop the game from being great.  Just in need of a bit of polish -- but hey!  Alpha is Alpha.  Overall, very solid, and I can't wait to see how much better it gets.\n\nPS:  Will update as I plow through the game.

I tried to accentuate the positive in my original review, but I have to change my rating to Not Recommended.\n\nDEADLine (in which, you control a 4-man squad fighting off hordes of zombies) is not a great game, but it's not a bad one either. The problem, though, is that I know I would have liked it more had it not been prefaced with the B&C title. Because of that title, instead of treating it as its own experience, I resent it for setting me up with certain expectations and then failing to deliver on any of them. Consider the following basic game play elements of both games:\n\nB&C: Players can select a path for each squad member, allowing them to set their viewing direction at the end point.\nDL: Implemented.\n\nB&C: Players can adjust their view at any point along the path chosen, allowing them to fire behind them and to the sides as they move.\nDL: Not implemented (although you can pause the game and change direction, but this is not the same thing).\n\nB&C: Players assign squad members to multiple doors, breaching with a variety of methods.\nDL: Doors are rarely used (and so far, I've only come across single entrances); method of breaching the few you'll find isn't really important.\n\nB&C: Players are visibly timed in each area, allowing them to set target times.\nDL: Not implemented.\n\nB&C: Players earn stars and coins for clearing areas within a specific number of turns, making actions used in each turn important.\nDL: Stars are not implemented; action can be frozen to simulate turn-based play, but it's not vital, and not important.\n\nB&C: Stars unlock new weapons and gear; players use earned coins to purchase equipment.\nDL: Stars are not implemented. Players use randomly dropped (not earned) "scrap" for upgrades, and finds the rest in chests (à la Diablo.)\n\nB&C: Gear and squad members are extremely customizable; everything from the trigger used (weapons) to reaction time (stats), to perks (skills) can be tweaked.\nDL: Weapons can have up to three, swappable, "attachments"; members each have a basic skill tree (à la Diablo). Individual stats can no longer be customized.\n\nB&C: Five levels of difficulty; areas can be replayed to try new tactics at any time, keeping any upgrades.\nDL: One difficulty, areas can't be replayed (unless you save at the start of each one, but then you'll lose your upgrades).\n\nB&C: Three different modes of play ("Terrorist Hunt," "Bomb Defusal," and "Escape Plan").\nDL: Two "Challenge Modes" (one competing with other players) and the Campaign, which has typical RPG-styled quests (à la Diablo). Multiplayer has been added.\n\n[TL;DR] Only basic movement is the same; everything else about the game has changed. After playing for several hours now, I'm still not quite sure what DEADLine is (I think "Diabloesque sorta-kinda-RTS" comes closest, although it's also very similar to X-Com). However, I know what it isn't: It isn't a Breach & Clear game. Those expecting anything similar to the original game will likely feel confused and disappointed so, for this reason, I have to change my rating to Not Recommended.","July 22, 2015","false","5.5"," 67 of 89 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","67","89","0","2"

Navigating in menus with PC is a mess.\n- Sometimes the control written on screen help is not the actual control to use.\n- Sometimes the squad follows your commands. Sometimes they just follow you. There are some controls for that, but either they are unintuitive or they just don't work.\n\nOverall, this game lacks finalization and inspiration.","July 27, 2015","false","14.3"," 58 of 79 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","58","79","4","4"

The game's "Command Mode" offers players a really interesting plethora of strategical combat options, and it does it good job nudging you towards using it; even though you don't have to. It's possible to just play the game in real-time, and treat it more like a top-down action title. However, doing this might rob you of the game's best features. It also features a pretty massive overworld, and includes plenty of sidequests to keep you busy. Consequently the developers have been really great at releasing useful updates at a very consistent rate, and seem to be really listening to player feedback.\n\nCONS:\n-	There could be a greater variety of enemies to fight, although this seems to be on the cards for a later update\n-	The game could really use a tutorial, as its most interesting mechanics can be somewhat difficult to grasp when you   first start playing (but they're really easy to use once you get it though)\n-	I think that they game would simply be AWESOME with a CO-OP mode!

It's a top-down shooter that you can toggle between "twin stick" mode and tactical pause based mode. In twin stick mode your teammates follow you around and shoot on their own(you can freely control any team member at any time, and the rest will follow). Once you switch to tactical mode, you are able to give movement and shooting orders to each teammate individually.\n\nThere are six classes with skill trees to move through. You get to make and customize your own 4 man team(choose appearance and rename team members). All the gear is changeable and upgradable. Slots are: Head, Body, Clothing, Primary, and secondary weapon. All inventory items and ammo are shared with the whole group at all times. So if you have 4 grenades, any of the members can access the grenades and throw them at any time(but some classes are better with them).\n\nThe beginning of the campaign is a tutorial, and the beginning of the first mission is on rails for about 20 min, then the game opens up to being fairly free roam with objectives to choose from. Along with the zombies, there are humans with guns to fight against, which keeps the tactical feel of a Breach & Clear type game. You breach, suppress, and flank while using items and skills to overcome your opponents.\n\nIts RPG elements come with the classes, levels and gear management. Collect, switch out, and upgrade your armor and weapons.\n\nIf this is the type of game you enjoy, then you should love this isometric tactical shooter/zombie survival game(it's not a survival game, but something like that on this engine would be super cool).\n\nThere are a few kinks that need to be worked out. rebinding controls is convoluted(you can't unbind keys) and sometimes you can see enemys spawn in front of you, but overall I love the feel of the game.\n\nOh, and it's co-op. Why is it that so many games in this age of extreme high speed internet can't add such a simple concept into their games? Especially when they already have multiplayer built in...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimawavs/recommended/310890/","ultimawavs","AV Ultima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimawavs/","250 products in account","Breach & Clear: Deadline most certainly does not reinvent the wheel, but is it interesting and engaging enough to hold its own against the multitude of zombie games on market? In a word, no. At its core, the game is essentially a zombie ARPG with a bland strategy component. Every element incorporated in Deadline is stuff we have all seen before. Of course, all games have borrowed ideas from each other since the beginning, but those who choose to implement these ideas try to improve upon it or at least make it their own. Deadline, on the other hand, barely comes to par with what is released today. Just imagine the ideas of action, strategy and role-playing boiled down to its fundamental gameplay components.\n\nLet us begin with the basic action of the game. The killing of zombies is not even interesting. Six hours played at the time of this review and the types of zombies I have encountered are as follows: zombies that walk, zombies that walk faster, and crawling zombies with more health. For a game that has a strategy feature built in, you would think they would introduce multiple zombie types early. One would agree that having many zombie types would assist in creating a strategic environment; an environment where I would need to carefully plan my actions. At the moment, you roam an open world with loot crates and the occasional zombie encounter. Once an encounter starts, you are brought to the command menu, where you able to issue commands to your four individual squad mates. The options available are essentially move, shoot, use abilities and items. I immediately exit this feature, hold both my mouse buttons down and kill the zombies in my way. After six hours, this can get a little repetitive.\n\nSeems like a great time to talk about strategy. There is none. Simply aim at the zombies and shoot them. Sure, you can use a suppression ability that slows the zombies down, but I do just fine standing behind a low wall and firing my weapon. The issue is that the game has unsuccessfully merged the elements of ARPG and strategy. To throw a grenade, you must press five buttons. In an already bland action experience, you are slowing down the gameplay with poorly implemented strategy components. It honestly feels like two different games. One could argue that the game allows you to play the way you want, action oriented or strategy oriented, but neither side compliments each other. It is just a mess of ideas that do not seem to be completed or fleshed out.\n\nWhat about those RPG features? Well, in this post-apocalyptic zombie world you kill enemies for currency and find items in crates. In addition to swapping out squad mate classes, you are able to choose their appearances from a list of premade heads. There are 6 classes in the game, all of which have the most uninspired skill trees I have ever seen. Great skills such as, “increase health”, “increase weapon damage” and “increase critical hit chance”. These passive skills greatly outweigh the active ones. I will admit, each class does have two or three unique active abilities, but as I said, they not very interesting. The item drops are as expected from a modern military shooter. Enemies drop “scrap”, which can be used to upgrade these items at work benches found at safe houses. As far as I can tell, scrap is the only currency in the game and it used to do everything at the work bench.\n\nAs one might be able to tell, this game did not gift me with the most enjoyable of experiences. Overall, it is a bland and uninspired mess of ideas. The game is now a year and a half past its initial release date and it still feels incomplete. The obvious bugs and presentation are not worth mentioning. They are just there. I do not recommend this $20 purchase. There are thousands of games on the market and they cost less and play better.\n\nTL;DR\n\nDid I like this game? No. Would you like this game? Probably not. Should you buy it? I would not recommend it.","October 15, 2015","false","6.6"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","23","29","0","0"

In the wake of a zombie infection you control a four man military team against masses of zombies and other survivors trying to achieve your mission. You can do this by issuing orders to you team and micromanaging their every move or taking control of one and having the rest follow. You can swap between these seamlessly as the situation dictates and this system works nicely in the game, allowing it to keep a good pace. The game includes a character levelling system, varied equipment, and a difficulty that scales nicely as the game progresses.\n\nI enjoy playing this game. I enjoy playing this game A LOT.\n\nBut it is painfully bugged, and feels unfinished. There are parts of it that are poliished to perfection and I get the feeling these were the parts that the Developers found interesting and enjoyed working on.

A cover system where 99% of your enemies use melee, for example.Conclusion:\n\nI really feel like this is a missed opportunity for a great game. It needs a lot of work to make this happen, but it is well within the realms of possibility. It is receiving regular updates, and I hope these will help polish out these problems, but until then I cannot recommend this game, even though I really want to.

At first I was sceptical about this hybrid Tactical/RTS controlls and how it would work in a zombie game. Mark my words it WORKS and is super fun. Play it like an arcade game or be tactical. Believe me, being tactical will save your life many times.\n\nAbout game:\nYou are playing in open world (city) where you will explore and search for weapon, ammo and medic crates. You will encounter zombies walking the streets that will do whatever they can to kill you. You will uncover fast travel locations that you can use later for traveling to specific locations. Me myself rarely use the traveling stations because I have so much fun killing the zombies and collecting scrap on my way to the npc missions.\n\nYou will meet people ingame that will give you missions. After beating the missions you will earn exp to level up your soldiers. You get exp for killing on the streets but the big boost comes from the missions. Some missions also give rewards such as scrap or weapons.\n\nGameplay:\nPressing SPACE will let you go into tactical mode. You can easier cordinate your attack with all characters invidually. Example: Soldier1 cover our rear, Soldier2 cover left flank, Soldier3 cover right flank and Soldier4 cover front assault. And when pressing space you can move timeframe forward slowly so you can see how it works out and change tactics when needed.\n\nWeapons and special moves:\nWeapons ingame will have status effects common and rare. So if you are familiar with RPG games you will understand and enjoy this as well. All your soldiers have a special move wich they can use in battle so when you are choosing your squad, think forward what will you benefit from having in battles. You can customize all your soldiers to your liking. Even give name to your upgraded weapons lol.\n\nScrap and Crafting:\nTo upgrade your armor, equipment and guns you must craft them in safehouses, this will need scrap wich can be found in loot cheests out in the city. You will also get scrap by killing zombies and soldiers.\n\nZombies is a blast to kill and there are alot of variations of them as well. Gfx of the zombies are well made.\n\nGFx 8,5-10\nSFx 7,0-10\nGameplay 10-10 (Never had this much fun in a zombie game)\nStory 6,0-10 (Dont let this fool you.)\n\nI recommend this game. I havent had any issues with the game and the Devs keep patches comming so this game is still supported.\n","November 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","22","28","2","2"

(as of Jan 22)\n\n- occasional frame drops in random locations where nothing is happening\n- menus look pixelated\n- the skill tree isn't helpful, most of the things on there are pointless and cost too much. (you would think the first skill to unlock costs 1 as you only get 1 per level right? nope its 3)\n- confusing map... very confusing\n- keyboard has multiple actions on certain keys set as default. (real example in game: "Q" switches weapons and opens doors) which should be seperated.

The problem is that the tactical component is weak and the game gets repetitive very quickly. The RPG component is quite generic, generic zombie infestation, generic characters, generic skills. Basically this game fails to stand out in either of its targeted genres. Ultimately the developers tried to mix the original Breach & Clear (which is quite good by the way) with How To Survive.

What you get is a topdown shooter with decent controls WASD format. Use of skills fromclasses will certainly take a backseat as the medic and weapon sergeant are all the main skills to use for the first hour. You WILL have teammates die and you'll definitely need them to be revived which is the first default skill for the medic. Weapon Sergeants (heavy gunners) can suppress an entire hoard down, dedicate two of your squad mates to be Weapon Sergeants. They'll make this into EZ mode.\n\nSounds:\n\nDecent for what they are as of this build. Don't expect too much yet.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThey don't make my eyes bleed so they're decent.\n\n\nCons as of Alpha:\n-The city is still very unfinished\n-Tactical overlook while in the map/ can lead to buildings disappearing when looking into other parts of the city. Heavily advise limiting/avoid using the the camera to see farther for now\n-AI is not yet perfect, while your teammates are competent as of Alpha, the enemy humans: Mercs and whatnot, will stand there as their comrades die shot by shot. The movement of your team is also pretty haphazard, you will lose a man just leaving the area trying to get into his squad position because you're too close to the wall.\n-Bugged ammo, will sometimes net you a 9999 ammo (in my case, the Assault Rifle) and in turn, will lead to a eventual crash.\n\n\nSummary:\nDo I suggest you buying this game? Yes, it fills a very niche roll and buying it now will not have you pay the full game price when it does fully release. Does it mean you should play it in this Alpha build? Answer is two-fold.\n\n1. As a casual gamer, no.\n2. As an interested customer, yes. Help sort out the bugs for the versions to come and lead the way for other gamers to enjoy this game.","February 1, 2015","false","5.2"," 45 of 72 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","45","72","2","1"

Both modes seem to be poor experiences of those types of gameplay.\nI didn't make it far in this game because I got fed up with the poor UI and rhe bugs.\nThe first problem that annoyed me was that after using tactical mode, sometimes units wouldn't follow your controlled units and would only move by commands given in tactical mode until next mission. Then while editing my equipment, I found that some buttons had controller prompts while I was using a keyboard, which doesn't affect the game, but is lazy. After that I  was unable to switch to my primary weapon and quit playing this annoying experience.","December 31, 2015","false","6.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I must say I was amazed at how fun Deadline is.  Buying it when it was in the early stages of development and constantly weaving through squads of characters to kill everything in my path was so satisfying.  The gameplay is simple & tactical.  Point & Click and issue commands in command mode or go knee deep just using your mouse and keyboard to travel around with your squad. Mind you, you can alternate between command and normal mode at anytime.  Different classes with different skills that you can use to your advantage in combat.  Different weapons you can use as well (SMG, Shotgun, AR, Grenades) to your liking and style of your squad.  What really impresses me is how the devs actually work with the community to help with updates and bugs.  A dedicated group for an underhyped game.  Overall Deadline is a great buy if you like tatical, military, zombie, strategy, top-down combat style games.  Especially if you liked the original Breach & Clear.","July 14, 2015","true","80.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

The original Breach & Clear was a highly tactical turn-based game, and while this game still has a lot of tactical thinking it's different in a number of ways, with a more real-time commander aspect with semi-autonomous allied AI.\n\nThe graphics have received a significant overhaul and upgrade, and I suspect they have changed engine (I can't confirm it, but it does feel like it - I'd guess Unity but it's a stab in the dark). Whatever they've done, it looks great, with atmospheric effects and a lot of detail added.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit of a piecemeal affair. I very much like that the developers are experimenting with something a bit different, but at this time it does lack the polish and shine that is required to really pull it off. I can easily excuse that, however, given the Early Access status. There's a lot of promise, however, and I do recommend the game with the caveat that this is most definitely an Early Access title - if you walk in expecting a fully finished game awaiting the last bug-fixes before going gold, you'll be disappointed.\n\nI'll update this review as/when more updates come out.","February 24, 2015","true","4.1"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","24","37","0","1"

I bought this for co-op, and my friend couldn't even connect to me. On the flip side when I connected to him, my two characters were invisible. Awesome. An Early Access game launching unfinished? Unheard of.\n\nAs for the game itself, I don't even know what to classify this game as. I don't really think the devs did either. It's like they had a good idea here, a good idea there, and then just mashed it into one game. Zombies who suffer from suppression, flash bangs, and sniper fire to pin them down? Well...okay. It makes me wonder why they even titled it "Breach & Clear" when it clearly has nothing to do with A). The original & B). The use of tactics accompanying the namesake. Should have just called it Deadline and separated it from the original Breach & Clear. Minor complaint, honestly, but still should be mentioned.\n\nThe animations are awkward as all get out - being brutally honest they're seriously amateur. Zombies are....zombies. They shamble, sprint, or crawl toward you so there's not much to complain about here. However, nothing says extreme military action louder, than a guy running around like he has ♥♥♥♥ in his pants I guess. Everything is fairly stiff, but I suppose it all takes a back seat to the gameplay.\n\nFor the most part the gameplay was enjoyable. Even if it felt entirely out of place to be doing military level tactics, of suppress, flank, flush out, etc. on zombies of all things, it still felt pretty cool and was fun to watch your men execute the plans laid out before them. It at least had its place when you got to the actual looters. Side/mini-quests are there to keep you busy and help level your squad. Speaking of, I actually do give the devs a thumbs up for having skill trees associated with your leveling, and furthermore you can even go outside your own skill tree to level other class abilities( e.g. a medic with satchel charges ). So, thankfully, depending on who you have initially that you create for your squad, you're not necessarily stuck with their classes and class abilities.\n\nSpeaking of your squad, I guess it ties into story, which is fairly non-existent, you crash land after being shot down from a stinger missile apparently. Where were you going? What were you doing? Who shot you down? It feels like it's not even really explained. You're just told to go from point A, B, and then C until you reach a safe house. How the zombies came to be, if it's global, wide spread, or if this is just a quarantine zone is never really clarified. It's just "oh look zombies and military dudes, time to be tacticool" *queue 80's horror music* The funny thing is, I actually found myself smiling and enjoying some bits of that, just due to the sheer level of cheesiness...\n\nIt's a tough game to honestly speak on. It feels like it goes into too many directions and does a lot of things right, some really nifty stuff, but gets dragged down by poor optimization( I had this loaded on my Samsung EVO 850 with an AMD FX-9590 & R9 390 and still found myself with fps dips ), co-op issues( why I bought it ), and weird design decisions( why zombies with this gameplay? ). As I said it's really difficult to recommend or shun people away from it.\n\nI'd say wait until the issues are fixed, otherwise it isn't worth full-price.","July 22, 2015","false","2.7"," 40 of 67 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","40","67","0","10"

Oh well, done to death, but worth looking at if you view them as 'The Infected' instead (again, sadly, done to death but what the hey!). If you've played the original prepare for the next evolution of the CQB title.\nI was not impressed at first with the new re-design choices made from the start, as this was touted as being a PC-focused release, and not a mobile port as with the original title (a brilliant port I might add). The focus on controllers threw me though (not very PC at all), and the locked WASD format (something I've never used) irked me no end. BUT...but! All has been adressed since I bought the game instantly in EA. There is now mouse control for movement as well as remappable keys. With so much work being done by the Devs, something many others might take note of, endless updates, tweaks and patches are being implemented. The evs particulalrly listen to what is said on the Forums, no matter how heated the debate sometimes gets (yep, my hand is raised!).\nThe graphics are top notch, and the behaviours of all units (controllable or otherwise) are improving with each new patch. The gameplay is squad-based CQB, in closed and open areas as with the first, and instantly changes to pause-plan-battle when going into 'set pieces'.\nIf you haven't bought into this franchise yet, and are a fan of squad-based tactics and story-driven strategy, then read no further.

Deadline also uses this to add a more RPG aspect to the game, even going so far as to have side quest. As usual with any zombie games the bigger threat seems to be other humans so get ready for that.

However, the concept is really cool and has a lot of potential.  Allowing you to freeze combat at any time and plan your next move is a great idea.  At this time it needs quite a bit of work which is fine.  It's an alpha remember.  These "tactical movement" concepts aren't new but executing them in an open world environment isn't something I've seen before.  It's quite refreshing.  The story elements aren't anything new.  We have a post apocalyptic world with zombies and survivers, both friendly and hostile.  Even if the individual elements of the game aren't very fresh or exciting the combination of them that Breach & Clear: Deadline brings is exciting.  I'm very excited to see how this game will shape up.  If you like Wasteland 2, Doorkickers, or Xcom it's likely you'll find something enjoyable here.  I'll update my review as it progresses.","March 11, 2015","true","28.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Honestly, I wasn't sure what this game would become when they first announced it, but I was interested because I played alot of B&C on Android.\nI like the RTS direction they took instead of simultaneous turn based, but you play real time, but still pause anytime and setup your guys, even control the speed of action if you want your move to proceed slowly to see if you need to alter it, so the planning aspect is still fully there.  I am enjoying the strategic aspect of the game and learning the tactics to defeating both Z's and humans.\nThe twin stick movement and shooting is good, and I like that you can move yourself around the "free roaming" areas to mission locations and not just  teleported to a level to fight and teleport somewhere else.\nI think the weapon midification, gear, etc has some good choices, but it could be clearer and easier to mod.\n","July 24, 2015","true","33.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","1"

This is a fun game and a breath of fresh air to tactical squad play.\n\nIt's only in "early access," but it already plays well and I can't wait for more.\n\nAFTER RELEASE:\n...I'm still waiting for that more.\n\nThis game was definitely a better "work in progress" than a finished product.  I think the devs pushed it out the door too soon and there are plenty of glitches and bugs at release.  I've stopped playing until  they straighten things out.\n\nThere's a lot to this game. But the game seems a little detached to feel like a satisfying squad building game.  The squad members are more homunculus then character.  The original Breach & Clear was better in that regard, and it definitely took a minimalist approach to squad building.   I "think" that this game is an attempt to flesh things out that were bare-bone in the first, but the parts I was able to play felt so firmly on rails there was little reason for me to be there except for the ride.\n\nBut...but I still love the mechanics!  I hope they can build those into a more satisfying game where I care more about the scenario and my squad members.  Maybe it's the zombies.

It takes the classic mechanics from the previous game and expands on them in some very interesting ways. Being an early access, it definitely has some problems, but I wouldn't say that stops it from being entertaining.\n\nA complaint I have is how limited the tutorial is when it comes to basic controls. It explains most everything pretty well, but it forgets to mention how to target enemies. For example, after completing the tutorial I begin to take out infected. Eventually, a mob comes towards me and I'm confused as to why my squad is just sitting there, even after telling them to hold position and aiming the cone at the enemy. It wasn't until later that I found out you had to queue enemies, which makes the game more challenging and fun.\n\nThe main menu makes my computer lag, which isn't fun. Even after turning the graphics down it's still slow to navigate the menu. I'm hoping in the future they can fix this, but honestly it's not a huge deal to me.\n\nThere was also an odd bug I had with the options and trying to lower the settings. The screen came up to configure the shadows and stuff, but nothing was there. Pressing the arrow keys, I heard the cursor moving in the background and eventually changed the settings. It was annoying, but nothing major.\n\nI also heard of another problem regarding ammo, which I haven't had enough time to experience yet. There's talk of adding a way to buy/craft ammo though, so I think that'll be fixed in the future.\n\nThe game is good though, get it now while it's cheap.","March 29, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","4"

Controls at times are confusing and don't work.  The vertical parts of levels are often times hard to recognize from one another.  Inventory system is at times unclear.  This is an early access game currently and needs work - but the framework in place has all the great markers of a great game to come.  Weapons and tactics vary widely enough to provide plenty of options of approach.  The class based squad selection reminds me a lot of the old Rainbow Six games.  The seperate abilities available to each class are varied and provide a useful balance.  The enemy AI is unintelligent, but they are zombies what do you expect them to be, ...smart?  Overall I can recommend getting into this early access if helping this game become a a reality in the tactical top down genre is a good thing to you.  While I have already experienced some bugs within an  hour of gameplay, you can tell this is building up to be a good game.

Good foundation of a game, but you may want to wait until more updates.\n\nLonger thoughts- I'll preface this by telling you to see how long I've played.... not much. But in that time I have tried out the campaign mode and challenge mode. I have run into one campaign stopping bug, and two challenge mode stopping bugs. So there is obviously some bug problems. But between those bugs, there seems to be solid foundation for a game that is different enough from the original breach and clear to make it worth your time.\n\nFirst the campaign mode. Good foundation of skills for each class and good gameplay (watch a video for the gameplay, it's a mix of real time shooting and pause based combat). What I'm most interested in is there are lootable objects which provide your persistant soliders with gear, ammo and items. That combined with what has so far been a decent enough intro to a story, and I'll certainly be playing the campaign in the future.\n\nThe challenge mode has great potential. As of now, it seems to spawn you with 4 random soliders with random classes. The two times I've played this mode, the level designs have been different (one a sewer system, the other an office building). You navigate the level killing zombies or enemy humans, while leveling up and collecting loot. The goal is to reach the exit to the next floor. Unfortuantely I've only been able to get several levels deep before something bugs up and impeeds further progress. This mode is where I can see a vast amount of time being spent, as it seems to have unlimited replay value.\n\nMy closing thoughts- I'm happy with my purchase (50% off coupon helps), and I'm looking forward to updates to the game engine to hopefully resolve the bugs. At this time I cannot recommend the game to those who want to sit down and play a complete game. I can recommend this game to people who are interested in a tactical zombie game with room to grow, that several months from now will hopefully be in a less buggy place. Ultimately, the only thing that matters to me is "Did I have fun playing?" And the aswer to that, is yes.","February 24, 2015","true","7.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","1"

This game for me is a 10/10, its still in alpha and a ton of fun to play, I cant wait till It's feature complete I just hope they keep supporting it I've been burned before. as far as glitches and bugs there are a good few it is an alpha after all but they are dropping updates pretty much every week it seems and cleaning them up plus adding chunks of new content. as far as Im concerned even at 15 dollars this game is absolutely worth it, If your debating on buying this game do it, and prepare to become fully addicted to a one of a kind gem.","February 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

Ok so its not your typical tactical shooter in the sense that is not another FPS trying to  fill in the gap left by the original Rainbow Six that was released in 1998 but Breach & Clear: Deadline might be the first title I would consider as being a worth successor to the crown.\n\nUnlike most modern day tactical shooters employ the standard issue run and gun gameplay we could expect from any FPS on the market with the added benefit of being able to target enemies or issue orders to other members of your team. This doesn’t make a tactical shooter. Breach & Clear: Deadline attempts to recapture the tactical control feeling (which is a staple of the genera) that has been missing from other games. It does this by allowing the player to not only issue orders to units like the standard go there and shoot that options you would expect, in Breach & Clear: Deadline the player is able to  issue move commands, move units behind cover, highlight targets, assign arcs of fire, all while gameplay is frozen eliminating the cumbersome feeling of fiddling with controls on the fly. This doesn’t mean you can't just try and run-n-gun your way through the game because that’s also an option, it just wont get you very far.\n\nAlong side the tactical shooter elements of the game there is also a good bit of a nostalgia due to the open world RPG style gameplay of the original Fallout series that will have you completing quests and looking for gear all while leveling up your squad and selecting different skills from the skill tree to upgrade each character and make your squad fit your play style.\n\nNow don't get me wrong Breach & Clear: Deadline isn’t perfect and it's still in development, but so far it has shown to be the model of what an Early Access title should be. First off I think pitting the player against zombies is a little dated at this point and the over all story could use some work. Luckily the developers are actively improving the game based on user comments and bug reports, patches come out to fix major issues fairly promptly, and their very responsive and appreciative of the online community.","February 25, 2015","true","3.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","1"

I do like the concept and I hope the mix of game types will work. I think they have something, combining a twin stick shooter with tactical layer, but that something is still not developed sufficiently to give a final verdict. It needs work. I've been playing with a x360 controller and although sufficient, it is a bit clunky. It needs to be smoother to be a nice twin stick. The tactical layer also needs to be more fluid with the controls. The AI is still pretty basic, so again to early to tell.\n\nBut I am willing to support the project and I hope they pull this off.","January 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","1"

So, why should I wait to finish the game before I give my review?\n\nI've played a bunch of hours so far, and it's repetitive, fun gameplay. It's fine. It's smooth and mostly non-buggy for me, aside from a couple of locations where the soldiers got stuck on the environment. I haven't tried the multiplayer.\n\nFor those complaining about the real time.... it's really there for exploration or for weak encounters. You're really supposed to switch to command mode if it gets difficult. Is that not common sense? In command mode you can scroll around and see everything, and there are no camera issues.\n\nThe UI could be more polished and the story is trivial, but it's fun enough. There are moments of stressful X-Com like situations where every move needs careful planning, and in-between them there's open world isometric Diablo-esque exploration plus click-killing. And btw, one of the negative reviews said that he had to click on every single enemy to get the soldiers to aim. WTF was he talking about?

The tactical aspects are rather a bit subdued while it invokes more elements of a roleplaying game, not really turnbased and it manages to keep a steady, break-neck pace, facilitated by a very user-friendly interface.

It can still be improved, but otherwise is a good, fun game.  I advise caution early on, as you should not assume your men will naturally move to where they're told 100% of the time.\n\nIt comes off as a more strategic, and more detailed version of Infested Planet, but focused on four people rather than the constant struggle over an expanding map.  There's some deep strategy here, such as when you're on floor 15 of a building and wondering if you have enough ammo to make it to the top... should you search rooms looking for ammo, switch weapons, or keep the fight limited to the hallway?  Also, the skills and personalized teams help to make the strategy more adjustable.  I've focused on strictly an efficient firing team, complete with sniper and explosives experts, only to curse when I could really use a medic and suddenly have to tiptoe to preserve health.\n\nOtherwise, maybe I should have had more medics, or equip a sniper rifle to someone rather than have a trained 'sniper skills.'  These open up the door to future playthrus.\n\nMy one recommendation would be for the developers to look into more difficulty settings.

The menus glitch out almost Pony Island style (although unintentional by this dev) There is this  blinding white light eminating from one or all of the squad members (its hard to tell the white light takes up 90% of the screen) which makes the prologue completely unplayable. I read that it's helmets that are the problem so I skipped the porlogue which allowed me to select a squad member without a chin strap made of blinding white missing textures and that allowed me to play the game.  Thankfully there is a framerate counter at the top of the screen, for some reason, that put the nail in the coffin of this game for me when it read 3 fps and confirmed how poorly the game performed as it chugged along in slide show mode.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AllForTheCookies/recommended/310890/","AllForTheCookies","No Cookies 4 U","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AllForTheCookies/","423 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGot this game after the devs gave a discount for this game if you owned the first game.\n\nThis game is awesome. The first game consentrated on counter terrorism and things of that nature. This game has zombies, but kept the tactical nature of the game (woot!)\n\nImprovements since the first game:\n\n*There is now an "action mode," which is basically a free-movement mode. It kept the command mode from the first game (you have the option of switching to that mode, and really you have to if you want any type of advantage, which you'll need) for implementing group tactics, which is how the game keeps its tactical feel. This game is even better now, and I already liked the first one.\n\n*The tutorial is leaps ahead of the old game (the tutorial is the first stage of the campaign). The old game wasn't hard to learn, but this one is very easy, and the controls seem better, as does the UI in general. I was happy with the old game, this one is just awesome. Keep working hard devs! You're doing amazing!\n\n*More detail/better graphics\n\n*I just started, but it seems to me like there is a story now. Before your story was "Here's your mission; get it done."  This game started like that, but now it's like "There are zombies," which aren't technically zombies I guess, they seem like parasites (from what I can tell so far). And the plight of the people you control is more interesting now, because it goes beyond just one mission. It was a really nice surprise, and a welcome one.\n\nFor people who never played the first one:\n\nPros:\n+Top-down view tactical game that has good controls that actually make real sense for a tactical game. It reminds me of the first Rainbow 6 game, where you could control your entire squad, only the POV is different (I think for a tactical game that both have their positives and negatives, but this one works great for this game)\n\n+Good tutorial to introduce you to the game.\n\n+Multiple methods and directions to approach enemies. Replying missions is enjoyable if you like creating tactics and testing/optimizing/goofing around with them.\n\nNegatives:\nI am admittedly biased. I love this game, and I don't see any downsides to it. If you want to be nit-picky, I guess the POV could be considered simplistic. In some AAA titles, you use fancy gadgets to check the next room (using things like door cameras and what have you), and this game just has a "fog of war" until your characters can physically see into the next room. I think that this accomplished the exact same thing; characters in another room that you can't see? Can't see them until you see them. Also, in first or third person view (as opposed to top down), you feel a little more like you're "in the action," which is nice. But in this game it feels like you're able to make better tactical decisions. So it's a +/-. Having the ability to switch view points would be cool (from top down to third person), but it does not ruin the game by not having it.\n\nPossible negative: I have not seen any, but the dev says it's early access, so there may be bugs or other issues. I did not see any bugs or other issues, but there might be. So there's that to consider.\n\nTL;DR - Would I purchase this game having played it?  Yes. And I'll probably end up buying it for some friends, too. I would highly recommend this game.","February 24, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The multiplayer doesn't work (I talked my friend into buying it so we could play the game together) and whenever I do certain movements and throw satchel charges or a grenade it goes from 60fps to like 10 and occasionally actually makes the game freeze. Then I have to exit and restart a 15 minute mission. In my personal opinion, if you are reading this don't purchase the game right now unless you want to play this alone. I enjoy playing with others the most and that's a 50% reason I purchased this game.\n\nUPDATE!: This game has been great since the patch today 8/1/15. I have had no problems with multiplayer at all. Oddly enough the multiplayer runs better then single player. I know graphical updates are being worked on as hard as possible and i'm sure that will be fixed soon also.\n\nPros\n------\n-Great multiplayer experience\n-Already has a good community of players looking forward to bug fixes\n-Tactical gameplay is amazing online\n-Free play / Stop motion option of engagement\n-Squad naming / character\n-Character skill tree / Freedom of making your character the way you like building through different skill trees.\n(Will be updated as I see more or less of pros and cons)\n\nCons\n-------\n-Obviously a slight multiplayer difficulty for some players\n-Saves still get corrupted occasionally\n-Graphical problems\n-Some buttons do not work after hitting certain ones beforehand\n-Gun parts but no clear crafting system (I may not have gotten far enough to find this)\n-Random bugs that are being worked on.\n\nOverall still a great game.

If you enjoyed Breach & Clear, you'll likely enjoy this one as well. It's open world city with zombies, and bandits running around, and of course the tactical gameplay Breach & Clear originally was. However, it could use some polishing up, the AI is far from perfect, you'll run into bugs if you do decide to buy the game. The verdict?

Yeah, but I'm not about to deduct points for that this early. Is it enjoyable? Hell yes - if you're a fan of the original, you wont go wrong with this. Be active and let the devs know where you find the issues you encounter; become a voice heard and help steer this game from fun-as to more-fun-than-a-fun-thing-can-be.\n\nCons:\nSometimes buildings get in the way (just bad camera angle)\nTeam mates can at times be demented lemmings with the attitude of a 4 year old when it comes to following you out of combat\nIt might feel alittle 'on rails' for some - but I haven't played enough yet, plus there's a online section (still coming)\n\nPros:\nGuns!\nZombies!\nExplosions!\nTactics (real tactics, not like 'this is the alpha AR setup or else you're n00b)\nNPC missions and dialog (sometimes weird)\n\nHope to See:\nMore NPC interaction and rewards/consequences for choices\nMore scrap to help modify weapons\nBalanced skills (I imagine this will addressed as time goes on)\n\nFinal thoughts:\nStill fun, even this early on.

The strategy half of this hybrid I felt was lacking with most of the objectives being possible to clear just using the real-time controls themselves. This may have to do with most of the enemies thoughtlessly running towards you and just ending up getting in your crosshairs instead. As such instead of thinking ahead of time where to position your soldiers and what classes to assign each one and messing around with their stats, one can just play it like simple twin-stick shooter.","October 14, 2015","false","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And it's got zombies...so that's cool.\n\nCons:\nLiterally everything else. It's full of glitches (the most annoying one being when I beat the game on one save file, started another [it has the option to use your previously saved squad to begin again, this time more challenging, which I like the idea of, but didn't choose] and the game suddenly became five times harder. More enemies of a harder class with higher health than the first time I had played it, as if I HAD chosen to restart with my previously saved squad, even though I didn't). Also what makes it worse is that your friendly AI is just plain god-awful. Your allies get caught up on walls should easily just walk around. If there they are behind cover that is taller than waist-high, instead of leaning out or maneuvering around it they just waste ammo by shooting at the wall/truck/whatever cover they are behind. The shotgun is pretty much useless unless you're within kissing rage of the enemies, and the AI will use it at sniper range which, again, wastes your ammo. When you enter new rooms that require a short loading screen (such as in dungeons) you character begins firing for no reason, waisting ammo and alerting anything within earshot that HEY FOUR ARMY RANGERS ARE HERE COME EAT US!!! The maps are extremely poorly designed and the minimap is just barely useable. I spent 70% of my gameplay just wandering around lost. The game never teaches you how to use fast travel, so THAT took me about 5 hours to figure out I even HAD it available (but maybe I'm just stupid). Oh, and you can't delete old saved games. I've looked up on Steam forums how to actually do it and the process is so complicated it's seriously making me think about just deleting Steam and going back to consols like a plebe.\n\nAll in all, I know I have just totally trashed this game, but honestly, I'd play it again. And maybe a third time. But that'd be it because I'd throw my computer out the window.","July 28, 2015","true","16.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I know it is probably for other people than me. I haven't played the original, but I heard that that game is completely different (more tactical, more Rainbow Six-y), so I'm more than certain that you won't need to play Breach and Clear for this game. Unless you are the kind of unimaginative slob that absolutely needs to know the thrilling backstory of Spec Ops Shooty Bro #1 and Shooty Shoot Headshot Bro #3.\n\nIt's an action-RPG with elements of tactical breaching and clearing on it, but the actual strategy gameplay is weirdly tacked onto the act of running around the city with your Shooty Shoot Bros, shooting all the zombies and picking up all the gun attachments you can find. It plays like World of Warcraft: You see a civilian with an exclamation point over their head, you ask them why they have a piece of punctuation attached to their head, the civilian says 'a zombie put it there, a grammar zombie', then you go out with your squad and deliver a bullet lesson to the grammar zombie's forehead, then you get paid in punctuation. Sorry, where were we? Oh yeah, video games.\n\nIt has a very Left 4 Dead feel to it, being that there's a ton of cannon fodder for you and your team to steamroll. There's even specials that require more bullets to kill! Occasionally, you'll have to stop and plan out how you're going to get through this next group of zombies in a gated area, and occasionally it harkens back to its Breach and Clear namesake by having you fight other living humans with guns. You can skip these parts with grenades or, more hilariously, with signal flares that tell zombies where the lunch is at.\n\nSo the bad news is: I think the game is doing half-measures. Half-measures in its open world, half-measures in its storytelling, and really doing half-measures with its interface. It's more of a Diablo open world than a Fallout open world, and that's fine. But the interface makes me think bad things. The skill tree feels geared towards a more different game than the one being played. There's only options to switch between a primary and a pistol secondary, and ammo drops give types of rounds in clumps of three hundred, so only one member of your squad gets to shoot their tricked out shotgun with almost infinite ammunition while your automatic rifle wielding buddies don't get much and only get to fire their dinky pistols in Eat Shitville. This makes tactical encounters really fun!\n\nBreach and Clear: Deadline is not a game I had fun with, but that's because I want more meat out of my roleplaying games beyond slaughtering and mayhem (or at the very least, stellar gunplay). Action RPG dudes or gun♥♥♥♥ers will want to give this a shot, though.","December 12, 2015","false","2.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/310890/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","B&C Deadline is an interesting port of B&C into a zombie story, with both real-time and precise tactical moves, as well as a detailed RPG system and some limite crafting and outfitting. Add this to a zombie landscape where you help survivors fight your way through both zeds and human renegades, in a semi-free-form encounter-based campaign, and you have one heck of a game, if a bit hard.\n\nThe original B&C is purely counter-terrorism... You need to move a 4-men section of CT specialists through various levels in a turn-based mode where they will determine for themselves who to shoot at and when. Your job is to get them there by flanking. In B&C deadline, the zeds don't shoot back, but the renegades will. The problem is there's usually a lot more zeds and some of them can be quite nasty.\n\nThe prologue, which also serves as tutorial, teaches you the basics like movement, facing, first-aid, suppression, and so on.  Now, the system was changed to be pausable real-time. Hit pause to issue orders like move, use special ability, and so on. Or you can move in real-time. The trick of course, is there's almost no cover in real-time so it's only suitable if you run into a handful of zeds.\n\nPeriodically you run into larger herds, and they will rush you. The trick is find enough cover and have your team sufficiently spread out to provide overlapping fields of fire. Flanking shots do a lot more damage than frontal shots. The nasty part is the Zeds can come from all directions, and forgetting to pay attention and move to better cover can be lethal.\n\nYou start having been shot down over a major metro area, and your squad was all that made it. You run around the map for supply crates and bonus crates with special equipment, from armor to gun enhancements, from night viz to first aid kits. And ammo, you can never have too much amo when your'e in a zombie apocalypse. As you try to make it to shelter, you run into loads and loads of zeds.\n\nPlaying this through a few missions makes it clear: turtiling does NOT work. You can't expect to sit behind barriers and shooting to stop the big herds, even with four guns on your side. A grenade would help but you only have so many of them. You have to properly exploit each character's speciality to get through the missions.\n\nAnd there sure are a lot of them, both random and campaign scripted.\n\nThe scrap system is back, but the scraps "dissipate" if you don't pick them up right away. And that is bad for your bottom line, as you need them to upgrade and more.\n\nAll in all, this is a worthy expansion of the B&C franchise.  if you like tactical combat games, and can stand zombies for short bursts, give this a try.","November 17, 2015","true","35.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

It is a very in depth game with tons of options for replay value. I love strategy games but sometimes they feel pretty dry since you just strategize and watch things happen. In Deadline you get to strategize and watch things happen if you want but there is that choice of real time action in which you control a character directly or oversee the action. At first it seems like it will be hard to get the hang of but it really did not take long at all to feel like I had a good grasp of the mechanics. Though I have only played for about 4 hours, there has been a fairly good amount of  tactical variety. Having zombie fights and human fights really switches things up. Overall, Deadline is a great game which I only have a couple of complaints for so far. Firstly, why no female characters? It doesn't really effect gameplay so I don't care that much but when you have a bunch of choices and they are all male it just doesn't make sense. Secondly, I would love to be able to sprint. I know this might change the core gameplay a little too much but maybe if I could just sprint when out of combat so I can get places quicker that would be nice. Overall, though, I am quite pleased with my time in the game so far.

You create a squad of soldiers and fight through wave after wave of zombies; not much more to the story than that, but it works.  The amount of customization isn't astronomical, though being able to name and make each character made me want to hold onto them; this is especially important when every one of your squad members can die permanently.  Having the scavange for supplies due to the lack of regeneration and managing resources made it an enjoyably difficult game, albeit rather unbalanced.

I'm not normally into strategy games like this, but there is definitely an acception with this game, maybe because it's based around zombies and that piques my interest, but nonetheless, this game is a good buy. It has everything you would have in the original B&C game, but with a twist of zombies instead of normal enemies shooting back so it takes a different mindset than what is normally asked for in these kind of games. I have put roughly 2 hours in the game and have only really noticed a couple of graphical issues here and there, things that can definitely be overlooked because the overall gameplay is great and a couple hiccups here and there are fine.","October 13, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a very in depth game with tons of options for replay value. I love strategy games but sometimes they feel pretty dry since you just strategize and watch things happen. In Deadline you get to strategize and watch things happen if you want but there is that choice of real time action in which you control a character directly or oversee the action. At first it seems like it will be hard to get the hang of but it really did not take long at all to feel like I had a good grasp of the mechanics. Though I have only played for about 4 hours, there has been a fairly good amount of  tactical variety. Having zombie fights and human fights really switches things up. Overall, Deadline is a great game which I only have a couple of complaints for so far. Firstly, why no female characters? It doesn't really effect gameplay so I don't care that much but when you have a bunch of choices and they are all male it just doesn't make sense. Secondly, I would love to be able to sprint. I know this might change the core gameplay a little too much but maybe if I could just sprint when out of combat so I can get places quicker that would be nice. Overall, though, I am quite pleased with my time in the game so far. I look forward to playing with a friend and really getting down to the nitty gritty.","October 14, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

You create a squad of soldiers and fight through wave after wave of zombies; not much more to the story than that, but it works.  The amount of customization isn't astronomical, though being able to name and make each character made me want to hold onto them; this is especially important when every one of your squad members can die permanently.  Having the scavange for supplies due to the lack of regeneration and managing resources made it an enjoyably difficult game, albeit rather unbalanced.  I found that several of the skills and items were fairly useless, while others were borderline devestating (can you say free super grenades?)

It reminded me a lot of the old school Xbox games like Conflict Desert Storm and others. As much as I enjoyed it though, its not a game I can recommend. Simply put the game-play is rather repetive, couple with the full price of being $20; just not worth it.\n\nPros:\n-Character-development: You can choose between a variety of classes each with unique perks. This adds some flavor to the game. Additionally characters can be cross trained between classes enabling you to do that demolitionist sniper or whathave you.\n-Audio: Audio is pleasant on the ears. Nothing you'll remember, but it wasnt bad.\n-Loot-This is both a good and bad component for the game. There was a variety of loot offered, however it was laregely hit and miss. I ended up using the same gun for almost the entire game just because I happened to find a powerful one early one. Also the entire game I found maybe 4 snipers total, including the one I started with; which sucked given that one of my characters was a sniper. Only found 6 shotguns, 4 of which were the exact same thing, and the other 2 the exact same thing.\n-Devs: I've seen the Developers making efforts to respond to people's posts. They actively seem concerend and are making an effort, so this is a big win for me, but still not enough to recommend the game.\n\nCons:\n-Loot-Could've been done much better as seen above.\n-Repetiveness-I found a dungeon that was 20-floors. I literally went through room by room, clearing out all 20 floors. It got extremely old, very fast. I would play a few floors for an hour or so before getting bored.\n-Story-You're in a lab! Now back to me again! You're shot down! Go here kill this, grab these supplies. Rinse and repeat ad-nausem. No explanation of the zombie origin, how far the infection has spreaded, etc... Its borderline non-existent. Like Destiny non-existent.\n-Price-Game is NOT worth $20. Max I woulda payed for this is like $5-$10. Just not worth it.\n-Co-Op: Does it Work? No.","July 24, 2015","false","24.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

You've basically seen the rooms a lot by the time you reach the end.*\n- Quests: Uninspired. To a degree, these spec ops guys could be replaced with civilian survivors. They'd likely perform just as well.*\n- Intermission: Walking... Lots of walking.\n- One path labyrinth: Follow road A to reach B.\n- Stealth: It's spec ops way to kick down every single door they come across. Luckily, the immense bang of a boot kicking -Loose- a door of various materials, doesn't make that much sound.*\n- Pathfinding - Non-existent at certain points throughout the game.*\n- Somewhat clunky interface: Retrieving your sidearm has never been so tedious.*\n- Gun modding: It's okay... IF you find a gun with slots to actually add the mods to that is.\n- Women are all men: It doesn't have to be -really- obvious... Just a slight?

A rating dropping like a rock within a few days should be a warning to both customers and the devs, this game doesn't measure up. These negative scores will get worse as more people who are not absolutly in love with the game play it. I suggest a wait and see if this grabbed your interest at some point.\n\nI loved the first B&C game. Not sure what happened here, I know they switched engines. But sticking to the old gameplay would have been a better decision. If they took the first game and added zombies and larger maps to that we would have had something. Here we have a clunky UI that is really not good at all. Camera is also sub-par. Hard to describe almost, the UI just never does what you want it to and fights you all the time. Like you click a soldier for an order, r-click, it stays in that r-clicked menu even after issuing an order. I don't see an order to reload. Stuff just acts weird, the UI just fights you too much and it's frustrating. The gameplay also seems to behave somewhat oddly.\n\nAdd on skills/specialities that seem to be no good vs a few that are good and an overall lack of incentive to keep playing mixed with broken online play you have a game that seems to have come out too early. Unless they massively overhaul the UI and change several core aspects of gameplay to improve them I don't think this game would be worth getting. I expected so much more after the first Breach and Clear, I can understand trying to be innovative but going backwards in many ways is not actual innovation. The devs appear to want to fix it, time will tell how things go. Other games had rough release from Early Access and smoothed over their issues with time, but I thought the point of Early Access was to get those issues before release not after. Regardless things are likely going to get better. If at a later point this game has it's issues ironed out and most common complaints that I agree with are resolved I will likely re-buy it. For now it's a sad 'not recommend' and I will update this review as necessary.","July 22, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","4"

Get a quest at the safehouse, run and shoot, complete the quest, run back, etc. The gunplay isn't that fun, every gun is single-shot or 3-round burst. Mercs will mow your squad of "special forces" soldiers down, and whenever you use the tactical mode, the only thing you will probably be doing is moving your soldiers into position, setting up cones of fire, and occasionally targeting an enemy.\nThe zombies aren't anything new, it looks like they copied special zombies from the L4D series (spitters, hunter, tank, etc).\n\nTL;DR\nIf you want to support the developers (and didn't do so in early access), buy this game, but don't believe this is a finished\nproduct ready for release.\n","July 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

The RPG elements help bring a lot of life to the game with the multiple classes and skill trees. Deadline also does a great job giving it a bit of exploration with the dungeon-crawling style maps. The game has a Borderlands-esque feel to it I might add. It has an interesting interface for you to use to organize your units if you're playing solo that can be a bit tedious to the point that AI would be a bit more welcomed but the system is a good way to micromanage your team so they don't die.

I like the overall design of the tactical system. It's very dynamic and flexible, so it's easy to make quick decisions.

There's even a part that allows the player to freely test their new knowledge. But afterwards in the next level, you're given free reign of the tactical system, and there's a lot that doesn't get covered in the prologue. I felt the game could have benefitted from an informative section that explained some of the deeper mechanics if the player got confused about the UI or simply forgot what was explained to them in the prologue.\nMoving on, I also liked the level of customization provided – from adjusting player abilities to changing the names of the guns. It makes the game more personal to the player; it feels tailored to their experience.\nMy main gripe about this game is its attention to dialogue – of which there is very little. Any dialogue comes in the form of the affirmative quips of the squad members as they perform different actions. None of the characters speak, not even the NPCs. It doesn't feel quite right in a game like this – where there's a lot of supposed communication – to have no dialogue between the characters.\nOther than that – and what I stated earlier about informing new players – this is a solid game.

You just need to manage your squad well and save some ammo they run out really fast :)","February 5","true","19.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

So much so that I gave this game the benefit of the doubt. I assumed the bad reviews were caused by the inevitable criticism geared towards sequals of popular games. However, after playing myself I see this game has problems. I still actually enjoy it and have tried to play around the bugs, but it's actually impossible. There is a lighting bug which makes this game unplayable. First it stopped me from wearing helmets as they caused the players to turn into glowing bright orbs. Then I started avoiding areas with glowing areas I assume are cause my glowing items. Now I can no longer advance in the game because what I assume are helmet wearing mercenaries. The game screen is so ♥♥♥♥ing bright, I can't even tell if that's the case! I just know the game is now impossible to enjoy.","December 26, 2015","false","16.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Different zombies to perforate, and sometimes they are quite numerous. Human opponents more dangerous than ever.

There are very few hints on how things work, what distinguishes the weapon types, what are the particularities of the zombie classes.\n\nAnd I could forget all of the above if the combat would be interesting, but it's not. The original Breach and Clear had a much more interesting combat system where setting up firing lines, crossfire, flanking maneuvers and getting into cover actually mattered. Here, it feels as if you just move your squad a bit, meet a bunch of enemies, stand still and kill them, then repeat. Someone compared this to XCOM in another review... this has nothing on XCOM in terms of tactical depth, as all enemies behave pretty much the same and squad positioning seems to be perfectly unimportant.\n\nI won't recommend this. It is a pity, though, it feels like this is a good base on which to build a good squad-based tactical strategy game, but there's just not enough depth.","February 8","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/310890/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","There’s a knack to creating the perfect combination; Mac & cheese, The Simpsons and Family Guy, Final Fantasy and Disney. All of the aforementioned combinations work as well with each other as they do on their own. However, it is quite possible to take two separately great ideas and merge them together into a product that, at its most basic level, simply does not work. Bringing me to Breach & Clear: Deadline – a combination that, on paper, makes perfect sense, but falls far short in practice.\n\nA spin-off from 2013’s Breach & Clear, Deadline attempts to take the series in a bold new direction, unrestricted by cramped corridors and closed in spaces. This time around you take control of a group of four troops trapped within a decaying, zombie infested city, shut off from the rest of the world. You’ll have to track down survivors and aid them as best you can, whilst wiping out the undead scourge – all in the hopes of being exfiltrated by your army comrades outside the city.\n\nThe game opens in a laboratory, where you’ve been called in to investigate explosions and rescue any survivors, but it quickly becomes clear that there are unnatural forces at play. Vile creatures have taken over the laboratory, forcing you and your team to beat a hasty retreat. Once you have made it out into the open world, Breach & Clear: Deadline takes a sharp turn from tactical squad shooter, into squad-based action RPG territory. Now you are free to roam the map to look for people to save, missions to take on and zombies to kill.\n\nIn a further departure from the series’ roots, you can control each character individually, such as you would in a twin stick shooter. This new sense of freedom is at odds with the game’s tactical leanings, but proves to be a good fall back when your tactics have failed.\n\nEarly on in the game your squad finds a base camp set up by survivors, and from here you’ll be able to accept new missions, upgrade gear and craft new weapons. Missions are usually “fetch” in nature, where you’ll be asked to go out into the world to recover more supplies for the camp. The missions themselves are fine, if a little cliché, but its Breach & Clear: Deadline’s combat that truly leaves me scratching my head.\n\nThe game is absolutely at odds with itself. It tries to set a creepy, foreboding tone, meanwhile arming your squad to the teeth with an assortment of weapons, explosives and perks. Non-human enemies are usually slow and pose no real threat from a distance, meaning you can quite happily set your squad up in safe positions and let them plug away. When things get tough you can take direct control of a squad member and go to town on them with a shotgun or rifle, making light work of the enemy. There’s no real challenge to the combat. The game lazily tries to make up for this by sending wave after wave of enemies after you, but the high elasticity of your squad means you’ll usually be able to work your way out of a bind.\n\n\nAdmittedly Breach & Clear: Deadline is quite well put together, and on a technical level it ticks all the boxes that it needs to, to make a serviceable product, but its core concept just doesn't make any sense. Its two themes don't fit together well, making its action sequences feel long and drawn out.\n\nI was never quite able to get over just how incongruous a combination Breach & Clear: Deadline is. It certainly isn’t a bad game, it just isn’t that much fun, and lacks the suspense that it tries so badly to evoke. If you’re not a fan of the series there’s no reason to buy this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReviewed with a copy provided by publisher.

As an early access, it currently lacks a tutorial. Also the graphic which displays the button maps does not show up, so you don't know what button does what.\n\nSo, the spiritual successor to Breach and Clear, a turn based tactical squad shooter. Deadline is now real time with the ability to pause time and issue commands, while most controls are standard TPS controls. However this doesn't always work. Why can't I reload while aiming? Why isn't there a crouch? The inventory system isn't exactly simple, and the leveling up is a bit obtuse.\n\nIn it's current state it's a fun game with some interesting prototype mechanics.

Vou pedir meu dinheiro de volta, e talvez, no futuro, se e quando eles consertarem o jogo e o modo co-op funcionar devidamente eu comprarei o mesmo novamente, como eu disse, é um jogo OK, mas não o compre se sua intenção for jogar com seus amigos.","July 24, 2015","false","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flauxhawk/recommended/310890/","flauxhawk","CTi flauxhawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flauxhawk/","627 products in account","Deadline plays in two major modes: an 'Action' mode which bears similiarities to twin-stick shooters - and a 'Tactical' mode (a pause, issue orders, then go system) which allows you to precisely positions your troopers and issue them commands. These commands include using special abilities, directing their fire and utilizing equipment such as grenades and medkits. You have four troopers in your squad recruited from various classes, each replete with their own special abilities (suppression, explosives, etc.) Your characters gain experience and level up from completing missions and slaying enemies such as zombies and mercenaries. They can then expend skill points to unlock new abilities. Characters can even 'cross-class' if they save up the skill points, allowing you to develop more versatile characters. Aside from some of the active abilities the passives include 5% increased chance to crit, 5% increased damage with a particular weapon category or 5% increased health. They aren't spectacular on their own but if you cross-class the right classes you can find some abilities and upgrades that properly complement each other.\n\nWeapons, equipment and weapon modifications can be looted from crates and dead mercenaries. These weapons can also be modded provided they have the slots (up to 3). The weapon mods aren't terribly exciting though - they typically include items such as scopes, gas systems and triggers that either up the fire rate, improve accuracy or improve damage (while typically lowering accuracy). You can also spend scrap (in-game currency) to upgrade armor and weapons. However this just ups DPS or armor value by a set amount and the cost increases with each upgrade. Again, nothing too exciting there.\n\nThe zombies come in a few flavors include shamblers, runners, acid spitters and some big hulking brutes. If you get swarmed your characters will easily be cut down. Luckily if you have a medic you can revive on the spot. Barring that your dead teammates will rejoin you when you visit a safehouse. Safehouses include workbenches for modding and upgrading weapons as well as storage for excess items.\n\nMercenaries are distinguished by the weapons they wield - sniper rifles, assault rifles, shotguns, etc. They too can cut you down pretty quickly if you're exposed.\n\nThere are 'dungeons' of a sort in-game. Certain areas have multiple floors that you can explore for loot and experience. Each level of the dungeon has an exit that takes you back to the starting point regardless of how deep you've made it. In addition they are interspersed with safehouse-like floors that refill health and allow you access to a workbench and locker. I'm not sure how 'deep' these dungeons go (the furthest I could stomach was about 8 floors in the Jupiter Building). Each floor or level isn't particularly different from the previous ones in layout so you do feel like you're exploring the same layout over and over after a few floors.\n\nOverall the game is enjoyable and fun, providing a mix of isometric-style shooting with some tactical direction. There is some character progression and development and while not as deep or exciting as I would like it works, especially with cross-classing. The missions and storyline have you backtracking quite a bit but the devs were kind enough to add in a fast-travel system so you aren't constantly walking back and forth.\n\nTL;DR: Military dudes shoot zambies in action or tactical mode. Level up, find equipment, customize characters.\n\n\nPost-release and patches edit: It seems that the developers have decided to throw in randomized zombie spawns during tactical gun battles with bandits, raiders, etc. While I could understand this as 'sound drawing the zombies to your location' the way it is currently handled is atrocious. I've had zombies spawn directly on top of my soldiers, directly behind with no warning. Previously zombies spawned outside of the combat zone and closed in on your location. Now they seem to spawn on top of you or behind you. This one change requires me to change my review to not recommended. This issue needs to be addressed for enjoyable, balanced gameplay.\n\nIn addition human enemies with firearms can easily sit behind cover and almost never be hit while your own soldiers - behind comparable cover - easily get shot over and over again. There's really no point in trying to do anything other than tossing explosives in these situations as even the slightest attempt at suppression and flanking will see your men shredded within seconds.","July 12, 2015","false","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love that I can play it for a bit and walk away and come right back to it.   Btw to clarify, it is feature complete.  Lots of confusion around this fact.   From deep reads most peeps who have played it thru really enjoy it for what it is; military themed, tactical action game.   Setting is great!  It's not XCOM, but few games are.

To say that only the name relates these to games is almost correct. Breach and Clear had a turn based, tatical feel that was GREAT. It was simple, enjoyable, and offered some customization. Deadline takes this formula through the biggest loop in history. Its now realtime with slow-mo and pause, skill trees were added, and even the aim seems changed. Does that make it a bad game? Not nessesarily.\nBreach and Clear:Deadline feel more like a new game series instead of a second in the series sort of deal. Its buggy, and very unlikely to be fixed ever. It can be very difficult, i had a full squad wipe within an hour and a half. Is the game enjoyable? I bielieve so, and here is why. It is a tatical rpg that is not afraid to take you to pound town. Is it Dark Souls hard? Sometimes, but i don't think so. The game is an aquired taste, you eithier enjoy it or you don't. If the developers atually came back and fixed it, the game could easily be up next to even Stellaris for sales. I will recommend this with a small stipulation, go and watch some videos and don't buy it on name alone. Its a good-mediocore game, its just needs some love, fixes, and attention to prosper.","May 19","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will either enjoy it or you won\'t.\n\nWith that said lets jump in\n\nYoure basically a squad of special forces trying to get stuff did.\nYou fight zombies, special zombies MUTANT ZOMBIES I DERSAY.\nYou command a squad of four people, there are five classes (6?) I believe. Each class has its own signature weapon, Assault Rifles, LMG\'s, Shotguns, Snipers and submachine guns.\nEach class has roughly 3-5 active abilitites that let them do stuff.\nA lot of times when dealing with enemies its pretty rock paper spock lizard demon, I.E there are multiple ways to deal with them. BUT that doesn't stop you from branching into other classes skill tree's or their weapons. Infact you can build your team however you want, Example: Four demolitionst with LMG's, suppression and medic skills.\n\nThere is real time that lets you run and gun and a tactical mode. Tactical mode lets you pause, issue orders, move your squad e.t.c Just a piece of advice, you can change it from holding down the key to keep it running to a toggle, just learned this five minutes ago.\n\nIn addition, while the storyline is somewhat linear, espically the begining, they have multiple procedural generated dungeons for funsies.\n\nAlso, if you do get this game, make sure to right click on the .exe in the steamfiles and make sure you are using your dedicated graphics card not your integrated. My biggest turn off was for a while I couldn\'t play this as it would run at 5fps, I know its horrible. I learned my Nividia card didn\'t always activate thanks to Mordheim, and now I sit at a steady 30-45, again not the best but its an improvement.\n\n\nOverall I love this game, its quaint, its unique, its a specific niche game that I enjoy because its simplistic nature. I also love it cause not many games give you the real time/pause tactical squad based gameplay, Red Solstice single player being my other favorite of this genre.\n\nJust to summarize, watch lets plays, know that this is a specific niche game, it is not for everyone, bugs and issues do exist, and a few can be personally fixed.","June 1","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
