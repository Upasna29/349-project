This one's a bit rough in the UI department (the menus are bad and difficult to explore with a gamepad) but it's gameplay is rock solid. And by "rock" I mean that the game will kick your ♥♥♥ repeatadely before you get good at it. It brilliantly conveys the feeling of a ring fight without taking itself seriously. Fighting system is simple but not simplistic - if you mash the same attack for a longer time each fighter will notice this and change his (its?) tatic accordingly. It all comes down to timing and proper strategy. As it should.\n\nThe writing is good (even though most won't even bother to read the text), graphics are okay. The music fits the theme perfectly. What's more important is that it's really fluid and it controls well during actual gameplay. I recommend using a 360 pad - it's easier to hammer both triggers than to mash the keyboard.\n\nWell worth its price. I got it on Indie Royale as soon as it appeared. Played it on Desura before, really happy to see it on Steam.","November 25, 2013","true","1.0"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","0"

There are a few places in which it falls short, though it does shine in a few spots as well.\n\nThe art style is a probably a personal preference, but I liked it. The beasts are just wacky enough without falling into the realm of ridiculous. Animation is a little stiff, but it works. Keep in mind that this is a $4.99 game and it is not trying to be AAA. But, hey, Punchout was no "looker" either, right?\n\nNow, where BBT falls just short of "Punchout", in my opinion, is in the gameplay. I played it with a wired 360 pad and it felt great using the two triggers in combination with the thumb stick for movement and punches. I'd have to level my criticism mainly at the lack of complexity in the enemy fighters. While each has a signature attack, it's not hard to win each fight with the same jabs and crosses. Once you defeat the game, a game+ mode unlocks and it does get a little tougher from there, but the action remains pretty straightforward.\n\nOne thing BBT does well is that it presents you with many training options that allow you to boost your stats with money earned from fights. Watch out though, because it's fairly easy to overlevel and fights become even easier. You may also purchase new gear that changes the look of your fighter (in-menu... all fighting is done first-person) and gives you even more stat boosts.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the game. There aren't many games in this genre, so fans will probably want to check it out.","December 14, 2013","true","4.0"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","2"

It controls pretty much the same way as those games and it has the same looks as PunchOut and actually manages to look a bit cooler thanks to the variety in opponents, even if there are only 12 of them.\n\nThe game really is beautifully rendered, but the fact that the backdrops and the crowds are in 2D is a bit disappointing.\n\nYou can use the mouse or controller to land your punches and there's an extensive tutorial to help you ease into the game. Except that, by the game you reach the 10th opponent - and at the same time the last tutorial - the game is almost over. Yes, there's a New Game+, but it's still a shame if you're not into stuff like that, or simply do not have the patience to go through it again.\n\nDefeating opponents rewards you with money. Money that can be used to upgrade your character by training at the gym or by buying equipment. By the time you reach the last opponent you're probably already strong enough to take him down the first time. My advice; don't spend your money on equipment, just use the money at the gym to make your character stronger.\n\nI praise the developer for not letting me grind in order to defeat the last opponent. But at the same time I wish it was made more difficult. Because Beast Boxing Turbo is a fun game, but a short one. Two hours and you're done with it.\n\nI really, really, really hope there'll be a sequel, with more opponents, a better tutorial system (or more opponents after the tutorial) and more incentive to keep fighting (or to do rematches).\nEven with its 2 hours of playtime BBT has become one of my favorite games.\n\n[Rating: 84/100]","November 30, 2013","true","2.1"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

I won't bore you with details but I will say that though this is a fun game, it's far too easy to complete.  Even the NewGame+ was a cakewalk.  And, the lack of any real punch variety makes the fights feel like deja-vu over and over again.  No special moves/punches, no southpaw, and no real sense of accomplishing anything through training accept for making a number larger are all dissapointments as well.

To be fair it's up against some stiff competition, but to this day SPO is still an incredibly fun and polished gem that has sadly faded from most people's memories. The developers of Beat Boxing Turbo clearly remember it though, with their game being clearly and highly inspired by Nintendo's boxing puzzle game, with a bit of Fight Night mixed in for a colorful arcade feel that reminded me why I miss SPO so much. It's in no way a perfect replacement, but it's an admirable effort and a surprisingly fun time!\n\nSo you want to box? Well tough luck, human, there's no place for your kind in the ring! Under a disguise though no one would stop you, and thus you enter the world of beat boxing in an attempt to make a name for yourself and prove humans have a place in the sport.\n\nAs the name suggests, this isn't straight boxing, but somewhere between the over the top feel of the before mentioned Punch Out and a simple arcade recreation of the sport. Your collection of moves is small and the way to utilize them equally limited, but you're given just enough variation to be able to plan out various moves, and counter the attacks of your beastly enemies (which true to form all have their own special attacks and fighting styles). It's easy to learn and honestly pretty easy to master as well, which actually becomes an issue after a point as fights become cake walks and the CPU's way to counteract this is to rely on cheap hits and forcing you into corners that never feel particularly fair. It's disappointing the difficulty fluctuates from such extremes, but when it's not beating you in the face without remorse the ease of conquering your opponents never became hugely unsatisfying.\n\nAs a budget priced game there have been some obvious cuts and as a whole the amount of content here is slim. Perhaps most disappointing is the absence of any multiplayer mode, which seems an obvious addition that could have extended the hour or so story mode a lot further. Other issues arise in the clunky combat, that isn't a problem generally but on higher difficulty levels leads to a lot of cheap KO's. Some recycled character models/frames are a bit tacky as well, but the cartoon artstyle mostly makes up for the corners that have been cut off the presentation.\n\nIrregardless, Beast Boxing Turbo is worth recommending if only for how unique it is to the platform, and for how fun it is while it lasts. It's far from the classic that is Super Punch Out!!, but as that is a sequel itself perhaps it's only a matter of waiting for Beast Boxing 2 for it to reach that point.\n\nIn the meantime I'll be over here punching pigs in the face.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","August 16, 2014","true","2.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","3"

The combos don't feel as tight and timing isn't as strict, but it is the closest thing you can get to punch out without having to fire up an emulator. The beast design is good, and while the story doesn't win any awards, it never gets in the way. Having to grind  for equipment and stats to beat the final boss is a nice touch to extend the game, but with only 12 monsters you will probably just play until you get strong enough to finish him off. The new game mode increases the difficulty, but appears to only increase the stats of the monsters, not really their moves or attack styles. Equiping items is a pain too, you have to scroll through items one by one, in no order sorting out all your items in your head. Slots for each equipment piece would be better, but you can visibly see your equipment change in the menu as well as in the ring, which was a nice touch.","December 13, 2013","true","0.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

And surprisingly - Beast Boxing Turbo is representing the last type.\n\nFirst of all - gameplay is gorgeous. From the very beginning. Control is simple and intuitive (you need to pass through tutorial, but it's painless). Every match is very engaging and entertaining - some of them can be considered as too easy though, due to limits of AI (you can find some gaps in behaviour of your opponent), but don't worry - overall, it's still challenging experience.\n\nIt's incredible, that with relatively small amount of mediocre graphic  you can have so much remarkable and well animated characters. It's for sure not the most beautiful game in Steam library, but believe me - it's not bothering at all.\n\nI really like music in this game - some themes are so memorable, that I like to listen them even long after beating the game.\n\nAs you probably guessed, this game is not too long. And that's unfortunately true. It has some replayability value, but still - I really would like to see more in-game opponents and multiplayer mode, but unfortunately, it seems that we can't count on any of those things in future.\n\nNevertheless - just for satisfactory and juicy gameplay I can recommend this game without hesitation.

Bouncing around the house with a lot of energy makes me want to expel it in different ways. I'm not a boxer myself but thinking about it made me remember this game and I'm glad I did.\n\nBeast Boxing Turbo is a fun little fighting game. There aren't many boxing games out there but this is one of the good ones. Your character's story is that she wants to participate in the Beast Boxing fight circuit but since humans aren't allowed you're fighting incognito. Your goal at first is just to prove you're as good as any beast as you just want to be accepted but of course you turn out to have mad boxing skills then get the idea that you can actually be the best. A rags to Rocky story if you will.\n\nControls are tight and even though you can get by with pretty much just jabs you face an good variety of fighters that have their own unique moves and fighting styles. You fight in a first person view reminiscent of Super Punchout, if you're old enough to remember that. You can also buy equipment and train to increase your skills. I play this with a gamepad and the controls feel natural and responsive.\n\nIf there was one area I feel that this game falls a bit shot in is that I would have enjoyed if the training exercises included a short mini-game of some sort so it adds a bit of play time and variation to just straight boxing matches. Another thing I feel that could have been a bit of an improvement was if there was some need to use other punches besides the jab. You can do uppercuts and hooks. Even though those punches are more effective when they do hit they tend to be slower and easily dodged by the majority of the opponents you face.\n\nOther than that this game is fun to play albeit is pretty short. One playthrough will take you about 90 minutes. There's no grinding involved. The story is peppered with humor and the characters you face have a surprising bit of personality as well. Overall it's a really good boxing game.","April 24, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/259490/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: A fun action boxing game with a short career mode.\n\nSet in an alternative universe with slums, aliens and monsters, you become the slum girl who wants to participate in the beast boxing tournament: boxing for monsters and only monsters, because humans are viewed weak and not up to the challenge. Thus a human wouldn't be able or even allowed to try their brawn in the ring. How's the girl going to fight the discrimination? Dressing up as a monster, of course!\n\nThe fight for equality aside, the story is very basic with the unlikely protagonist rising and training hard to become a champion. Albeit basic and familiar in a sense, the story is still very nicely presented and interesting to see through. Music and sound effects fit the setting well.\n\nThe game itself is really fun action boxing! One important thing keeping you hooked until the end is the career mode, which is also the main mode of the game. You start fighting in rings against lowest of the lowest opponents and even in higher difficulty levels the opponents will easily fall in front of you. Not going to how this is fairly unrealistic (the protagonist being a teenager against bigger monsters), but the fights sure are a lot of fun. It's surely not a simulation but it's not trying to be one anyway: for realism you might want to look elsewhere.\n\nThe opponents are talking pigs, aliens, turkeys, all kinds of vaguely bipedal fantasy monster races. There are even some ridiculous ones like a skeleton and a treeherd. They are hilarious and fit the theme well. All opponents have different attributes, like strength, health and speed and their own special attacks. Other than that, they are a bit too similar. There are basically just two archetypes: the speedy one and the heavy hitter, who might or might not require a different tactic to beat them depending on your difficulty setting.\n\nFighting is straightforward and easy to understand and works like fluid playing with a keyboard. You (and your opponents) may attack with any of the more or less familiar boxing strikes, like jabs or hooks. It's important to keep track of your stamina, which drains when punching or taking hits but also replenishes fast when not attacking. You win a round by emptying the opponent's health bar by landing punches and not letting the opponent do the same to you by blocking and dodging.\n\nThe AI can be nasty: it fights you giving fast punches when you're preparing for a strong strike and doing heavier hits when you are down. It even learns to anticipate your strikes if you don't change your strategy often enough. It was still fairly easy to shoot a hook at them when they're approaching and they would almost never see that coming, even when repeating the action.\n\nOne thing about the AI bugs me though: when the opponent is low on health they'll retreat to a corner. They will stay there so you have to follow them. When you do, they will always give you a punch or two and then retreat to the opposite corner. This exploitative tactic was really annoying when trying to finally down the opponent and call it a round.\n\nIn the story you get a couch who teaches you some important techniques (i.e. game mechanics) in the practice (tutorials). As the story goes on, your previous opponents decide to join your dojo and teach you more things. This is a nice and convenient way of handling the tutorials.\n\nAs you progress you win money, which you can use to train and buy equipment. The monster boxing rules don't seem to mind the fighters having some extra equipment while in the ring, though they are otherwise honourable to the basic rules of boxing. The equipment makes you e.g. stronger or faster but can also penalize you while giving higher bonuses to other things. Likewise, training naturally also makes you stronger and helps you especially when facing the highest tier foes.\n\nIf you really get into the game there is the endless mode, in which you just fight opponent after opponent without healing or upgrades until you inevitably drop, trying to last as long as possible. You can then track your score on global leaderboards and compete for the highest place.\n\nHaving only 12 opponents, the game is unfortunately quite short: myself, I finished it (all achievements) in 4 hours and having played through New Game++: the career mode can be start anew with the previous upgrades but stronger opponents. Still, this can only last so far.\n\nFor longevity it would need more opponents, a longer career mode and more distinct difficulties (frankly I saw little difference between normal and hard). Perhaps playing different characters or having multiplayer would be cool as well. Here's for hoping there will be a sequel that addresses at least some of these issues.\n\nFor the glorious full price of 5 bucks though the price is still good, and on sale it's even better! For the short time it lasted for me it was a blast, an excellent choice for killing a few hours for fun.","August 20, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

However I'll also say that the Continue+ mode, Endless mode and several difficulty levels mitigates this as well as it can.\n\nI usually judge a game based on 5 criteria, listed in order of important: Gameplay, Controls, Replayability, Sound & Graphics.\n\nGameplay: As many people before me have said this is definitely an homage to Punch Out from the slew of eccentric and quirky characters to the first person boxing mode. The gameplay though is very tight. The AI doesn't feel like it cheats, there's no psuedo difficulty or anything of that nature. The AI learns from your patterns and which attacks you're using most and will guard against it in the current and next round, forcing players to avoid a specific pattern or style of play.\n\nControls: You can rock the keyboard or you can rock a gamepad, fully customizable and absolutely no complaints here. Controls are such an important part of a game, they can make a game or break it and while you might think it's standard practice to allow customizable controls, it's the few games that don't that stand out like a sore thumb. Thankfully this game isn't one of them.\n\nReplayability: As long as you're in the mood for the game, there's content there to play. From exhibition missions to completing/replaying the story, or trying your hand at endless mode. The only thing I can foresee ruining this is becoming bored with the game itself which will happen, as with most games, eventually.\n\nSound: The sound effects are definitely on point and the music is about what you'd expect: standard background music that you actually hear for a few minutes and then start tuning out after that.\n\nGraphics: The graphics for this game are great. They're not super polished high end but for what they are they look awesome and I had a ball seeing new characters and the blending of art for story and 3d in the ring.\n\nOverall on a scale of 0-10, I'd give this game an 8.","May 8, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You dream abotu one day becomming a beast boxer yourself. But there is one problem: you are a human from the slums and humans are not allowed to compete. So you buy a monster costume and trick your way to a qualifying match for the Bush League, the lowest league there is.\nAnd that is where the game starts and you start to jab, cross, hook and uppercut yourself to fame and fortune. And eventually realize that youa re fighting for more than just your dream, but human rights and the place of humanity in a beasty world.\n\nThe controls are fairly simple, be it controller or keyboard, requiring only either an analogue stick and two buttons, or the arrow keys and two punching keys. As you progress through the game, you are tought to block, dodge, counter and preserve your stamina through a series of optional tutorial fights.\nThere are 12 opponents in total to unlock and you can do exhibition matches against any opponent you have defeated. Every fight nets you cash. This you can use to buy better equipment and to train your skills. Sometimes you may need to take a step back and practice with weaker opponents, earn some cash and upgrade your equipment before being able to proceed through harder leagues.\nOn normal difficulty, the story mode took me just under 3 hours. There is a New Game Plus though where opponents are tougher, faster and hit harder.\nAnd there is an Endless mode, where you can test your boxing skills and see how long you can last.\nThere can be a bit of frustration when opponents seemingly hover just outside your reach and none of your punches connect. But perseverance will see every beast that gets in your way K.O. on the ground.\n\nOverall a very fun little game that keeps entertaining far beyond a single playthrough.","April 14, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game mechanics work well, the character design is great, and the minimal storyline is fun. Would I reccommend a playthrough? Certainly. For $5, a game of monster boxing is certainly worthwhile.\n\nThat being said, however, there is the frequently mentioned flaw of the game being too short. In one sitting, I managed to purchase every item, max out all my stats and plow through all of the "campaign". It didn't take long to use up the entire game's playability, and the "endless" mode gets boring really fast. I played through it twice and quickly lost interest after that.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is that the game is painfully easy. I finally stopped playing when the game asked me if I wanted to play through "NewGame Plus 11". The big problem here is that this game can be destroyed using a strategy a five year old could master. In NG+7, which is supposedly the maximum level of difficulty available, I, being someone who is not at all a major gamer, managed to beat the first five characters in a row without them being able to so much as pull off a single punch by doing little more than button-mash jabbing right as the fight started. If a character can't be simply annihilated in five seconds that way and they start blocking, you move off to the side, take advantage of reach with a single hook, and then begin mashing again. Repeat this until you get the fire-glove power, which eventually makes it so you virtually can't lose, and then pummel jab until the fight ends. If you can time this without getting caught in some combo or running out of steam, you honestly can't lose. I was running the entire story mode in under fifteen minutes. It is mindlessly easy to master, and after the NG+1, which was the only time playing the game I felt even mildly challenged, the fun bled out. It was mechanical and I knew what was coming.\n\nDespite this major issue in playability, I would still highly suggest giving the game a run. Perhaps, like all other games on Steam, it would be best to wait until it goes on sale. Even if not, what fun is there is worth five dollars. Start on easy mode just so you can suck all the enjoyment out of it, enjoy the humor and the conversations between the characters when you play it for the first time, try to get the highest accuracy rating you can rather than just trying to win....there is some worthwhile enjoyment here, as long as you understand ahead of time what it is you are getting into with this title.","December 8, 2013","true","7.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I highly recommend starting in hard mode, as that is where the game truly shines. A sequence of tutorials will guide you through some of the more advanced combat mechanics as you progress.\n\nOpponent design is the biggest strength of this game, given it's much more interesting fighting a treeman than some professional (human) boxer you probably haven't heard of before anyway. Each enemy comes with his own personal finishing move and tasteful flavor text.\n\nLast but not least a reasonably diverse upgrade system serves to tie the short fights together, giving you long term equipment goals to fight for, as well as allowing you to cheaply boost your power in the gym, should you be struggling with an opponent in the short run.\n\nThe games main weakness is ultimately it's length, provided there are only twelve adversaries to fight in total. This shortcoming is unfortunate, but very much acceptable given the game's budget price. Same goes for the music.

Telling the story of a girl who wants to beat the living daylights out of the Pro-Boxers of Beasthalla - you punch your way to victory. Boxing in the ring feels fast and responsive, with alright feedback too. I am only missing visible damage (bruises, black eyes, nosebleed - that kind of stuff) and there are no different animations for different types of knockouts. The fighting engine is decent, but not overly complex - especially in the easier modes you can simply "bruteforce" your way to victory if you keep dodging every once in a while. Later on, and particularly in NewGame Plus things become more interesting as gear, training and tactics in the ring play a much more integral role in overcoming the beastly boxers.\n\nUnfortunately, the training- and gear-screens make it obvious that this was once a mobile game - you will be forced (sooner or later depending on what you spend your prize-money on) to grind for money in exhibition matches, which was a bit of a downer. And as soon as you hit max-level for your various stats or finish the NewGame Plus there is not a whole lot to do besides starting over or doing "endless"-mode (which is basically survival) and the game is rather short. Until you hit that point in the game however, it is a fun and fast experience, telling a charming story with enjoyable characters. It's looking pretty cool too, I like the style and the monster designs - it could be a bit flashier in its presentation though. Same goes for the audio, which is lacking, well, punch.\n\nDespite it's flaws, it is still a pretty cool little game, and a nice debut from Goodhustle Studios - if you want something different for your Steam Library, you could do worse than Beast Boxing Turbo.","January 5, 2014","true","2.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This isn't like Punch-Out.\n\nBeast Boxing Turbo does not use the usual 3 K.O. for a TKO.  This game uses the fighting formula for winning a fight(I.E. 2 KO's).\n\nYou and your opponent have regenerating health bars and stamina.  Taking a blow reduces the maximum amount of health you can have indicated by the red bar.  Stamina dictates your power and how many punches you can throw before you tire yourself out.  Tiring yourself out is not good because your speed will drop, making your punches and movement slower.\n\nThe story has 4 leagues from the easy to beat to opponents that are able to react faster than you.\n\nFor those looking for a bit of a challenge normal difficulty does not give that.  I beat all my opponents with some relative ease on normal.\n\nAfter each fight you get coins which are used to purchase equipment and upgrading your stats.  Once you beat an opponent they are available on exhibition.  This mode allows you to farm for less coins but still a good way to grind for them should you need coins to fight the next opponent.\n\nI really find this game to be very fun.  Kinda short on Normal but fun nontheless.\n\nWords not enough to convince?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/259490/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","I was very pleased to see this game after playing Punch-out! (Mike Tyson's Punch-out!, for the NES), as it's not the type of game you often see.\n\n\nDon't buy it thinking it's Punch-out. It's actually a significantly different game, with different mechanics, that stands on its own! If you enjoyed it, you'll probably like this one as well, but they're fundamentally different game.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll now say what I like and what I don't like.\n\nThe most obvious think here are the graphics. The game has quite a lot of character to it, and the visual style of the game suits it surprisingly well. Although the models are questionable (you can see the polygons clearly in some characters and animations), the textures manage to hide that pretty well, and make the game look awesome!\nPersonally, I think the game looks great, but it might not be your thing... I guess you can decide that from the screenshots.\n\nAs a segway... the music. It's very good! And it's varied enough, each stage giving a different vibe, matching the opponent as well. One complaint I have it that the music doesn't loop very well, most of the time. In combat I didn't really notice it much (maybe because there wasn't enough time to notice), but on the menus it's pretty apparent... and feels awkward. I think there could've been more polish into the ending and starting of the tracks.\nOther than that, it's awesome, good job!\nSoundEffects weren't really something I enjoyed a lot. I found them a little annoying at times, with some high-pitched sounds, but they're bearable.\n\nNow, a problem I've had with this game was the Interface. The style of the menus were a bit out of place, but that's not the main problem. Navigating through them is slow and unintuitive with a controller. I guess a mouse helps it greatly (since this is a PC), but for a game like this, I prefer using the controller.\nAlso, key bindings were very awkward with the shared functionalities.\nWhen you change a certain key, it might have 2 functions at once, which you can't change separately... that makes it weird with a couple of keys. I think the game would have benefited quite a lot from having all the keys able to be rebound, and a reworked interface. Ah well...\n\nOptions menu was a bit lackluster as well, but at least it had separate audio sliders... That's a plus and some games fail royaly.\n\nSo, all in all, presentation was pretty good, despite having a clunky interface.\n\n\nNow about the gameplay. In this, you have essentially 3 modes: Carreer, which is separated in Tournament and an Exhibition Modes. Then you have Endless.\nIn the carreer mode, you can upgrade your character by buying attributes, and equipment. Each piece of equipment has its benefits and its downgrades, letting you create your own sets for different situations. I didn't really like this, for the simple reason that it makes for a not as balanced game. If there were no upgrades, you would have to play like in the old days, memorizing patterns, and actually train to beat a game. In this, if you lose a couple of matches, you can just buy your way to victory, in a way.\nBut... this is a different type of game, so I guess I shouldn't be complaining about that. It works for this game, letting the player create his own pacing in a way, and giving the game some customization, so I think it's good... even if I don't like the notion of it.\n\nIn Tournament Mode, you have 4 leagues, each with 3 opponents. Each opponent has his own fighting style and backstory (which I enjoyed greatly, not swarming you with text, but letting their personalities go through small but to the point catch-phrases and fighting style, well done!). These get progressively harder, as one would imagine. You gain currency at the end of each fight, receiving a smaller amount when you lose.\n\nIn Exhibition Mode, you can fight whoever you've fought before, for a smaller amount of currency. This was there in case the player was having difficulty defeating an opponent, then grinding a bit and upgrading his equipment/stats. I didn't really need that, but we'll get on to that further.\n\nFinally, in Endless Mode, you find in Rounds of just 1, trying to go through as many opponents as you can. As you fight, coins drop on the floor, which you can use in Carreer Mode, or to buy Health during the Endless Mode, as you don't gain health after each round.\n\nI actually enjoyed the game's structure quite a lot! Although, it was pretty short for me. Either way, for 5€, it was enough... and a lot of fun.\n\n\nNow, the most important part of the game: the combat.\nI have several issues with it. But, it was fun as hell while it lasted! And it's deeper than it seems when you start playing.\nYou can do Jabs (left-handed fast, but weak punches), Crosses (slightly slower but stronger right-handed punches), Uppercuts, and Hooks as attacks. Your objective is to figure out which ones work the best against the different opponents, and then doing combos with these.\nThe great thing is that opponents start defending against your combos if you use always the same, so it pushes the player to experiment with different tactics.\nAnd defense, you can Block, and you can walk Sideways (this walking sideways is my biggest complain, instead of a dodge ability). When you Block, you still lose HP, but a smaller amount, and you can lower that by upgrading a certain attribute.\n\nEach fighter has HP and Power (which is essentially a Stamina Bar). Whenever you attack, or Block, you lose Power. If you use it all, you'll get very, very slow, and won't be able to attack nor block appropriately. This makes the player be a bit more careful when to attack and block, creating a good pacing to the fights. However, the slowing part of running out of energy, is often not being able to escape attacks fast enough, even by walking sideways. That sometimes got awkward and frustrating during a couple of fights, but it's a question of being careful when managing attack and defense.\n\nIn regards to HP, you have a general bar, you have one that depletes faster, but also regenerates. This creates an awesome dynamic in combos: the bigger the combo, the more impact it may have. You can finish the fights really quickly if you combo your attacks wisely, but they can also end fast for you if not careful. When you're hit, this alternative bar lowers faster, but it regenerates up to a point when you're not being attacked. This was unexpected, but great design, well done!\nOne big complaint I have with the combat, it the lack of connection. Due to the sideways walk and the animation, punches sometimes don't connect when they feel like they should. If you slightly to the left/right, you can still see the punches hit the opponent, but it doesn't register. This leads to some awkward moves and makes it almost feel unfair, but it's not so bad once you get the hang of it. Still, I don't like it and I think it should be reworked if the developers make a sequel.\n\nAchievements were mainly straightforward, but some were pretty creative, which I appreciate.\nLack of multiplayer is a fault, in my opinion, since you can complete the game within 5-6hours without too much of an issue... but hey, it's 5€! And it's pretty good either way! Maybe more in a future game!\n\nAnother thing was the difficulty... I started the game on Hard, and it actually was hard when I started. But once I got used to the controls and developped a tactic, the difficulty has fallen quite a bit. Then there was NewGame+ which was surprisingly easier, with no difficulty options this time. Only 3 fights gave me a fairly hard time (due to very strong punches), but other than that, it was very easy in the NG+.\n\nBut, it was challenging at times.\nSo, if you're curious about the game, I'd definitely recommend it. It has its flaws, but it was a very enjoyable, and at times challenging game. And it's not very expensive, so you wouldn't lose all that much for trying it!\n\n","February 15, 2014","true","5.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

As a Punchout sucessor, it fails miserably.  The control style is totally different, there is little focus on attack patterns, there are no specials, and you run away to dodge instead of actually watching your opponents moves.\n\nPutting that comparison aside, it's a fun little romp, if you enjoy arcade style boxing games.  Personally, I love them.  Even bad games in the genre can be pretty fun, and this one is pretty decent with a unique personaility.  The emphasis on chains over countering is a decent, if unprefered, twist, and the RPG elements keep the game escalating in its early stages.  Controls are responsive, and beating down an opponnent with no mercy is satisfying (a redeeming feature in a game where you can easily be overleveled).\n\nIt's biggest fault is that it relies too heavily on it's RPG elements to manage progression, so your foes will quickly go from being too hard, to just right, to way too easy.  Other complaints include a limited number of opponents, and a lack of advanced blocking / dodging strategies.\n\nSo it's kind of fun and a little lacking, i.e. it's a $5 game (SRP).  I can easily list off a dozen games I've payed more for on sale and enjoyed less.","July 22, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing but their own two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fists (beneath padded gloves as per beast boxing regulations).\n\nThis is the world of Beast Boxing, where newcomer and secret human Char must train herself to win against a dozen other fearsome monsters, including: a "Fitness Skeleton", a pig in a Santa costume, and a turkey. The game is short, lasting about 2 to 4 hours worth of gameplay, depending on how much you grind or repeat levels. Likewise, the game only has a dozen stages/opponents, which are reused for the game's endless mode. However, this is reasonable considering the game's base price of CDN$5.49\n\nPlus, if you consider the gameplay, then this game is well worth the price! Every match in this game is a punchy haha fast-paced slugfest where quick reflexes and thoughtful movements are necessary for an assured victory. The sensation of jabbing and strafing, seeking the right moment to unleash a flurry of fists, keeps every fight exciting. And as an additional bonus, the wacky art designs and quirky animations makes every fight visually amusing.\n\nThis game is an appreciative nod to Nintendo's Punch-Out, and if you need quick sessions of boxing action to fill in the smaller gaps in your schedule, this game is an ideal contender. I give this two boxing gloves up, and eagerly await the starting bell for this game's sequel!","April 23, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW GREAT THIS PREMISE IS.\n\nBoxing. Monsters. You click buttons, and then your fists go punch punch, and then you hit the monsters and they make silly sounds. I could not possibly be any happier about this arrangement.\n\nWhile this game is not ambitious, the execution is awesome. Funny dialog, great monster modeling, bad-♥♥♥ skull armor upgrades, and enjoyable, if not very deep, arcade boxing combat. This is a great example of a successful game vignette -- it's brief, but everything provided is well polished and serves to explore the game's premise.\n\nI love this game. The three hours of game play reflects two complete story playthrough, mostly not by me. The first game was a hotseat game where I swapped out with a number of friends on each fight. The second playthrough was mostly one friend that decided to play everything again on hard mode. I am content with this experience as it stands, and probably won't ever play this game again, unless there's people to show it to.\n\nAtriplemonsterplus, am completely satisfied with this purchase.","June 27, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I didn't expect was a great game that I'm definately going to be playing again very soon. The story is that you are a human disguised as a monster working your way through the ranks. The game is very good, the sound effects, visuals and music is very modern and nice. The story consists of 12 Matches, which isn't that long as you can finish the matches in about one or two minutes. Endless mode is fairly good but it feels like a bit of a grind at times. Story/Campaign is the cheesiest thing ever and needs a bit of work, however I definately reccomend this game, especially at a nice, comftorable price of £4","May 14, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think Punch-Out against D&D monsters, with a hefty dose of character advancement (you earn money in fights, which goes to buy equipment and stat enhancements).\nThe game's pretty fun, well written, and looks and sounds great. It's also got buttloads of charm. It's a bit on the short side, but there are a few modes to play through once you're done with the story.\nIf the premise sounds like something you might enjoy, well, go for it.

I won every round on every fight without getting below 50% health on any fight.\nStill, I think its worth the price for the fun it delivers.\n\nps. I played this game with a 360 controller.

While playing for the first time, you can reach the end very fast. But that doesn't matter, all of fun starts on higher difficult levels. Fighting with each monster is enjoyable, and once you will learn all of "tricks" it will be easy ride. Getting new stuff and leveling your stats is also easy. Too bad there weren't more fights, or something that could make you play this endless mode longer than few times. I doubt I will ever want to play this game again but for the time I spend with it, and with this low price (I recommend getting this game on sale) it was a good deal.","May 30","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
