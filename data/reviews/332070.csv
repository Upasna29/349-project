I understand the work that could've gone into a title like this, albeit perhaps work aimed at squeezing every last penny out of a very, very young and impressionable audience. I like to get a good feel for every feature before I pass judgement.\n\nAnd I must say, I have gotten quite a feel for this game.\n\nThe first problem here is that these developers are working with an IP that is very clearly targeted at a young audience. I know a lot of adults who go crazy over Toothless and I'm sure you do, too, but the game is designed in every corner to be aimed at really small kids. They'll get their parents to download it or they'll play in-browser, they'll see the shiny armor or dragons or they'll try to use the farm and lord knows that most kids aren't patient enough to wait 10 minutes for a plant to grow. So they'll get their parents to buy them gems and the money JumpStart wants is made. It's really damn grimy.\n\nThe second problem, ignoring the business model and focusing on gameplay, is that it is very buggy and prone to crashing. In the (at the time of writing) 9 hours I've spent playing, I have crashed while simply jumping around or walking about 6 times. I've frozen at a loading screen 3 times. And my menus have glitched and stayed onscreen with no way to close them about 4 times. That's just 3 kinds of bugs I've run into, and I'm sure only just 3 of many that OTHERS have had to put up with as well.\n\nAnd as far as the questing goes. What the hell? It consists of walking back and forth between movie characters, getting shown a little movie clip sometimes, answering some trivia, and being told to go do the same minigames over and over. Of these minigames I've gotten to play so far, there's a target practice railshooter thing and a flying challenge. Initially you cannot use your dragon to play these, you need to use Toothless every hour for the railshooter, and you have to use another dragon for the flying challenges. For the flying nonsense, there's also a huge repetoire of dragons from the movies/show that you can use as well, but of course, only if you shell out the cash for the lovely microtransactions. And my favorite part of that is that every single one of them is 250 gems (about $2.00)..... except Toothless. He's 500! (about $5.00).\n\nYou can use your own dragon after you level it up and then age it. Teen years are good enough for the railshooter and glide challenges, and then adult is what you need for actual flying stuff. But all this takes "Energy" from your dragon, which you can only replenish by either waiting or by feeding him fish you've caught in the fishing minigame thing. Well I mean, there's also microtransactions to help with the whole energy ordeal, but seeing as so far there've been microtransactions tied to almost every single facet of gameplay, this shouldn't be any surprise at all.\n\nThere's also the farming. The way this works is you have your little plots to plant seeds and you can eventually get coops and pens for some animals like sheep, yak, chickens, and some seasonal stuff as well (at time of writing, turkeys are purchaseable. I own one because of the microtransaction gems you're given for free to start with. Gotta love turkeys, man). All of this works off of a timer. All of it. Every last bit of this is timed, and every single part of it can be "hurried" with microtransactions. Feed your sheep to get it to grow wool. Or feed it, then dish out some gems to make it instantly grow wool. Plant some cool plants and wait a certain amount of time dependent on the plant itself. OR, pay some gems and have that sucker instantly matured (just like real life). Ran out of water in your well for watering your plants? No big deal, gems are god in this land. Pay out a few of them and your well will be full again.\n\nAnd my absolute favorite part about farming (and fishing, but it's not even that notable to explain or talk about in my opinion), my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PART is that there's bounty boards tied to exchanging your farming/fishing goods for money. In every scenario where I mathed out how much I'd be getting back compared to how much gold I was putting in to producing these goods, the amount I was getting back was NOMINAL. It was like 40-50 at absolute maximum for profit, after pumping in something like 100 to begin with. I understand the MMO grind, but take note that you can spend some gems to get a big lump sum of enticing, juicy gold, and realize just what kind of game this is (if you hadn't realized already).\n\nThere are almost no redeeming factors for this game. The fishing is kind of fun (although buying new rods takes gems, and that's just.... god dammit. Just why?), the farming is okay if you're a fan of Harvest Moon-y kind of mechanics, and the flight is kind of fun even if it's really clunky and you get stuck on terrain a lot. That's it. That's all I can think of that I've had fun with in my entire 9 hour first sitting with the game.\n\nIn other words, unless you REALLY, REALLY like this series or you love to laugh at poor, greedy design at every turn (like I do), avoid this title. And honestly there's no reason to NOT avoid it. There are so many good/passable free to play MMOs on Steam now. Go have fun in one of those.","December 6, 2014","false","15.0"," 1,547 of 1,648 people (94%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","94","547","1","69","31"

Many people wrote about how bad it was but as it has dragons in it, I wanted to try it for myself.\n\nSo after having played this what I can say is that every single bad review about this game was true. I've never thought a game could be this laggy or buggy or in other words bad. But this game totally is.\nComments like: "I'd rather climb the huge mountain in kung fu panda in a wheelchair, miss all of it and not become the dragon warrior than play this game again." - They are absolutely true.\nAfter playing this game you may feel a severe lack of will to carry on living. But to be fair and objectively, I will go on with some facts about pros and cons:\n\n\nPros: It has Toothless, the dragon from the movies in it, so if he was your favorite character, this might be interesting.\n\nCons: Almost everything else about the game.\nThe graphics are okay. But it doesn't really matter, when you can't even walk more than two steps before the game crashes. When you finally can fly with your dragon, it is so slow that you can do laundry, go to the toilet, make dinner, go shopping and load a website with Internet Explorer, before arriving at the next destination.\nIt's the same with loading screens. They are so long, that i almost forgot i had the game running in the background a few times.\nThe reason I called it School of Payment is simple: You log in and half of the screen wants you to buy a membership, gems or a starterpack.\n\n\nNevertheless I had at least a bit fun playing this, I am not that big farmer, but without paying anything, it was the fastest and easiest way to get gold in the game. So I bought a few plants, sheep and chicken. Nearly sounds like fun, doesn't it? And it could be so much more fun, without the crashes which caused that my chicken, sheep and plants were gone without getting the money for them back. So I was trying to get gold without wasting money on this game. I tried to give this game a real chance. But it really didn't deserve it.\n\nWish I could recommend this piece, but honestly I can't. I searched for at least something good in this game, but there's nothing. I wasted nearly 35 hours of my life with that game. Sadly, not even including Toothless is worth playing it.","August 7, 2015","false","35.0"," 302 of 334 people (90%) found this review helpful 112 people found this review funny","90","302","334","112","6"

The graphics are, well to put it lightly, 10 years old. Its just not good enough for a modern game. The textures are just aweful. but this is not the worst part, i can live with bad graphics.\n\nLets start with account registration. You have an age choice, 5 options. Are you 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5? yep thats right. The game assumes that everyone playing it is under 6. through the registration process you rapidly discover a complete lack of tab change. so you cant just type in the answers into the fields you have to select the field first. This is just the start of the bad GUI design.\n\nApparently this game is a mobile phone port because the game puts huge buttons up on the screen for you to click on to accelerate and slow and also apparently fire fireballs, though that button was only flashed at me as a taunt, and accelerate consisted of going from standing still to a slight snails pace. After the rather basic flying tutorial you are required to then go choose a dragon. First it asks you a series of questions and recommends a dragon to you, then basically tells you to pick your own anyway and leaves you to try and work out what the eggs refer to. A more knowledgable person might know the IP enough to remember the names given to each of the dragons in the movie and what each looks like and does...i couldn't, went for one that looked good on the graphic next to the egg, and then got one that looked quite different to what i was expecting...\n\nI then followed the arrows to 'flight school' where i promptly disconnected from the game for the 2nd time in 15 minutes and decided enough was enough.\n\nI'd like to say the game has potential. but the truth is, with all the faults in the game, to fix it you probably pretty much need to scrap the engine and start from scratch, this time with an aim to be more graphically similar to the movies. They might be able to do something with it...but it would need a huge overhaul in the graphics just to make it look reasonable, and a big overhaul in the user interface.","December 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 439 of 513 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","439","513","10","29"

Kinda like a Facebook pay to win game though, but I have patience and refuse to pay for games, it ran decent-ish on my old computer, I loved the movie, just wanted to zone out... a lot of reasons to play it.\n\nBut this game blows so bad.\n\nYou can just glitch through the floor and fall forever. Then you can hop on your dragon and try to ride it back up and never get up there!\n\nThe camera controls are terrible, even if you zoom out and get to a position that is acceptable, it resets all the time whenever you do something, anything. Fly? Reset. Fireball? Reset. Zone through? Reset.\n\nSpeaking of controls, little to no volume controls - you can turn it on, or off. On is ear-blastingly, RIP headphones users loud. Off is... not even really off. Occasionally when you zone through or activate/turn in a quest, sound will come blasting out of nowhere and blow your eardrums out.\n\nThere's nothing really to do at all. It's all gathering quests, retrieval and delivery quests, and what appears to be a selection of daily quests (Hiccup will keep making you do his scientific theory BS over and over again and play the same movie scenes despite it having NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SUBJECT OR TASK AT HAND). There is absolutely no PvE. There appears to be some kind of PvP which is really just minigames vs each other.\n\nFishing sucks. It takes forever. You gotta buy, with real money (gems = real money) a better fishing pole so it doesn't suck.\n\nFlying sucks. The only way for you to dismount is if you plow into the ground and hit the dismount button (or press R) but you cannot dismount in the air and there is practically no way to just LAND. LAND. LAND.\n\nSpeaking of plowing and dismounting, you can't use either of those words. So, the word for GETTING OFF OF YOUR DRAGON TO WALK AROUND, is censored.\n\nAlso for some reason this game censors what appears to be a selection of American first names. However, you can still make a character using those names - but if someone tries to call you by your name, nope, you are censored.\n\n\nOh my god why am I even writing a realistic review for this? Nobody cares and everyone already knows this game is crap.\n\nEDIT ADDING TO THE LIST OF STUPIDLY BANNED WORDS:\nplow\ndismount\nrandom American names\n5, 10, five (you cannot even tell anyone what level things unlock and when your dragon levels up)\nANY FREAKING NUMBERS AT ALL omg mommy said I couldn't tell anyone how old I am on the internet or I'll get molested.\n\nand my favorite, fart.","December 18, 2014","false","38.7"," 219 of 248 people (88%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","88","219","248","59","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hobocookie/recommended/332070/","hobocookie","sayum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hobocookie/","78 products in account","So here's my short opinion on School of Dragons.\n\nI downloaded it with some friends because we were all curious about how a game based off this particular franchise would go. To be honest none of us really expected much. Upon downloading we were greeted by, if you have not already guessed from the other reviews, lots of loading screens. Loading screens aren't a bad thing...normally. But these are heavy and a bit sore on the eyes. The attempts to get you excited by all the new content fall flat when you cycle through the same 5 ads over and over for 10 minutes. They could be better designed but moving on.\n\nThe intro experience is a bit clunky but long story short you get to pick from a few dragon breeds and get your baby dragon. The colour customization is actually pretty solid and the dragon models are great for the level of graphics the game can handle. Excellent textures a fairly well contructed world and you're off to level up yourself and your baby dragon.\n\nThe game attempts to be educational and actually does a fairly decent job at being engaging about it...at first. You have some quests involving the scientific theory and although the game gets a bit 'please allow us to shove this information directly down your child's throat, you are very welcome' the sentiment does not go unnoted. You collect different minerals and see how they interact with dragonfire and check the results against your hypothesis. Actually kind of rad.\n\nToo bad all the other science related quests are replaced with this Candy Crush Simulator that makes NO SENSE WHATSOVER. But I digress. I was fairly impressed at this point.\n\nThen I tried to meet up with my friends.\n\nAfter the initial dance of 'where are you' and 'meet me here' we finally made it to the same location. Only...my friends were not there. Ok, so there are different servers. No way to see which one you are on? No problem. We'll just exchange friend codes and teleport to each other. Only...you can only befriend someone on the same server as you.\n\nOh. Well then...challenge accepted. We spent the next hour switching from single player mode back to mmo mode until we found each other. Grand. Only there is a chance that when you leave the area you could swap servers. Graaaaaaand. No matter. We'll meet up later when our dragons can fly and explore together.\n\nBy the time our dragons could all fly, we had stumbled upon the most ridiculous series of bugs and paywalls imaginable.\n\nGems, in this game, just so happen to be truuuuuuly outrageous. They can be obtained for free, rarely and in small quantities. Otherwise you have to pay for them. That's fine, I don't need Gems right? Ho boy. You can't do anything without them.\n\nWant another dragon? Gems. Saddle? Gems. Another go at a race? Gems. Open a chest you found? Gems. Start a clan? Gems.\n\nHeck, some places you can't even get to without a membership. Not only that but if you don't have mum's credit card to get those sweet, outrageous beauties you can forget about playing at all. You're dragon can run out of energy. How do you fix that? Feeding them. How do you feed them? By fishing. Fishing bait costs gold which can be obtained through quests...which you need your dragon for. If your dragon is tired you can't do quests. Hazzah! I think you can recharge your dragon by paying gems though. So, yey.\n\nBugs include, quests that can only be completed by logging in on someone else's computer after attempting to light a campfire for two hours, quests that you never took, lead no where, and simply don't exist, and, my favorite, incomplete maps. INCOMPLETE MAPS.\n\nThere are literally places in this game where you can be flying over a mountain and suddenly it looks like the entire world is see through, like your minecraft server crashed or you're trying to play on your mum's flip phone again to prove you can. I was flying in the glitchy ocean (which should have a seziure warning on it btw because the shaders are bugged) and heading towards the island only to find a neat surprise. Its flat. Its literally a 2D render of the island the disappears when you pass go. I mean, come on. Don't make flying there an option if you're going to be lazy.\n\nHalf the trees are flat. There is a forest of 4 very sad, out of place trees in this one location that you have to go to for any quest involving chopping wood. MUST I GO ON?\n\nAnd do you know what the worst part about this game is? It has freaking potential. It has such a good base but it feels like no one is working on it. I want to shut it down, give it to a team of college kids, and put it back up in a couple of months because it would probably be ACES and I would probably LOVE IT. Because flying on your own dragon is COOL and the setting is CHARMING but it all feels like an alpha game that someone ran out of energy for halfway through and still had to turn it in.\n\nI hate this game and I want someone with some fire in their soul to take over the whole freaking project so I can sleep at night instead of sketching out ideas for a better system that does not wreek of being a quick cash grab. Ugh. Don't play it just go send some letters to the developers or find a kickstarter to fund. I don't know just don't download this until someone takes responsibility for this beautiful disaster.","April 5","false","14.1"," 112 of 123 people (91%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","91","112","123","23","2"

There is a lot to do here, plenty of fetch quests and mini games that center around flying a dragon through checkpoints. Other than that, you can tend to your farm, planting crops, watering them and harvesting all in real time. There is even a button mashing fishing mini game to get fish to feed your dragon. The glaring issue that I have with flying through the rings are the controls. These controls are meant for a touch screen. You have a speed up, slow down and fire button all on your screen. There are now hot keys to assist those of us not using the entire screen as a keyboard.\n\nThe game makes great use of its movie license and has clips from the movie with the ability to skip them. Skip is good, but each clip gets followed by a question about what you just watched. The graphics in game are bright, bold and colorful, but I can't call them good or bad. Its somewhere between and they can't get adjusted. Its good for computers with lesser graphics cards. This is a game for kids given the license and the easy difficulty. Does that make it bad? By no means. Its still the controls without a touch screen that make it bad. There are a few voice overs and a few things are fully voiced, but for the most part its one line of voice with an entire paragraph in text. The music is good, but there's not much variety. The same songs loop over and over again. By the time I was done with a one minute race, I had heard the same loop a noticeable amount of times.\n\nWhen you start the game, you create your character, male or female with a few frills. You can setup an account or play as a guest. Then you get dropped into the world after a lengthily update that could have been downloading as I was making my character. After that, you get to pilot the dragon Toothless from the movie through an easy course to get the hang of the controls. Then you get to hatch your own baby dragon after you answer a few questions. You get to color your dragon, but you can't chose the style or anything.\n\nSince its a baby dragon, the game needs you to grow the dragon over time by participating in chores that I wouldn't call fun. You'll need to feed your dragon fish by doing the fishing mini game. First buy bait then it is just a simple button mashing or mouse clicking I should say. Easy stuff. Then if you want to keep your dragon happy and level up, you'll grow plants on your farm over real life time and be there to harvest them or they die. You'll spend gold on the seeds or just buy the plant itself from the guy standing next to your farm. It incorporates the addictive bring you back chore work of Farmville with the thrill of flying through rings like Superman 64! Feeding your dragon might be one of the joys a child gets from this game. Want to feed your dragon the crops you just grew? Well you can't do it in the farm even if the dragon is sitting right there. You need to exit the farm back into the main world to click on it to bring up a first person view that lets you feed and play with it. You are playing fetch with your own dragon! Having an enslaved beast bring you back a ball for your amusement might be fun to apartment dwellers who are allergic to reptiles. Not just that, but you can shine a torch light like a laser pointer that gets your dragon to chase after it.\n\nWhen its time to play the game and not just do chores in it, you'll visit the flight club where you get an adult dragon to pilot. Just fly through the checkpoints or touch flags and then make it to the end. That's it. I feel like there is an issue with hit detection, like I couldn't touch a flag around a rock wall between my dragon and the flag and it still counted. I guess that is a testament of how easy the game is. If you miss a checkpoint or a flag, it doesn't matter that much, because you get a grade for each course. Getting a B+ or higher grade unlocks the next course in the circuit. You can't just go to the next course, you need to get out, then select the next course. It seems like wasted time. Not just that, but there is only one circuit unlocked for free players. Then you get to use new abilities like fire to blast down targets that lock on instantly so you can't miss.  Some dragons have special powers that let you charge your fireball to destroy obstacles. When you complete each course, you are given gold to buy things. You will need to buy gems to unlock the rest.\n\nWith this being a free to play game, it has micro transactions. They are everywhere. Premium items. Premium circuits to fly in. Don't want to wait to grow your dragon or wait for a plant to mature? You bet that you can pay gems to have it done instantly. You spend real world money to get gems. Not just that, but there is a membership system for $10 a month up to $85 for 12 months. Members get in game discounts and the game tells you. 10 gold for seeds, but the membership price is 8 gold. You're missing out on 2 gold savings. You can also get gems by inviting your friends and having them register. Do it. Invite them. Make them register. Get the gems. Use the gems. Just invite your friends. Get them hooked. Do it.\n\nSince this is a MMO, there are updates in game. These updates feel longer than they need to be. Sometimes it tells me that my Internet lost connection, but it didn't. This left me stuck in a loading screen. After five minutes, I had to Alt + F4 to exit the game, because there was no sort of menu during the loading screen to get out of it. The game has also crashed a few times for random reasons. Crashed in game and then during a movie clip. Then your instructor gives you a one question quiz about what you had just seen. Even though I was wrong, the game let it slide.\n\nIt plays like other third person MMOs, you run from person to person that gives you a quest. There is no death or combat. What I didn't like is I'd be talking to a quest giver and then they'd say come see me again and they'd disappear and teleport elsewhere for me to run to. It would have been different if I had done something between, but it felt like just a way for me to walk from one side of the snowy village to the other. For what? So he could quiz me about the clip he just showed me.\n\nThere are other small issues I had with the game, like I was running through an area and suddenly it told me my viking is now idle. Click the check mark to reconnect and it never did. It begs the question though, why was I moving and yet still considered idle. There is no Escape menu in this scene and again I had to Alt + F4 out of the game. I couldn't name myself my member name. It said there were numbers in there. I couldn't name my Dragon "Gertrude", because the game said there were numbers. So I just named it "Dragon" and that worked. The tutorial quests really emphasis scientific studies, yet the game doesn't make use of it. I could be finding or crafting new things, but no everything is right there to pay for in gems.\n\nIn all, there are some entertaining mini games, but jogging from one area to the next on fetch quests with zero challenge just isn't for me. There are better games out there. Kids might enjoy it and its a good chance to teach them responsibility by managing a farm and growing a dragon.","January 21, 2015","false","7.2"," 182 of 227 people (80%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","80","182","227","24","7"

Over the 20+ years of experience I've had with gaming, I have played various titles such as Big Rigs Over The Road Racing and ET for the Atari 2600, and I must admit this is an almost better experience than those two!\nThe graphics are amazing for a game originally meant to be played on a TI-83 calculator and the sound effects remind me of the good old days of the Atari 5200.\nSome may say that the lip syncing is awful, but I disagree. This is clearly intentional. The developers were trying to pass the message that the words that come out of your mouth aren't always what your heart wanted you to say. Another example of a philosophical message passed by this game is the apparent censorship of every word you try to type in the chat, by claiming they are "too offensive". Some people may say this is due to bad coding, but yet again, they would be wrong. The developers are trying to pass the message that even if you think you are free, you are always being surveilled and observed. Perhaps it is a call to Anarchism, which would be supported by the colour of Toothless, black, but, nonetheless, it is a very beautiful, and true, message.\nYou have to use your imagination to completely understand the fine piece of art that this game is. This game doesn't offer you an experience, the game challenges you to find your own adventure while you read the advertisements that are on every loading screen.\nIt challenges you to use Marxist Sociology, and question yourself "How would the common man react to this use of capital?" when you are faced with the option to use real money to make the game proceed faster.\nI'd recommend this to anyone with a fine taste in art, and I suspect that this game will, in the future, be displayed in a museum, right next to the Mona Lisa, as they are both pieces of art of the finest quality.","December 8, 2014","true","0.7"," 962 of 1,329 people (72%) found this review helpful 366 people found this review funny","72","962","1","366","63"

This is a nice catch to get more people interested in the game.\n+ great music\n+ you can ride Toothless first time in the game\n+ you can ride dragons\n+ game is free\n+ game is MMO (but can be turned off to speed up the game)\n+ if the game is stuck, there is a chance to close the game with ALT+F4\n+ game starts quickly\n\n- there are only 4 dragons to choose from (or pay money to get more choices)\n- you cannot choose a nightfury dragon to bond with (there's only one nightfury, and that's Toothless)\n- you can ride Toothless only for practice (which is in a pretty boring level)\n- extra events cost money\n- creating more vikings cost money\n- bonding with more dragons cost money\n- in game videos are bad quality\n- controls cannot be changed (instead of strafe you get turn left/right)\n- cannot change resolution (game will probably choose resolution for you)\n- you have to create an account on an external server\n- you cannot play this game offline\n-- game crashes a lot. Once so badly I had to repair Windows using a recovery cd.","December 6, 2014","false","1.0"," 67 of 79 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","67","79","0","2"

(I have a GTX 650 Ti graphics card and run on Windows 10)\n\nYou raise a dragon from baby -> teen -> adult. My hideous zippleback reached adulthood at level 11 after the second day of playing.\n\nYou can also have multiple dragons, though extra stable slots will require gems. Gems can be earned by sending emails to friends to join, and after a few days of consecutive log-ins you'll get some prizes and gems as a thanks for your loyalty. Apparently there were campfires where you could sit around and play a very slow game of "gem farming" but it was disabled in later updates.\n\nThere are mini games where you can earn gold and experience for you and your dragon: Fishing (requires gold to buy bait, though I think you can get worms from compost)\n\nA matching elements game (think bejeweled with the periodic table)\n\nDragon racing (your dragon needs to be an adult to participate, but you can borrow NPCs' dragons until that happens - unfortunately, Hookfang is the only free dragon to borrow)\n\nFireball Frenzy, where you ride your dragon through an assault course and shoot targets to score points\n\nEel blasting: This is a mini game you can play with your dragon - your dragon fires at eels of a certain colour as they pop out of the water\n\nYou can even run a farm, and it's basically a 3D Farmville - you have to wait for HOURS for your crops to grow, but if you want to speed it up it'll cost you a gem or two.\n\nAnd of course there's quests the NPCs give you, which are basically fetch and retrieve quests.\n\nI don't think it's an awful game, but it suffer from "BUY THIS STUFF" syndrome. So sadly I'm going to have to give it a "No, not unless you like to grind."\n\n\n\n","September 23, 2015","false","42.5"," 61 of 75 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","61","75","7","0"

If it was well crafted.\n\nBut uh...nope. This was so bad that I, even with my love for all things to do with dragons, gave up on it in no time. FIrst of all, there does not appear to be any way to register over the age of five. According to the devs there supposedly is, but I sure as heck didn't see it and I poked around a fair bit.\n\nThe Viking customization is about a third of a step away from nonexisitent, with only two choices for things like hair and outfits. Worse, none of my customization saved. The save for it apparently ♥♥♥♥ itself and died at that very second, so I ended up with generic start Viking girl with no name. And I could find no way to change that, either.\n\nThe flying is absolute crap. I mean, the first thing you get to do is get on Toothless with Hiccup and seriously, Toothless, you guys. Only...I could even tell, unless I aimed downwards, that the damn dragon was even moving. One of the best parts of HtTYD is how dynamic the flight is, and in this game it is utterly awful.\n\nAbout the only positive moment was hatching my dragon and watching it follow me around as a precious little baby, but that wasn't enough to keep me wanting to play. I just wasn't interested in a dragon game with craptastic flying. Who would be?\n\nIt makes me feel really bad for young gamers, honestly.

So I though the game would be great, I found out it wasn't. I haven't gone far because the 'train your dragon proccess' was boring and half way through my 'dragon fly training' I quit and moved on to be even more bored.\nThe flying is quite easy once you get used to it but at first it's hard to master. The only dragons you can fly for free is your dragon (once it grows up) or two other Dragon Master dragons.  The flying procedures are basiclly mini-games. There is fishing but I always find fighing really boring in games.\nThere was really no effort in the bachground when it comes to flying and it was ashame.\nAnd then the game bombardes you with pop-ups with pay for stuff. And I don't dout that very quickly you'll end having to pay to continue playing this game. Not worth the time.

What I felt during this journey belonged to me and me only. The same is with my brothers. Sometimes, you have to teach more than skills. This has taught me what to pass on. Love, poetry, sadness, courage, and compassion. This is what I will pass on.

I expected it to be more like a racing game, but I didn't get to see if it was that or not as it crashed for me after the tutorial.\n\nThe controls were dumb, I would imagine the developers could have made the flying direction according to where your mouse stands and the shooting/breaking/accelerating with QWE or controls as they are, but the buttons, such as shooting and others on space, E and R or something. The mouse clicking was just too much. You can't concentrate on the road.\n\nThe tutorial was buggy as on one part, you could barely finish it because the game wouldn't let you shoot targets.\nI would imagine there are other bugs too, but, like I said, I crashed to find out more.\n\nI also didn't like that there were too many "Viking_456465" names, there shouldn't be an option to register like that.\n\n\nThe only thing that I liked was the fact that you could fly dragons.

Any other options require a membership (oh wait, you can choose between two tops and two bottoms. Cool.) I soldiered through anyway and got into the actual game.\n\nRight off the bat the voice acting bugged me, I don't know if they had the characters do new voices for this or just took words from the movie and clipped them all together. They sound so vaguely uninterested I was almost ready to exit there. After accepting the first mission I realized the controls aren't the same as most mmos which threw me off because WASD/arrow keys to move is stupid and laggy. I'm guessing it's because it started on mobile (?) but if you're gonna release it for PC at least make some needed changes.\n\nFlying was boring. It said you could hold a button to go faster and all it really did was make you crawl at a slightly quicker pace as though if the game excited you too much you may have a seizure or something. Then you take a personality test and get to choose a dragon which I didn't even bother with because pretty much all the dragons looked stupid bar two and one of them you need a bloody membership for?\n\nPretty much anything that may pique your interest about this game requires you to buy a membership, as though you'd even waste the money. The best part is I had to restart my viking because I hadn't entered a name and being generic viking #72149657 annoyed me to hell and back, so when I did the flight mission again at the beginning it actually bugged out and toothless floated to the bottom of the screen with no way to get back up and that's about the time I exited the game and decided to write out this review, because writing this 4/5 paragraph long review held more ennjoyment then attempting to play this mmo, don't even waste the space.","December 5, 2014","false","0.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Being an easily amused and patient child I enjoyed it, but when I came back to it, I realized how stupid it really is.\n\nFirst of all, I like to be able to customize my character. A lot. In this game it has a  very limited amount of customization, and with the amout of money I had in the game I could only afford one mask. Bullcrap.\n\nThe second thing I dislike about this is farming. I hate farming. In many other games I love farming, but here I just hate it. Not because I'm impatient, but because its boring and results in almost no benifit to me. Fishing was okay though. And growing animals. I don't like growing animals in this game.\n\nI don't like how you have to be a member for getting certain dragons. Getting another dragon maybe, but limited starting choices bugs me.\n\nI have a great computer, and it still takes 30 minutes to load. I am pretty sure it should be called "The Screen of Tediousness" Loading screen is just too much of a title to live up to.\n\nNot to mention the chat rules. There are several words that I couldn't say, even though I saw NO WAY they could have been offensive! I like to chat with people and be able to say things like "potato" at the same time! What could be offensive about potato? Are you offended by its skin?\n\nThe dragons take  ages  to grow, and you cant do much with a baby dragon. If you dont have a dragon that is old enough, then you have to use toothless for most minigames that involve a dragon.\n\nthis is  very clearly  a childs game. It really doesn't appeal to me, or even my 9 year old sister at all, because it is  very clearly a childs game .\n\nI do like that the devs are updating and adding new things, but please, before you add new things  work out the problems with the existing things first  !\n\nThe graphics could be worse, but they certainly are not up to todays standards. I like the visuals of Minecraft better than this. And the visuals of Minecraft kind of suck.\n\nThe quests are monotonous and boring as hell. Talk to this guy, get a rock from this guy, talk to this guy, go back to this guy, gather these seven things from here. Its really the same thing over again, with nothing to amuse you for long, unless you really, really, like walking back and forth and talking to the same people 50 times.\n\nThe quest arrow doesn't know what its doing with its life. I seriously spend like 15 minutes walking in circles because the quest arrow was being a scrub. The quests are horrible enough with out it, and now it just added like 15 minutes of pointless walking to them. The quests might actually be easier without it, or make it one of those quest lines, I don't care, just  fix it\n\nI do like how you sort of replicated the Island of Berk, even if it might not have been done awesomely.\n\nEverything is so freaking slow. Oh the fastest dragon in the game? Yeah this baby goes a total of 6 miles and hour. I know, so fast. Im not talking about the gameplay, which is very slow, im talking about you and your dragon. When I rode my dragon I want to go breakneck speed, or even like 15 mph, but instead I got the speed of a great grandmother sloth. I like to go really fast, so I am used to not getting quite what I want, but this was really a letdown.\n\nThe minigames, are just boring. Fishing is  sort of  fine, but the games like flying and the shooting games are not... They are just not fun.\n\nThis is a good concept, but the execution is not done well. It could have been done way better, but now this game is just so deep in a hole of failure, I don't think it can be redeemed.\n\nSo to wrap this up I'll say the one thing I did like about this game.\nDragons. I like dragons. Or rather I did. Until now.","March 16, 2015","false","1.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","10","11","6","0"

There's no room for wandering off on the back of your new airborne friend. I hot an invisible wall in 5 seconds flat. To unlock more things to do in the game, you have to get out your wallet. If your kids want this, my advice to you is to teach them to have better taste and higher standards of gaming. This is not a 'free' game. If your kids like dragons, go get them Spyro.

The later missions seem doable but part way through them you find you need something like an advanced fishing road to complete it but guess what it costs you gems.  The only other way to get gems seems now to be to invite friends to join. (and that isn't going to get the many thousands you'll need at 50ges a registration) Add to that it's very glitchy and can crash 3-4 times in a hour. Pay Premium players get everything 80% cheaper so can make more profit in coins but still have to pay gems for anything useful. Coins are useful for buying only bait which you use to catch fish to feed your dragons who get's super hungry doing missions.\nGrowing crops means you have to buy seed with coins (can't save seed) , water (which runs out fast unless you spend gems on an instafill), carefully not click the spend gems button (to instaharvest) wait up to an hour then click the harvest before the timer expires and the crops are wasted. After spending 200 coins and wasting an hour you might make 40 coins profit, enough to have 4 goes at fishing, which will be wasted if a salmon or an eel takes your bait as you haven't spent gemson the rod capable of catching them or dragons not eating eels. Complaints seem to get the thanks for your copncern, we're making changes treatment but the feeling I get from the forums is things get worse rather than better.\nClans seem a way to peer pressure you to spend  gems to beat other clans.\nTLDR don't bother unless you're prepared for a large constant daily cash drain for a glitchy game.","January 12, 2015","false","62.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","4"

Got it to work well on W10 gaming laptop with 1 gb graphics card and 4GB ram, overkill for this, but seems the only platform to run it stable.  On the wifes IMAC hitches and glitches with no abandom after 15min of gameplay ??? why apple store does not seem to offer it on IMAC ?, but does offer it on IPAD apple store...Oooo the politics these days of online gaming and mmo's lol.  Was a real pain to get this to work for the kids, but ones it was all setup, they seem very happy with it.  Tried it myself and does have all the elements of a good MMO simplified and at a lower graphics resolution.  Believe the issues with stability are due to too much access to system beeing requested by Software? and the Korea developer adding trojan horses or other malware type tracking software for demographics and marketing resell purposses? the 25 cents they get for each user to resell to marketing firms?  Or maybe due to them refusing to bow down to apple and MS regarding licensing fees? Hope Steam solves the issues on the IMAC, since thats most likely Apple blocking since they want us all to use Apple Store on that platform, when they finally make it available ;)  $25 bucks on gems does not go far, and kids can burn up cash on this game very fast :) but does get you some nice dragons, and toothless to fly etc, but dont give em open access to cc card lol, they rack up $100 before you can blink an eye.","March 30","true","26.6"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

It is a graphical browser game implemented on the client-side in Java or HTML5, and incorporates 3D rendering. The game has had over 200 million accounts created and is recognised by the Guinness World Records as the world's largest free MMORPG and the most-updated game.\n\nRuneScape takes place in the world of Gielinor, a medieval fantasy realm divided into different kingdoms, regions, and cities. Players can travel throughout Gielinor via a number of methods including on foot, magical spells, or charter ships.Each region offers different types of monsters, resources, and quests to challenge players. The game's fictional universe has also been explored through a tie-in video game on another of its maker's websites, FunOrb, Armies of Gielinor,and the novels Betrayal at Falador,Return to Canifis, and Legacy of Blood.\n\nPlayers are represented in the game with customisable avatars. RuneScape does not follow a linear storyline; rather, players set their own goals and objectives. Players can choose to fight non-player character (NPC) monsters, complete quests, or increase their experience in the available skills. Players interact with each other through trading, chatting, or by participating in mini-games and activities, some of which are competitive or combative in nature, while others require cooperative or collaborative play.\n\nThe first public version of RuneScape was released on 4 January 2001 in beta form, and in December 2001, Jagex was formed to manage the game. As the game's popularity grew, the game engine was rewritten, and its beta was opened to paying players on 1 December 2003 under the name "RuneScape 2", and officially released on 29 March 2004.The third iteration of the game, "RuneScape 3", was released on 22 July 2013.","January 12, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","1"

That is all i can say. this game did have allot of work and thought for kids and money grab with your stupid subscription, but you need to think level if this idea will fly. movie game titles die fast and eat hard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991387768/recommended/332070/","76561197991387768","Anus Bandanus","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991387768/","34 products in account","A nice idea for a concept - Really bad attention to gameplay, physics, artifical intelligence and sound.\n\nGameplay and Physics:\nThis was a game I was looking forward to try out. At first it seemed promising, but alas, the cover of a book can fool you.\nHeads-up devices look terrible and feel unstable. The camera acts really weird - especially when flying.\nThe physics in the game seem like they have been written by a middle-schooler. Turning angles are awkward and control with mouse and keyboard are confusing (I never thought I'd say that) .  Flying is obviously a big thing in the game, but the physics are impossible! Dragons can stand perfectly still in the sky and the rules of aerodynamics don't apply to them. This removes all immersion for me. If, however, you don't care about the feel of speed and good physics, you will still be disappointed. Going out to explore when having a dragon raised to rank 10, ready to fly, you will find that the scenery is only half done and invisible walls will kep you from going too far anywhere. It has been long since an anti-climax hit me so hard.\nIn addition to this - there is nothing called damage or crashes. You cannot crash with your dragon or inflict damage to anyone or anything - even though you are given weapons, tools and a fire-breathing dragon.\n\nAI:\nThe game starts off by introducing you to your dragon. As a guide - you go through a test that then points you to a suggested species of dragon. As for me - I got a dragon that wanted to go around to explore as much as I and play games. This all sounds jolly. To my surprise - it seemed like something fantastic had been done here. But no. The dragons to NOTHING apart from follow you around as a mindless chihuahua in a way too loose leash. No personality, no unexpected features. just empty animations.\n\nSound:\nOh my God. I don't know where to begin. Absolutely horrible. Simple sounds like your own footsteps (not to mention a 600 kilogram dragon ) are applied to enhance the immersion into the game. I will leave it at that: The sound effects are horrible or absent.\nThe background music is actually nice. It has a good tune and a realistic feel. Also - it changes with every scene. Good work there.\n\nGraphics:\nOne thing that makes the game playable is the graphics. They are not high definition, but that is not important. They are funny to look at, without getting too messy - and all in all - it makes the game cosy.\n-   Animations, 3D models and Frame hierarchies-\nThe animations are well made, precise and important. They lift the game to a somewhat acceptable standard (for a free game ) .  The models are authentic to the movies - which is fantastic. Thank you for that, developers. The interaction between the animations and models seem to have been made on a very well build frame hierarchy structure - which is standard in all animated games today. but still - good job.\n\n\nSamples I liked:\n+   I liked that you had to walk around everywhere until your dragon was mature enough to fly. This made the sensation of flying an achievement (until I ragequit because of absurd physics ).\n\n+  I liked the vioce-acting. Very soothing and authentic.\n\n+  I liked all the minigames : fishing, playing eel-catch with dragon and testing things in the lab.\n\n\n\nVerdict:\n\nI cannot recommend spending any money on this software. The game world is not big enough and is unfinished, the gameplay seem like it should be much more friendly towards players ( This makes the game feel more like a slot-machine than anything else ) . Games should be made because We - or all developers - have some urge to tell a story or make other people experience something. Not to pump money out of them. (To me this is nothing more than Farmville on facebook)\n\nThe level of intelligence in this game could satisfy the mind of a six or eight year old. However - I would not recommend it, because the quest log is non-descriptive and the quest-arrow is buggy - meaning it will sometimes take a LONG time to figure out where to go. The eight year old would have lost his/her patience before rank 10.\n\n\n\n\nThe only reason to play this game is to experience the concept - the idea of raising a dragon and then flying it. (If you managed to come as far as to flying your dragon - you have done well.","December 15, 2014","false","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I also think that all the people whining about this game are complete dolts. This game was only released today! HOW did you think that it would be completely problem free? anyway, back to my first point. For most of the problems that have been pointed out so far to have been fixed on the day of the release speaks volumes to me. But I still cannot give this game a good review just yet as there are still some game breaking bugs. One of which I just experienced and it is that the game crashes and all you can do is open task manager and Tab around untill you can close it. I hope the Devs fix this bug soon so that I can play this game without fear of crashing. But aside from all this, it is a fun little game NOT to be taken seriously and to be played for no particular reason but to goof off and have this weird thing called "fun".","December 4, 2014","false","0.6"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","1"

There are a lot of people who do not like it because of the bugs in it, but if you have good internet and network this should reduce those issues by far! The Admins in this game are constantly updating it, adding new expansion packs ( e.g Icestorm Island), releasing new dragon eggs, new items/clothing ect. The possabilties in this game are pretty much endless! You can go on to the official site and check the forums for the latest updates and news! There is loads of activities to do like Thunder Run Racing, Fire Ball Frenzy, Bulls Eye Lagoon ect. along with all the quests you are given through out your adventure to becoming an Ultimate Dragon Trainer!\n\nThe only thing I really dislike about this game is its glitches, connection issues and the occasional moment where the server times out. These can be resolved by a simple restart. If these issues are common for you, this may be from your internet or the strenght of your device you are chosing to play it from.\n\nI hope you do have a great gaming expirience in this game and I hope this review was helpful!\n\n:D","August 13, 2015","true","362.8"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","13","25","3","1"

The Bruiser\nDon't let this dragon's appearance fool you, this dragon loves a great succ and will easily become your best friend, he can take approximately 3 hits before fainting, it's damage is high but can only shoot one fire ball every 30 minutes.\nIt's customization consists of new eyes, the colour of it's ear wax, and the shape of it's nostrils.\nOverall Choose this class if you're into a quick, stealthy class, much like Dr.Egg Man from sonic and Mario in the Olympic games\n\n2.The Healer\nThis Dragon can only move if something needs healing, so prepare to bring your razor, because you'll be needing to cut yourself to lead this dragon, unlike it's name it actually has no healing capabilities, it can breath air and can move at the speed of a young child, He likes long walks on the beach, romantic movies, and dogs.\nYou can buy paint as DLC and colour it's nails, this adds +20 Agility, and +10 Fletching\n\n3.The Wizard\nThis Unique Dragon has the ability to bend the space time continuum and change reality as we know it, this power is somewhat under powered, as this would still take 5 hits to kill a simple protector of time, the AOE of this attack is high, but it's damage is slow, only 12,000 HP per hit, this is nothing compared to the Gnome Child's DEF of 15\n\n4.Nothing\nIf you're going for a bloodborne game-play style, this dragon is for you, it's completely invisible, because nothing's there It has no attack, and no defense, when playing this game mode, be sure not to die, because it's one life and you're dead, the developers even added a special bonus that if you die in the game, you die in real life, it's so realistic that it actually feels if you're getting a knife stuck in you. There's no customization, because there's no dragon.\n\nOverall this game appeals to every audience, and it's asking price of nothing is still way too much, it's DLC is worth it though.\n\nA Proper 9/10 Could have used more dragon yiffing","January 15","true","2.4"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","49","17","35","30","5"

Aside from non-starter dragon eggs and certain Shop things, everything you can get with Gems is also obtainable just by being patient ingame. It's not the game's fault if you don't want to put the work in to level up your dragon and get flying that way.\n\nCrashes rarely happen on a halfway decent system. I had one "crash" which was really just caused by my computer acting up as I was alt-tabbing out to my browser to look up one of the dragons and had to close the game manually.\n\nThe game doesn't shove its microtransactions in your face unless you click on something that requires it, such as an activity when your active dragon is too young or an expansion you don't have.\n\nActually, when I was playing brower-based I remembered it was incredibly easy to cheese he referral-for-gems system, since it didn't track your IP. My friend got a Skrill egg just by making a few fake accounts.","December 17, 2015","true","2.1"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","48","14","29","5","0"

School of Dragons is playable, and you may enjoy it if you are a fan of the series, and can stand the looks. The game is not pretty but I havent noticed anything specifically terrible about the game. its basic, but it can still be enjoyable.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. You will probobly be accosted with adds wanting you to become a member, and or pay gems for extra stuff. there are a lot of these adds, you have been warned.\n\n2. You might as well not even try to chat. if you do be very careful of what you say and how you say it. I haven't had any trouble as of yet. But I have seen people complaining of bans for using basic non cursewords and such. Again this is not first hand experience on my part but the game is clearly designed for children who have parents with deep pockets.

They did not play and have no real perception of the game play. Yes the intial load takes time just let the files update. NOW FOR THE GAME REVIEW!\n\nPros:\n- Meant for kids obviously given the game type. My 4 year old can play it and has for a period of time the reading is what stumps him at times because some things do but its a game reading is required.\n\n-The games in the game are easy to play  which allows interaction with your dragon.\n\n- Educational ( good for kids in this instance) Example: One of the first quests is an Experiment which can take your child through all the steps required to do their own experiment  Problem, Hypothesis ect. Addtionally some of the games have your win screen with interactions that give interesting facts. Facts at the age of 26 I did not know probably because I'm not a Marine biologist but all the same good information to help your kids just know a little more.\n\n- Graphically for the engine they are using not too bad for a F2P MMO\n\n- Key binds are super simple does not require hot keys so it is primarily just click based interactions making it a very simple game.\n\n- Energy bar for your dragon Feed them Fish easy fix\n\n\nCons-\n\n- Lots of load screens between areas that is a bit of a pain I would say atleast 1 hour of game play will get you about 5 to 10 minutes of load screens between areas but not all in one spot its broken up in to about 30 second load screens while questing.\n\n\n\n- A lot of the gear requires gems gems require money so for that it can be kind of frustrating because who doesn't like to get new gear in an MMO, but there is other currency for item purchases in the game.\n\n- Too much clicking at times to proceed a lot is double checking for you to leave a current interaction. " Are you sure you want to leave?" " Are you sure your sure you want to leave?" kind of redundant in a way but deal able because load screens can follow some of the interactions and you end up wasting more time by loading when you had the second opportunity to stop.\n\n\nRemember Every game has its pro's and Cons but we can not base a game off " Mixed reviews" when half the people fail to even let the game update after the inital download. If you can deal with a WOW patch you can take the 15 mins to let the files update on the game this reduces your initial load time every time you go in to the game and it is heavily reduced. Hope this helps overall not a bad game especially for a kid.","August 3, 2015","true","5.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

The online version would never load for me but this one went into the game almost instantly and plays well.\n\nThe game is probably best suited for ages around 12-14 but I still think it's fun despite the absolutely ridiculous word filter which doesn't let you use words including 'Droggle' 'Banana' 'Baby' 'Brun' and 'Sword'.\nLike most MMO's, there are a lot of pay features, most of the dragons are sub only but you still get four customisable types to choose from for free: Gronkles, Hideous Zipplebacks, Deadly Nadders and Monsterous Nightmares.\nFor dragons such as Whispering Death, Scauldron, Stormcutter, Rainutter, Screaming Death, Nightfury, etc. you're going to have to pay. The game is still perfectly playable and enjoyable without the pay features, they just make things a lot easier.\n\nThe world is still fairly small at this point but there seems to be areas where the world will be developed further, paths leading to boarded up tunnels and locked doors, that sort of thing. Hoping to see more developments soon.\n\nThere are a few bugs and glitches in the game. I've only experienced a minor one which doesn't set me back at all. Just be aware that certain elements may cause your game to crash and you may find certain quests unachievable. The developers encourage players to report any issues to them.\n","January 2, 2015","true","19.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","1"

When console elitists tell pc gamers "we have better exclusives than you, take that PC!" just bring this game up and you've already beaten them.\n-Gameplay\nThis game has you using WASD to move the dolls around, and J and K to rotate them. You rotate and fumble around with them until they are having the closest thing possible to sex in this game. This is an absolutely fantastic gameplay system and I wish more games, (especially Call of Duty, it bring some innovation to that dying franchise.) would replicate it.\n-Graphics\nthis has some of the best graphics I've seen in a video game to date. Far surpassing games like Ryse Son of Rome, The Order 1886, or Crysis 3. The downside to this is you do need a very, very powerful pc to run this game properly.\n-Sound\nOn par with the fantastic graphics, a looping, repetitve piano plays while you hear the sound of your plastic dolls mashing together. Nothing more I could ask for honestly\n-Replay value\nAs you can see, all the people reviewing the game, including myself have at least 5-10 hours of game time in the game. This shows me I'm not alone in thinking this game has a lot to come back for.\nMy best score was having 204 sex. I can't wait to go back and try and beat that score.\n\n-Verdict probably one of the best games we'll see this generation, this game is a must play.\nhow do you Do it is to gaming, as Bohemian Rhapsody is to music.

Sure, there is no real combat system, the level progression seems a bit awkward, and I dont understand the purpose of a health bar when there is no way to even get hurt (literally walked off of a cliff and landed perfectly fine). Not to mention the lack of direction and no main story to keep you engaged. Or at the very least make the characters more interesting.\nHowever, you have to remember that there is really nothing that you'd be able to fight. Maybe Outcasts or Berserkers, but that would be about it without ruining the essence of HtTYD. But it would still be nice if there was something to make the game at least a little more interesting.\n\nThat being said, if you just wanted to rp having your own dragon and being apart of said universe, I say go for it. The graphics are not that bad all things considered. Most of the characters re-appear, alond with their dragons. So you can go ahead and rp as a member of the HH tribe, or who ever you want to be.

Free to Play, but Pay to Win. If you want the best Dragon, you have to pay the most money along with having a membership. But all in all, it's possible to play this game without spending any money (which is what I did) and I'm enjoying it. There are a few instances of some...weird gameplay chat, but it's not really common as it's a shared chat. That deters a good deal of the roleplayers from their...roleplaying haha. I like it, and it's one of those games where if you just want to cruise around on a dragon, you can do that, but if you want to get serious and do some quests, you can do that too and make some coins along the way.

Sure, there is no real combat system, the level progression seems a bit awkward, and I dont understand the purpose of a health bar when there is no way to even get hurt (literally walked off of a cliff and landed perfectly fine). Not to mention the lack of direction and no main story to keep you engaged. Or at the very least make the characters more interesting.\nHowever, you have to remember that there is really nothing that you'd be able to fight. Maybe Outcasts or Berserkers, but that would be about it without ruining the essence of HtTYD. But it would still be nice if there was something to make the game at least a little more interesting.\n\nThat being said, if you just wanted to rp having your own dragon and being apart of said universe, I say go for it. The graphics are not that bad all things considered. Most of the characters re-appear, alond with their dragons. So you can go ahead and rp as a member of the HH tribe, or who ever you want to be. Sure the game may glitch here and there, and the enviornment may be a little lacking, but it works. The dragon flight controls take a little getting used to, but after that, they're not too bad. The "Pay-to-win" features can get a little annoying some times but they are not down right agrivating.

I have not played it for long enough yet, but I find it enjoyable and really nice. The graphics are not the best, but still really good and makes me part of the movie+series universe. It is more of a fairy tale game meant for children that even adults can enjoy as they can play it with them. It reminds me of Harry Potter And the Prisoner of Azkaban, when I played Harry flying on a Buckbeak. Sure many things could be made better (for example the constant membership/gem adds throughout the game annoy me) but as a game meant for children to LEARN, yes learn as some of the scientific stuff/mathematics, logics, really helps children to learn and gain some knowledge. Easy to navigate and the BIG icon bars are there also to help children. So just to oppose those negative ANTI-Recommendations - THIS is a game meant for KIDS to play and LEARN but it is also ENJOYABLE for other generations as well.","October 19, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I find it very fun running around and having my favorite dragons from httyd/httyd2. The game in general does have a few bugs and glitches, but some (like for me the speedy Gonzales glide where if you are gliding on a dragon, sometimes your dragon will suddenly "fly" at the speed of light) are quite enjoyable and make me laugh. Recently the game released the Death song expansion which is free with membership. I think these expansions are amazing and I have so much fun doing them and eventually getting the Death song or Groncicle. Now here are somethings I think that the creators of the game should fix: I think that they need to create more animations for the dragons. Now, I think they did make a new animation for the death song since no other dragon goes up on two legs and shows off their wings, but most dragons are based off the main dragon animations, Deadly Nadder, Gronckle, Monsterious nightmare, Hideous Zippleback, and night fury. They should fix most of the bugs in the game. for a game that's been around a few months or weeks after httyd came out, the graphics look pretty good, and there is regular updates fixing bugs and having the game look more and more beautiful, but there are bugs that still remain. One in particular that scares me is when the screen goes completely black when going to an island or section of the school. They should add Valka to the game. I mean, if you're going to have Stoick alive in the game and have the main characters age like in the second movie, you can at least add Valka! You have her dragon, a stormcutter, but not her in general. I mean, come game!  They should have a main character look or clothing. Who doesn't want to look like their favorite character in the game? You can have a Hiccup, Astrid, Fishlegs, Ruff and tuff, Snotlout, Stoick, and Gobber look, all that cost around 10-20 gems in the game. That's all I have to say about the game and that you should really play it. It's fun, it teaches your kids about the scientific method while they still think it's a game, and, even though the prices are pretty high, the pros about the membership are amazing!","October 30, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While the game crashes occasionally and some things cost gems (gems costs real money), I do think that game has a few more positives than negatives. The different dragons are cool, the minigames are really fun, the music is awesome, and a lot of quests are fun to do.\n\nI only really have one major issue with it, and it's only when racing. My problem is that most of the race tracks have unintentional shortcuts that can skip entire sections of a track, and many people abuse them! I've made a two personal rules of mine when racing. The first is to not use fireballs (because in my opinion, fireballs in the races are really cheap), and the second one is to never use broken shortcuts. So when nearly everybody that races uses these shortcuts, it really aggrivates myself and others that just want to have a fair race.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the movies, or that wants somthing different.","July 22, 2015","true","56.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game has a very nice combination of mechanics from both titles without really dragging the game down.\n\nThis would include that like the first HTTYD there is the ability to walk around and interact with the environment and characters, as well as quests to do that can level up your dragon, and of course dragon customization!\n\nWhile like Dragons 2 there is the entire flight system! With an open world to fly around in and explore this opens up many other fun things to the player, and with this game being massively multiplayer you no longer need your friends to come over to your house to play local splitscreen just to fly around with them. There is also much more than just Berk now, you have lots of new maps to explore with Expansion packs for even more to do.\n\n\nNOTE: IN THE NEW UPDATE 1.19.0 THESE BUGS HAVE BEEN FIXED!\nAll that said, there is more than a few flaws to this game. Mainly Bugs and Glitches....\nI've noticed several farm and quest glitches where farm jobs appear in your quest book, or where quests become unselectable after a time, meaning the quest arrow WILL NOT help you in that objective again. This happened to all my Expansion quests (since i didnt have the packs i couldn't do the quests) after a time of them being active but unfinished, if this occurs for anyone else the only solution i know is to actually read the NPC dialoge and follow their instructions...\nThese are probably the most noticable ones for me but these are not the only ones.\n\n\nAside from that the multiplayer chat has a very messed up sensor that not only blocks swears from being used but all the numbers as well as the word for a number, meaning if you want to say to the other people "twenty minutes till the battle"(etc.) you have to write " wenty mins till the battle" or something dumb like that.....\n\nAfter all that (All glitches aside as there should be a bug fix update eventually...) i would call this a good game and rate it about 8/10","April 2","true","271.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

He wants to end the world. You, the Dragonborn, has to stop him in his tracks. This is only the main story, though. There's tons of sidequests, and the lore of this universe is extremely deep.\n\nGRAPHICS: The game's graphics are stunning for a 2011 game. Skyrim is a beautiful province, and everything feels different, from the icy peak of High Hrothgar to the forests of the Rift.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay is great, and dragon fights are epic. There's a lot of different weapons and armour to be found throughout the game, and there's hundreds of locations to discover.\n\nI wish I could replay this with the same sense of awe and discovery as the first time I played it.\n\nOverall, I would say this game is a 10/10.","November 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In reality, you can hardly walk without having to pay for something.\nYou pay with either gems or coins, the latter being scarce, the first as rare as night furies.\nAdds wait around every corner and pounce at you whenever you try to do something. Even feeding your dragon costs buckets of money, and to even be able to raise another one, you need to buy expensive stables, which are prized more like luxury penthouses.\nDragon eggs can also only be obtained by spending affromentioned gems, wild dragon nests are non-interactable, if you can even find one that is.\nTo summarize the game in one sentence; BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY!\nEverything is so focused on you spending actual, real-life money on it, that it becomes hardly playable. And certainly not a fun pass-time. I Definitely do not reccomend this game to anyone.\nAnd don't even get me started on all the bugs\nWhen it comes to freemium games, I'd prefer candy crush.

My name is Sefh and I'm bringing you this exclusive review of School of Dragons. It all began in my Twitch stream, this game was meant to be played as a joke. I am now stuck in this game and I have subscribed for a total of 420 months. Me and my dragons have awesome adventures and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes dragons overall. Be sure to subscribe to the game in order to unlock 1 new hairstyle, it is so great I can't take my eyes of it. I am addicted to this game and might require assistance to stop playing it, but nothing will stop me this year -- perhaps in 2015.","December 9, 2014","true","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Apprently you all are teenagers or adults, so why are you even wanting to be perverts and try to be sexual over kids? Whatever you are doing as teenagers or adults in this game, I don't like it. And it doesn't give you the right to review if you AREN'T even a young child or adult that looks for kid games for your child!\n\nThis is a game where young children play with their favorite dreamworks characters, and will enjoy it. Everything is okay with it when you have a GOOD, WORKING COMPUTER. Both the application and the personal computer version of the game is fine. It's just the older people like teenagers and adults that grown out of kids games like these that are giving this game a FALSE BAD NAME!\n\nI recommend this game for young children and for people who just want non violent gaming or have their child learn bad habits from older aged games.","October 12, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

Её нельзя оценивать как f2p или MMO. Перед нами "песочница", рассчитанная на детей от 8 до 12 лет. Здесь их ждёт:\nРаскрученная вселенная мультфильма "Как приручить дракона" и его персонажи;\nБольшое количество развивающих заданий, поданых в игровой форме;\nИгровой мир без насилия в принципе;\nБольшое количество познавательных материалов на сайте игры.И  список далеко не полный. Кому интересно - в Руководствах после 20.12.2014г. должна появится моя статья об этой игре под названием "Почему эта игра может подойти Вашему ребёнку".\nПри этом да, имеются определённые проблемы. Они описаны в другой статье тоже подробно. Но суть не в проблемах - у любой игры они есть. И постепенно они решаются. А эта игра - кроссплатформенная, т.е. разработчики вынуждены следить постоянно за вариациями для всех платформ. ПК на данным момент у них не самая приоритетная и их можно понять - у их целевой аудитории (детей) большая часть времени проходит со смартфоном в руках и севшая батарейка воспринимается почти трагедией.\nЭта игра выделяется среди большинства доступных в Steam игр именно тем, что она не пытается взять максимально обширную аудиторию, а нацелена исключительно на детей. Если Вы присматриваете игру своему ребёнку - мой Вам совет, попробуйте обратить внимания на эту.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBefore us is a unique product for the Russian market - a game designed primarily for children. It can not be assessed as f2p or MMO. Before us "sandbox", designed for children aged 8 to 12 years. Here they were waiting for:\nHyped Universe animated film "How to Train Your Dragon" and its characters;\nA large number of developmental tasks, filed in the form of a game;\nThe game world without violence, in principle;\nA large number of informative material on the website of the game.And the list is far from complete. Who cares - a guide after 20.12.2014g. should appear my article about this game called " Why this game can go to your child ".\nIn this case, yes, there are some problems. They are described in detail also another article. But is not the problem - any game they are. And gradually they are solved. And this game - a cross-platform, that is, developers are forced to constantly monitor variations for all platforms. PC at this moment they have not the priority and they can understand - in their target audience (children) most of the time is spent with a smartphone in the hands and stranded battery perceived almost a tragedy.\nThis game stands out among the most affordable in the Steam games is the fact that it does not try to take the maximum wide audience, and focus exclusively on children. If you look after your child play - my advice to you, try to pay attention to this.","December 16, 2014","true","30.4"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","6","19","0","0"

Dreamworks is releasing a new TV Series, plus later movies. I am a Jumpstart Veteran. I have been with Jumpstart Games since Adventure Land was released, and I have to say the virtual worlds are getting better. Would love to see more updates on their other virtual worlds like EatMyDust and SuperSecret.\n\nSadly, I must warn you. The game does has it's bugs, gliches, and downsets. For example, in Fireball Frenzy, your dragon's body is covering some of the bottom targets. There has been known to be hackers for the game, which does make it unfair, and can be annoying when you see a 20 foot-tall Whispering Death. Also, if you are planning on getting the "Age-Up" option for your dragon, it won't level your dragon up; it would only give you the ability to fly.\n\nNow, I do have some suggestions. Perhaps an Arena-based game. You guys have done it before with the Monster Mutts in MathBlaster, so it shouldn't be hard recoding some parts, and redesigning some textures. Also, you should allow eggs bought from the Viking Store to be used as your first dragon. I really want to experience the quests with the Changewing from the very beginning.","December 5, 2014","true","200.8"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

However, I found the game to be colourful and frankly a breath of fresh air.\nThe graphics are outdated and similar to PS2 graphics, it's glitchy, and I've lost my dragon several times just walking around. However, this game had many more glitches before I started playing it apparently, considering I was able to input my appropriate age and I only crashed once. What we must keep in mind is this game just came out yesterday. Understandably, who would want to put a glitchy, unfinished product on the market? *cough* Ubisoft *cough* But that's the beauty of MMO's, although sometimes glitchy at first, they develop and grow over time with the right support. I think this game has a lot of potential and I'm willing to stick around for it. The cutscenes are nothing to ogle at and they play scenes from the movies for some of the quests I've done so far. Call me blinded by nostalgia, but throwing movie scenes into a computer game takes me back to the old Disney PC games. Of course, it shows laziness on development's part by not creating these cutscenes themselves, but I can still appreciate putting scenes in from the movie.\ntl;dr version: I like this game. While it has it's flaws I think it has potential. 10/10 would have toothless follow my cursor in the lab again.","December 5, 2014","true","15.3"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/parasiticartist/recommended/332070/","parasiticartist","Shabriri Nyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/parasiticartist/","31 products in account",""School of Dragons" is such a cute game. While there is a bit of negative pointers in my opinion, I do recommend this to those who do not mind  simple gaming. Withing the two hours I been playing "School of Dragons", I realize it's nothing to be overjoyed about however it is a game to waste some time at if your day consists of nothing other than staring at a clock.\n\nGraphics: I have seen better graphics in a lot of games, but these are not bad. However, depending on how smooth your computer runs things; the graphics may look different to other players. Worst yet, there is no options to lower the standards except to window/fullscreen the game perhaps.   6/10\n\nGamePlay: There is nothing special about this game play, do quest, raise your dragon and do mini-games. Pretty repetitive but again most games tend to be. You're lucky to get mini-games out of this as other games may not have that. 4/10\n\nMaps/Areas: School of Dragons have a few different maps to choose from which is nice to see despite they may not be very big. Sadly, there needs to be a stronger format/coding/ect as some players can get stuck in some places or appear as if they are in mid-jump on a bridge. It's not horrifying though and can easily be ignored if you don't run your dragon into the ground in tight areas. 5/10\n\nBugs: There is a few bugs that can be easily spotted. I had an issue when I first entered the game; After hopping on Toothless, it showed the rings we had to go through but after Hiccup finished talking they disappeared and I was unable to proceed to the next area. All you need to do is restart the game and it will be fine. Some other bugs will not be mentioned as they are not dramatic.\n\nWhile I don't feel like breaking this whole game apart due to it's childish gameplay, I will mention that this game is not as awful as people have made it seem. Yes it has it's down points like any other game, yes there are options to pay in-game however it is not Pay to Play* and yes it's a child's game.\n**The game offers in-game payment options to be a member. This does not mean it's "Pay to Play" as pay to play simply means to use real currency to continue in the game, become stronger/immortal, and unlock classes etc that are not available any other way. Paying in-game grants you membership which simply means;\n-No Ads (Original Website)\n-500 Free Gems Monthly*\n-All Flight Club Dragons*\n-20% Off InStore\n-Hiccups Flightsuit\n-Your Own Toothless\n\n**Gems help you buy a lot of stuff in the game however does not generally affect how you get through the game. Gems are used to by costumes, unnecessary gold that can be earned through jobs and quests, farm accessories to make your farm look better than the rest, dragons and gear, consumables that really have no use except restoring energy which you can do by fishing. Yes you can by better dragons, but default dragons can be just as good.\n\n**All Flight Club dragons are not your own personal dragons and may just help you get a better grade in that class. By default you can use your own dragon or Terror. Unlocking them is not a necessity.\n\nAnyone can play just as good as a person who pays.","December 4, 2014","true","2.2"," 20 of 52 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","20","52","0","0"

You can scroll down, and pick your age right there. If you're mouse doesn't scroll, on the right there's a scroller that you can use.

The gameplay feels clunky, the quests (which is SUPPOSED to be the main part of any MMORPG) feels empty, unrewarding and mainly consists of fetch-quests. Except from a few minigames, which are rather boring already, there isn't really any content for the game. Unless you are willing to become a member. But even then, you only get new dragons to ride on(which, may sound cool, it's done in a very, very awkward way.) and some new cosmetics. Then nothing else. NOTHING at all. You can finish all the quests in like a week's time(granted, I finished it in like 3 days back when it is still only on their website via Unity Web Player, with all the guide arrows last year, but still they are on by default...) and then you got nothing to do. Riding and raising your own dragons is a cool thing...but they set up payment barriers for F2Ps so that they need to pay in order to get more dragons, which, I'm doubting they would, seeing that they game does not actually have enough content to keep them there.(Or, they could potentially just start a new account to experience it again....I did. And I admit I was dumb.)\n\nBut by far, the most disappointing thing about this game, is not how the graphic is terrible, comparing to what Unity could actually do(I feel like that the reason for the horrid graphics is to make sure that a lot more pcs can run it and to maintain the same experience for all players across and probably add in that their servers might not be able to handle massive data flow or something like that, I don't know. It's just speculation. As a sidenote though, AT LEAST LET THE PLAYERS CHOOSE THE RESOULTION OF THE GAME THAT THEY WANT TO PLAY ON), it's the aim of the game and demographic players for the game.\n\nI'm a fan of the How To Train Your Dragons series for a while now, and what I've seen from the online fandom, is that they are mostly consist of people who are teens and even young adults, instead of what the game is targeting at, which is like for 6-10 year-olds. So there's a lot of quests in the game that attempts to teach the players about real-world science that they are supposed to be learning at school, and the entire game felt like it was too dumbed down to cater for them.\n\nFirst of all, the science quests. They. Ruin. Immersion. NO one wants to learn science in a world where glass is a valuable and people wear horned helmets to protect themselves in the constant battles and dragons are real. In fact, I'm pretty sure that during the Viking age, most of what we learned about since today hasn't even been theorized or ever touched on! I would rather just focus on training dragons and fly with them, thank you very much.\n\nI remember like the original aim was to like 'train, raise your own dragon and learn real world science along the way' or something like that, That's just something I can't agree on.\n\nAnd then there's the catering problem. I know, How To Train Your Dragon is supposed to be a children's film, but it feels mature(especially in the sequel, I don't want to spoil it so go find yourself and cry forever. A major character's parent died.), that's probably why it gathered a number of older fans, but even then, the game developers ignored the needs of them and would rather create something to milk money for themselves. Shame on you.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Dragons franchise, you could go try out the game...on your own behalves. This game is just not worth it. As for anyone else, nope. Don't even get the idea to click that button to install. It's not worth your time.","January 20, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are crap. There isn't even an option to turn them up or down. It's just permalocked turdvision. Speaking of options, character customization is ABSOLUTE ♥♥♥♥. There are like 2 choices of hair and 2 choices of face, both of which look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell. There are multiple bugs throught the game and they arent major except for the part where the mission you're on spontaneously termiantes and you cant move forward. I was really looking forward to playing in the HTTYD universe and I understand that this is targeted at kids but c'mon. This is 2014, this game plays like it just came out for the Nintendo 64. Did you really release a game like this and expect no one to notice. Not to mension, it takes SO LONG for you to actually ride your beloved dragon. I didn't even get to the point where i can actually ride it but I imagine it would be less like the movies and more like Superman 64 for anyone who remembers that game. This should not be considered a complete game, not even Beta for that matter. This is someone wiping there ♥♥♥ on a keyboard and somehow managing to write code that produces a barely functional program and deciding to publish his ♥♥♥_wipe.exe to steam. Furthermore, you have to PAY to DELETE a character and there is only one character slot. Honestly, wtf. Speaking of pay, microtranactions. Microtransactions everywhere, There is also a paid subscription option which unlocks for you an experience similar to that of eating turd flacored ice cream with sprinkles and caramel.

I really like it but I can understand if others can't. There are lots of problems with this game that -I feel- if are fixed this will be a much loved game. For starters;\n1. Glitches\nAlmost everywhere there are glitches, mainly graphic ones though. Everytime I try to complete a certain quest the game freezes and I yet again, have to restart the game.\n2. Graphics\nA ladder (that is the only way to get to the top of a mountain without a flying age dragon) you cannot climb without getting stuck and having to restart the game. Deep sea fishing, when you get close to the water the sea turns white and starts flashing as well as the rock you sit on out there is highlight pink. It always ignores the fact that wings are not like ghosts and should not go through rock. The trees are in 2D...?\n3. So Expensive!\nAnything that has to be bought is expensive, even as a member with a discount. The dragons I understand, but things like 70 Gems for a new hairstyle? 8 gold per piece of bait? 48 gold for 1 seed of carrots? Animals! Food for animals/Dragons!\n4. Dragons\nThere is only One Skrill In the show as well as one Night Fury So why can I buy a Skrill and paint it whatever colour I want but only one Night Fury- Toothless (whose colour cannot be changed and can only be obtained through being a member).\nAlso, More dragons should be made into the game because I want more for my growing collection. I would also like to be able to sell my dragons incase of double-ups because I'm sure you get a Whispering Death for completing a certain mission. I already have one and do not wish to go through all my missions to level up a dragon I alrweady have.\n4. Missions\nI feel there is not enough missions. I have often run out of them on both profiles, there is one that you are always able to do but you get 5 gold, 5 XP, 5 Dragon XP and 5 UDT points for it for 30 minutes of stuff. There is also a mission that cannot be completed on both profiles due to a glitch where it freezes when you are about to make a step to complete it. Leaving me with only one possible mission that is a complete waste of time.\n5. Education...? RUFKM?\nIf I wanted to see the words Hypothisis, Scientific Method, Convex, Concave, Botanist, Chemical Reaction, Science Experiment, Refract or Prisim I would be playing a Breaking Bad, Big Bang Theory, Science Class cross over game. I get that it is driven for kids but no matter how many times you say most of these the average kid is going to be like "WTF? I want to get back to the Dragons!". It makes me feel lame when those words come up because I remember that my actual nerd friends are playing WoW and LoL and I am in fact playing a kids game.\n\nWith all these issues I still love this game and still recommend it. I can fly a dragon! I'm going to be honest and say that I have no idea why I like this game. But I do, I've told you all these problems to give you a clear image of the game and although I can't particually give you reasons to play it apart from "FUN" and "DRAGONS" I ask you give it a go and get your own opinion of this game that I set Anime aside for.","January 31, 2015","true","88.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I turned on my computer and got online. My friend, Kyle, messaged me. We got caught up on our lives. He mentioned a new game that he found. A unique one based on the popular How to Train your Dragon Series. Feeling adventurous, we both downloaded it and began to play. Immediately, a smilie appeared on my face. I couldn't help. I just new from the very beginning that this game was something truly magically. The music perfectly set the mood. I began to feel like a viking myself. When I began creating my character, the amount of choices overwhelmed me. I created a character that fit my persona and felt truly connected. Then cutscenes introed the game and oh god the cutscenes. So masterfully crafted you would think they got them straight out a movie. When I finally began playing, everything fit in place. It was perfect. The controls were simple and fun. The interface was easy and clear. Voice acting was top notch. I think they got the actual movie actors! Everything was fun.

The graphics are terrible and there is literally no customization on the charcter. I get 2 options per thing. Actually, most of the customization bars have nothing in it. I've played many MMO's that had payment options for better stuff but when I tried to name my character it asked me to buy a member ship. The game crashed 2 times before I actually got to play.

Ok first off ad's pop up every so often, you even get single time offer things. Truly mean't for 5 year olds. Why, because this game teaches you about things that should not be in this game this therefore reduces the lore to the movies by well about 67%.\nPOINTERS for the DEVS:\n1. Don't teach gamers stuff. PERIOD.\n2. Free up the game a little bit, give some freedom to the players of this game.\n3. Less ads and more of the the lore and freedom (like before).\n4. Less offers to buy stuff for money. (I understand you want to make money and all but people who play video games HATE ADS AND RANDOM POP-UPS THAT KILL THE GAMEPLAY!!!)\n5. I haven't got far enough to see if this is actually a feature but, Free (flying) roaming, like... Exploring berk while flying on your dragon.\nSummary:\nIt's a great game but... Has olmost every aspect of a Pay-to-win game. If your Kid or yourself is stuggling in prek - 4th grade then this is the game for you. BUT A FAIR WARNING!!! If your child or yourself get's too attached to this game (somehow) get ready to lose all your money because, its a game where you will get mad at having a stupid dragon and then spending 56.99 to buy 500 gems to get like 6 virtual dragons that last like 6 months.(not really)\nBut its ok a little less than what i though it was.(a little pathetic overall) which makes it a below average game.\nEnjoy!","December 6, 2014","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Couldn't add friends no matter how many times we tried, closed and opened back again. At last we could add each other creating a clan and could meet in the game but hey, they still don't show up in friends list, cannot chat on the game nor ask them to help simple tasks along the game, all you can do is see them next to you while talking over Skype. Basically you choose a dragon egg, a baby dragon hatches and you need to go fishing to feed it. Also, you create a farm, buy seeds and wait for crops so you can sell them. You can decorate your farm but hey, if I wanted to play FarmVille, I could have played THAT you know. The quests are far beyond silly, teaching me the "scientific method" with quizzes? No sir. And if I wanted to spend tens of dollars, I would have bought a decent game rather than several gems. When you refuse to pay, it crashes.

Unlike most of the people who reviewed this game i actually took the time to play it for awhile. I love the concept of this game having a dragon to train a soul-bond and you can only have 1 but it contradicts itself. It say's you can only have 1 dragon that you will bond with, but if you pay for Gems you can have several dragons. You cannot earn the dragon's that cost gem's unless you A. Buy gems Or B buy a membership. I don't really feel like this game is Pay2Win as much as I feel that it is Pay2HaveFunCosmetics. The flying on the dragon's is actually quite fun i was surprised to be having fun just going through the obstacle course. It's not a very explaining game the tutorial is like yeah do this and they expect you to know how to do everything. At one point in this game i got very frustrated because it glitched and it said to feed my dragon a fish, your thinking ok how hard can this be well, when your dragon is nowhere to be seen i have no idea how to feed him. Your dragon will be a derpmonster and walk off several times. And woulden't you expect to fly your own dragon? No you will be flying a dragon called Nightmare or something. Supposedly you can't fly on your dragon till it's out of baby mode and then it does not explain how to get your dragon out of baby mode. I like this game but at the same time I hate it.\nPros!!!\nGreat Concept\nGood Storyline\nKid Friendly\nCons!!!\nExpect your kid's to get frustrated\nTerrible Graphics\nTerrible Lag\nTerrible Glitchiness\nTerrible Explanations\nAnd thank you this was my review on SOT\nIf someone ever does come out with a game like this but can turn it into a working concept it will be a great game.\n","December 21, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game has.... problems, to say the least. Firstly, I can't hardly ever rev it up without it freezing up on me while it is booting up. When I redeem quests, it doesn't always process it or freezes up right after, nothing ever really gives you enough gold because as soon as you have gold, you need to spend it on bait to catch fish to feed your dragon, and whenever I really need the fish, I get an eel or something that barely restores jack diddly squat. Some improvements I would suggest are to fix the freezing up problem, fix the display tabs in the game so they don't display the wrong info, and add in a thing where you need to choose yes or no whenever you are about to spend gems.\n\nNow for the good, I love the dragons part of the game, I like the farm and customizing the farm aspect (kinda wish I had my own viking hut to customize though), I generally like the game for what it is and how it is great for helping me calm down after a long day of playing games that ensure I get majorly ♥♥♥♥ed over to the point where I can't think at all due to rage.","December 12, 2014","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And with 'mature', I don't mean 'for adults', though that is also the case, in my opinion. Where to start...\nThis 'free to play' constantly notifies you of buyable stuff and uprades. I suspect that you will miss out if you never buy anything in the game, so the 'free to play' is a con.\nWhat annoys me too, is that the 'open world' is not that open. When walking outside, I expect to be actually able to walk from A to B, and not having to load new parts of the outside all the time.\nThe first time I played, the game crashed on me.\nThe second time I played, I wasn't able to find a menu with a 'Quit' option, so I finally Alt+F4'd my way out.\n\nIt's kinda fun to walk around in the world you know from the movies and series, but that's about it. The graphics aren't all that good. The controls are far from intuitive (I play a couple of other open world games with different controls to move around, none of them as bad as this, and it's nothing to do with 'getting used to).\n\nThe reason I finally gave up, was the profanity filter in the chat. It filters out 'un' (and words starting with it, like unrealistic, uninstall, et cetera), 'mark', 'slap' (I said 'slap on the wrist'), and the single use of '?'. It made me look like a badmouth, while the only thing I actually said that got filtered out, that was the closest to a profanity, was 'dognibbit'.\n\nI'm going to install the game, because there are better games to fill my precious time with.","December 21, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ok first off ad's pop up every so often, you even get single time offer things. Truly mean't for 5 year olds. Why, because this game teaches you about things that should not be in this game this therefore reduces the lore to the movies by well about 67%.\nPOINTERS for the DEVS:\n1. Don't teach gamers stuff. PERIOD.\n2. Free up the game a little bit, give some freedom to the players of this game.\n3. Less ads and more of the the lore and freedom (like before).\n4. Less offers to buy stuff for money.

It features several species both from the Movies and Show. My only gripes are that several species specific diet and abilities aren't in the game and that you have a Species Specific Quest. Like the Monstrous Nightmare's ability to light itself on fire, the Nadder's spine shot and the Typhoomerang's Eel diet. The Species Specific Quest involves hovering and the only dragon that can hover is a Gronkle so in order to complete that quest you need a Gronkle. This penalizes players who don't pay for gems and didn't choose a Gronkle as their starter dragon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjanickisbestpony/recommended/332070/","ninjanickisbestpony","NinjaNick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjanickisbestpony/","707 products in account","After playing this game for 7 hours, I feel I'm ready to give this a real review. I want to love it, so, so much, but I just can't. There are so many problems with this game that it makes it unbearable. If they were fixed it would at least make a fan of the HTTYD series such as myself at least deal with the minor issues, but sadly, it's not like that.\nI'm going to list some problems as I think of them so please bear with me:\n\n· No Volume bar, it's only on or off.\n· Even when both sound options are off some sounds still play, ex. leveling up, your dragon's breathing, etc.\n· Random crashes, a lot.\n· Quest arrow will just not work sometimes.\n· When doing collection quests the NPCs sometimes won't give you the items needed, making you have to re-log.\n· Some quests you finish, just to find the same quest available again making the whole quest progression system very confusing.\n· Friend list is broken, like, really broken.\n· It costs gems (real world currency) to delete a character, wtf.\n· I had to delete my old character because the quest he was on updated making the NPC I had to talk to not appear thus making the quest progress impossible.\n· Quests are really boring, to be honest. There's no variety.\n· Membership gives you some unfair benefits such as 20% discount on ALL items in the store, access to some special fishing thing in your farm, gold bonuses.\n· Anything good in the store costs gems such as the compost, improved fishing rods, good saddles, and lots of other items that are basically needed to get ahead in the game.\n· Membership costs a ♥♥♥ ton for what you get, $10 a month, Jesus.\n· When you go to the credits section of the game you can jump off the cliff and forever fall through the world. This really surprised me and you would think that they would have fixed it by now. It's not.\n\nSo now some good aspects of the game:\n\n· Fishing is kinda fun\n· Toothless is in the game AKA the best dragon ever\n· The UDT system is kinda neat but affected heavily by hackers\nThat's about it.\n\nNow, if you still want to go ahead and give the game a shot, go ahead. I hope you have a lot of fun. For the others still looking for a good kids game, I heavily recommend Wizard101 or Pirate101. Thos games are without a doubt the best kid friendly game I have ever played.\n\nIn the end, I feel this game is incomplete and not worthy of your money, or your time. It's something that you would casually play just to have a little fun and not take it seriously or play it hours on end every day. I really hope the developers solve some of these bugs and create a better game, but it's been out for 2 years, I don't see them redeeming themselves anytime soon.","March 28, 2015","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
