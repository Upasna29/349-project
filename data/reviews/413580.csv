"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/recommended/413580/","azusa_twin","ティアラ μ's","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/","244 products in account","Reverse x Reverse is the latest game from desunoya_Logodesunoya, creator of Tobari and the Night of the Curious Moon. This game is a cute & quirky challenging puzzle platformer that has a total of 81 mind-melting levels that comes with online leader boards, where you get to control two girls that is heroic and witty at the same time, Code and Rithm, as who have been set out on a quest into a internal layer of their game world to find the root cause of Bug Fields that have been rapidly spreading. Help them both through the levels and collect data discs that will be used to restore their world!\n\nGenerally I like the concept of the game of either controlling 2 character at once or just 1 of them to complete tasks and these 2 characters Code and Rithm each both have a special unique power that is only available to them [Code having the ability to “dash” and Rithm having the ability to do a double jump]\nThere are objectives in the game where players have to collect “Discs” and reach the final “Big Discs” at the end of the level in a time frame of 300 seconds.\n\nThe Discs are usually very important to progress because collecting them will open a pathway or what the game calls a “BugField” to let players through to get to the progress further but if not collecting them the “Bugfield” will stay and players will be blocked by a “BugField” which is a wall that will hinders the player’s progression.\n\nThis game at first glance it looks like a “rage” game but not to worry, the puzzles are acceptable and you can trust me on this one since I am not good at platformer games at all, the levels that are presented to you in this game are very possible to win as long if you have the patience and willing to do trial and error [you may need to do it on some of the levels] and most of them require knowledge means you will need to have platformer game skills and some knowledge to solve puzzles.\n\nFeatures to point out– Global steam leader boards\n– Friends only steam leader boards\n– Controller support\n– 81 levels\n– Overall cute looking characters\n\nTo sum upThis game it will be a hit or miss for some people as some people hate puzzles or platformers, as for me I am a person that hates puzzles to the core, I hate to use my brain but Reverse x Reverse caught my attention and somehow managed to get me slightly addicted most provably because of steam leader boards and interesting game play.\n\nFull review link - https://azusantiara.wordpress.com/2015/12/10/reverse-x-reverse-review/","December 10, 2015","true","44.2"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","40","44","4","1"

Seriously, I apologize to them that they had to go through hell just so we could get the game. They are the real MVPs.\n\nFull review: http://www.thedrastikmeasure.com/2015/12/10/we-touch-games-reverse-x-reverse-pc-review/","December 10, 2015","true","7.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","1"

The leaderboards gives a pretty fun incentive to try to replay levels over again to try to figure out a faster way to solve a puzzle, and getting a higher rank can start to feel like another aspect of the puzzle itself.\n\nI can see this game becoming more difficult in the later stages, but right now it's always given off the vibe of being hard but fair, as opposed to games that are punishingly unfair. The mechanics also seem pretty well thought out so far in my opinion, so I don't think there would be any frustration there.\n\nAlso the two characters are pretty cute and their voice actors throughout the small cutscenes every time you enter a new world or so are pretty good. Seems like a really polished little game of sorts that I guess if you love tough puzzlers you'd like as well. Hope this game gains at least a small amount of success because I feel it deserves it.","December 17, 2015","true","11.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

One is inverted making the level completely different upside down, and at point you can even switch their positions as their gravity is also oppisite.\n+ Cute likable characters, Japanese voice-acting with some comedic dialogue\n+ A nice relaxing electronic soundtrack\n+ Get very challenging later on with a lot of interesting mechanics like blocks that will scroll the screen in various directions\n\n- I didn't see any option to go past 720p, and I don't think there's an option to play fullscreen\n- Can be quite frusterating on later levels\n","April 24","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Execution gets challenging as you go on, especially when going for faster stage times.  Because of the difficulty, devising faster solutions and pulling off tricky manuevers are incredibly satisfying.","December 15, 2015","true","69.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/catscradle/recommended/413580/","catscradle","Nanami","http://steamcommunity.com/id/catscradle/","225 products in account","The short: You control two characters in a well-made puzzle-platformer that expects you to be VERY proficient at controlling them by the end. Recommended if you enjoy tough puzzles that also require precise execution to complete and you like the anime aesthetic; otherwise, you probably ought to pass. Controller recommended, unless you're fine with breaking whatever key you bind Synchro to.\n\n*Note: I played the game before it was released on steam, hence the low playtime.\n\nThe long: Reverse x Reverse (RxR) is a puzzle-platformer with the core gameplay mechanic of simultaneously managing two characters, each with their own unique ability (one can dash, and the other can double jump). The first few stages provide a gentle introduction to the game while the player gets used to controlling the pair. These intro stages are followed by a steady stream of new gameplay mechanics, which are accompanied by an initially reasonable difficulty ramp... but the last world is a monster on its own, so be prepared to endure a lot of frustration.\n\nAdditionally, there are several puzzles that will require you to think, react, and execute rather quickly and precisely, especially if you choose to pursue high scores for each stage, so keep that in mind when considering a purchase.\n\nMost importantly, in my opinion, RxR passes all of the checks for a good puzzle-platformer: good stage/puzzle design, tight controls, steady introduction of new mechanics (and combinations of old)... combined with good artwork, music, spritework, and voicework, this was genuinely one of my favorite games of 2015.","December 20, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
