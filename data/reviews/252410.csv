My only real issue is that it's over a little too quickly, between 6-10 hours depending on how much you explore. It's got pretty good replay value too and I don't think you'll find too many other games as good as this in this price range.

Motherlode because the game owes a lot to the concept of digging down into the earth, mining minerals and then selling them on the surface for gold to buy upgrades, which then enable you to dig deeper, take on more enemies etc. Spelunky because the main levels are procedurally generated, and the general feel of your character is quite similar to Spelunky (so much so that playing one after the other causes quite a bit of confusing pressing the wrong buttons!). Metroidvania because there are various caves that are set puzzles scattered throughout the main mine shafts, and completing them gives you upgrades that allow access to previously inaccessible areas. It's a compelling formula polished to a fine sheen here. There's a lot more depth (ho ho) to this game than first appears. I definitely dug it. In fact I'd say it's oresome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/252410/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3060 products in account","Moving into Steamworld Dig, I knew two things. The first being that a tasty art style is not a good indicator of a game's quality, and two, that this was originally a handheld title. With these things in mind, I begin my journey into the depths of what turns out to be a charming and far more than competent Dig-Dug style, upgrade laden adventure.\n\nWhen you first enter the only town in the game - which acts as the hub for your adventure - you're limited by the only tool you possess: your trusty pickaxe. In this beginning portion of the game, where your only moves are to jump and slowly break away the dirt beside and beneath your feet, this game's handheld roots seem to become apparent, as there doesn't appear to be any sort of depth to what your doing nor any real goal other than to find your long lost uncle Rusty. I was almost tempted to quit and write it off here as nothing more than a simple throwaway time waster. Luckily I didn't, as the game's (limited) depth soon bubbles it's way to the surface.\n\nYour journey to find your uncle consists of digging deep and hard for minerals of varying value, which can be traded for currency, which in turn increases your "level" and the sorts of things that you can purchase. Finding these minerals is your primary goal in the game, as the ground gets harder the deeper you go, and your simple pickaxe won't always cut it. This is what drives the game, and caused me to play it for hours at a time: Upgrades! That feeling you get when you finally earn enough for that powerful new pickaxe or higher defense against the creepy crawlies that inhabit the underground persists throughout the duration of the game, and you'll have to do a lot of mining to earn enough for all of them. But you won't be able to stay down for hours, hoarding all of the loot you snag. You can only hold a finite amount of minerals, among other, upgradeable necessities, such as light and water, that you will need to replenish by returning to the surface. And that loot pouch fills up quickly, limiting how long you can explore at a time, and you will need upgrade it's capacity if you want to stay deeper for longer.\n\nAs you progress, you will find brand new abilities that you will constantly have to utilize if you want to survive and loot the entirety of the world beneath the surface, like a powerful drill arm and the ability to leap larger distances. You will have to use every move you earn if you want to make it to the bottom; there are no useless abilities here.\n\nThe world isn't limited to the drab and ordinary beneath that you start your journey, and soon opens up to several varying areas with far more dangerous traps and enemies, as well as more valuable loot. This is the sort of game that you need to stick with past the first hour, as prior to this point, it can seem like a boring and shallow experience. And in many ways, it is very limited by it's handheld origins. A full PC/Console sequel could very easily rectify any complaints I have, the greatest being the limited use of the minerals you find. For a game whose loot can so easily be associated with that of games like Terraria, Starbound or Minecraft, it feels like a massive waste of an opportunity to not utilize the minerals you find in the same way. Finding that last piece raritanium needed to craft the Quantum Drill Head is infinitely more exciting than just finding a gem that sells for the last few coins that you needed to just buy the thing. Especially given that the characters are all robots, it's a shame that there isn't any sort of customizable upgrade system in place, augmented by rare materials you can seek out.\n\nAs simple as the experience is, it never gets boring. As you progress downwards, there is always a new ability to be discovered, hidden gem caches to dig up, and upgrades to buy. The game scratches that very special itch to find every last hidden object, and can make playtime range anywhere from 3-10 hours, depending on just how much you really need that final upgrade.\n\nAs it is, Steamworld Dig is a fantastic time waster for the loot junkie needing a break from their poison of choice, even if the game does little more than scratch that itch for several hours. The potential for something far greater is there, and I truly do hope for a sequel that capitalizes on crafting systems already implemented in other similar titles. As a solid first entry, with a very real opportunity to make a fantastic sequel, I can only hope that the developers are already hard at work designing the next entry in the Steamworld series.","May 26, 2014","true","5.6"," 102 of 116 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","102","116","0","12"

Do you like weird, steampunk robots? Do you enjoy Metroidvania style action platformers where you get a lot of upgrades and upgrade a lot of equipment?\n\nSteamWorld Dig may be right for you, as long as you don't mind the game's short, short length (I clocked in at 3 hours and 15 minutes), very slightly repetitive digging, and overall sort-of-Flash-game feel. The core gameplay loop is simple; dig through rocks to find gems and orbs, then make it back to town safely to upgrade your digging tool, water tank, health, or lantern, then rinse and repeat. It's fun, luckily, which stops it from feeling like a chore, but those of you looking for constantly changing ideas and gameplay should look elsewhere.\n\nThe theme is interesting; a dusty desert, a dangerous and ramshackle mine, filled with all sorts of dangers, and a town with a couple robots like yourself, along with some robots who make their way to town as you progress through the game. The sound design is fun; lots of tinky tinks as you hit things with your pickaxe, and loud booms as dynamite goes off deep inside of a mineshaft. The story is essentially non-existent; you're told of your predecessor and handed the tools to complete what he'd started, and only at the end is there really another story beat. It's not a bad choice, per se, but if you were hoping for meaty lore and plot-heavy digging, you'll be disappointed.\n\nI liked SteamWorld Dig a lot, and had no problems with the short length. I wouldn't have minded more, and I felt like some of the tool upgrades and new gadgets were ultimately pointless, but I was satisfied with what I got.\nI'll happily keep an eye out for Image&Form's next game, wherever and whatever it may be.\n\nOverall rating: 7.5/10","January 15, 2014","true","4.8"," 73 of 85 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","73","85","0","0"

You will dig, dig, dig and find many precious things, then you will turn them into money, now you will take your money to buy stuff so you can dig, dig, dig better and faster.\n\nThe adaptation of your playthrough, where you try to upgrade yourself (level-up and upgrade weapon/armor), is very well done. The gameplay's design is architechtural well built. The monsters get smarter and harder to kill, while you get stronger along the way.

I especially love Spelunky and Super Meat Boy. I also enjoy games like Guacamelee and Raymond. So if you like them too you'll probably not like this game. I also like sandbox games like terraria and starbound. So this review might be helpful for people with the same taste. Don't expect from this game too much. It'll take 2-3 evenings. But before I count things I don't like I'd prefer to show positive side of deal:\n\n+ there is a plot\n+ funny NPC characters, their phrases\n+ beautiful simple picture\n\nThat's all. It's ok for $4 game (I bought it during sale), but anyway I regret that I spent time and money for it. Now check things I don't like about this game:\n\n- It's really short. It took less than 5 hours to pass it completely including all "puzzle" caves. According to the game plot It has a claim to be continued, but it will be another game or DLC. It's better to be free patch/DLC. Otherwise, it'll not be worth.\n- Simple. No challenges at all. It's like walking in the park. Game process is slow and smooth. I didn't feel my self in dangerous until I met a boss. There is only one boss at the end of the game. Regular monsters are dump and predictable. They are easy to avoid or kill. Few "puzzle" caves require 2-5 minutes to pass because of they are obvious. And it's not big deal to die as you will be resurrected.\n- Routine. Yep, it's all about digging. Get deeper to get more resources to sell it to get more money to upgrade your ammunition to be able to get deeper... you got it. Defeat final boss.\n- Replayability. There is no replayability. No score table to compare your and another players progress, crack a records. No difficult levels.\n- More fun with company? No, thank you. I've got used to play with my wife together or with friend of mine. Games like Spelunky, Guacamelee allow me to enjoy company and a game at the same time. Regarding to SteamWorld Dig there is no multiplayer or hot seat. It's obvious from the game description but it's pity anyway.\n\nIt's not an ideal game or a masterpiece. Just be ready if you're going to play. On the other hand, it was disposable fun you can enjoy yourself anyway and may be like it. Frankly, I can't recommend this game. I hope my review was helpful for you.","February 19, 2014","false","5.1"," 323 of 503 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","323","503","0","12"

(edit: After beating it - one thing may be a bug, I never saw one shopkeeper appear, but aside from that, no, the rest of this still stands)\n\nSWD is a game that tries to meld two cool concepts: the digging and exploration of a Terraria, and the 'levelling' and ability gain of a Metroidvania. The problem is that it drops the ball on both. The early game involves a LOT of back-and-forth between going into the mines, filling your pouch, and then returning to the surface. Do this a few times and you'll have sold back enough materials to level up the town's shopkeeper, and buy a new pick, and... okay, can you see where this is already starting to become an issue?\n\nAs you dig down, there will be the occasional chamber to explore (basically a side-room to the large vertical shaft you continue down). This is basically where the Metroid influence comes in: single room puzzles that lead to one of the more limited currencies (did I mention there's more than just gold? there are also ORBS to upgrade things) or your actual upgrades. These rooms are fun! But you basically have to realize that they're few and far between, and it's like if you were playing, to keep this metaphor going, a version of Metroid where between every interesting room, there were about 10 of those vertical shaft levels and you needed to BATTLE YOUR WAY DOWN. With fall damage.\n\nTo top it off, eventually the stuff you're digging down through becomes too hard for a pick to work on, so you need to find a drill... but because the game has the word "Steam" in the title, a lot of your abilities or items rely on your stored water as you go on. Water becomes really quite scarce, and at where I am now(? god I hope this changes), I can't refill that in town like everything else (I would have assumed the saloon lets me do this but nope). Everything but your basic pick and your run move is a limited-inventory item or requires water. EVERYTHING. HIGH-JUMPING requires steam power. Given that the basic pick straight up WILL NOT WORK to break things past a certain ore, this is easily the worst aspect of the game.\n\nOther small gripes: Combat bites, you need to be on top of enemies to hit them and you DO take contact damage, so that's risky as heck. (I just got a ranged weapon but IT NEEDS STEAM TO USE so that becomes another 'fun' tradeoff between "can I dig or do I hit this dude from two squares away"). The grind is seriously irritating, if I try and beeline between the good rooms, I'm suddenly underleveled and can't buy the item that'll upgrade my drill and let me keep digging, so I've gotta go farm things in a dimly lit mining stage for ten minutes at a time.\n\nIf this were tightened up a little, this could be a really cool game, but it's trying to do way too many things unsuccessfully to really make it above "competent".","April 29, 2014","false","4.5"," 35 of 54 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","35","54","0","0"

SteamWorld Dig however convinced me. It's a very good game if you are ready to dig into it. Now if you wonder, why does a guy who does not like platformers buy a platformer, that's because the game was part of a bundle and I decided  to give it a shot. I didn't regret it.\n\nIn SteamWorld Dig your uncle dies which makes you the new owner of a mine. Equipped with a pickaxe you start exploring the mine and it's secrets. You can find all kind or ore and minerals that you can sell to upgrade your equipment. During the course of the game you will upgrade your health, your armour, get better pickaxes, find drills and something like a jack-hammer, bigger bags, etc. A number of unfriendly creatures will cross your way and you will discover caves holding secrets left by your uncle. The underworld is divided into three major areas and the whole experience is wrapped in an interesting, simple story.\n\nThe game starts a little boring during the first two hours but gets better and better the longer you play. So you need a little patience. After finishing the game I wanted to repeat it right away.\n\nPros:\n- nice graphics\n- fantastic title melody, I even started whistling it at work\n- good controller support\n- very good overall game concept, the story, secrets, gadgets, it all makes perfect sense\n- becomes addictive the longer you play\n- it's fun\n- well balanced level of difficulty\n\nCons:\n- one achievement seemed bugged, I did not get it the first time (but the second time)","April 10","true","18.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

They both have the same basic idea. Dig for valuable minerals, return to the surface to sell off your gains, buy new equipment & supplies, repeat. It's a simple concept but it's addictive and entertaining. Steamworld Dig adds to this concept and creates a very nice game.\n\nThe goal of the game is to make your way to the bottom of an ancient underground labyrinth. Mostly you'll be digging your way through, however you'll make occasional detours to collect special upgrades. These upgrades include the ability to dig through rocks, fire projectiles, and eventually even double-jump. It's kinda comparable to Metroid, since you can use the upgrades to find better stuff in previous areas. There are also various creatures to deal with. There are a handful of ways to deal with them aside from just using your pickax. This game is really combat-oriented though, just consider it another obstacle in the way of your loot.\n\nSteamworld Dig is a very well-paced game. Aside from monsters, there are also traps and other issues that crop as your scour the depths. There might even be times where you can't find a way back up. Unless you can find a teleporter(or brought one with you), the only alternative will be very costly repairs. Getting crushed by rocks is also a thing that can happen. Really though, this is an easy game. It's very much something that you put in to relax for a bit.\n\nNot to say that this game doesn't have any challenge. There are end-game rankings as well as a variety of ways for you to challenge yourself. Maybe on your next play-through you can skimp on the health upgrades, or devise that perfect route to get through the game as fast as possible. For some one trip through the labyrinth is enough, but Steamworld Dig does offer more, and the good controls and playablity make for welcome return trips.","September 4, 2014","true","4.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The gameplay is solid if not a bit too straightforward: you dig. You will dig for gold to buy upgrades that will allow you to dig more efficiently, and so the vicious cycle will continue. There is some light combat, exploration, and platforming involved and it all plays out rather nicely.\n\nI really only tend to complain when games drag out, but SteamWorld seemed to just rush through itself. I almost feel like SteamWorld invited me over to play Legos, but then at the last second got insecure and just decided to rush through all the fun stuff rather than just enjoy a decent amount of time together. It’s really hardly a complaint, it is more of a backhanded encouragement: you were a nice little gem, I just wish there was more of you.\n\nFor the time that SteamWorld does stick around it is strangely enjoyable. I think I may actually have some fun with a digging simulator as this game managed to convince me that digging could be fun and wasn’t just for mining nerds. There is definitely some combat and exploration, and I do remember a bit of a challenge here or there.\n\nThis is not a life changing game, but it is well oiled and worth a bit of your time. I can recommend it on sale for those don’t expect Guacamelee.\n","March 4, 2014","true","6.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

That being said, it is still nice to have options, and returning to previous 'puzzle caves' with a new ability that allows you to reach a previously unattainable cache of ore is a nice touch, it's just a shame that it wasn't expanded upon more.\n\nThe game also offers a basic level of resource management, with water to power your tool needing to be refilled by standing in pools, or the light that powers your vision underground needing to be recharged by returning to the surface, but rather than add something to the game, it actually detracts from the experience as you may on occasion find yourself quite literally stumbling around in the dark forced to spend ages trying to break through rocks with your pickaxe as you've run out of light and water. Annoyingly you have to return to the surface to refill your light gauge, but can not refill your water gauge there, so it can sometimes mean a lot of uncessesary backtracking, and feels like a tool to artificially extend the playing time of the game.\n\nIn addition, the game  offers little in the way of real challenge, either in the sparse combat or the handful of puzzle based rooms dotted about the three distinct levels of the game, so any semi competent gamer will find it a breeze to complete in a few hours. To properly explore every nook and cranny will take a little longer, but there isn't really a great deal of incentive to do so.\n\nDespite the negatives though, I enjoyed playing through SteamWorld Dig, and feel that if the planned sequel is longer, with more advantage taken of the skills you earn while playing, then it would be a worthy purchase. As it stands, this game does feel like a missed opportunity, but the potential is definitely there, and I would recommend it to players who want a light-hearted and stress-free gaming experience, or to younger players.\n\n7/10","December 16, 2013","true","7.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

After all, everyone else seemed to. I have A LOT of steam games and have trouble passing up a promising game when it goes on sale. This was the case with SteamWorld Dig. I read the reviews, looked at the screen shots, checked out the forums, etc. and this definitely sounded like a game that I would enjoy. It looks like bastion and looked like it would play like Terraria's awkward little brother. With that said, I was pretty disappointed when I realized that this game is essentially all of the mining components of Terraria without any of the depth of either of the aforementioned games. This game is great for killing some time, but that's about all it is: a time killer. I didn't laugh at all, and found it to be more or less a grind without any of the payout. It's linear - literally. You have a map that clearly shows that you cannot go right or left anymore, and you just keep digging down. Your pickaxe is your weapon and you can upgrade it, but there's no reward for exploration beyond getting a few more orbs or precious stones that you don't really need in the end.\n\nAll in all, I beat this game because I paid for it. Had it been a mobile app I would have been a lot less critical, but it's not. I bought it because people were comparing it to games that I love (Terraria, Starbound, Bastion, etc) that are all surprisingly well polished (Starbound is still in the works, but a lot of fun to play) and much deeper than SteamWorld Dig can possibly hope to get. It's a very two dimensional game with a very two dimensional storyline. I kept hoping that it would get better and gain a bit more depth, but that only led to disappointment. If you like mind numbingly simple games than this might be a good pick for you, but I would suggest spending your money elsewhere if you don't enjoy grinding for hours on end.","February 18, 2014","false","6.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Steamworld Dig blends together Metroid, Spelunky, and Terraria flawlessly. You play as Rusty, a robot that receives a mine from his uncle. From that sentence, you know plot doesn't matter here. The object is to dig deeper & deeper into your mine, gathering ores to sell so you can buy upgrades for the various tools you find while exploring. The game starts off a bit slow, but stick with it and you'll find a very nice risk & reward system. There's treasure everywhere, but there are also traps and enemies to fight. The graphics in Steamworld Dig look fantastic. Hand-drawn 2D sprites and excellent animation. Each playthrough is randomized, so you also have replay value. I only have a couple negatives for Steamworld. The music for me was somewhat forgettable, but that's a small complaint for a game of this quality. Also, I wish the game were a bit more challenging, but that's another small complaint.","February 16, 2014","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Frankly it is not a bad game but a game that doesn't reach my expectation. I hope this negative review can be a reference to those like me who only check negative reviews before buying any games.\n\nPROS:\n+ Nice graphic\n+ Do have a plot\n+ No bugs found\n+ Replayability (for those who found this game interesting)\n\nCONS:\n- Monotone gameplay\nAt the first few minutes I was expecting some tasks like finding someone trapped in the cave or some interactions like item crafting. Unfortunately the answer is no. The entire gameplay is repeating the cycle: dig - back to town - sell minerals - buy upgrades - go down - dig again. The NPCs do nothing other than basic trading and story telling.\n\n= Tiresome to get back to the town (main negative)\nThere are many reasons that can force you to go back: low health, no lighting oil, no water, or your bag is full. It is not a problem unless it is time-consuming and boring. There are handful free portals in the cave. When your portal is at 400m and you digged 100m downward from the portal, you need to climb up 100m to your portal to go back to the town. If you want to dig deeper, you need to go down the 100m first. Supposing you've digged another 100m this time, you need to climb up 200m to go back, What bothers me a lot is that you need to detour to find a way up. So each time you want to go back, you might need to walk and jump for a long time, and you might have gone through this path for over 10 times. Of course you can buy a self-placed portal, but the price will double each time you buy it, and it cost the shiny blue balls (can't remember its name), which is a rare resource.\n\n- Plain fighting system\nThe attack type and enemy variety are not rich. During the fight, there is no knockback effect, no HP bar for enemies and no dmg indicator jumping out. Don't expect too much on fighting.\n\n- Easy boss fight\nThe boss is not challenging at all. You just need to  use your mouse and keyboard .\n\n- Ordinary Soundtrack\nYou could get bored after listening to it over and over again. Personally it is also not my style and it makes me feel unconfortable rather than enjoyable.\n\n- Misc\nYou can't mine while jumping. You can't dig through the boundary (not an open world).\n\nCONCLUSION:\nYou can get bored easily.","December 27, 2015","false","12.2"," 32 of 58 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","32","58","6","2"

It reminded me a bit of Mr. Driller, but with deeper gameplay and without the timer. As the new mining bot in town it's your job to dig your way down the old mines and find as many minerals as you can while uncovering the story. Sell the minerals to the locals to gather money and buy upgrades. Upgrades you desperately need later on in the game, when enemies become tougher to kill and it literally takes seconds to destroy blocks.\n\nI guess you'll die several times during the game, which is totally fine. Even when I died I wanted to collect my dropped loot and go to that next mine. It evokes that 'one more time' feeling with every death.\n\nBut like I said, it's a little game. And it can be finished in 3+ hours, depending on if you want to collect the achievements or not.\n\nThe graphics are colorful, sharp and charming and look great on higher resolutions. The sounds consist of nothing but sound bites and background music, but they fit the game and get the job done.\n\nIt doesn't even matter, the end result is awesome.

While it only clocked about 4-5 hours, I had fun the entire time, and had difficulty putting it down. That in and of itself is worth a recommendation, as my gaming attention span is difficult to hold. But I digress.\n\nThe gameplay boils down to, well, digging and exploration. If you don't particularly value exploration and collection, I don't think this game is right for you. Digging to new depths, collecting Ore to sell, and gaining valueable upgrades is most of what you'll be doing.\n\nThe graphics are very pleasant; it has a distinct, vibrant aesthetic that I very much enjoyed.\n\nHowever...\n\n- Feels short (~4 hours). Left me longing for more game.\n- Combat was somewhat frustrating. Thankfully, it's not to frequent.\n- Gameplay is somewhat tedious, with digging and returning to town to replenish light / looking to replenish resources.\n\nStill, overall I enjoyed the game, especially considering I got it in a $1 Humble Bundle.

Also, in addition to the main map, there are portals to puzzle levels, which give you an opportunity to find extra loot, as well as upgrades nessessary for progress.\n\nThe final boss was a little annoying, but it only took me a couple of attempts.

Plays very smoothly w/ Xbox360 controller.  Sound design and direction in general are dramatically better than in most indie/budget games.\n\nThe billing of "hybrid of Super Metroid and Terria" is fair and accurate, though it lacks the vastness and complexity of those titles.  Not that it matters, in my opinion, as what IS here is handled exceptionally well and captivates throughout.\n\nThe only knock against this game, in my book, is the length.  Exploring the vast majority of nooks and crannies, as well as backtracking regulary (more on this after the review) put me at 6h11m for completion.  Others are reporting clear times of around 3 hours, and knowing what I know now, I would assume that those people are enjoying the game even more than I did (and are probably even more upset about the game's brevity).\n\nOverall I'd give this game an 8/10.  If the game were dramatically longer or lower-priced, I'd probably be calling it 9/10.  On a day when I had nothing important to do, and was really dying for a timekiller, this absolutely hit the spot and was worth the money.\n\n\n(spoilers ahead, read at own risk)\n\n\nI hate spoilers and I hate spoiling things for people, but there is one thing I reallllllly wish I knew before starting the game:\n\nRelatively early-on, you'll get a chance to buy a consumable item that allows faster travel to/from town.  Because the currency required for this item is very rare in the beginning, I was hesitant to use them.  In retrospect, I regret the additional time spent backtracking in lieu using these items.\n\nIf you're fairly thorough in your search, you'll find enough currency to buy at least a dozen of these items and still have enough left-over to buy all of the upgrades.  This will obviously cut your playtime down a bit, likely to the range of 3-5 hours, but you'll probably get a bit more enjoyment out of the game than I did!","December 5, 2013","true","9.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

At first the game feels like it shares a lot in common with Terraria, but as you advance further in it also shares a flavor of Metroid, with encouraged exploration and a gradual progression of upgrades, both purchased through exchanged loot or at key juncutres in the game.\n\nThe goal of the game is to dig as far down as you possibly can, frequently re-emerging at the top to purchase supplies and gear before venturing even further. It sounds tedious, but surprisingly hooks you in and gives you that sense of real progress as you dig down mile upon mile, environment changing and hazards growing more deadly.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from the likes of Terraria, and what I find the most appealing about the game, is that the whole time you are working toward directed goals, instead of being left to your own devices. You can explore the caverns and go slightly off the beaten bath in search for treasure and loot, but the whole time you're inching toward the end of the inevitable pathway you carve out.\n\nIt took me 6 hours to beat on my first playthrough, but the game itself features randomly-generated mines with each new save slot, giving you incentive to revisit the game and try it again with an unfamiliar layout.

The loop of digging for more treasure, returning to the surface to sell off what you've found, upgrade your gear, and dive back in to dig for more treasure (but now faster and better) is actually incredibly relaxing. The moody post-apocalypse/wild west setting helps with this a great deal, as you have a great sense of atmosphere and it's utilized pretty well.\n\nThe game introduces new ability upgrades at a pretty steady pace, and they usually serve a dual purpose: though there are often specific rooms built around solving puzzles using these upgrades, most of them also just help traverse the mines you've dug out. It's sort of like Metroid, but also not really.\n\nThe game's a bit on the easy side, but that's not necessarily a complaint. That being said, some kind of "New Game+" that remixes the world a little more would be a welcome addition.\n\nBut still. It's a heck of a nice game.

It finds a very nice sweet spot between Metroidvania style platforming and Terraria-like endless crafting.  There is a dash of roguelike dungeon creation, but no crafting, and a very straightforward set of upgrades that progressively increase your range of abilities and add to the fun.  The game has a pleasing sense of style, with sharp graphics and a goofy Steampunk/Wild West setting. Like I said, it's not very long, with about 5-10 hours to complete the campaign.  I beat it in 7.5hrs (it tells you how long it took you to win) without trying to speedrun or uncover every secret. There is some replayability if you want to max out your performance by finding everything, not dying through an entire playthrough, etc. Definitely a solid little game though.","September 14, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With that out of the way, what does this port do? Well, it gives the game a complete facelift and added Gamepad support (Which is how you SHOULD play it). The gameplay is pure Metroidvania and a bit of mining is thrown in as a way to collect money. The money you collect can be used to upgrade your tools and bring more people into your small town. If you're okay with managin resources though, you're REALLY gonna love this game. As you're in the mines, you have 3 bars to worry about: Health, Water or Steam, and Light. Each has it's own purpose in gameplay. Water is used for your tools and super jump. Light is (obviously) used for light. And health is used for keeping you alive from fall damage and enemies. The game uses some roguelite platforming as well, so you have to focus on your jumps, or it's game over.

I have only a few complaints.\n\nFirst is that some of the purchased upgrades felt extremely arbitrary.  You can upgrade your pick to mine faster... But the ground gets harder to mine every few layers down.  So the end result is that you spend most of the game mining at the same speed anyway.\n\nSecondly, I feel like the beginning of the game was a little bit slow.  Before you are given a lot of tools the game can be a little stale, and feel too simple.  Thankfully that is completely reversed as the game progresses: Each new tool you get gives you new options, and new ways of thinking about mining and dispatching enemies.  I just feel that a little bit of complexity could have been added earlier.  As it stands you just have to kind of consider the first section of the game an extended tutorial.\n\nThe plot was simple, but I liked it.  The world felt much bigger than was shown, which is a wonderful achievement.  Little things that the characters said seemed to stand out, or imply things about the worlds past and origins.\n\nThe graphics are pretty excellent.  Nothing stood out as particularly terrible.  Most things are easy to spot and read, which is always nice in a puzzle-style game.\n\nI was tempted to call the game 'short', since I finished it in only a few days, but I think that it is actually right about the correct length.  If it was to be any longer then there would have to be more tools to be given to you, since I felt that I ended up with a good mastery of my toolkit, and there wasn't much more to learn.\n\nAll in all, a solid pick up.

Its remake early this year fell a little short, but was still a fun nostalgia trip with enhanced gameplay.\n\nSteamworld Dig is Everything I wished Motherload was, but wasn't. Multiple weapons, likable characters, Puzzle aspects, hidden areas, running out of fuel doesnt cripple you, there are actually enemies to fight, you can dig up (to an extent), you have spells and abilities, necessary tech doesnt require grind, you can buy permenant checkpoints that teleport you to the surface. I havent played this game to completion yet, but so far it's in good standings to sire my children.\n\nThe one thing Motherload has Steamworld beat on is its rogue-like elements. Steamworld's puzzle rooms are static (obviously) and don't change from playthrough to playthrough, and it's downwards path is pretty linear.

Recently though, I decided to play it again, and ended up playing through to completion in one sitting.\n\nSteamWorld Dig is a great little arcade-platformer. You play the role of Rusty, a robot cowboy/prospector that has come to town to find out more about his uncle. Equipped with only a pickaxe, you begin to excavate the depths below Tumbleton.\n\nAt it’s heart SteamWorld Dig is a run-jump-and-dig platforming/collection game. More advanced platforming mechanics are introduced throughout the "dig", through mini-caves scattered within the main shaft. Mining and selling the ores you find exploring is the main mechanic to buy upgrades. I found myself a little frustrated at times with my purchases being non-optimal, but there is probably a science to the upgrades that would make the gameplay feel a bit more rewarding.\n\nExploring otherwise felt fun and engaging. All the ores to be mined brought out the completionist side in me. The “natural” obstacles were easily overcome with the correct upgrades, but sometimes just ended up requiring a bit more scavenging be done in order to purchase the correct upgrade so that you could continue.\n\nThe art-style and characters are fun and surface-level interesting. The story is basically there to serve a glue for the game to make sense — it isn’t really necessary, but doesn’t get in the way if you just want to dig.\n\nOverall, I’d recommend this game as it provides enough of the fun platforming and resource collection aspects without being too hard on you when you make a poor decision in the upgrade paths. Would play again.","December 16, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of my friends were. It was the perfect mix of skinner-box grind, story and challenge. Its remake early this year fell a little short, but was still a fun nostalgia trip with enhanced gameplay.\n\nSteamworld Dig is Everything I wished Motherload was, but wasn't. Multiple weapons, likable characters, Puzzle aspects, hidden areas, running out of fuel doesnt cripple you, there are actually enemies to fight, you can dig up (to an extent), you have spells and abilities, necessary tech doesnt require grind, you can buy permenant checkpoints that teleport you to the surface. I havent played this game to completion yet, but so far it's in good standings to sire my children.\n\nThe one thing Motherload has Steamworld beat on is its rogue-like elements. Steamworld's puzzle rooms are static (obviously) and don't change from playthrough to playthrough, and it's downwards path is pretty linear. If you're okay with this, pick this game up.\n\n11/10 best mining simulator since the program I used at the minesite while working as an engineer for Rio Tinto.","September 17, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the other, the game rarely presents much of a challenge, rarely testing your/Rusty's abilities.\n\nThe graphics are charming, the environments and NPCs memorable, and the sense of exploration is great...and then you realize it's all over with little sense of real accomplishment (well, as much accomplishment as one can glean from playing a video-game).\n\nIt's definitely a short and sweet experience, and you will likely find yourself addicted for the 5-9 hours or so it will take to complete the game, but unfortunately the limited depth and replayability means few will be coming back to this one.

When I think of games like Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, I remember large, fairly open world to explore where there are numerous paths however, some can only be traversed once a certain item/skill is obtained. Steamworld Dig has the blocked path thing down but there’s very little area to explore as the item needed to get passed the blockage is fairly close to the blockage itself.\n\nOther than that the only other gripes I have is that lack of enemy variation the game not being very difficult and lack of replayability. Those issues aren’t that major and do little to take away from a game that is pretty charming just based on the art style and characters. The game does a great job of mixing western and steampunk aesthetics which is most noticeable in the surface town where the main character interacts with the local robotic townsfolk.\n\nMost of the game takes place in an abandoned mine where Rusty, main character will dig through the ground collecting rare minerals and ores to sell topside so that new items and tools can be bought. He inherited this mine from his recently deceased uncle that passed away and the main purpose of digging is to unearth the mysteries of the mine. While digging there are quite a few obstacles that Rusty can come across including about a dozen types of creatures and remnants of the past that will try to prevent the character from progressing along with poor mine planning.

If you’ve blocked your path or made too deep of a tunnel then the only way to go is further down.\n\nYou start off with very basic equipment and little to worry about but after a short while, the character will get stronger by purchasing upgrades and unlocking new technology found in the mine. After a while, besides worrying about heath and coal (for lighting your path) you’ll also have to manage water which lubricates your more powerful talents and digging tools.\nThrough exploring this mine, Rusty will slowly piece together what his uncle was up to and also unearth something pretty sinister in the mine and it will be up to him to use all the items that he’s found to defeat this buried foe.\n\nIn about 6 hours I’ve reached the end and done everything I wanted to do with the game.

While dying isn't really *that* much of a penalty, it will happen a lot. It is a short game designed to have fairly simple gameplay, not really a criticism, that's just the intended style of game. It helps that I enjoy most mining-related games and stories with robots in them. I liked being able to customise my character by selling ore but would rather have been able to craft items myself, and for different ores to make different items.","June 27, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/recommended/252410/","mokushiroku","Moku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/","694 products in account","Forget the new Motherload, THIS is the Motherload that you know and love.\n\nThree different areas, split into differing 'levels', with both secret and mandatory 'caves'; More ore types than you'll remember; Enough upgrades to fill three different shops; A consistent stream of new abilities that keep the levels fresh; Long enough to be enjoyable, short enough to not get boring (My game came to 6:30 hours). There is one boss battle to end the game, which while a little bland, works well with the mechanics and offers a high note to end your adventure on.\n\nThis IS Motherload. But what's wrong with it?\nWell, my biggest gripe, albeit cosmetic, is that none of the upgrades change your character. Visually you'll finish the game the same way you started (minus the three weapons). One of the biggest pulls to the old Motherload game was how each upgrade made a visually significant impact/improvement, which was sorely missed from the characterisation of this game. The townsfolk even mention how much your character has apparently changed.\n\nAlso, as other reviewers have mentioned, this game can be seen as short, and there isn't much replay value. You get ranked based on deaths, money earned, etc., so if you really feel like playing again to get gold (and acheivements), then you'll get at least one more run for your money. If you know Motherload, you know exactly what you're getting, and you'll be pleasently surprised with the innovations this game brings to the table, but you might want to wait until a sale to buy it.\n\nIn short:\nI enjoyed this game very much. It is a golden example of its genre and I would highly recommend it tothose who know what that is. To those looking for Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, a 'Metroidvania' or whatever other games you think this is like, this is not like that. There is no crafting, no building, and you only attack to survive. This is a game about digging down, mining for money, and buying upgrades to survive digging further. Good luck, 'pardner.","June 27, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Xbox 360 gamers may have played the indie game Miner Dig Deep, and this game is very much like that, only with somewhat more focused gameplay and a faster pace.  This isn't a minecraft style game or anything like that, but rather a simple, straightforward sort of action game where you dig for ore, sell it, get better equipment, and just keep going deeper.  Eventually the game gets harder and slightly more complex in that getting around and getting all of the ore and Orbs (a special currency) begins to take a bit of smarter planning to get.  While there are straightforward goals (keep digging until you reach a room that has your next major upgrade), the levels also have randomly placed "puzzle rooms" where you have to use your abilities to survive or figure out a challenge to gain access to some Orbs and valuable ore.  Extremely well crafted and paced just right so that it feels like every time you think you've mastered a particular part of a level, as you go deeper it throws more difficulty curves at you.  I can't recommend it enough.\nI should point out my whole game time was just over 7 hours to find all the ore, orbs, completing every room and buying every upgrade.","December 7, 2013","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a pretty solid one, with a fun little story, decent progression of both tools and difficulty and solid controls.  The main gate is money, as it should be with miner types, and you will pretty smoothly gain more abilities to get more minerals to get more stuff to get more abilioties etc.\n\nThe only thing that I would improve is to have some post-game content as the main adventure will only take 3-4 hours to get through.  Either a new game plus mode or some kind of randomized post game mine just for the fun of the mining would greatly add to the replay value.\n\nAs it stands tho it is a very good little game and well worth the money and time to play it though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/252410/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Steamworld Dig is a cross between a Metroid-vania and a Dungeon Crawler. Its focus, however, is the mining experience, rather than the combat. And it's works surprisingly well! You use your collected resources to upgrade your equipment, which makes traversing the map easier, as well as being able to mine deeper and deeper.\n\nI'll say that I have not played the 3DS version, but I wouldn't have noticed that this was a mobile port. Everything is very fluid and it just works perfectly overall, unlike many mobile ports we see on Steam.\n\n\nPresentation\nIt's a very good and clean looking game, in my opinion. Everything looks polished, is what I'd say. It gives off a good Steampunk vibe, and the character designs have a unique cartoon style as well.\nIt has solid lighting effects as well, that look nice and also provide a good mechanic for you to know when it's needed to go back to the surface.\nThere isn't much else to say, really. It looks great! And it's functional, as I've never had a problem with the backgrounds, or anything at all...\n\nThe music was a pleasant surprise too! The soundtrack is only 15 minutes long, but its purpose was achieved: atmosphere, rather than getting a melody stuck in your head. And I have absolutely no problem with that.\nIt uses a Blues-like vibe, with a more metallic texture, if you will, with a few Western whistles... you get the drill (eh). I actually reminded me of Torchlight or Diablo's music! Especially Tristram Village, only less dark. I really enjoyed the music.\n\nOne complaint I have is with the voices... Speaking gibberish isn't a problem for me, but it got really annoying at times, with some vendors. When you're speaking to the shopkeepers, they describe the item you're looking at every time... Since they're not really saying anything very useful, it seems like a cacophony of sounds... But that only happens when you're upgrading in the town, so it's not too bad.\n\n\nSo, onto the game's Structure, then.\nYou do virtually the same thing 3 times. And while I don't quite understand how it does it, it works! The game has 3 main sections. Each section has a certain visual theme (and some new enemies), and features 3 optional and 3 mandatory "dungeons" (perhaps it's the wrong word, as they're mostly just a room).\nThe optional dungeons were quite interesting, actually: you simply go there to get more minerals/orbs (more on that later), but they function as puzzle rooms. They have certain blocks and enemies set in a specific way. And to overcome them, you will often have to think of a method that you hadn't previously thought of. The best thing is that these methods will help you on the outer mines, so it ends up being almost a tutorial, but one that is well done and almost seemless!\nThe mandatory dungeons were generally larger, but they always provide you with a new upgrade. These can be an actual ability (like a Drill, a Double Jump, etc.), or just a useful passive (No fall damage, minerals show up on the map, etc.). Whenever you got an active ability, you then had to use it to leave the dungeon (or go over a specific obstacle) so, again, good teaching.\n\nEach area gets harder as you go through, but they're very similar, all things considered. They usually have the previous enemies reskinned, and then one or two other types added. Combat is NOT the focus of this game, but it proves a good break of pace to attack/avoid enemies. Otherwise, it would simply be mindless digging, and that would be too monotonous. Some enemies are trickier than others, but there are usually ways to defeat them more easily.\n\nYour main object is simply to go in and collect minerals, and then go back to the surface and sell them. With the gold you make, you can upgrade your various abilities, or buy utility items (such as Teleporters, Lanterns, Ladders, Dynamite,  etc.). Of the utility items, I've only used Dynamite and Teleporters. But there are options, if you want them!\nThe whole game is basically just getting in and out of the mines. Thrice!\nI'm not sure why it works (since the upgrades are usually not that radical), but I've had fun during the whole game, so they've done something right! The game's fluidity in going through the mines probably helps and lot. It's actually fun to jump around the various tunnels, clearing minerals on the way. And the rest is in the hands of OCD and Compulsive Buying Disorder. One simply must mine every shiny things, and then clear out the shops... Maybe this sounds really bad (haha!) but it was fun. And the atmosphere also adds to the enjoyment of the actions.\n\n\nThe way the mining actually works is that you your character has: Health, Water (mana), and Light.\n\nLight depletes as you stay underground for a certain time. It's a gradual loss, giving you time to decide when to go back. The only downside to staying down there is that you won't be able to see the minerals (and barely anything else as well), but there's no actual danger of dying. To help with this, you can buy "Lamps". However, this are just static, and I don't really see the point. They're not expensive, but don't iluminate much either. The only reason why they COULD be useful, is if they could mark a spot on your map.\nThis is a metroid-vania afterall, so the player expects some backtracking (specially for hard to reach minerals). So if he saw something unreachable, he could mark the stop with a Lamp, and then go there later on, without forgetting everything about it. But those are my 2 cents on it. It's not really a problem here, just a minor suggestion.\n\nWater works when you need to use special abilities, or you Drill. Most of the blocks can be destroyed with your Pickaxe. Rock, however, requires a Drill. This drill is more powerful than the pickaxe, but it requires water to work. If you run out of water, you'll have to find a pool underground to restore it.\nThat basically it. As you get deeper and deeper, the blocks will become slower and slower to mine, which is a side that you'll have to upgrade your mining material.\n\nSo yeah, you go down and mine. Then you go up a sell it to upgrade and mine even deeper. There's no complex crafting system (of say, Terraria), it's just mining and upgrading to mine deeper and more expensive. It's a weird concept to me, but I've enjoyed it more than I expected!\nYou can upgrade everything from your Health to your Water capacity, Water usage, Light duration, mining power, etc. etc. etc. You can just buy the upgrades as you see fit, conforming to your needs. The game sort of balances itself out, this way.\n\nWhen you die, you simply go back to the village. All of your minerals are dropped to the floor (and you need to get back there to pick them up -- like DemonSouls), and you also lose half of your gold.\n\nI don't think there's much else to say about it. The story wasn't particularly striking to me. There's a Boss fight in the end (not too hard), and there are also some achievements for completionists. I'll commend these for having some pretty tough tasks that would actually be an achievement (like completing the whole game without dying). Others are just there to incentivise you to explore.\n\n\n\nThese last 3 weeks for me have been mostly marked by not very good games. They were interesting, sure, but execution was lacking. As such, Steamworld Dig came as a nice surprise! I wasn't expecting much out of a game that's based around mining (and looking back, it doesn't do anything really stunning, it's a very simple and by the book game), but I enjoyed the whole time I played it.\nI've finished it in about 6/7 hours, with every secret found, and every mineral mined. After this, all there is left to replayability is trying out to finish the game as efficiently as possible. That's not for me, but if you're into that stuff, you can take more out of it.\nGood one!","October 2, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"Why is that fun?" you may ask. The answer is that while there is not a great deal of story, the story is does have is well written. It is a very casual game with lots of monotomy. You go down, get gems and kill enemies, run out of light, go up and sell gems, repeat x times. Every now and then you hit a cave to explore or the next bit of story, but that's about it. If you want a hardcore action game, this is not the game for you. But, if you are just looking for a nice casual sit down and play when you have time, this game is perfect. One con of this game though is the ending, while I liked it, it did not fit with the rest of the game. The story part of it was great, but the game went from being a casual game to having a final boss which required platforming that most casual gamers don't usually do.","September 29, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"2d minecraft", as has been said before, it is somewhat, but not quite; it has a very finite world and a finite number of minerals, so much so that if you die very often you will not be able to purchase all the upgrades.  Luckily, most the upgrades are mundane enough (+2 digging power, +1 health bar, over and over basically) you can deal with such a thing, and even more luckily it's not that hard to die.  But basically, it's no big deal either way.  The game's small and not that difficult at all -- 90% of my deaths I could attribute to stupid falling rocks everywhere and me scrambling back and forth indecisively under them like an idiotic cartoon character under an anvil.\n\nSo yeah -- small, simplistic, and less infinite than these types of games tend to be for good reason.  And let's throw in mostly mediocre music (except for the second area's theme which gives strong oldschool Diablo vibes), and an incredibly boring and predictable story.   Oh, and weirdly superfluous NPCs-- more of them means more personality in the small home town at least, but really there could have just been one shopkeeper you could dump your haul on and buy stuff from to achieve the same effect.\n\nSo what's the good news?  Well, it's got nice, smooth graphics, fine sound, and... most importantly, it's REALLY FUN.  I started playing it yesterday morning and had the thing running until last night, going through the vast majority of it only to load it up again this morning and finished up some loose ends as well as the final boss.  It was hard to tear myself away from -- and in an age in which most games are hopelessly elongated in myriad artificial ways and want to just be able to beat them and feel 'finished' like in the old days, I really, truly wish I'd had more content to play with this time.  It's over too quickly with too little else to do than getting some arbitrary achievements; I felt I had well and truly "completed" it as much as I'd ever need to upon collecting absolutely every single nugget of ore in the game, finding every secret and slaying every one of the non-respawning enemies (except for the laser boxes that take hundreds of hits to defeat).  I can only hope the inevitable sequel creates a much larger world to continually upgrade and dig deep down into.\n\nSo yeah.  It's not much new; it's a little bit of a stifled Minecraft and a little bit of an oldschool metroid -- but trust me when I say it's very fun and very much worth the price of admission.","January 27, 2015","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style suits the gamer very well, and the controls just work, i found it to be very responsive.\n\nGameplay wise you have a vast arsenal of things at your disposal, you start off with basic variants, and then through mining different forms of crystals, gems and matter gain gold by selling them at the hub town. You then use the gold for better upgrades, which will make your journey a lot easier.\n\nLike Dig Dug or Boulderdash you start at the top of the map and work your way down, along the way you will encounter a bunch of doors that will have new skills to unlock and secret rooms with loot for you to sell. And of course the game wouldn't be much fun without enemies, which there is a small variety of, and they will do their best to stop you and your mission.\n\nDying will make you loose all you inventory and respawns have a price, but like Dark Souls you can claim your inventory back if you find the place where you died, there will be a small loot bag with the items in it.\n\nTook me around 6 hours to finish, you can do it way faster if you are good enough.

The story is decent enough, though it certainly takes a bit of a backseat to the mechanics.\n\nAn enjoyable game, which I recommend you pick up if you want some relxaing gameplay.","February 14","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/252410/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","SteamWorld Dig is a really clever and unique 2d platformer. Sort of a Minecraft meets Metroidvania. With steampunk robots in a Wild West setting. I don't remember why I grabbed this one. But I'm really glad I did.\n\nYou play as a robot who's uncle has sent for you to come to his mine in the town he lives in. When you get there, you fall into a hole and meet a girl-robot in the mine who shows you to your uncle's dead (deactivated?) corpse (or junk pile, not sure if robots have a corpse). Well now, you own the mine and your uncles mining pick. Welcome to Steamworld, population of 3.\n\nSo the basic thing is, you have a pick. You go down into the mine and mine around, looking for ore to take back to the surface and sell. Every x dollars worth of ore you bring up, you get the option to buy an upgrade from the nearby shop. There are many different types of ore you bring up, all worth differing amounts. There are also various enemies, trapped in the rock or running in tiny caverns. You can stay in the mine as long as you want, but you do have a light that slowly runs out, causing the illumination to get dimmer and dimmer until it evertually is gone. When this happens, you can barely see and definately cant see the ore you are looking for. Upgrades are things like stronger picks, longer light, stronger armor, more inventory slots and so on. There are also ladders and lamps, which can be purchased for cheap and placed in the mine but not picked up again, once they're there, they're there.  You can carry up to 4 lamps and 5 ladders, (in the beginning anyway), but wasting them sucks even though they are cheap.\n\nThere is also a little story, and various caves "your uncle hid stuff in". The caves have cool power ups, things like an extra high "steam jump", the ability to sprint and other permanent power ups. Just like Metroidvania style games, getting these power ups allows you to access areas that were blocked to you before.\n\nThe graphics are cute and slightly cartoony, but very well done. Each character (besides you) has a portrait when you talk to them, and all sprites and images are rendered well in vibrant color.\n\nThe music is Western sounding and fits the scenery well. Other sounds are typical as expected for mining in a steampunk world inhabited by robots (pings, clanks, stones falling, steam hissing) but all are appropriate and not intrusive. One important sound is the popping noise an enemy imprisoned in the rock makes as it tries to break out. Killing these enemies while still imprisoned is important, as they can be killed in one hit, but if they break free (by having open space near them, they become harder to kill and harm you if you hit them).\n\nThe controls arent quite as perfect as some platformers Ive played (Dust and Thomas Walks Alone come to mind as two platformers with near perfect controls) but they arent terrible. You wont be missing jumps due to poor controls and getting frustrated, but neither they arent that perfect almagam that makes the character feel like an extention of the controller.\n\nYou can't mine while jumping or wall jumping- a way to go up a shaft by bouncing along the walls). Also you cant mine (at least at the point I'm at, dont know if an upgrade changes that) other than the block directly above you without a ladder. So if you want something above you and dont want to waste ladders, you must go all the way back up and mine from on top of it to get it. Thats kind of annoying in my mind.\n\nAlso, if you accidentally drop a ladder in a one-square high tunnel, you cant mine directly above or below it while standing on the same sqaure as the ladder. That is REALLY annoying, and something I think the devs should fix.\n\nOverall, this game is quite fun as you mine deeper and deeper in search of treasure, creating strange tunnels nad paths as you go. It does have a self-destruct feature in case you pin yourself due to falling rocks or bad judgement, but pinning yourself is not a common occurance. Death takes half your money, which seems kind of steep as the minerals do not appear to regenerate at all. But dying is rather rare, as easy to kill trapped enemies which drop recovery items are abundant.","June 30, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well worth the money, well worth the time. Optional logical+action challenges for completists. End boss is tedious (as usual). Recommended for platformer/metroidvania semi-casual fans.\n\nDetails In tradition of digging games like Motherload[www.miniclip.com] (and in same broad genre like Glean[www.newgrounds.com] or Mustached driller[www.newgrounds.com] and the like), you dig down from your town, periodically returning to it to sell found minerals and upgrade yourself. On your journey down you'll encounter new environments with new enemies and obstacles. The main world contains entrances to separate small levels (like "instances" in MMO) - some of them required by plot and giving you new abilities, some are just optional puzzles to test your brain and nimble fingers.\n\nIn best tradition of metroidvania games you are forced to return to previously explored areas and instances to uncover more. For those struck by OCD (Obsessive Completion Disorder) - game is balanced to allow you to collect every mineral and kill every monster there is in the game - given you don't screw up royally. New skills and new enemies are placed evenly on your path to the endgame - there are no tedious or boring streaks except for the final boss.\n\nGraphically game is excelent in its cartoonish style. Technically it's also very stable, responsive and polished overall. Although I usually turn off ingame music, here I played it through without turning music off. Sound FX design is also very good.\n\nOverall, it's a nice little digger with great polish to justify it being paid.","December 22, 2013","true","7.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/252410/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Playtime: about 5 hours your first time playing\nDownload size: less than 200 megabytes\n\nSteamworld Dig is a mining game similar to the old in-browser game Motherload from X Gen studios. If you haven’t played that before, it’s worth your time to try. Some of the key differences though, are in Steamworld Dig there is a storyline, there are enemies, and there are special power-up items that you find in your mining adventure.\n\nThe game’s story is pretty simple and not particularly good or bad. You play a robot (every NPC in the game is a robot) that comes to a mining town to take over a mine left by your dead (destroyed?) uncle. The goal of the game is just to dig deeper and deeper, mining out all the precious minerals and selling them to upgrade your equipment.  On your way down you’ll discover ancient sleeping enemies, many of which behave like the enemies in the Super Mario games (most of them just run back and forth in their little sections). You take damage if you touch them, so you have to use your trusty pickaxe to hack them to death.\n\nThe game’s controls are pretty simple as well, you use the directional keys to move (the game is 2 dimensional) and a few other keys to either swing your axe or switch your weapon. You have very limited inventory space (upgradeable) to store the precious minerals that you mine so you’ll find yourself climbing back to the surface every few minutes. Unlike Motherload, you cannot fly. You climb sort of like in the Megaman X games where you do little jumps against walls. This means you can’t dig around willy nilly because if you dig too big a space, you’ll make it impossible to climb back out. Fortunately you don’t have an air/fuel limit so the only real drawback of being stuck underground for long periods is you run out of light from your torch (can be upgraded). If you get stuck, just keep digging downward and eventually you’ll find a portal back to the surface.\n\nAs you progress and sell your minerals you can buy upgrades to your pickaxe, which let you dig down deeper since the ground gets harder the farther down you are (more pickaxe swings per block dug). If this is your first playthrough, I recommend buying the upgrades as soon as you can. You can’t “skip upgrades” and save money to buy something better. For example, to buy the gold pickaxe, you need to buy the silver first, or the gold one won’t unlock. Along your way you will also find special “body parts” like running boots, a hand drill, and other equipment items that give you special abilities. The hand drill is awesome for digging, but not so great for killing enemies. I actually missed one of these upgrades (a ranged weapon) until close to the end of the game, and it was required to proceed, so the game gave me a waypoint telling me which direction to go. After the first half of the game you’ll find yourself doing a lot of digging puzzles, so it’s not a completely casual game. It can actually get frustrating near the end. Don’t worry too much about deaths though. If you die, you respawn on the surface with half the money you’re carrying being confiscated. If you followed my earlier advice and bought everything as soon as you could, you probably won’t lose too much. Just bear in mind that there is a finite amount of resources. You cannot “reset” the world, and minerals do not respawn.\n\nPros:\n+Fun game to kill time with. There’s an autosave so you can play in small time windows if you want, but you should probably play in 30 – 45 minute intervals at least, so you don’t forget where you’ve dug for minerals. Very small download size too.\n+The puzzle solving starts off easy (how to dig to a mineral patch without touching enemies or getting crushed by rocks) and becomes very challenging near the end (how to get past laser walls).\n\nCons:\n-The game is pretty short, only about 5 hours to beat. This isn’t too big a problem, except that I didn’t acquire enough money to buy all the upgrades and items. There were a few consumable items that I never got to try (ladder, teleporter).\n-There’s a chance you might quit in frustration near the end of the game when you keep dying at the same places. When you respawn, you don’t have full health, and all your water is gone (water is the fuel for your steampunk equipment). This means that after a death, you don’t just need to go all the way back to where you died, you also need to find a place to refill your health and water.\n\nOverall, the game is a decent mix up of various game genres, and put together make a pretty good game. If you have time to kill and don’t want to get into anything too serious, give Steamworld Dig a try. You’ll need to use your brain, but most of the game up until the end is pretty easy.\n","February 25, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game's plot is incredibly in depth and well thought out. I wont spoil anything in this review, but it has an fantastic story line filled with romance and betrayal. There is a great suprise ending. All of the characters have well written back stories and have great character progression. One of the robots' stories had me literally in tears by the end of the game. Her story has inspired me to reform my shallow life. The characters in this game have more depth to them than most people I know.\n\nThe gameplay to this masterpiece is very good as well. I would say that this game might be mechanically too difficult for the average casual gamer, but for truely hardcore gamers it will challenge you and truely push you to your limits. Gamers seeking a challenging game that they can seek to master will absolutely love steamworld dig. There are many different ways one can go about trying to accomplish the main goal of the game; "digging". First, and most important, is using the pickaxe to break appart blocks in order to collect resorces. This might seem like a realatively easy task, but it gets more difficult as the game goes on. Luckily there are other ways to accomplish this "digging". You can use the drill and steam punch later on in the game to quickly and efficiantly dispose of pesky blocks. This will however drain one of your important resorces; "water". Managing this "water" resorce while maintaining rapid "digging" rates is one of the most important ways to improve your effectiveness in steamworld dig. This all may sound pretty complicated and technical. Sorry to disapoint casual players, but it is. Steamworld dig has an extremely high skill floor. Masters will be delighted to find it has a very high skill ceiling as well. Because of the high skill ceiling and the indepth plot steamworld dig has very high replay value. I know I have logged hundreds of hours into this game just to experience all of the outcomes.\n\nSteamworld dig has the best graphics out of any game released so far (to my knowledge). The robots and an insane level of detail and the dirt blocks look more real than the dirt outside my house. Truely the artists that put together the visuals should be praised for their attention to detail and their ability to create 3d models that bring this game to life. I have spent hours in steamworld dig just walking around so I could full appreciate the detail and craftsmenship of the game's artists. Once, during a 24 hour marathon, I forgot  I wasnt in real life. I would recomend getting this game even just to observe the graphics. Its hard to make comparisons to other games because steamworld dig is just so far ahead of any other game.\n\nOverall I would recomend this game to anyone who wants a beautiful, challenging, and well written game. This is my favorite game of all time and I hope it can soon be yours as well!","January 21, 2015","true","4.9"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","52","11","21","12","1"

Lets get on to the Pros and Cons!\n\nPROS  Amazing graphics:\nSteampunk in general just looks amazing when applied to anything. And since this is also western its pretty darn cool\nGood music:\nThis games soundtrack. OH MY GOD, this games soundtrack. It fits well with the game, and any western setting.\nAwesome "Setting" :\nThis ones kinda confusing, take steampunk and mix it with western, it probably may not work, but THIS GAME makes it work, AND IT DOES IT AMAZINGLY\n\nOne I put as a "medium" is the gameplay, as it takes a long time to get to a certain point, yes you can get better pickaxes, but in the beginning you just slowllly dig to tunnels, this is good and bad, it gives you a feeling of "you did it, craig. You can go sanic fast digging"\n\nCONS  Controls:\nThe controls are set to the arrow keys in the beginning, however this isn't a huge gripe, as you can set it to whatever.\nDifficulty:\nWhether I suck or this games hard (probably the first) I died a lot. But it didn't really come off as the game being cheap. It made me actually feel as if it was my fault, probably the first PC game thats done that.\n\n\n\nIn short; SteamWorld Dig is a amazing game. A perfect blend of Western and Steampunk with amazing qualities and very few bad things. Go buy this game. Just.. buy it.

Terarria bored me to tears. However, I got this in a humble bundle and decided to try it. I found that SteamWorld Dig is a very endearing game, and a distinct advantage it has is that platforming in your own tunnels gets increasingly rewarding and interesting as you get more upgrades. On top of that, you can dig yourself into situations that then take on a more puzzle-platformer element, like getting yourself onto a certain ledge when you only have one ladder left. Getting yourself into difficult situations is often more challenging than frustrating and I appreciate that. Additionally, the music/sound design is very enjoyable and the art style is charming.\n\nThe largest complaint I take with SteamWorld Dig is the scarcity of resources, or at the very least, that trying to scrimp the last chocomite out of an early world area when you're preparing to fight the end boss is pretty unrewarding. I feel like special areas that can only be reached with certain upgrades should have substantially more loot.\n\nOn the whole, SteamWorld Dig is what I might consider a hidden gem, so to speak. The digging itself isn't too tedious (and gets better as you go along), the platforming is rewarding, the art and music direction is pleasing, and the plot isn't half bad. The late game can get a little tiresome if you don't have the finesse to take out the final boss without a lot of upgrades, but I don't think it would prevent many people from having a positive experience.","October 15, 2014","true","29.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Your lost loot will stay there so you can pick it back up and keep going. Healing and refilling your water tank which you acquire fairly early in the game are both very easy to do.\n\nSpeaking of the loot though, all you can find is different types of ore (which are only used for money) and special orbs with are used in more expensive purchases that improve your character: You can dig faster, have more health and so on. There are upgrades spreaded around here and there that WILL change your character, such as a steam-powered jump or a drill, but ultimately, even they do little to improve the game's overly simple mechanics.\n\nThe soundtrack while good enough, isn't very diverse and can get boring pretty quickly. The only good thing I can say about it is: The game's pretty, it has a nice aesthetic to it... but that's not enough for me to recommend it, unfortunately.\n\nIt probably has some value as a "My first platformer" for those who never played the genre and are hoping for an easy, unchallenging experience or if it is on some very generous (75%+) sale, but otherwise I'd say skip it.\n\nThere are other platformers out there such as Spelunky, Guacamelee or Battleblock Theater that can offer you a more enjoyable experience, in my opinion.","July 27, 2014","false","5.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

If so, you missed the only-costs-a-dollar 2009 classic Miner Dig Deep, where you dig deeper into the mine to find rare minerals so you can afford better equipment and eventually reach the bottom. SteamWorld Dig has much better art than MDD, but is otherwise inferior in every way. In this game you can walljump, which largely removes the challenge of carefully tunneling in such a way that it's actually practical to leave the mine with your haul. Combat has also been added in, and it's BAD - your mining pick has a very short reach, and the two monsters I've encountered so far are more of a nuisance than a real threat. There are also special platforming levels (where you aren't allowed to use your items such as ladders to avoid the stupid platforming) that feel really out of place.","April 8","false","5.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","3"

It's a pretty game, but the mechanics design is lacking. You can only dig directly to your left, right, up, or down, and you can't dig while jumping. This means that you can easily get yourself stuck, since you have no way of building an upwards staircase, or breaking through a ledge two blocks above you.\n\nIf you're really into the wild west steampunk robot aesthetic, then you'll probably enjoy this game, but as an exploration game/digger it fails in many respects. The linear puzzle levels are where it shines, but getting between those is a slog of slowly digging downwards and avoiding the gems not in your path out of fear of getting stuck.","June 5, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It is an extremely mindless and unchallenging way to spend 3 hours. It's not fun or interesting at any point.\n\nI get it. All games require some sort of loop to keep you playing it and keeping the feel consistent. But SteamWorld is, as I said, completely transparent. Nothing exciting or shocking happens, there are no interesting puzzles to solve, challenging monsters to battle, or interesting characters to talk to. There's nowhere to explore, and nowhere to go but deeper into the mine, where the gems are a new color and the numbers are bigger.\n\nIf, like me, you play this game to the end, you will hate it and yourself all the way through for being so obviously manipulated into dull, glassy-eyed complacency by a skinner box's "reward" of a bigger number next to your mining pick. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it - and if you have bought it, just say no.

It's not an incredibly long game, so pick it up on sale. After completing the game there are some definite issues that will either please hardcore gamers or seriously ♥♥♥♥ people off.\n\nGood:\nStyle is pretty nice\nGreat music and atmosphere\nUpgrades to your character come pretty quickly, there's no grinding as such\nLots of side things to do, and some of the achievements look like you have to make a serious effort.\nIt's not like minecraft where you can dig wherever you want (pretty much). You need to plan routes or you can easily become stuck. You can't jump & mine simultaneously.\n\nBad:\nWalljumping feels weird sometimes, but this is a problem with lots of games with wall jumping\n\nSome deaths can be rage inducing. Initially I had "take teleporters here" but don't because...\n\nThere is ZERO leeway on the number of orbs available in relation to what needs to be spent on upgrases. Spend any on teleporters? Sorry you're locked out of late game upgrades. Also I'm pretty sure there's not enough money to get through unless you play a perfect game. If you want to do achievements then this forces a second unnecessary playthrough.\n\nDigging can get a bit tedious unless you keep up to date on your pick and drill.\n\nCombat is kinda annoying. Wish there was an alternative to hitting something with your pick and waiting for it to path back. Dynamite isn't always a good choice.\n\nI didn't know you could charge the fist until right at the end of the game. I don't know if it's mentioned in a tooltip, maybe I missed it, but yeah, you can charge it to make it go farther.\n\nThe sleeping trilobite achievements are BS and once again you're screwed if any of them wake up. Which they will in Vectron because you won't have the drill power to get them before they do. Unless you knew beforehand about it.\n\nOverall it isn't a game I would've paid full price for, but it was a fun time waster. On the one hand I like that the achievements aren't just "you loaded the game, yay!", but on the other hand I don't think it's fair to force players through replaying a not very replayable game to get achievements that you have to plan for perfectly. For example, sequence breaker requires you to know about the story's events beforehand, and then abuse game mechanics to achieve since you can't collect the needed upgrades to access the specific areas. Is this fair? I don't know. It feels like lazy design instead of adding more content.","December 27, 2014","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This could be ok, but the mining itself is very straightforward in two dimensions and there's little variation in what you do. Same with the upgrades, they are almost all just slight numerical increases in the pickaxe / drill / health / steam power you have.\n\nThe aesthetic is nice, with a good art style and music. Controls are very responsive and your mobility gets pretty good towards the end of the game as you unlock more metroid-like powers.\n\nUltimately though, not enough here to keep this interesting past a few hours. If you want to gather resources and work through the logistics of mining, Minecraft is where you should be spending your time.","January 6, 2015","false","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can't jump & mine simultaneously.\n\nBad:\nWalljumping feels weird sometimes, but this is a problem with lots of games with wall jumping\n\nSome deaths can be rage inducing. Initially I had "take teleporters here" but don't because...\n\nThere is ZERO leeway on the number of orbs available in relation to what needs to be spent on upgrases. Spend any on teleporters? Sorry you're locked out of late game upgrades. Also I'm pretty sure there's not enough money to get through unless you play a perfect game. If you want to do achievements then this forces a second unnecessary playthrough.\n\nDigging can get a bit tedious unless you keep up to date on your pick and drill.\n\nCombat is kinda annoying. Wish there was an alternative to hitting something with your pick and waiting for it to path back. Dynamite isn't always a good choice.\n\nI didn't know you could charge the fist until right at the end of the game. I don't know if it's mentioned in a tooltip, maybe I missed it, but yeah, you can charge it to make it go farther.\n\nThe sleeping trilobite achievements are BS and once again you're screwed if any of them wake up. Which they will in Vectron because you won't have the drill power to get them before they do. Unless you knew beforehand about it.\n\nOverall it isn't a game I would've paid full price for, but it was a fun time waster. On the one hand I like that the achievements aren't just "you loaded the game, yay!", but on the other hand I don't think it's fair to force players through replaying a not very replayable game to get achievements that you have to plan for perfectly. For example, sequence breaker requires you to know about the story's events beforehand, and then abuse game mechanics to achieve since you can't collect the needed upgrades to access the specific areas. Is this fair? I don't know. It feels like lazy design instead of adding more content.","December 27, 2014","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This could be ok, but the mining itself is very straightforward in two dimensions and there's little variation in what you do. Same with the upgrades, they are almost all just slight numerical increases in the pickaxe / drill / health / steam power you have.\n\nThe aesthetic is nice, with a good art style and music. Controls are very responsive and your mobility gets pretty good towards the end of the game as you unlock more metroid-like powers.\n\nUltimately though, not enough here to keep this interesting past a few hours. If you want to gather resources and work through the logistics of mining, Minecraft is where you should be spending your time.","January 6, 2015","false","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It cannot decide what it wants to be. Does it want to be super mario with the double jump and a head boss at the end? Does it want to be a game where you just explore and look for loot? The start of the game was great. Look for loot and get a better drill and other powers ups.  No time limit just explore to your hearts content.\n\nGreat idea. Build up a town using loot to attract others. However for whatever reason they got bored with that idea and switched over to a head boss. Where you need to dodge laser beams, tons of bad guys and my favorite blocks that re appear after 2 seconds. Those never get old. Oh boy. Not only do you have to do this 3 times it gets harder after each wave. Great.  I feel like this game was designed by 2 different mind sets. One wanted it to be about exploring the other wanted a Mario Clone. Who doesnt love Mario right?\n\nThe game looks and reminds me a lot like Platformines. However where that game knew what it was exactly. This game tries to straddle both lines and doesnt do a very good job at either. I recommend it with some caveats. Get the game cheap because its not a long game. Took me around 5 hours to get to the head boss. I did not finish the game as I got mad at the stupid end boss. Tried 3 times and called it a wrap. I Watched the ending on youtube.\n\nI wish they would have another game like this and leave out the Mario stuff and make the game what it should be exploring and finding stuff.

As you search the seemingly endless depths of the mine you collect resources, purchase power ups and retrofit your robot body with new upgrades, better weapons and digging equipment in order to reach even further into the darkness. All the while you must contend with environmental hazards, avoid falling down wells, combat the creatures the live underground and figure out how to reach ancient treasures in underground ruins.\n\nAdditionally, you also have to contend with running out of light, water and inventory space - giving the game a slight survivalist undertone. Of course, you can upgrade your capacity to hold these resources through retrofits and upgrades in town.\n\nThe story is great, the music and art is great, the controls are superb (I used an old Logitech Dual Shock controller with no problem) and the abilities and upgrades, if you take the time to grind for them, are mighty indeed!\n\n\nMy only 2 gripes about the game are:\n\n1) Some of the "dialogue" noise that the robot NPCs in town make. Some of them were particularly grating on the ears.\n\n2) The game left me wanting more! Despite taking my time and grinding for all the upgrades, I finished the game in under 10 hours. However, considering I didn't pay much (less than $5 dollars) and considering it was a greenlight game, I really can't gripe, especially considering the replayability of the game and the cool achievement goals.\n\n\nWhat more can I say!? Treat yourself to SteamWorld Dig immediately!\n","December 19, 2014","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, your character finds upgrades throughout the game, but there's no exploration aside from "dig down, then dig down some more".  If you want a good feel for what the game's like, go look up the flash game "Motherload".  Steamworld Dig is pretty much just a prettier version of Motherload.\n\nYou dig until you can't dig any more (lack of resources or full inventory), you go back up, sell what you've found, go back down, dig more, and repeat until the game's done.  There are some puzzle caves along the way, but they never really present a huge challenge, and I ended up spending the entire game waiting for things to start getting interesting, and then the credits rolled.","June 27, 2014","false","5.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/garrett_w/recommended/252410/","garrett_w","Benedict","http://steamcommunity.com/id/garrett_w/","100 products in account","Steamworld Dig reminds me of another game, a game that this game was probably inspired by, and a game that, unlike Steamworld Dig, is free. Motherload. Motherload had the concept of you being on... Mars, I believe? You're given a machine to mine for ores, you sell the ores for money, you buy upgrades. The difference was that Motherload was actually good.\n\nSteamworld advertises itself as a "platform mining adventure". Well, it has mining, it has terrible platforming, and its a very boring adventure. It seems to be trying to have some steampunk western feel, but its just that. A feel. The western part feels poorly thrown in so that there wasn't more steampunk crap on the market, but as far as the game is concerned, it is very steampunk robot, and the only "western" part is that the main hub is a very "kid's cartoon version of a wild west town" town, and you got a cowboy hat. Yes, this is very western. The platforming, as said, is bad. Until you get a certain upgrade, you can suffer fall damage, which can hurt your "adventures" until you get it. Why fall damage in a platformer? Motherload also had fall damage but 1) It was not a platformer, 2) It gave you rockets from the start to get yourself out of a hole and to soften your fall. Here, you're expected to waste valuable orbs on teleporters, buy cheap ladders, which you can only carry 5 of at a time, or make your own "platforms", but if you got some TNT nearby, or a creature/robot that destroys tiles, then oh no, your platforms are gone.\n\nMotherload had a world that made sense. Sure, its final boss might have been something people didn't want/expect from that game of mining resources, but as you gain more valuable minerals, you could reasonably say you can sell them and expect a paycheck, since you're working for a corporation that has enough money to pay for you and another miner. In Steamworld Dig, you get a mine in a failing town, yet the town always has enough money to buy your full-to-the-brim inventory of diamonds, worth about 500 gold each. Why is this town paying me for ♥♥♥♥ it ain't using, when it could use the infinite money it has to improve its town? Nitpicky? Maybe, but Motherload had a believable world, where as this world is just... ehhh.\n\nThis game involves something terrible. Backtracking. You'll have to go back to old zones, or back to the main hub at times during the game's "story", so some random woman robot can tell you something you already figured out. There's a bunch of lasers blocking your way, and you already had to deal with lasers before by destroying their generator? Nope. You gotta go back to town so she can tell you what you already figured out. Speaking of story, its not a very good one from what I've seen. "Oh hey, your uncle is dead, and there's this strange stuff below the mine that gives you upgrades, I wonder what it was all for" repeat ad nausem. I'm feeling like I'm near the end of the game, and there's nothing like a journal entry to give me a hint of what's happening soon. Why my uncle was keeping this tech a secret. It's just... tech. That no one knows about, that gives me upgrades, and no reason for its secreacy. I'm hoping that if I continue to play this game, I get an answer to that, but for now, the story just doesn't advance. You just get upgrades, and people talk about how odd the upgrades are, and nothing happens.\n\n$10? No. Don't pay $10. Wait for a sale, or for it to appear on the Humble Bundle.","November 19, 2014","false","5.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The concept is amazing. It's like a much, MUCH, MUCCCHHH better Motherload. There is one or two things I really don't like about this.\n\nIt's farmy. Really farmy. "Yeah well that's what the game is" I KNOW. But it is, and do you want to waste time farming? No. It's pretty fun to play around with the platforming, but it just gets boring. It takes time to mine a block. Lots of time. This doesn't make it hard, it makes it annoying. I don't feel the "Oh crap, my light is low, I need to find a flame gear thing to restore it!" that a genuinly hard game gives. I feel "Oh great, light source is out. Now I gotta waste time in the dark. Hoooorrrrraaaaaay.....".\n\nThen there is combat. This game shouldn't have it. The enemies look great. I won't deny it. Their attack style is ookkaaay.... but you as the player have very little control over how they get handled. First you get your common bug, which attacks you by going left to right until it hits something. If you hit it with your pick it goes the other way and gets damaged. Okay right? No. Because they got health and take time to kill. Lots of time. And say you are in a hurry because a laser is going to shoot you. Please wait for this bug to turn around, and inch twords you. It's just annoying. Then there is the mutated human with moonshine. He has a projectile... that's okay, right? No. There is no way to block it, and if you are in a tight space just pray to god you can tank through it with your health. Sure if you are in an open area you can dodge it, but what good does that do you when you are going to fall right back down to do the same thing?\n\nNow, later in the game -NOT A SPOILER- you can the Steam Punch, which is like your own little projectile. But unlike the moonshine, you can only throw up down left and right. That's not an arc, making it much harder to do anything. It can be charged to pack a better punch, but that takes time, the time when you are being bombarded by bottles of moonshine. The idea of it also being used as a mining tool is really cool though, props to you guys for thinking of that. There's dynamite too, but that only goes left and right in a small arc (But thank god it still has gravity), so I guess that is pretty good, but you can only have 5 and they cost money.\n\nI haven't finished it yet, but I am on the final boss battle. -SPOILERS MAYBE?- Now, the concept is neat I guess, but it is just really BORING. The guy shoots lasers at you and you gotta dodge em while destoying generators... But it's like Silver from Sonic '06.. As soon as you land he shoots again. You only got that little bit of time. I found the best way to do this was to just use your steam punch and use the generator as a sheild while he shoots, and mine it at the same time. But I was soooo close (I think) to beating him, phase 3, and what's this? I die! No! It's okay I'll spawn at a checkp-... oh... I guess there are none.\n\nWHY ARE THERE NO CHECKPOINTS ON A BOSS BATTLE? I mean you could at least do me a favor and let me spawn right before our little conversation! BUT NOOOO, I gotta spawn at the beginning of the dungeon, which is really boring to get through, and the second 'puzzle' is impossible to do without water, which you can only get in that area if you smash your pick on every block around you to try to find a secret area. This shouldn't be happening. You know why? Because that is not a puzzle. That's just checking every nook and cranny for something slightly abnormal. If I wanted this I'd play as Batman, a detective, not a robot miner.\n\nSo far, I mean, even through all negative stuff I've said about this game, it is a really good game if you stand from a few feet away. The art, music, humor, setting, everything is amazing except for these things. So, I guess I'd give this a 7.5/10. I mean I can't be too mad. The controls are really great, even for the keyboard. If you configure it right, you don't even need your mouse.","September 15, 2014","false","6.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

If you can get it cheap, it's worth a play through if you like these type of games, but overall I can't recommend it as a buy.\n\nThis game is not trite or contrived at all.  It's quite the opposite...it's fresh and interesting, and it's authentic and well-done.  It simply isn't as fun as it could or should be, and in the end is not a particularly satisfying play.  On one hand, I beat it as fast as I could so I could get it over with, but on the other hand, it was interesting enough to make me want to finish.\n\nSteamWorld is a cute little game, and the story is fine, but too much of the game is either repetitive or simply not fun.  The only non-repetitive part is using the new tech you acquire as you progress, and certainly the new tech is pretty fun to use.  But the game is so short, you are acquiring the new tech about every 30 minutes or so, in which time the novelty from the previous acquisition has not yet worn off.  More simply put, acquiring new tech was sort of ho-hum rather than exciting.\n\nStory and graphics\nThese are definitely strong points.  Along with overall atmosphere.  I got the rogue man in a strange new world feeling from it.  The townspeople are good characters and add to the feeling of authenticity.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is fine, and probably is the biggest challenge, in a good way.  Getting a feel for the wall jumping takes some practice, but when you get it down, you can maneuver quite well, and it is rewarding.   Combat is pretty simple...it could be more dynamic.  Combat gets repetitive.  Also, having to climb back out of the cavern time after time gets old fast.\n\nUpgrades, Leveling, and Resource Management\nThese are fun at first, but get repetitive quickly.  Finding minerals gets old fast.  It becomes a chore.  Upgrades are very linear and uninteresting (each upgrade is basically plus damage or more resource efficiency).  Upgrades would have been much more interesting if there were trees to choose from or tradeoffs (speed vs power, or different gimmicks) instead of having them be so linear.  Finding the crystal balls is exciting at first, but toward the end, they seemed to be everywhere.  Also, I found the limited lantern time to add nothing to the game...it only served to annoy when the flame ran out.\n\nTL;DR:  SteamWorld Dig is a short game with a fresh story and environment, and certainly some fun parts, but it has too many repetitive and overly linear aspects that make it overall not particularly satisfying to play.","October 30, 2014","false","6.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Once I started the game up and the art style was very appealing so I thought maybe I will enjoy this game, however that was not the case.\n\n(I will be going through the game so spoiler alert!)\n\nThe game started where you are this random character (Rusty) arriving at this small town to claim your uncles mine (Which apparently is just as low as you can go that there is really no mine but just dirt you can mine through). The first problem with the game is how your character claims “I am not a miner” which is one of his three lines he says throughout the game but once he gets trapped underground he knows automatically how to throw that pickaxe around with enough force to break the earth (although I will admit is just nitpicking but I feel that this line is redundant beyond belief.)\n\nAfter the intro, the flow of the game until the final boss literally plays out like a pay-to-play mobile app using the typical RPG cycle of collecting, selling, and upgrading then rinse and repeat which is only just barely fun, I found myself coming back to this game but for all the wrong reasons, not because it was a fun experience or for a well written story but to actually see if the game gets better (I really wanted to like this title). Sadly though the game never got better, and because of that has no replay ability, and the only incentive it gives to play again is that it gives out a star rating of bronze, silver, or gold, so maybe a player wants to desperately get a gold rating.\n\nthe game has absolutely no story/character development throughout all the NPCs and your character, but then once you hit the final boss the game suddenly acts like it had story development the entire time and expects the player to (imply?) there was some sort of character development. Which is the main reason I am so bothered with the lack of story, I feel like you have to have one or the other, but this game fails at each spectrum, instead of giving an arcade style game you can pick up and play, or a long story driven game. You have a long boring game with no award for beating it.\n\nThe boss at the end of the game (which was a assimilate everything super computer) exclaims that you are already pretty much assimilates with all of the boss’s technology that you have upgraded yourself with. In reality this is kind of true because there are platforms that give you a new ability but there is no visual change that implies you are no longer what you were at the beginning of the game. (All that is changed is one of your arms that shows what tool you have. The final fight was disappointing as well, it was not a real challenge and did not use anything you learned to defeat it. Any player could defeat it having no upgrades and the basic pickaxe. However you would need all the upgrades to get to the end, besides the virtually worthless fist upgrade.\n\nWhat bothers me afterwards is the ending as well, the area you are fighting the boss in collapses so everyone in town decides to try to find you and there is also a random forced love interest in the shop (you sell your minerals) keeper and the main character, which as I said before there was no character development so this came out of left field. And the icing on the cake is that Rusty escapes, but instead of coming back to the town where the erected a statue in his memory and adore him beyond belief and have a wife and a job he decides to skip town. So now only is he a synthetic cardboard cutout of a character he also is now a jerk.\n\nSo for anyone deciding to purchase this game only do so knowing that you are buying a game boasting it has great story and character development but had a story with less depth than a dry sidewalk and characters flatter than cardboard, which is a digging simulator. But hey at least it looks pretty...\n\n2/10\n★☆☆☆☆\nF","January 18, 2015","false","7.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I suppose they did it to make game last a bit longer, but seriously this just adds frustration. Music and especially enviroment also become very repetative soon.

Once I started the game up and the art style was very appealing so I thought maybe I will enjoy this game, however that was not the case.\n\n(I will be going through the game so spoiler alert!)\n\nThe game started where you are this random character (Rusty) arriving at this small town to claim your uncles mine (Which apparently is just as low as you can go that there is really no mine but just dirt you can mine through). The first problem with the game is how your character claims “I am not a miner” which is one of his three lines he says throughout the game but once he gets trapped underground he knows automatically how to throw that pickaxe around with enough force to break the earth (although I will admit is just nitpicking but I feel that this line is redundant beyond belief.)\n\nAfter the intro, the flow of the game until the final boss literally plays out like a pay-to-play mobile app using the typical RPG cycle of collecting, selling, and upgrading then rinse and repeat which is only just barely fun, I found myself coming back to this game but for all the wrong reasons, not because it was a fun experience or for a well written story but to actually see if the game gets better (I really wanted to like this title). Sadly though the game never got better, and because of that has no replay ability, and the only incentive it gives to play again is that it gives out a star rating of bronze, silver, or gold, so maybe a player wants to desperately get a gold rating.\n\nthe game has absolutely no story/character development throughout all the NPCs and your character, but then once you hit the final boss the game suddenly acts like it had story development the entire time and expects the player to (imply?) there was some sort of character development.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ignoritus/recommended/252410/","Ignoritus","Ignoritus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ignoritus/","116 products in account","This game made the fundamental mistake that I see rather often. It attempted to create a fusion of several great games and genres, but did so without a core comprehension of what made those games good in the first place. The gameplay can be split into three aspects.\n\nThe first is the town area, where you can buy upgrades and talk to people. That's about it. To be fair, not much more can be expected out of a town area in a game with only a few hours of gameplay. But you may very well come to hate this town as you keep having to return over and over again.\n\nThe second aspect are the caves beneath the town. Have you ever played Minecraft or Terraria and thought, "Man, I love digging through solid walls for extended periods of time!"? If so, this might be the game for you. Otherwise...\nThere are things to be found in the caves, yes. However, all of the major things you /need/ to find are thrown right into your face so you don't miss them. On top of that it's just enemies, pockets of space, and ore.  Speaking of ore, the game has a brilliant way of artificially extending its length: only letting you carry three stacks of an ore at once. I don't really see any good reason for this besides forcing you to go back up to the surface sometimes. Which of course involves backtracking all the way up the shaft you've dug down up to the last warp point to the surface. Other than that occasionally interrupting the game flow (and using the word "occasionally" is being generous), it's nothing but digging around looking for ores and then digging downwards to continue with the game. Oh, and did I mention that the better digging tools you get all have limited fuel? So you'll need to backtrack for that too. This whole major aspect of the game feels incredibly pointless and like it's designed to take way longer than it needs to.\n\nThe final aspect of the game are the special challenge caves you find along the way.  These are certainly the best part of the game, but they're dragged down by the main cave. If the main cave didn't exist and the engine was truly made for a platformer with puzzle aspects rather than what it is, they would likely play a lot better. The most apparent example is enemies. Combat just does not play out very well because all of your "weapons" are digging tools. I think if the entire game consisted of gameplay like in these caves and if the engine was made to reflect that then the game would certainly have a lot of potential. But as is?

An hour in and if I wasn't listening to podcasts I would be extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I just wasted that much time. Progression is slow; you have to methodically chip away at the walls and make sure that you've got some openings on the walls on the off chance you pass under some minerals that you cannot reach. You can expand your pack but you're still running back to the nearest teleporter every few minutes to drop off another load in the hopes that you can afford a decent upgrade.\n\nThe platforming is stiff and entirely reliant on finding certain upgrades rather than any actual skill: if you can't reach it, you're not meant to yet. Oh and there is some light backtracking, great.\n\nIt's just a mindless, bland little game.

You essentially dig into dungeons and ore and fight enemies with your pickaxe.  That's about it, it doesn't really expand the forumula, even given the additional powerups, not to mention you're holding the dig button all the time and occasionally jumping if you're avoiding something or going back to the base to sell stuff.\n\nThe biggest issue is the variation that is there, is not very engaging or interesting.  You'll gather minerals to get a better pickaxe to then gather more minerals gaining a few special moves along the way.  The enemy varation is very poor, there's few enemies and they all are bit on the floaty side.  The first ones you encounter you just hold your dig button and trap them agains the wall and the second you hit them and run away, then repeat.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but due to it being singleplayer only, lacking depth (pun) and being incredibly repetitve, I didn't even get enjoyment out of it from a bundle, and I LOVE Terraria, it's easily one of my faves.\n\nI'd say avoid.","October 26, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

A lot. For hours. That's all you do. Oh yeah, and you have to climb out of the hole you dig ever 3 minutes because your light runs out, or you have to sell ore for a couple of bucks (because you can only carry a few ores at a time). With that money you can buy upgrades to carry more ore, or mine faster... Except the ground gets harder as you go down so you never feel like you are getting a better pick. It's about the most boring and tedious game I've ever played.\n\nOccasionally you will find a cave, with an upgrade to your abilities (ala Metroid). But they are only useful in said caves, and the most useful one I found was the "Steam Jump", which you could only do like twice without needing water, which was basically nonexistent in the mines.\n\nThe graphics are nice to look at, and the music isn't bad...at first. Until you realize that it's like a 2 minute loop for the main area. So not only is digging tedious, it has super repetive music.\n\nIf you die, you get taxed. Yes, taxed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/surn/recommended/252410/","surn","surn_thing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/surn/","281 products in account","Plot (Engaging, but nothing too spectacular):\nRusty (if I had a nickel for every robot with that name…) inherits a mineshaft from his dead uncle but soon discovers there’s some pretty weird stuff going on down there. Mainly curiosity is the driving force behind the plot and once that curiosity is fulfilled the rest if somewhat forgettable. On top of that the game ends on a somewhat sad note (and from what I can tell, there aren’t any alternate endings).\n\nAs for the other characters they’re fairly generic and a bit annoying. You’ve got your old-geezer, rootin-tootin-Texan, rich snob, bimbo and the other fem-bot with a fairly bland personality. One particular quirk that stands out is that Rusty only talks at the beginning and end of the game. In between he’s your silent protagonist.\n\nGameplay (I think I’ve seen similar on a popular flash-game hosting site):\nIf you’re looking for another Terraria you’re going to be disappointed. While it plays borrows from the block-mining genre like Terraria, Starbound and Junk Jack it seems quite lacking in depth by comparison. Mining serves to acquire ores with which to upgrade Rusty. There’s no crafting, all you can do with the ores is sell them for upgrades to buy from the old-geezer, rootin-tootin-Texan and rich-snob. Also you can’t skip upgrades. Say you have enough for the highest tier armor, but you still have basic armor. Before you can buy the highest tier you have to buy the other armors first. Back to the mining, you can’t put blocks back which can make it difficult to reach those ores you missed if you’re not strategic about how you dig. While you can buy ladders you can only hold 5 at a time and you can’t take them back once you set them down.\n\nReplay Value (…meh):\nThe game follows a linear path with a definite end rather than a sandbox type game with endless replay value. At the end you’re given an evaluation for your performance such as how long you took or how many times you died. There’s probably an achievement for getting gold on all ranks, but personally I can’t say I find the game interesting enough to try for it.\n\nAll and all I wouldn’t say it’s a bad game, but if you’re looking for something that will keep you busy long term, look elsewhere.","December 28, 2013","false","6.5"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

It is a real life pickaxe swinging simulator combined with a simulation of wall jumping back up hundreds of feet that you have dug to constantly go back up to the surface to sell items. I found a teleporter, but that only works for so long until you dig down so far that it becomes a real chore and a burden getting back to it, especially since if you dug around a certain way you can't jump up but sometimes you can use a steam powered jump but if you are out of water you can't use it... what a mess. I couldn't afford another personal teleporter because I didn't have any more blue orbs and they are hard to come by, so it was back to wall-jumping my way back up to the teleporter to reach town. In fact, this could have been a much better game if there was a easier way to get back to town to sell your mined ore, but there isn't. I started falling asleep because about 90% of my time was spent wall jumping back up, way up, and the rest of my time was spent pressing the B button on the controller to hit rocks.\n\nWhat a ♥♥♥♥ing borefest, 3/10","October 11, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

You can't even change half the controls, including movment! The default controls for movement are the arrow keys. They need to change it so you can actually change the controls for moving. 2. IT'S A TOTAL RIP-OFF OF SPELUNKY! Go right now and search "spelunky". Compare the metascores and the fact that it came before this. There you go. 3. I don't like the fact that you have to be facing a certain way if you want to mine that way. I prefer the Terraria style of mining, where you put your mouse over the block you want to mine and click to mine it. Please add this option or something similar. Now, I do understand that this is a very new game, but these are things that should've been fixed before they released it. Especially the most obvious one: BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE DARN CONTROLS! I don't know how they could've missed that, and I can barely play it because the controls are so awkward! It feels like it was designed for a left-handed person. And as my own personal taste, I would rather play a game like fez or the stanley parable. Go buy those games.

Completed. General impression is pretty good. Don't know why, but I liked how you could plan the dig (awfully simple) on your way down.\n\nPROS\n1. More story as you dig deeper\nI won't spoil this for you as I can only tell you that there is more stuff to get and play with as you dig deeper\n\n2. Digging plans\nYou actually have to plan how you dig downwards as certain areas can regrow back. Of course, it can be solved with an infinite amount of cheap ladders. You also want areas that have water (mana) to use items such as the drill, steam punch and steam jump.\n\n3. Teleporters\nI like how you can set your save point wherever you want. I tend to put mine near the water points as you don't have water recharges close by.\n\nCONS\n1. Linear\nJust dig down. It's so simple.\n\n2. Pickaxe\nOh god... It is so tedious to dig with your pickaxe when you run out of water for the drill.\n\n3. No tutorial\nSo you have to guess what the keys are or press Esc. Really ridiculous.\n\n4. Lamps\nI think there should be a use for them but I've never really needed them.\n\n5. NPCs\nVery boring. Only 5 robots? And every additional one is just a shop? You might as well put them all in one. None of them are special.\n\n6. Enemies\nWorm and robotic worm? Most of them are unique in their abilitiy but you tend to see a lot of them and you kill them all the same way... Just smack them hard...\n\nSUGGESTION\nI think there's a Japanese digger game that's similar to this. Perhaps, some competitive multiplayer might make this game even more valuable? E.g. Race to the bottom maps?","December 10, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I completed it in around roughly 8 hours and the best way I could describe Steamworld is if Digdug and Metroid had a baby. The art style is very pleasing to the eye and I really enjoyed the music. The characters are likable and the story, while not original, isn't bad. Like I said before the game isn't very difficult, the times I died were due to my own impatience or lack of paying attention, and the only penalty for death is half your money, which is no big deal as by the end game money comes in fairly easy.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is to explore underground and mine for precious ore while trying to discover what happened to Rusty's, the main characters, uncle. You bring the ores back to the surface and sell them to buy upgrades, that in turn allows you to reach new areas. After you get deep enough that trecking back to the surface is a chore, you discover teleport pads that take you right back to the surface, and when your done with the shops return you to where the pad is underground. There are a few pads already placed but you can buy your own and place them where you wish as well. I really enjoyed Steamworld Dig and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys 2d platformers or exploration games.","July 27, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spencerdub/recommended/252410/","spencerdub","SpencerDub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spencerdub/","58 products in account","SteamWorld Dig is a fun little game that blends Metroidvania-esque ability progression with the platforming and money management of a mining game. You play a robot drawn to a dusty Western mining town, who discovers his miner uncle has died and left him a hole in the ground. Your goal: get to the bottom of it.\n\nThe game has a great visual style and I found the core mechanics engaging, if more than a little repetitive. It was fun for a playthrough. However, I don't think it's a home run game.\n\nMy first complaint is the story. The world of SteamWorld Dig is a neat one--a world where steam-powered robots are the dominant civilization, and some untold catastrophe has left humans trapped under the earth. But the driving plot of the game is thin to the point of being unsubstantial. Supposedly, you dig deeper in order to figure out just what your uncle was up to, but as a player, I didn't care a lick about that. I was digging just to dig.\n\nA more compelling plot would have provided me with reason to care about my uncle and what he found. Since the mechanics of the game encourage an obsession with digging deeper, tying an insatiable urge to dig into the character of the uncle would have made him more sympathetic, and caused the story to resonate better with the gameplay. As it stands, I entirely ignored the "plot" of the game, and I feel the lack of a story detracted from the experience.\n\nSecondly, SteamWorld Dig seems to me to have very little replay value. Your mileage may vary if you're inspired by achievements and the idea of speedrunning, but for me, once I reached the bottom, attained all the various skills, and maxed out most of my stats, I had no reason to play the game again. That's because the game's progression is almost entirely linear, with very few challenges requiring backtracking or use of your new abilities (as one might expect from a Metroidvania game). What's more, unless you are very bad at money management, there are next to no branching options for character development in the game; you can upgrade your pickaxe and your other tools and other attributes, without ever having to choose a trade-off. And given the finite amount of resources in the game, there's very little point to returning to a finished game for more mining--eventually, you will have mined all there is to mine.\n\nThis could have been solved in a number of ways. Inserting more optional high-level challenges at the beginning of the game would reward backtracking and would make the acquisition of new skills feel like more of an accomplishment. Offering more upgrade options, or otherwise making stat boosting feel like more of a meaningful choice, would reward playing through multiple times to experience different "builds". And a New Game+ mode that added new or more difficult enemies and additional challenges would have brought a welcome amount of replay value.\n\nThis isn't to say SteamWorld Dig is a bad game. Like I said, I enjoyed it when I was playing it. But I think it's a thin game--good for a few hours of enjoyment, but not anything worth returning to once you've finished it.\n\nFinal rating: 6/10","December 7, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Completed. General impression is pretty good. Don't know why, but I liked how you could plan the dig (awfully simple) on your way down.\n\nPROS\n1. More story as you dig deeper\nI won't spoil this for you as I can only tell you that there is more stuff to get and play with as you dig deeper\n\n2. Digging plans\nYou actually have to plan how you dig downwards as certain areas can regrow back. Of course, it can be solved with an infinite amount of cheap ladders. You also want areas that have water (mana) to use items such as the drill, steam punch and steam jump.\n\n3. Teleporters\nI like how you can set your save point wherever you want. I tend to put mine near the water points as you don't have water recharges close by.\n\nCONS\n1. Linear\nJust dig down. It's so simple.\n\n2. Pickaxe\nOh god... It is so tedious to dig with your pickaxe when you run out of water for the drill.\n\n3. No tutorial\nSo you have to guess what the keys are or press Esc. Really ridiculous.\n\n4. Lamps\nI think there should be a use for them but I've never really needed them.\n\n5. NPCs\nVery boring. Only 5 robots? And every additional one is just a shop? You might as well put them all in one. None of them are special.\n\n6. Enemies\nWorm and robotic worm? Most of them are unique in their abilitiy but you tend to see a lot of them and you kill them all the same way... Just smack them hard...\n\nSUGGESTION\nI think there's a Japanese digger game that's similar to this. Perhaps, some competitive multiplayer might make this game even more valuable? E.g. Race to the bottom maps?","December 10, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/252410/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","It's pretty much Terraria-lite with platforming elements and clearly defined goals. Also without any real combat system. I mean, there's kind of combat, but it's still really hard to defend yourself save for using dynamite. The upgrades you get are generally all good and I was quite happy with how mobile your main character gets by the end of the game; it plays really smoothly, definitely. No control issues at all. My one gripe is that it's really easy to get stuck to a point where you either have to die or keep digging deeper in hopes of finding the one or two teleporters in each area; true, you can bring a teleporter along yourself, but those cost orbs, which are rare and valuable and better used on other upgrades. That aside, it's a fun little exploration platformer, with some decent puzzles to boot. The story's nothing special and almost non-existent, which is really how I like it in a 2D game like this. The final boss is also pretty clever for the type of game this is and makes good use of the mechanics. All in all a delightful but short game that I'd say is probably worth full price, but wait for a sale if you're really tight on money.","July 3, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The deeper you go, the harder(slower) it is to mine. Thankfully the game provides upgrades that increase the mining power of your pickaxe. Then you unlock lots of fun upgrades that build up your platforming powers. The controls are nice and behave as expected. If you're looking to get a metroid-vania fix with a bit of mining thrown in, this is about the best game I know of. Highly recommended.\n\nMy first playthrough was about 4 hours, and the second time through was just under 2 1/2.

You play a robotic guy who ends up going down in his relative's mine, mining different stones or gems. In Town, there are plenty of upgrades to help your HP and Water, Pickaxe, and throughout it you will find upgrades. Going through the underground, or the mine, is pretty amazing but can be really tricky. You get even more types of things to sell, unlocking more levels and more upgrades.\n\nAlthough, it is pretty easy to die if you fall, find certain enemies and have a weak pickaxe, and upgrades become REALLY needed. But the latter is actual what you're supposed to do and makes the experience much better.\n\nI'd recommend it to people for sure.

However, it is too simple, it doesn't really push any boundaries or have a whole lot of new exciting elements.  Basically you just dig deeper and deeper, and solve puzzles along the way.  It could be fun if you like puzzles (I'm not a big fan of them) but even then, the puzzles are way too easy, even for me.  Also the start of the game is extremely slow and tedious.  There isn't a whole lot of buyables and you spend way too much time digging.  As the game progresses you are able to dig faster to speed things up with a drill but the drill requires water so if you run out you have to go back to using your slow pickaxe.  And the "town" really only has 3 other people (robots) in it and 1 doesn't really do anything.  The chat can be witty but really there just isn't a whole lot there.  It's a pretty short game as it is.\n\nOverall this game could be worth getting if you like sandbox puzzles but only if you can get it for a really good price.  I don't know whether to give it a thumbs up or down because I'm pretty mixed so I'll just give it a thumbs up because it still seems to be a fairy well made game and because I'm nice.","July 5, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only downside is that it's short (took me 3.3 hours to complete according to Steam).\n\nThis game reminds me of Metroid (although it is less hard). Especially, it reminded me of Super Metroid with Terraria (or Junk Jack for iOS) elements. In other words, single player platformer with exploration, rpg and mining elements, but with no building.

When he falls into the mine he runs into dorothy which after a brief conversation he goes to find his father when he finds out that his uncle died in the mine so you "borrow" his pickaxe to find out what he was up to. Then after a while he falls into the second section of the mine known as Old world a nuclear plant section. Then later you reach vectron a electronic generator underground where after mining a bit ou reach the final boss of the game known as the Voltbot who plans on taking over the world making voltbots the dominant species on the planet. After destroying the voltbot the mine collapses on you and you end up dying in the mine. Then the townspeople build a statue of Rusty and then the credits roll...ok I know what your thinking why didn't I mention the townspeople well because all they really do in the game is give you upgrades to your tools.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nThe gameplay is a mix of Metroid and Minecraft. But what do you do in steamworld dig you mine then sell your ore then go back to the mine then sell and so on. It doesn't sound like much but it's a really addicting game. Like Minecraft the main goal is to well Mine. Like Metroid the game is setup like a maze except you make the path But when you leave the cave it doesn't reset so you need to think out a move before you do it. But there is one major flaw it ends too soon just when your used to everything the game ends with the only boss in the game the voltbot also it takes around 5-6 hours to beat give or take. Yet this is also the best thing in the game too because when you beat the game it posts your score so it makes you destined to come back to beat your last score. Also there's another flaw  which are the side characters they just don't do anything but upgrade your tools.\n\nThe Verdict:\nSteamworld dig is one of those masterpieces that comes around every once in a while where a game is so good you always remember the experience you had playing the game. This game is a must have game in anyone's steam library. The game is $9.99 and that is a great price so this game gets a 9.5 out of 10.\n\nPros:\n+ Great story\n+ Addictive Gameplay\n+ Amazing replay value\n+ Great visuals and soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- Side characters\n- Length\n\n9.5\nMust-Have","July 6, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It introduces new gameplay mechanics flawlessly, right about the time when you've mastered the old ones and are looking for something new.\n\nDon't expect this game to last too long, though - it's only about 4-5 hours of gameplay (unless you're like me and need to explore every single nook and cranny, in which case expect it to clock in at 6 hours).  Sadly, there isn't much replayability here.\n\nMy only really big complaint is the music.  Don't get me wrong, the music - what there is of it - is great.  But there's not enough.  I got pretty sick of listening to the same track over and over again while I was mining.

Your goal is to find out why. You will recieve upgrades tech throughout the game by finding them in the mine as well as buying them with what you find in the mine. Delve deep and find out the mystery.\n\nPositive\nThe game has very solid pacing. The atmosphere is unique and keeps you interested. The gems you dig up change as you progress. The characters may only speak in text but they are illustrated in a way where you can make it up accents by looking at them. The upgrades come in constantly which is a good thing.\n\nNegative\nThe game wears thin so it is actually a good thing that it is only about 3.5 hours long. With more enemies and crazier upgrades the game could have been longer, but the real issue is the digging element itself wears thin. The story exists only to progress the game.\n\nConclusion\nSteamWorld Dig is a solid metroidvania title that you'll enjoy until the end. That end will come rather soon, but it ends when it should. The game is from an unknown so they did a great job for there first game.\n\nValue\nI got the game in a bundle, but I'd feel solid saying you wouldn't regret paying $3.50 for it at all.","March 16, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You dig down, look for minerals, and unravel the mystery of how your relative disappeared. This is a simple side-scrolling platformer with some RPG elements, but a worthwhile one. It's paced nicely, the gameplay is good, the art and characters are interesting, etc.\n\nTo beat the game it requires about 3-9 hours of playtime depending on how much you explore and how many upgrades you want (personally I don't mind grinding but others may disagree). SteamWorld Dig is a bit lighthearted and casual, but it's not a yawnsome breeze to play either. You'll probably encounter a few parts here and there that are semi-challenging. Nothing serious of course, but it was nice to see some level of strategy beyond "point and click anywhere to win."\n\nI'm not sure if the game is worth $10 - maybe a bit closer to $5 - but it's well done. 8/10, like Metacritic says, seems accurate. Not the best game ever, but it's pretty fun and worth a try.

Due to upgrades you get, you could say it is a metroidvania type game.\n\nYou start out with nothing and are dropped into the underground caves of a town. You a local, and are told about you uncle. Shortly after, you get you first item, a pick axe.\n\nThe game revolves around using digging devices (throughout the game you find more) to keep mining the gems under the town and fend off enimies. While there are enimies, that isn't the highlight of the game. You keep getting upgrades of your digging devices as well throughout the game.\n\nIf you die, you drop all the gems you are carring and are returned to town. You loose 50% of your gold as well, so you want to avoid this. The first time through you might find yourself digging down faster than you should. It is wise to plan ahead so you can always get back up to sell those precious gems.\n\nWhile at first there might not be much stratigy, as stated above you do need to be careful just digging down and fast. Plan ahead, so you have tunnels that you can use to your advantage. Thera are consumable's you can use to help out, but I found them not very useful. I found spending my money on upgrades more worth the money.\n\nThere are 3 diffrent "types" of mning areas you go through. They get progresivly harder to mine, but the game overall isn't very challanging.\n\nOverall I would recomend the game. I also feel it is sutable for the younger crowd if you are looking for your children. I played the game completly with a wireless xbox 360 controler, and had no issues with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spencerdub/recommended/252410/","spencerdub","SpencerDub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spencerdub/","58 products in account","SteamWorld Dig is a fun little game that blends Metroidvania-esque ability progression with the platforming and money management of a mining game. You play a robot drawn to a dusty Western mining town, who discovers his miner uncle has died and left him a hole in the ground. Your goal: get to the bottom of it.\n\nThe game has a great visual style and I found the core mechanics engaging, if more than a little repetitive. It was fun for a playthrough. However, I don't think it's a home run game.\n\nMy first complaint is the story. The world of SteamWorld Dig is a neat one--a world where steam-powered robots are the dominant civilization, and some untold catastrophe has left humans trapped under the earth. But the driving plot of the game is thin to the point of being unsubstantial. Supposedly, you dig deeper in order to figure out just what your uncle was up to, but as a player, I didn't care a lick about that. I was digging just to dig.\n\nA more compelling plot would have provided me with reason to care about my uncle and what he found. Since the mechanics of the game encourage an obsession with digging deeper, tying an insatiable urge to dig into the character of the uncle would have made him more sympathetic, and caused the story to resonate better with the gameplay. As it stands, I entirely ignored the "plot" of the game, and I feel the lack of a story detracted from the experience.\n\nSecondly, SteamWorld Dig seems to me to have very little replay value. Your mileage may vary if you're inspired by achievements and the idea of speedrunning, but for me, once I reached the bottom, attained all the various skills, and maxed out most of my stats, I had no reason to play the game again. That's because the game's progression is almost entirely linear, with very few challenges requiring backtracking or use of your new abilities (as one might expect from a Metroidvania game). What's more, unless you are very bad at money management, there are next to no branching options for character development in the game; you can upgrade your pickaxe and your other tools and other attributes, without ever having to choose a trade-off. And given the finite amount of resources in the game, there's very little point to returning to a finished game for more mining--eventually, you will have mined all there is to mine.\n\nThis could have been solved in a number of ways. Inserting more optional high-level challenges at the beginning of the game would reward backtracking and would make the acquisition of new skills feel like more of an accomplishment. Offering more upgrade options, or otherwise making stat boosting feel like more of a meaningful choice, would reward playing through multiple times to experience different "builds". And a New Game+ mode that added new or more difficult enemies and additional challenges would have brought a welcome amount of replay value.\n\nThis isn't to say SteamWorld Dig is a bad game. Like I said, I enjoyed it when I was playing it. But I think it's a thin game--good for a few hours of enjoyment, but not anything worth returning to once you've finished it.\n\nFinal rating: 6/10","December 7, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Grab that pickaxe and start digging!\n\nSteamworld Dig is a funny little mining game that gave me the same feeling as Minecraft: you just want to keep exploring in hopes of finding something awesome. The game feels really polished and there are some very nice mechanics in it. For example, that you need to use water to fuel your special abilities (you are a steam powered robot, duh).\n\nEspecially in the beginning you need to do some careful planning for each "haul", because your light will run out in a minute or two which means you need to make your way back to the surface to recharge your lamp. While you're back there, you can sell your precious minerals and buy some upgrades for your silly little robot in return.\n\nAdd a few small puzzle rooms and some pop cultural references on top of that and you have a great game that will entertain you for about 7 hours. The only downside I could think of are the enemies, since they are not really a threat once you know how to deal with them. But digging your way down a seemingly endless cave makes up for that.","September 20, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

B+\n\nI have to admit I haven't banked enough hours on the PC version of this game, but I have it on 3DS as well and play the heck out of it.\n\nThe story is VERY basic, graphics are nice and smooth, gameplay is simple and addicting. It's the type of game you can come back and play several times, and that's helped by the layout being random every time you play. That alone right there is a great plus to an already nice time you'll have playing. You'll just want to keep digging down looking for as much ore as you can before reaching the final area.\n\nMy only problems are this... the game is plenty short. You can blow through it really fast if you don't take your time to savor it. Speed running need not apply here. Also, there's only 1 boss and it's at the ending, and that boss isn't very challenging. These 2 things are greatly helped by the random layouts, and the fact that the digging in itself is a bit of a challenge. You'll find yourself wanting to dig patterns so you'll be able to even escape if something goes wrong down there. And that's not as easy as you may think. It's almost like a puzzle.\n\nSo yes it's a great game everyone should have in their collection.\nThe length? yeah a bit disappointing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adhartma/recommended/252410/","adhartma","Your Potential Friend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adhartma/","356 products in account","A reasonably fun digging game, although a game where you spend 97% of you time digging with no real purpose can feel kind of dull. The actual digging part resembles Terraria, although instead of the different varieties of ore found in Terraria, Steamworld Dig just has gem nodes that give you junk to exchange for gold. Unlike Terraria, the stuff you gather while digging doesn't have any real use. You just trade it for gold and use that gold to upgrade your digging capabilities. So that you can dig faster, get more gold, and use it to buy more upgrades. Perhaps this is a deep meditation on the pointlessness of consumerism. Or maybe its just kinda dull gameplay.\n\nTowards the end of the game, there are caves that feature something resembling puzzles, although none of those puzzles are particularly puzzling. They still make for a nice break from the previous ~4 hours of largely uninterrupted digging.\n\nAside the from the general tedium of the gameplay, my major complaint is the death penalty. You lose half the gold you're carrying every time you die. And because there are only a limited number of gem nodes, you can only get so much gold during the game. If you die more than a few times, you will not be able to afford all the upgrades. This ultimately doesn't really matter, since the upgrades just make you dig faster or die less. But not being able to get everything is frustrating.\n\nThe story is mostly non-existent, with a random conclusion thrown in at the very end. The narrative certainly won't keep you going if you find the gameplay dull.\n\nOverall, I mostly enjoyed Steamworld Dig even with all my complaints. This is probably just because I tend to enjoy tedium in games if it comes along with a sense of progress. If you enjoyed the mining aspects of Terreria, you may like this game. If you like grinding in JRPGs just to make your characters' numbers bigger, you may like this game. However, if you want exciting action or a compelling story, Steamworld Dig is not for you.\n\nI would give Steamworld Dig a 6.5/10 and recommend it only if you like digging.","April 9, 2015","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I usually complete the games I begin, but with this I have had enough. It's not bad or broken, but it's not good either. It's well done, visuals look okay, sounds are decent, but the gameplay was boring.\n\nI had fun for the first dungeon, digging and trying to find something. After that I "got lost". I didn't know where I was going or why. Of course in this game you go only down, but still. At one point I was supposed to go back up, but I couldn't and I end up going much further than I was supposed to go with my skill set. Apparently I got stuck and felt like I didn't need to finish this game, at least for now. Maybe some day.\n\nDigging with even the best pickaxe was freaking slow, enemies were pretty dull, teleporting and light seemed artificially complicated and annoying without contributing much to the game. I just had to walk back up to get full light and since teleports cost spheres instead of money, and one could carry only one, I end up walking way too much back and forth.\n\nI feel that this game could've had me playing it to the end if it were done differently. All in all, I cannot recommend this game, even though I can understand why some might like it and why developer thought it was ready. For me it wasn't, it was like playing a well polished alpha version, no bugs, no content.","April 1, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I beat it in less than 5 hours of total gameplay and only died 12 times. I enjoyed digging around and all, and some of the puzzles were interesting but it could have gone more in depth (no pun intended, well maybe a little). The mines are all attached in a downward direction and you are collecting gems and then cashing them up to level up your digging, health, stamina (steam processing). The upgrades just come really fast and before you know it the whole game is over. You aren't really exploring and finding anything special, just uncovering more of the same in whatever section you are in. The difficulty scales with the upgrades you get, so it never gets too hard, but it wasn't that difficult.\n\nOverall I would say it is worth it if you find it on sale or in a bundle.","September 14, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because of its portable roots the game encourages (or rather forces you into) short mining sessions by giving you a limited amount of lantern time and a very small inventory space for minerals. After you return to the surface you can sell your minerals for some gold, and then buy consumable items or permanent upgrades for your HP or lantern or for the various special powers you come across while mining.\n\nThe game is in no ways very deep, but it is very easy to get hooked in the simple but rewarding mining. The mixture of scifi/western on the art also makes the game fun and unique. It can also get quite atmospheric on the dimly lit mines which have great ambient background music and changing art assets when you get deeper. SteamWorld Dig comes highly recommended.","September 15, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised to notice this on sale today, and purchased it immediately - it's that good.  After only 15 minute on the Steam/PC version, rest assured, the transition is everything it should be.  Here's an actual review of the game itself.  Last, I apologize now for spelling, grammatical, or contextual errors, i.e., I am typing quickly in a dark room~\n\nThis game is fresh, imaginitive, visually stylish, and is easy to pickup, but requires elements of strategy as you dig and rewards you with progress often.  It delivers a perfect balance; whereas, it is far from super easy, though never hits impossibile or the bang your head against the wall to end it all 'frustration rage' (we've all seen this, be it controllers, walls, friends, etc).  You start casually, but there are no long drawn out tutorials, cut scenses, or credits.  Shorrtly after hitting the start button, you are playing - a feature that is more uncommon than is often noted.  Its apparent almost immediately that the game possesses visually asthetic fluidity.   As you continue to explore, the pacing set by the game is consistently maitained and develops respective to the depths you traverse, and keeps you balanced by means of progressive upgrades, powerups, the twon's growth, purchasable items, and increased value of the loot you find. This game constantly rewards you and creates the sense of wanting to play just a bit longer.  I found myself setting aside some of lifes responaibilities simply because I enjoyed the time I spent playing, e.g., foolhardily making the wife wait longer than any wife prefers to wait...multiple times (Protip: AVOID this mistake).  Additionally, the balance feels very natural and honestly has a rare bit of brillance that you never really think about, probably because it does play so well.  The time you spend jmping through the air, punching, digging, upgrading your items, treking back to town, while thinking about how youre going to get all the way back to the pipe/teleporter as you make some questionable wall jumps never really got old; rather, it did feel as though you accomplished and understand the game more.  As the game tosses new dynamics this feeling continued to evolve... and I found myself enjoying it as I evolved as a player.  Despite the hollistic theme of digging, digging, digging, the gameplay never really got old.  It all comes together in a package that delivers an experience that really ends up complimeting the multiple componets of its own gameplay; therfore, bringing itself together delivering syle, balance, exploration, while provinding a (gamer's) sense of accomplishment, excitment, and fun -> a feeling often associated with video games; however, is all too often replaced with a sense of obligation to finish simply becasue we started or have put so much into it.  This gam never created a sense of obligation, and if your a gamer you know the feeling I am referring to.  This game transcends that dynamic and sccomplishes the ever more difficult task of creating the fundemtntial elements of enjoyment.  This game is appropriate for gamers of all ages, styles, and skill level(s).  The constant rewards will develop younger players, yet can offer old school gamers (the one's who grew up on arcades/atari/nes/collecovison) an experience that is a often more difficult to find in a game.  Buy it.  You will literally find yourself digging in~","December 5, 2013","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bottom layer is usually a hell layer with the big boss, which is usually your mentor or father or some other kind of person gone bad.\n\nIt doesn't add anything new other than graphics and a cool soundtrack and a cool western robot setting. If you've seen Futurama, Bender, those types of robots.\n\nRemember that it is a mobile game ported to PC so it is very short.\n\nMy total hours probably say something around 4 hours... that's how long it takes to beat.\n\nYou don't actually do all that much mining. You just dig down, make sure to get a few ores on the way and that's it. It has a slight puzzle aspect to it because you can't mine diagonally, you can't mine while hanging from a ceiling etc. You can only mine up 1 block, left, right and down. So if you don't play smart, you can get stuck. Upgrades aleviate this but not entirely.\n\nI got it in a bundle, so paid maybe 1 buck for it.\n\nThe graphics and themes and sounds are more polished than other games in its genre so I'd say it's worth a few bucks.\n\nThere's many flash games out there for free, with the same gameplay.","September 13, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But then again I am very patient. For a good portion of this game after a few accomplishments earlier in game play you'll find yourself a little confused. After digging and digging and more digging I started wondering if I was missing something or even going in the right direction. There isn't much indication of where you are in your game play which is fine but you don't find yourself finding an exact direction(besides down) to follow. Not to spoil but I believe the ending was left wide open for an inevitable sequel which I will be more than happy to play and look forward to more defined "levels" and maybe the addition of more Bosses. The final battle for me was really satisfying because of it's nastalga boss battle feel and I really wished I had more of that throughout the game. Maybe even a Completion bar would be nice to have to know whether or not it would be worth the time and effort to go out Mining and have the satisfaction of knowing that every nook,cranny and stone has been turned for that 100% completion.\nsolid 3.5/5 for me","July 12, 2014","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is what I want when buying a mining platformer. It is short but the environments are interesting and some parts are challenging. Plus, I can easily see the potential for more levels down the line. Kind of like Megaman, but with less backtracking; the potential is there to build that kind of scope into this game.","February 18, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very short, but to be honest it feels about right length wise.  Had I bought it full price it would still have been worth it for the enjoyment it gave me.

It's like a mashup of Torchlight style dungeon-crawlers and mining games (Terraria/Starbound) with some platforming thrown in for kicks.  Rather more lightweight than those examples as it wants to be more of a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none sort of game but totally worth it when it's on sale.  I would be all over a slightly more complex sequel.","February 19, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I picked it up I was afraid it will be just another boring title, but so far I'm loving it and I've decided to do a full playthrough of it on my YT channel.\n\nPersonally I recommend it for anyone that likes this genre, check it out at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEGUkyWO4MU\n\nThumbs up!","February 20, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Took me a touch over 6hrs to beat the game, with a bit of rushing at the end. Make sure you have a controller! Worth picking up (especially at $5) but would not spend more than $1/hr on this, as there is little to no reason to play it more than once, unless you <3 achievements.","February 23, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
