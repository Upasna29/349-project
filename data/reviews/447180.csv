So when I saw that the company wanted to release another otome game, I was like 'I HAD TO GET IT!' I got it at 40% off, thinking to myself, 'Wow! This will be such a great deal!'.\nSo this game starts off with you and your boyfriend (ex..?) breaking off, you became really sad and went home and suddenly your 4 out of 5 pets became human. (Yeah, I wish that happens in real.) I really liked how Lize looked, so I went into his route first. AND HOLY SH**. Ok.. *Heavy sigh* Lemme lemme lemme explain first.. why I gave this game a thumbs down.\n1) First of all, the MC (you) was not even curious as to know why they became humans. She did ask once but that's all. As a normal human being, or a normal hot-blooded female, you would question EVERYTHING. She just went 'Oh, you guys are still humans? Meh. No big deal. I'm not even going to ask.' like it was part of her everyday lives where pets become human. No girl, you should be SUPER curious about it.\n2) This line bothers me a lot 'Whenever Lize cooks food, the food always looks as amazing as it taste' Wasn't he a rabbit yesterday? Since when did he ever cook for you before today? Don't you find it really weird?\n3) When Lize went missing because of a fight, you called Ramin, he picked up the phone. Since when did he knows how to pick up a phone or even have a cellphone?!\n4) When they revealed how they became human and what is their contract (about you loving them within a week so they can continue to be a human to stay next to you), the MC(you) suddenly proclaims your love for Lize... HELLO GIRL, YOU JUST BROKE UP WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND 3 DAYS AGO. I know you love your pets a lot but don't you think that loving them as a human is a bit too sudden? I mean, if there was more development plot in between the 3 days, (I honestly don't mind the 3 days being dragged across the chapters like in Voltage's 10 days with my Devil just for the character development)\n5) Honestly the game ends too fast, the whole story was going on so fast that I feel like I was just reading and not passionate about the story like how I was in 'The Men of Yoshiwara'. I am a very emotional person, I cry easily during touching scenes where the men of yoshiwara do anything he takes to be with you, but THERE WAS NO TEARS SHED IN THIS GAME. I was just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off like how the story ended so abruptly and there was no development!\n6) I finished one route in less than 1.5 hours while in other otome games, I finish the route in 3 hours.\n7) I don't know where this story plot is going. The human-pet guy confesses his love to you and you two did not even do much, your heart suddenly beats faster? I don't get it.\nYou may say that otome games are not based on logic. Totally wrong, This is a dating sims, it should make me feel like I'm dating the guy and going through the relationship with the guy properly instead of dumping the character who is head over heels over loving in front of you and expect the relationship to work. I don't even feel like I'm dating Lize in the whole process, I just feel like he is dating another girl, not me. And that girl is just high on something to suddenly love him. I will continue supporting 'The Men of Yoshiwara' but not this game. So sorry about this bad review, I hope to see better otome games from this company though. Thank you.","May 12","false","1.9"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","35","44","4","0"

Since it was 40% off I thought why not? It might actually be okay and if not at least good for a laugh. Even if My Secret Pets turned out to be rip off of Dandelion I at least thought it would be cute, but the only thing that is cute about it is the artwork. I love the use of color and the character designs are pretty good. Sadly those are really the only pros I can point out about this game. I wasn't expecting much in terms of the character and story development and this game fell short of my already low expectations of it.\n\nThe character and story development are pretty bad. The plot could have been worked with as it was okay, but whoever wrote this script seemed to be struggling to stay out the gutter. At points I felt they were doing a good job just to ruin it by interjecting poorly written smut. I really felt like I was reading a bad fanfiction. There are obvious spelling and grammatical errors that should have caught in editing. There aren't too many errors, but the story is so thin they really stand out. Whatever potential there was for this story to be a very good one the writer shattered it into a million pieces with unnecessary smut. I'm just thanking God my poor eyes were spared smutty illustrations to compliment smutty writing especially since the "love" scenes were basically borderline ♥♥♥♥ scenes. Having read two routes plus their corresponding bonus chapters I have no faith the remaining routes will be any different. I'll probably check out the remaining ones later out of curiosity and sheer boredom but that won't be for a long while if ever.\n\nI found out after purchasing this game that its original title was "Animal Boys In Heat". Enough said.\n\nIf you want a poorly written visual novel game peppered with smut have at it. But, if you prefer a visual novel game with solid story and character development that gives you a more interactive experience than a selection between response a, b, or c, nor subjects you to borderline ♥♥♥♥ scenes then save your money and buy Dandelion instead.","May 15","false","7.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","2"

If not on sale, i would say maybe it is worth it if you really are desperate looking for a little sweet romance story, full of prince charmings and beautiful ccgs. If not so desperate, then just wait for the next sale.\n\nPros:\n- the artwork is really really nice (both character designs and backgrounds), also has a bit of animation here and there\n- the bishies (all of them are hot and their personalities are actually quite well shaped, despite the story being rather short)\n- the skin (most of the routes have a bit of fan service, with a hint of smutiness in them. It is neither too much nor too little, and it adds up quite nicely to the story of each character)\n- the overwhelming pink flowerish romance feeling (for me it was a breath of fresh air after all the angst, tragedy, unfulfilled wishes the otomes i lately played were filled with. Seriously, sometimes you just want to pay for something that doesn`t resemble real life, and this game provides exactly that, a little nice piece of a fairy tale)\n- the extra stories (epilogue and side story) are a nice addition, bringing you closure for each character\n\nCons:\n- no "auto" button, which means you need to endlessly click through all the "...." and the "umm" replies\n- the music is not so great and it quickly gets repetitive and annoying\n- no voicing (yes i`m spoiled, i know)\n- the story is very short. too short in fact\n- after you complete all the routes, you notice that at some point the whole story doesn`t add up anymore\n- this can also be a plus, depending on personal preference: there is no truly bad ending (you know, the everyone-dies-end-of-the-world-broken-heart-forever type of ending)\n\nOverall probably 8/10.","May 12","true","6.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This is another game created by the makers of The Men of Yoshiwara Kikuya, Pub Encounter, and many others, I nabbed it immediately for the sale price; for the 40% off, I would definitely grab it, if you haven't yet. I'm hesitant at this time to recommend it for full price. This may change the further I progress into the game.\n\nThe chapters are shorter than previous games I've played by the company, but I'm not enjoying it any less. I found it pleasing that they gave you the option of trying to win the Ex back, instead of just giving you the options of the animals. Might have seemed a bit weird at first to some - but, if you can date pigeons, then this isn't a problem at all. They aren't anthromorphic; no animals parts are on them regularly. In Ramin's route(the pink/grey cockatoo), in one scene, his wings did sprout. He got "excited" Haha.\n\nIt's cute, the art is gorgeous. I really wish there was more cutscene images, though. I can't say much about the music as I always turn it off since I approach these are interactive novels - which as VN's, they are.\n\nI also hope for DLC further down the line for Georgie and Charme(Fumiya). I thought it was odd, even after explanations, that Georgie was the one pet to remain in his animal form throughout(even though you are gifted with a human Georgie later on ;D).\n\nAnyway - still playing! :)\n\n**There are quite a few typo's. The beta reader in me cringes with each one.","May 11","true","15.1"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","15","23","4","0"

This game is corny, the story is kinda dumb and the sex stuff is frankly kinda icky with regards to consent (which is honestly my one MAJOR gripe with the game, though this hardly is the first otome game to have that cringey issue), but I'm still gonna give it a thumbs up because for me personally? I don't really expect much else from the vast majority of VNs on Steam, certainly not those that are under 35 bucks or so. This is a way to kill some time, look at some pleasing art, and while the story was overall pretty "uh....wut" from what I've played, there were some genuinely interesting twists to some of the routes. All in all, if you're a fine otome game connoisseur you're probably not gonna be immensely pleased with this, but if you're just looking to spend some time ogling a cat boy or something it's probably worth grabbing while on sale as I did. Curb your expectations and grab it when it's cheap, that's the best advice I can give.","May 13","true","10.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This is the first game I've reviewed on Steam that I feel that I should voice out my opinion to help others from getting this game. I got it on sale but even then, I feel like it's not even worth $10. I was willing to overlook the art as it isn't as good as the other otome games I've played, provided that the story made up for it. But even the pacing and the story itself was terrible - especially in Lize's route.\n\nUnfortunately, the first route I played was Reito's (the ex bf) and I didn't know it was a route I should have played last. I was too used to the other Dogenzaka games where I could just start with any character I wanted and if something had to be played last, they actually write a warning next to the description of the route. This time, they didn't and I was pretty annoyed at that point since I just pretty much spoiled the entire game right from the beginning.\n\nI just find it funny that I've read so many reviews about other games that apparently the romance was forced and it happened way too fast... I think this game pretty much beat that record. The MC pretty much falls in love with the guy in 4-5 days just after she got dumped by the "love of her life". -_-' Apparently they only had 1 week to make the MC fall in love with them... so I GUESS 4-5 days was enough! (/sarcasm) It was so forced and utterly ridiculous. :-/ I am really disappointed and I am not sure if I will even play any more routes other than these 2. It was really hard to keep playing it without wanting to smash something, lol.","May 27","false","3.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Don't expect the supernatural element to be explored much, as the focus is in the romance. The narrative, while decently cute and with some steamy scenes sprinkled here and there, feels a bit superficial, maybe because the whole story takes only a week to develop. The chapters are also shorter. It's a light, sweet read. The MC is bearable for otome standards, but not the best out there. At least she has friends, and Yosuke and Sachi are a decent support cast. Also, for once it's not a high-school MC, she already goes to university. Yay for something catered to us grannies, although the general level of maturity of the characters is far below what the setting would suggest.\nI really liked the artstyle, there is a good amount of CGs and the MC has eyes in all of them, which is always a plus considering the mobile origins of this game (but the guys have no nips :<).\nThe music is okay, few tracks that fit a variety of moods. The very first is probably my favorite.\nSince sequels and special scenarios are included as well, it's well worth the price if you're looking for a light read with slice of life/romance as focus and some supernatural. But exactly because the narrative is so superficial, it can be a hit or miss, so I'd suggest to try out the Android/iOS version first (prologue and first chapter of each characters are free).","May 11","true","1.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I really enjoyed the characters and story, as well as the fact that you got different information in each route to solve the mystery. It made me want to find out more and do all the routes. I also really enjoy the art. As expected of an otome game, there's plenty of romance and it's fun to see the relationships develop.I also thought that the concept, although rather strange, was pretty neat.\n\nThere are a few things about the game that are just kind of 'meh.' The music wasn't bad, but after playing for hours, listening to the same 3 or 4 tracks got to be pretty repetitive and predictible. There were also a bunch of choices that didn't affect the likeability meter at all. I'm assuminng they included so many choices to make up for the fact that there are so few chapters, but it really seemed pointless. There were some small plot details that irked me a bit, but didn't ruin the story, such as the fact that Lize is apparently an amazing cook and his burgers are 'famous' even though he's been a rabbit until just recently. Maybe she lets her pets cook?\n\nOn to the negatives, everything generally seemed pretty rushed. Each route only has 8 chapters (not encluding the endings) and it also takes place in only a week. While the Main Character technically already knew all the pets before they were human, I really find it hard to believe she'd fall in love in less than a week, especially after ending such a long relationship and not even getting closure. Another thing that's really annoying in this, as well as many mobile otomes, is the grammar. The typos and misused words can really hurt the experience, especially when the characters names even get mixed up.\n\nSo basically, it's an entertaining read if you don't take it too seriously, but I'd recommend keeping the negative things in mind if you're considering this game.","May 16","true","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm thinking the latter for multiple reasons.\n\n- The amount of typos in such a short story is inexcusable. As linked in another negative review, they even use the wrong names multiple times in the routes. That breaks all immersion to me.\n-The writing/story is extremely boring and stereotypical. It kind of seems like some high school fan-fiction. I'm sure there is more story to be told in the routes I did not go into, but the lack of interesting story in the route I did do just throws me off of trying any more.\n-*slight spoiler?* It's slightly ridiculous that she starts saying she is in love with the pet a day or two after she's just left some year+ relationship\n- More poses for the guys would work better with the dialogues, etc.\n\nAll in all, I think I would've been more okay with the game if it didn't take itself so seriously. The concept is too weird to do that. I really wasn't expecting much from a $10 otome about pet-boys, but this still falls short.

I recommend you get it on sale,\n\nIt plays very similar to Destiny's Princess except there's no bad or bittersweet endings, which I enjoyed. I beat everything within 5.3 hours of play time, all endings, sequels, and senarios. It's a bit short compared to the Otome games I've played. Price wise, I believe $10 was sufficient. The regular price of $16 is pushing it.\nFrom the 'cons' I've read from other reviews:\nThere is actually an auto button. It's the ">>" or just hold space down for a second or two and it will do it on it's own.\nNo, it's not voiced. I was fine with that. Better no voices than have only parts voiced, imo I find that annoying.\nThe music can get alittle repetitive, but just turn it off if you don't like it. Not nearly as annoying as Ozmafia's loading screen thing *twitches*\nThe MC is naive and trusting, so what?\nFor those who complain about the story, realize the MC is mostly romancing her >pets<. Does the underling plot really matter that much? Does it really matter the rabbit knows how to cook? Is the logic of this game really that important? And if you are confused about Georgie in the begining, I was right away, just go along with it till later.\n","May 13","true","5.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I feel that each story is TOO SHORT to buy at full price...so I recommend getting it at a discount price. Each story is good but they could be great if each story was given more depth and made quite a bit longer.\n\nThis is another great game from the creators of Men of Yoshiwara (both Kikuya and Ohgiya) and Pub Encounter. I feel that each character route is a bit shorter than their other visual novels mentioned previously. Although this is a bit shorter, there are a lot more choices to decide in the story. However each choice may not give likeability. Meaning you could pick from two choices, but neither will give likeability it will just give a slight variation on dialogue or scene. For example when the pets turned human help out the protagonist cleaning, there are three choices that dont affect likeability but give different scenes or a slight variation on dialogue.\n\nI do WISH there were more CGs as there are not enough (at least in my opinion). I also HOPE in the future that the creators add story routes for both Georgie and Fumiya, because I would love to get to know each of their characters a bit more intimately ;)\n\n***I definitely recommend this at the sale price as I am a bit hesitant to recommend to buy it at full price since it is shorter than Men of Yoshiwara. I do want to point out that it has a somewhat similar plot to Dandelion-Wishes Brought to You just without the skill grinding. But like Men of Yoshiwara the artwork is great as expected and is a story that pulls you in from the moment you start reading. ***","May 11","true","6.6"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","3"
