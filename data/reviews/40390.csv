"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/40390/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Risen2: Dark Waters is an open world RPG game based around the theme of pirates. Its the sequeal to the original Risen game developed by Piranha Bytes. Risen 2 was released in early 2012 on the PC and then later released on consoles. Even today, the game is still popular among PC gamers with at least one million people owning the game on Steam alone.\n\nThis is an action RPG where you play in a third-person perspective to explore the world. You complete quests and customize your characters abilities and equipment through leveling up and assigning glory points. This takes RPG games back to their routes, allowing you to customize your character exactly how you want to play with the amount of abilities and talents on display. The combat much like Risen 1 is not exactly a strong point; it seems clunky at times, and you will often find your self dying through no fault of your own other than the strange combat system. You have two weapon slots, a melee weapon and a range weapon. You aren't able to use the range weapon unless you are within melee range of an enemy oddly yet your enemies have almost laser guided aim against you with their spears and guns.\n\nA nice little change I found was the infinite amount of inventory space you have, some will think this removes some of the challenge of the game, but for me I have always found a limited inventory space to be a chore which is not always needed. Obviously this means that currency is never a problem once you reach the latter stages of the game since you are able to just sell everything though.\n\nThe graphics in Risen 2 are certainly an improvement on Risen 1, however there are a few glaring problems I found. The main one being the terrain pop-in throughout the open world. As you are roaming around the jungle, all of a sudden you will quite clearly notice trees and plants suddenly expanding before your very eyes. It's clear this is done to try and reduce the strain on systems for loading the world, but it is done in such an obvious way that sometimes it can ruin the immersion. I also found the game to be very very dark. The day/night circle while adds to the realism, the game is sometimes virtually unplayable in the night hours due to how dark it is. I found myself actually having to turn up the brightness settings at times to keep playing.\n\nWhile the game is completely voice acted, it does have some very bad acting in it; some of the lines which are said are very out of place and just don't fit right. That being said; there are some absolute classics such as "...off, before I put a banana on your c*ck and call for the gorilla" being easily the best line I have heard in a video game.\n\nRisen 2 is a hard game; as you begin your adventure you will die a lot of times due to being under geared and under trained and having no money. A lot of the early quests require you to have certain training in sneaking and lock picking, which all require gold to learn, so the game starts out very slowly. I would say the first three hours are the hardest part of the game due to the speed in which you are able to carry out even the smallest side quests.\n\nThis is a well designed open world game. The world is full of life and plenty of items, weapons, buildings and much more to find. You are able to go mining, or skinning animals as well, which reminded me a lot of the MMO type games.\n\nRisen 2 has so much content to offer, so many side quests, worlds to explore, everything. I have put almost fifty five hours into this game, doing all of the side quests, a good amount of grinding and of course the main story. It's very rare these days to find a game this good that gives you that amount of gameplay.\n\nI had a few little technical issues which were random frame drops in certain areas, as well as long loading times but nothing that can't be overpowered by either using a SSD or a DIMM drive.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Let me break down my favourites just for the fun of it...\n\n- Clunky Controls : The guy moves like a friggin tank and everything feels so horribly sluggish, especially paired with those stiff as wood animations.\n\n- Terrible Combat : Click click click click click click click..Oh wait, there's actualy counter parries, dodge rolls and..nvm click click click click click click..Also, enemies can break your attack animation by simply hitting you with whatever they fancy. You, however, can not do the same to them, which is especially fun when you often have to fight 2 or 3 things at once.\n\n- Tedious Quests : This game even makes you pay your hard earned..and I mean HARD EARNED gold to move on in some quests. Nothing more RPG than having a silvertongue skill of 60 to make a ♥♥♥♥♥ drop her price from 1000 to 500 gold..well invested skills points, sir...Or you get the usual "collect this and that through laborious and unfun work from all corners of the island".\n\n- Level Up System : You do not level up, you just acquire fame which you then have to spend in 5 categories. Then you also get to pay gold to learn new "abilites" like thieving or lockpicking, for which you often require a certain level in the aforementioned categories. Lockpicking, for example, needs you to have spent around 20000 fame to even be able to learn it on a very basic level. Doing a quest usually gives you 50-100 fame as does killing an enemy..you do the maths. This ties into..\n\n- Exploration Denied : Imagine beating some tough monsters, by letting your comrade do all the work just to reach a chest. Oh no, it requires a xx in lockpicking skill. Access denied, unless you already assembled 20000 fame somehow and the gold to upgrade your skill and the clothing to add some bonus to your skills. In the end you won't even bother to explore anymore, because you will usually lack the skills to reap the rewards. But if you do not lack them, then this ties into..\n\n- Worst Loot EVER : Fancy finding new weapons ? New armor ? A cool hat ? Magic Boots ? Haha, no...All the good items you will get (all those..less than 15 pieces of clothing available in the whole game), will require you to buy them from merchants.. There is absolutely nothing to find equipment-wise, except for a few broken sword pieces which you can smith together (requires you to have spent fame and gold and what not again though to learn smithing in the first place, so..basically not for free either). You won't find any clothes ever, in fact most chest rewards will be absolutely laughable like..I don't know...finding 10 gold in a chest or maybe..MAYBE 50..Usually it's just a major waste of time and effort.\n\n-  Fighting the Kraken and the final boss : Ok, mostly the Kraken..who designed that and why ? Seriously..\n\nAll in all this game is a major step down from Risen 1, which already wasn't the best game in the world, but still better than this..product.","October 21, 2014","false","27.0"," 215 of 316 people (68%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","68","215","316","25","0"

The game starts very slow and combat feels a bit underwhelming, but if you stick out the first few hours, the game just climbs in fun factor and epicness.

Is it glitchy? Yes. Embarrassingly so. Is it cheesy? Arrr. It be cheesy matey.\nNonetheless, it is also somewhat epic as an RPG and as a pirate game. It can be unforgiving at first, but once you get over the hump and start being able to afford upper tier training, things start moving really quickly.\nThe game itself is unabashedly silly as far as the dialogue goes, the graphics aren't great by today's standards, but the gameplay is nonetheless quite solid, the cutscenes are pretty well done, etc....\n\nThis is a game you will love if you give it a fair chance, love RPG's, love pirates, and aren't afraid of rough edges.\n\nBy the way, what be a pirates favorite letter?

Risen 2 is a classic Piranha Bytes game. So what's a Piranha Bytes game like? Well, it is an open world rpg which presents a fabulous world to explore and has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fighting mechanics.\n\nI am a fan of Gothic series, especially Gothic 1 & 2. So I liked Risen 2 very much. Tough beware if you are not familiar with Gothic. This game may not be the game you want or think. Or it may be.\n\nRisen 2 presents very very very beautiful lands to explore. Besides the models, the graphics are very good and the only thing that prevents you to feel you are actually in that tropical island is the lack of wind on your face. The short but adequate soundtrack also plays it's part well.\n\nSo if you like open-world RPGs I definetely recommend the Risen 2. Just keep in mind that Risen 2 is a little "different" game.\nOverall game mechanics may be and will be awkward sometimes. The fighting mechanics are broken as in every Piranha Bytes game, especially for the first 10 hours in the game (But don't give up, it gets easier and enjoyable after you get some skills and stuff). The progress is slow and painful. The story is not strong but the cheesy characters are somehow enjoyable.\n\nSo it's like a negative review. Actually it is not. The point is, Piranha Bytes never learn from their mistakes. Yet their all games has a kind of strange charm in them. They make you angry, but they make you happy more. Those bad gameplay mechanics that you will complain, you will get to enjoy them after a point. At least, you will ignore them. The "charm" that the game possesses makes you enjoy the game. Besides, Risen 2 really puts you in the world, as Gothic 1 did back in the time. Maps are so lively. You can play and enjoy the game even just for that.\n\n8/10\n\n","February 15, 2014","true","27.8"," 166 of 247 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","166","247","0","0"

It is not an amazing game, and to begin with the Gothic games were never regarded as really good games anyway, but it is surely a game worth checking out. I have great memories with Gothic 1 and 2, and while i did not enjoy Gothic 3, Arcania (even though someone else developed it) or the first Risen, Risen 2 is in my opinion a game worth playing and finishing and the best Piranha Bytes made so far.\nSo starting with the good bits, the story is quite good. It is memorable and so is the world and the quests. There are some exceptional characters with an amazing personality (Jaffar, Bones). It's supposed to be the kind of game where you want to explore every corner of the map, open every chest, kill every mob and do every quest to get the highest amount of exp and gold to become overpowered. And this is why it is the best 'Gothic' game, because it does a very good job at that.\nAnd the bad bit: the combat is simplistic, and the boss fights not that epic. The factions are not as good as the first games. The talent tree is not perfectly optimised but there are unique 'piratey' items in the game that sort of help that later in the game. Some abilities are pointless and require a lot investment to get them and muskets are just too strong. And while you are a pirate captain and hunt down other pirates and have your own crew, plus the drinking and shooting mini-games and treasure to find, it just doesn't feel like you are a pirate. Oh yeah and main flaw, achievements stop counting if you exit the game.\nSo if you want a relaxing 'piratey' game, with lots of conversations, zones to explore and loot to find I think it does a pretty good job at that.","July 7, 2014","true","26.8"," 68 of 90 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","68","90","0","2"

Risen 2 wastes its interesting setting and solid content by wrapping it around horribly flawed mechanics and watered down design.  Melee combat is bad, ranged/firearms are absurdly overpowered, voodoo is a shallow replacement for the magic of the past few games, the 'boss' fights are laughable, there are no factions....  There. Are. No. Factions.  Rather than improve on their past mistakes, Piranha Bytes is content to just give up and phone it in so long as a publisher is willing to fund the project.  Risen 3 should be a trip.","January 26, 2014","false","28.5"," 138 of 206 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","138","206","0","0"

Those first three hours are the trial by fire. Your skills in combat are limited and you spend most of your time running around a jungle getting your ♥♥♥♥ kicked.\n\nShortly after that it all seems to come together, you realise the combat is all about timing, you get training to develop your skills and you fall in love with the charm that the game oozes. Its not the most polished game out there but some of the dialogue is fantastic and depending on your build you can have 3 or more alternative options in every conversation.\n\nFor example investing in Toughness makes you more intimidating to Npcs.\nCunning on the other hand improves your thievery ie. pickpocking and Silver tongue skill (persuasion).\n\nOne of the biggest choices in the game is the Musket/Voodoo decision. The guns make you more powerful in combat but believe me you are missing out on some rping goodness by not choosing Voodoo. Entire quest lines are altered just because of that choice and the conclusion of said quests is hilarious.\n\nSo if you see this game go on sale, you love classic Rpgs, ignore the metacritic and give it a shot.","November 22, 2015","true","28.7"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","33","36","5","0"

I don't want to spoil too much but the ending is pretty obvious after a while, so not really interesting.\nSame goes for most characters, while some of them are at least good written, they are boring as hell and simple chliches, so everyone who is in search for a game with deep lore and interesting characters won't be satisfied with this game.\n\nThe fighting system is kind of fun, at least against humanoid enemies, against animals its much more simple but less fair. While you can counterattack humans there is no possibillity to do so against animals, you can not even block incoming attacks of some animals. One tip: don't use the musket that much, that makes the game even easier than it already is, at least in the latter parts. Either way, after about 20 hours you should play the game on hard,  many enemies stay the same while you become undoubtedly better.\n\nThe skill system is a fairly simple one, you get XP for every kill/quest you do, which you can then spend on one of 5 traits which are: Blades, toughness, firearms, cunning and voodoo.\nThe money you gain you either spend on improving your skills at special trainers or in gear like clothes, swords or pistols.\n\nThe graphics are sometimes really gorgeous, the design also. Even after 30 hours of gameplay the jungles or beaches you visit won't be boring at all. But still, the worst part of the game is part of the graphics though: the character animations, those are so unbelievable bad you should probably laugh at them rather then criticizing them.\n\nAnd for everyone with a fairly good computer, you should check out the mod "AntiWarp", it removes that weird warping of the plants, it's really easy to install as well.","October 27, 2013","true","47.7"," 45 of 60 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","45","60","0","0"

For some reason the Pirate theme and look of this game put me off; it seemed different, and worse than previous titles. After picking it up for just a buck during the Humble ReBundle, it pleasantly surprised me. I'd rank this right up there with the rest of their games. Adventuring in their open world maps, stealing and beating up NPCs is great fun. The game is also VERY pretty on max settings. I actually thought the combat was an improvement over previous titles; it was still difficult, but learning an enemy's patterns and fully utilizing your abilties (leveling up your 'player skill') proved fruitful, and that's satisfying. The voice acting was decent - nothing incredible, mind you, but I tend to be picky and felt the actors were pretty good; their manner of speaking reminded me of Game of Thrones a couple times.\n\nIf you take your time with each island, exploring it throroughly and completeing all the quests, this is actually a reasonably long game. My first (very thorough) playthrough was over 50 hours, and the game is constructed so that you cannot get all the skills or experience all the content in a single playthrough. I don't know if it will hold my attention for a second go-around, but I could see my clock hitting nearly 100 hours if I do, and that's great bang for your buck.\n\nAnother reviewer complained that training and items were "too expensive" and the game was "too difficult". I couldn't disagree more. Too often, loot and gold are meaningless in games. You hoard hundreds of thousands of gold and have nothing to spend it on! In this game, you need to choose what gear and training you get with care, and that gives a real sense of value to loot when you get it. As for "too difficult"? Maybe my opinion is different as a fan since Gothic 1, but the challenge in these games are part of the experience. Why should you be able to go anywhere and beat anyone willy-nilly? One of the most memorable experiences of Gothic 2 was when I faced a situation in which I found myself unable beat a crowd of Orcs guarding the enterance to a city, and was forced to make a break from my "kill everything" mentality, and instead find a way to sneak past them and then proceed to RUN FOR MY LIFE! This was such a breath of fresh air! Furthermore, if you use all your resources in this game (proper gear, potion use... strategy) you can prevail in any fight, and overcoming the challenge makes it all the more satisfying when you do.\n\nThis game might not be for everyone. There are bugs, and quirks, but looking past those you have a very thoughtfully and lovingly made game here. I definitely recommend it. If you like Risen, or Gothic, this should be a safe buy, but you may want to wait for a sale.\n\nAll said and done, I really enjoyed this game, would have paid more for it, and would like to pick up the DLC when it goes on sale. Looking forward to Risen 3: Titan Lords, for sure!","June 1, 2014","true","53.9"," 46 of 62 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","46","62","0","1"

This one, however, is strange, the mouths don't move half the time and the movement is completely out of time with how fast people are talking.\nCombat is much more clunky. Perhaps this changes as the game goes on?\nThere are 3 unforgivable problems\nI'm not even sure how to properly describe this one, I'm sure there must a term for it out there somewhere because you can see it in other types of media. It's 'rushed,' dialogue is rushed past so fast it's mind numbing. Just "this is the problem this is the plan," a conversation about important issues that would require more detail and background information is blasted through in 2 to 3 sentences. I know not everyone likes lots of dialogue, but this is so stripped back it feels completely unrealistic. To go along with that you are also moved around in the same way, instead of talking to a person then moving to the next location or person you are just put there instantly to continue the scene. Again it's something I'm sure some people welcome, but it's just so jarring, like they don't want you to experience the world they crafted, they just want to push you through it as fast as possible.\nIt's obvious they should have just made an entirely new universe for this game. Though they've kept the skeleton of the story from the first game they haven't continued it. Instead they introduce completely new obstacles in the plot that seem completely out of place. perhaps it could all work with some proper backstory and explanation, but because of 'rushed' effect explained before it's just TONS of stuff out of nowhere that just doesn't work.\n\nshort list of things that came out of nowhere without proper explanation:\nWhy are you now a full fledged member of the inquisition; you could be a member in the first game, but due to the ending and the fact that you could follow other paths, an explanation is needed.\nWhy do you start the game in this city; why did you leave the island; how did you get across the sea again when the first game makes it clear the magical storms are making sailing almost impossible.\nMara is introduced like you should know who she is, this is a situation where the player knows nothing about a topic and even though player's character might know things you need to present the player with the information in a natural way.\nIn the opening cinematic and the information you gain over the course of the first game you learn that water titans (or at least titans that can travel on the ocean) are destroying ships and causing the storms; now the threat is Mara and Kraken with no mention of the titans.\nCharacter personalities. In the few minutes I devoted to this game I met 4 characters from the first game; the main character, Patty, Severin, and Commandant Carlos. All of them act significantly differently than they did in the first game. (and the last two look completely different as well, changing in age and physique)\nHOWEVER some of these problems are, in fact, explained. They are explained away in a single small paragraph, presumably from the devs, I found on the wiki (very minor spoilers for the first game, spoiler tag probably isn't needed tbh), but it's not mentioned in game at all.\n\nWhile in the Inquisition, the Nameless Hero tried to fight the Titans, but soon magic is banned as too dangerous, the Titan Lord armor and weapon are left to sink in the sea. The monocle turned out to be cursed, so once removed, the Nameless Hero lost his eye. Besides, having used magical items, he was regarded with suspicion by people around him. Abandoned and disappointed, the Nameless Hero could not do anything but drown his sorrow in rum for years.\nNone of this is presented in game and it has some serious issues.\n\nMagic is banned? this is nonsense, humanity is on the brink of defeat, and so far magic has proven to be the only effective way to succeed.\nNo one would throw away a set of armor that made you nearly immune to the titans’ power, again, humanity is dying, losing against the titans on all fronts.\nNo one would throw away the monocle, even with this (very minor) curse. It is the only known way to see titans, which are otherwise INVISIBLE.\nI can’t imagine anyone on the island of the first game would treat him with suspicion.

Well, what can I say?\nThere will always be some problems with Piranha Bytes games, mostly of the technical origin. I can foretell you that, being a fan of them from the year 2002, when I climbed on the highest and almost inaccessible tower in the first Gothic game... and on the top of it a chest which contained a mysterious item with description in German, the only use of that was breaking my save file... So what?\nPiranha Bytes may not be code wizards, but they do an impressive work over the years. They bring passion, dedication, soul in the every game they making. For that I'm grateful.\n\nDown to the Risen 2. The most user-friendly, most casual in the progress compared with the previous games... And with embellished and fancy pirate theme. Surely it attracted some new players to the franchise. Aaaand... some of them were distracted! That's that I felt, while was reading all those complaints about awkward controls, unbearable skills elaboration system etc.\nFor my part, I got that for what has come into the game: an interesting adventure. You know the kind where you explore new lands, meet new people, kill some of them, getting better in the process...\nI had some downsides, too. For first, game was far more narrative than before, and exploring part was less than usual in favor of major quest line by saving the world. Second, famous tech issues of the developer made a process of gaining achievements far more complicated. And for third, my pride suffered a bit from the shooting mini-game, where I cannot hit any bottle!\n\nAll of those minuses are tolerable, of course. For the luxury of being a pirate captain with your own ship and crew... Risen 2 is surely deserved its cost.\n\n8/10 killed pirates","July 3, 2015","true","98.0"," 50 of 73 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","50","73","6","7"

Most of my friends tend to curse at the "difficult" gameplay and levelling up, but I say to them - "That's old-school for you." And I like it. Nowadays, I find some of the games a bit too easy to play, but the old-school ones make me think before I start slashing and hacking at enemies, because it can happen that a boar gets me from the back and I'm done.\n\nRisen 2 reminds me of the Gothic series quite a but, but it shouldn't surprise me since it's made by the same company. I am in love with its graphics and the storyline is very interesting. I also quite like the character redesigns from the first Risen game and their development throughout the game. Take the main protagonist for example - at the beginning of the game he's a drunkard, right? And at the end of the game, he rises as a hero again.\n\nThe new enemies are quite interesting too - I've always wanted to play more pirate games, but I haven't found an interesting one as of yet, excluding Gothic II's Addon and Risen 2 - did you notice that both of the games that made pirates interesting are made by PB? :)\n\nAnyway, I warmly recommend this game to everyone that doesn't get too frustrated with the "difficult" gameplay. As I said, that's old-school for ya.","October 7, 2014","true","22.1"," 41 of 58 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","41","58","5","0"

Risen 2 parts from the sword and shield medieval fighting world of Faranga to a musket, pistol, cannon and sabers fighting modern age.\n\nRisen 2 is set in the age of the conquistadors, where a kind of sabre-fighting and musket-shooting Spanish fleet is invading new lands inhabited by spear-throwing and voodoo-casters natives. You, a "good pirate", must fight the "bad pirates" for relics to fight the water titan lord, Mara, and for that, you need to choose to side with the inquisition, which will give you muskets, or the Natives, which will give you voodoo spells.\n\nIt is a story about the romantic and cliche view of pirates, With a lot of rum, eye patches, parrots, typical clothing and speaking, etc. Despite being a mediocre RPG, the story is captivating. If you see it on a sale, it is worth buying and giving a chance.\n\nIf you have played Risen before, you'll find better and worse aspects in comparison:\n\nFirst, the battle system was crippled. It's a shame, since Risen battle system was very good. Even without training, one could battle stronger enemies given enough skill. Now, without training, you can't do anything but swing your sword around. You can't dodge anymore, the dodge was changed to a kind of roll, which is not only unrealistic (because you roll too far away) but serves only to flee, since you don't end up in a good position to counter attack.\n\nSecond, magic was removed from the game. It just didn't fit in the modern feel the developers wanted for the game. Instead, it was changed for voodoo, a kind of cursing spells used by the natives, that is almost useless for combat but adds interesting events in the game.\n\nAnd third, for the good news, quests are less linear and more interesting.","October 14, 2014","true","190.4"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","30","42","0","0"

Graphics glitches, a poorer NPCs behaviour (more static, more repetitive movements, more exploitable....), a few of important changes in the gameplay such as the missing animation while you use a potion or food to heal yourself that makes the fights much easier as the healing effect is immediate or almost so... Despite that, it is still clearly a Piranha Bytes RPG game and I very enjoyed it. It seems what it is really improved compared to the first Risen are - at least  - some aspects of the story: narration, dialogues (not always good though), two-three well done characters (especially Jaffar, "♥♥♥♥ yes", he is a fun travelling companion).

Don't get me wrong. It was a definition of the Gothic style. Risen 1 joined the best bits from the first two Gothic titles, giving us the perfect Gothic game gameplay wise and implementing a load of great ideas. Even the lore and the plot was a mix of first two Gothic games with changed names and details. I had a ton of fun playing and re-playing it. The disappointment came from the fact, that Piranha Bytes made once a good game - that is Gothic 2 (which is the fixed Gothic 1) and is too incompetent to make anything else. So they copied everything that they made in the past. They learned from the mistake Gothic 3 was.\nOr did they?\nNo. Because now they decided to make their own BioWare role playing wanna be; just like they tried to jump on an Oblivion band wagon with Gothic 3. Don't try to pull BS that was not the whole point. The whole game screams with crippled cinematic drama in the style of mass effect or worse - dragon age. The sole concept of trying the whole "bond to the characters" in a game just to jump on a popular bandwagon of "bioware way" is the root of the failure Risen 2 came out to be. No one expected PB to pull a such BS, because their target audience never wanted that from their games. The Steelbeard's death scene was the peak of failure Risen 2 was story wise.\nWhat else? The game itself was a chore, unfinished cluster♥♥♥♥, suffering not only because of the failed design choice of making "our own bioware rpg", but from everything else. The lore, the world structure, characters, combat, the character progress, crafting, exploration crappy engine with BS graphics (remember the horrendous flora pop-ups?) - everything was broken beyond repair.\nThe combat was ♥♥♥♥, it's not up for a dispute. Useless melee, laughable cunning that didn't even work as intended (the parrot was the majestic way to loose your character points). Overpowered AS ♥♥♥♥ fire-arms that turned the game into boring shoot-a-crap marathon until you encountered the last boss. Which went down from 3 shots. Yeah, talk about difficulty curve or balanced character progression in this game. Feeble magic raplecement in form of a voodoo, which was mind boggling useless gimmick - I bet no one even bothered with testing that ♥♥♥♥ after being coded, they just threw it to the bag and realeased it without checking if it works. I refuse to accept the fact this crap was pulled out with a full knowledge from a developer: "yeah this plays out nicely and as intended!" No, the voodoo just didn't work. Dolls were useless and hardly did much, they were used only once and they costed a fortune. Possesion hex? Yeah, go ahead, hex that monkey and watch it fight another monkey for 30 minutes, because mobs tend to kite themselves endlessly. This ♥♥♥♥ only looked promising when the game told you that you can posses NPCs. Hey, that can work just fine! I thought and oh God was I wrong. A gimmick used once or two in the whole game, bugged as well. What a ♥♥♥♥ing farce this game was combat-wise. Do you remember game telling you to dodge while fighting animals? Yeah, but there was no actual dodge move in the ♥♥♥♥ing game. The patch came out week or more after the release. How ♥♥♥♥ing ignorant and incompetent you have to be to let a such cluster♥♥♥♥ to be released? It was even worse than a broken Gothic 1 combat.\nCrafting? You didn't need to craft anything, until you decided to struggle with a broken melee, then you will need one crafted sword - to roll everything on your path with 2 hits, with your finger up your ♥♥♥.\nThe world structure and exploration? Yeah, but - no in this game. Everyone loved Gothic games and Risen 1 for the illusion of a living world. Every NPC had their day routine, his/her house, some even travelled through the world. It was ♥♥♥♥ing marvelous in Gothic 1. It still is, after all these years. Risen 1 kept that achievement of the PB studio, but in a less scale. But it was still there and no one was complaining. What do we have in Risen 2? A pirate theme that forces the game world to be divided into islands. Ok. But the most of the islands are so ♥♥♥♥ing small, on two you can even see the other side of them. Islands are full of NPCs, but the small sizes of environment made impossible to give them all their own place or even a daily routine. Most NPCs just stand there day and night, having nothing to do. Only few can boast with their own beds. It's a such ♥♥♥♥ing step back I don't need to comment further. You loved previous games for different guilds, ways to progress your character? Forget that, you're a pirate here all the way, working for nobody! Hunting Mara, killing Earth Titan with a fart! Wearing the same tricorne hat for 90% of the ♥♥♥♥ing game. You loved changing your armour and weapon over and over in previous Gothic games, but keeping them, feeling they're more valueable than any price trader can offer? Sorry, you will wear some dirty pirate rags for a whole game. If you got yourself a "dlc" outfit, you will keep it for 99% of the game. By "get it" I mean literally get it via a console, because Risen 2 is also an excellent example of DLC scam policy, where a publisher blocks a retail disc content and demands money for unlocking it (and the studio was too incompetent to block it properly and you can access all the content via console downloading nothing). Exploration? A good joke in Risen 2. The chest loot is ♥♥♥♥ing level-scaled, which is a unforgiveable crime if you were looking for a Gothic game. Yeah, go struggle to open that chest. Here, have few coins and a bottle of rum. You want to jump freely and explore for ♥♥♥♥? Remember jumping on the roofs in Khorinis? Climbing the ♥♥♥♥ing mountains in Gothic 3? Sorry, your pirate character can't swim even in a ♥♥♥♥ing lake, he's a stiff dude also. You can only climb specified rock ledges, which are hilariously out of place and you spot them from 100m ahead (that being often a half of the island you're on). A reward of finding a "hidden" chest? Have a rock and get lost to watch another shoveled down drama cinematic or listen to that ♥♥♥♥ingly annoying gnome that screams over and over "♥♥♥♥ yes".\nAlso, being the game about PIRATES ARRRRRR, having ALL SHIPS to LOOK EXCACTLY THE ♥♥♥♥ING SAME is beyond my mind. Even A ♥♥♥♥ING GHOST SHIP looks the same like every other in the game, even your own.\nEnemies? ♥♥♥♥ you, have a gorilla, a huge spider and uninspired undead guardians. That is all. Remember orc armies, demons, mad cultists, ♥♥♥♥ing dragons, and so on? Haha, you will see non here. But wait! Maybe you will fight that kraken everyone in the game ♥♥♥♥♥ their pants on? ♥♥♥♥ you - a kraken fight was a joke, having to shoot tentacles that posed no threat just before fighting Mara. The most dangerous enemies were boars at the beginning and NPCs enemies you needed to fight melee early due to broken combat. That kraken couldn't kill a ♥♥♥♥ing monkey you fought 10 hours earlier.","May 13, 2012","false","32.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

There are many reasons to account for this. One of the principal factors is the fact that it was released soon after the genre defining title, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Many people had preconstructed expectancies going into Risen 2, such as an open world format with huge worlds and places to explore. Risen is none of that. It is a fairly linear RPG. This is by no means a bad thing. There were times, believe it or not, where RPGs were completely story driven and linear, the likes of Final Fantasy 7. Many have forgotten this, or are too young, or too casual to have played a real RPG in their life times, and have only experienced Skyrim. But here is the truth. Skyrim has no balance whatsoever due to its open world nature, and the story is garbage. Risen II is better in both of these categories, though not perfect. If I can be critical on one point it is that the game has an inverted difficulty curb. The game starts quite hard for the first 10 hours, then is completely easy. It's very unusual to say the least.

It's hard to talk about Risen 2 without referring to their previous games, which I'll call 'PB games' for short.\n\nTo summarize: Risen 2 sometimes feels like a 'PB game lite' but it's certainly not completely dumbed down from previous PB games. The atmosphere and the 'feel' of the PB games is there, so I'll enjoy playing this game more than I would 9 out of 10 similar games. The fact that melee combat is almost as bad as it was in Gothic 3 and the absence of 'real' magic are the only two problems that certainly knock off some points in the final score for Risen 2.\n\nTo talk about this game more in-depth, I'll take the list I used for my 'Risen' review to elaborate about the aspects that make PB games enjoyable experiences in a  way that only PB can create them. Now, as I will be focusing on the differences in Risen 2 compared to earlier PB games, this may come across as a pretty negative review. This is not my intention though. I like this game and recommend it to everyone who is looking for a decent but challenging roleplaying game. But I think people who are familiar with previous PB games will benefit from reading about the differences between previous PB games and Risen 2 to help them decide whether to buy this game or not, more than they would from reading yet again that Risen 2 is a nice but not a flawless pirate-themed RPG. So let's...\n\n- Exciting melee combat... well, NOT. Not this time. You'll soon discover that the melee combat is just as clunky and worthless as it was in Gothic 3. Against beasts it's a clickfest, so you won't experience some form of tactical melee combat like in Gothic, Gothic 2 and Risen here. Against human(oid) opponents, the melee combat becomes more tactical but somewhat boring because opponents can block forever unless you counter their endless block with a specific move... which leaves you open for attacks and after which both parties will get back to blocking. This makes fighting humanoid opponents a slow experience. Only when your level in swordfighting is very high, so in the second half of the game at the earliest, will you be able to learn 'Powerful Riposte' which makes melee combat actually fun. But by then, you'll most likely have adopted a whole different style of fighting, most probably ranged combat (style 'hit-and-run' or 'kite'). This is really Gothic 3 all over.\n\nAbout the ranged combat. At first, I couldn't get over the fact that Risen 2 has no bows or crossbows at all, unlike all previous PB games. Risen 2 starts a short time after where Risen 1 ended, but all of a sudden nobody uses bows anymore and everyone uses guns instead. But once you get over that, you find that the ranged combat in this game is actually quite effective and fun. Yup, just like in Gothic 3. In Risen 2, you can wield a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other, if you want to stick with blades as your main weapon. But pistols only become decent weapons when you learn a skill to reload them a lot faster. The alternative is fully choosing guns and wielding two-handed guns like the musket or the shotgun.\n\nUsually, 'magic' is another alternative to melee combat in PB games, but not this time around. Don't get me wrong, you can join a faction that allows you to learn some sort of magic (Voodoo) but it is limited to curses and debuffs. So there are no magic attack spells whatsoever in Risen 2.\n\nIt's too bad there's only one decent option, really, but let's focus on the good news here: going with guns (or blade + pistol) is a good and fun build in this game. Or maybe you will like the challenge of going with swords and/or Voodoo anyway. You can always change the difficulty of the game in the options menu if you want to play a certain way but find it too difficult (for the first part of the game).\n\n- Learning curve for your character: like in all PB games there isn't just a learning curve for the player but for the character, too. He needs to learn to fight better. As the game progresses and you improve your character's skills, you actually feel your character getting better. This curve is pretty steep in Risen 2. The reason why they had to do this is because for about 90% of the game, you will have an NPC fighting alongside you. So you can't become a godlike solo fighting machine (too soon) or the game would be too easy for people who choose to take a follower NPC with them, as is the case in Risen 3. Now, we had follower NPCs in all the previous PB games but they where very temporary, more like for 10% of the game so the opposite of Risen 2.\n\n- Factions: this time, there are only two factions to choose from. You will join other 'factions' through the main storyline, but the only real choice you have to make, will be between the Inquisition and the Natives. As usual, each faction has their own set of preferred skills and weapons. The Inquisition = guns, the natives = Voodoo and throwing weapons (which are very weak but hey, it's an option). Another difference with earlier PB games is that there is no real 'faction armor'. You will wear the clothes that offer the best defense, whether you side with the natives or with the inquisition. Also, of all the PB games, the faction choice in Risen 2 has the least impact on the game as a whole. Right after making your choice, a few quests are different for each of the factions, but after that the game has 97% the same quests and storyline for all players.\n\n- Trainers: to learn new skills, you will still need to visit a trainer who can teach you. But not so for your stats anymore. 'Strength' and 'dexterity' have been replaced with more interesting stats (blades, guns, defense, thieving and voodoo). You increase these by spending XP (called 'glory' as of Risen 2) directly in the character screen. Each of the 5 stats has an impact on 3 talents (e.g. for gunfighting you have muskets, shotguns and pistols) and each of the 5 stats determines which skills you can learn providing you can afford the price in gold and find an appropriate teacher. At first, it seems like a bummer they removed the old and well-loved strength and dexterity system, but the new system is actually a lot more elaborate and interesting, and makes for more varied character development options.\n\n- Great atmosphere: the settings, the NPCs, the towns, the music, the humour, ... everything adds to a distinct atmosphere that only PB can create. Although, I must admit in this aspect the 'slightly dumbing down' of the game is most noticeable. Nothing huge, little things really. But it's the little things... Example: there is only one type of food in your inventory, called 'provisions'. So you'll pick up apples and cheese like in previous PB games, but in your inventory they are immediately converted into 'provisions'. You'll still loot raw meat from animals you killed and you can fry this meat at a fire, but once the meat is fried, it's converted into 'provisions' as well. Another example: after beating an NPC in a duel, you can no longer loot them or even pick up their weapon. One last example: in most cases you can steal items in NPC's houses without any real repercussions. They will moan something to let you know they saw you steal but that's it.\n\nLike I said earlier, things like that often made me feel like I was playing a 'PB game lite'. Simplifying things is not necessarily a bad thing, and people who never played another PB game wouldn't even think twice about things like that. But all in all, I'll take a 'PB lite' game over 9 out of 10 similar games any time!\n\nNote about achievements: some achievements are bugged but completionists can unlock them, mostly by using console commands.

It also features a rather unique level up system where you upgrade attributes (Blades, Firearms, Cunning and Voodoo) that  unlocks abilities that you'll have to learn from someone who'll teach you in exange of gold, a nice variation to the "character that figures stuff out of thin air" as you level up.\nThe rules of combat are simple, but the fighting itself must be reasoned, since the game penalizes button mashing quite harshly.\nThat being said, it's a game that focuses of exploration and quests, as there will be a lot of those.\nQuests speaking, i've never encontered a bug quest-wise, so none are broken and/or uncompletable, which is important in a game like this.\n\nAfterall, despite serious technical problems, Risen 2 it's a gem of itself that deserves to be played by any fan of Adventure/RGP, just buy it on discount","August 24, 2015","true","28.7"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

Combat feels totally disconnected from pressing buttons, more akin to ordering the character to perform an attack which he will then perform on his own time. Attacking is limited to just spamming the left click, which is mired by long wind up times, as well as enemies not being staggered by your attacks, while they are more than capable of stunlocking you should they even lightly cough on you, which they will do so, far quicker than your attack animation. The only way I felt I could actually attack enemies was to rub myself up against an enemy and clip through them when they thrusted.\n\nAnimals are even worse, as their attacks are unblockable, as well as un-staggerable. Not only that, but skills that reduce damage taken are limited to only effecting human opponents. So not only can you not block animal attacks, they do far more damage than is feasible, forcing you to hoard potions in order to just soak enemy attacks until you grind them down.\n\nAnimations are in themselves janky and poor quality, and recycled to a horrendous degree. Human characters talking merely flap their jaws as if they belonged in the 90s, while the camera and characters noticebly constantly reset themselves every line of dialog, causing them to visibly spawn in every 5 seconds during cinematics. Texture and model quality, while not everything is to do with graphics, the level of quality is most definitely sub par for a studio as old as this.\n\nVoice acting is poor too, it's better than average in that it actually uses British actors, but they're still pretty pants.\n\nOverall a poor and infuriating experience not worth investing in, even if you are desperate for a pirate game like I was.","May 9, 2015","false","1.7"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

The pirate setting is generally well done and there is plenty of humor.\n\nNPC teammates are a nice addition, but one of them is so much better than the others that I doubt most players will spend much time switching between them. A couple of them are painfully boring, and one of them seems to be something of a jarjar binks ripoff in terms of irritating accent, total failure at humor and racist undertones.\n\nCOMBAT and CHOICE are where this game really fails.\n\nRisen 1 had punishing combat that was at first really difficult, until you figured out the enemies' attack patterns and were given proper armour (that game's "soft" invisible wall in terms of exploration), at which point all combat pretty much became trivial and tedious. Risen 2 takes any feeling of real flow out of combat by making most enemies' attacks unblockable, which makes combat revolve around spamming attacks and hoping to beat them to the punch. Once you get a rifle, pretty much all combat involves cheesy "hit and run" and/or using your teammate as a distraction/tank, while you spam the fire button.\n\nThere are lots of choices for off-hand weapons and tactics, but because of enemies' total lack of AI and frustrating attack spamming/swarming, none of them are particularly useful.\n\nCombat is, in short, broken, tedious and not fun. There is also a lot of it.\n\nCHOICE is this game is thankfully not broken like in Risen 1, but rather pointless and badly implemented all the same. You pick a "faction" close to the start of the game, but neither has much of an impact on the story other than some changed dialogue, and one different NPC on your ship, neither of which is interesting enough to use throughout the rest of the game, IMHO. This choice also locks you in/out of using either Rifles or Voodoo. Rifles are SO MUCH better than Voodoo that choosing Voodoo amounts to purposely gimping your character. This is a big problem, since Voodoo powers are lots of fun and open up 90% of the (otherwise extremely boring) crafting system. Muskets make all combat extremely easy, however, so picking the fun of voodoo just doesn't make sense since you end up with much more frustrating combat. It would have been great if the devs had allowed you to learn all talents and mix the voodoo with the rifles.\n\nCharacter progression is nicely handled, but other than the Voodoo/Musket choice, I think most players will end up putting points into exactly the same skills, since a handful of them (lockpicking especially) are necessities, and the rest are no-brainers. In the end, it's a very shallow system, but could be a template for a great skill system in the hands of better developers.\n\nThis game will really leave a "low budget game" bad taste in your mouth. There are lots of corners cut, the devs don't seem to have a very easy time using the game engine (i think it's based on unreal engine) as there are some awkward animations, draw distances and fake physics, and while certain aspects of the voice acting are great, others are horrible and/or too repetitive in the Morrowind kind of sense of every non-major NPC having one of 2 voices. Walking into deep water causes the screen to briefly go black before you're teleported back to where you're standing, certain kills have a Fallout 3 style slow motion finish in which your weapon will never actually make contact with your victim and most textures will be see-through, and NPCs in general have too few lines and don't react to your exploits/the changing world in any meaningful way.\n\nI'll also mention that, while the devs are known for "open world" games like Risen 1 and Gothic, this game is painfully linear for the first 35% of the game, then gives you a bioware-style choice of what order the next 3 small "hubs" will be tackled in, follwed by the final 20% of the game being linear.\n\nI left this game running accidentally overnight at one point, and would estimate that game took me in all about 20-25 hours to beat, including the DLC.\n\nA special note regarding the DLC: The "Air Temple" is horrible and tedious, while "Treasure Island" is simply below-average, boring DLC. Niether adds anything to the game (air temple is so bad that it actually takes away from the rest of the game, in my opinion, even though it adds an NPC from Risen 1 who some fans might appreciate).\n\nAll in all, I can only recommend this game if you've replayed Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyborn so many times that you're sick of them, have multiple playthroughs of all Bioware RPG's and Witcher games under your belt, and don't have any higher quality or more original games in your backlog. Of course, if you're a HUGE fan of pirates, by all means try it out.","May 6, 2014","false","41.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The company behind Risen made Gothic, a series that I loved. Gothic has a tragic story, funding was cut from the expansion pack to the third installment, resulting in a buggy game that felt unfinished, and had the wrong voice-actors. The dreaded fourth installment that the orginal company wasn't even part of, killed the series, and I hear this is why they started Risen on the side.\n\nWhile I was initially excited about Risen, I feel like Risen is some sort of attempt from the company's side to "win back" their original ideas for gothic. It feels like they're trying to make the same game, but different.\n\nStill, Risen has a decent story, but Risen is a series, and the third installment just game out. I'll try not to judge Risen 1 on the sequels, but it's hard, because frankly Risen 2 feels like they retconned a lot of Risen 1 in an attempt to reboot their franchise as a sort of "pirate age" age game, even though it clearly felt like a high-fantasy gothic medieval game in the first installment.\n\nSeparately though, the games are quite good, it's just a bit of a snag to get over how poorly they connect, despite several characters making appearances in both games.\n\nIn many ways, Risen perfectly embodies the spirit of Gothic and does provide some not-seen-before elements. Where in Gothic, you felt like you were the nameless master-mind behind a gang of anti-heroes who follow you out of some misguided sense of loyalty (honor among thieves, I guess) rather than true friendship, always facing challenges in a hostile world as you go about, in Risen you feel like people actually have a more "human" relationship towards you. Sure, you're still a nameless guy but apart from a select few individuals, you're truly alone this time, but your friendships in the game are based on actual frienship, meaning the character actually has some relationships with people.\n\nRisen in no way beats or threatens the legacy of the 3 real gothic games, but if you liked gothic, you NEED to play Risen too.\n\nFun fact: Many fans believe that unofficially, Risen is set several years in the future of the original gothic trilogy. Read more on this theory on the internet.\n","September 29, 2014","true","10.6"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

I also used Risen 2 modstarter (downloadable from the web) to get a community patch and to fix some small issues, mainly graphic related. Other than that - no crashes and rather stable on my system.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eincrou/recommended/40390/","Eincrou","Eincrou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eincrou/","244 products in account","Background\nI played Risen when it was released back in 2009 and had a great time with it.  The game was very rough around the edges, and combat at the beginning of the game was absolutely brutal.  But, the game shone brightly with its immense draw distances, enjoyable dialog, and rewarding exploration.  Risen 2: Dark Waters maintains all of these characteristics.\n\nStory and Setting\nThis is a pirate-themed RPG.  Expect pirate things.  I've seen several complaints that Risen 2's take on buccaneering is "generic," such as in Kevin Van Ord's review for Gamespot.  This is an absurd criticism.  A pirate-theme needs certain aspects, such as excessive cursing, buried treasure, tavern wenches, and unnecessarily agressive swashbucklers.  Risen 2 does all of these things, and I think it does them fairly well.\n\nThe story rarely references the Unnamed Hero's previous adventure in Risen, though the grandstoryline of warring Titans continues.  The main villian is a female Titan named Mara.  The storytelling failed big time here, in my opinion.  Mara is seen only three times during the game.  Characters constantly talk about how terrible she is, but little is done to make the player feel Mara's impact.\n\nCharacters and Voice Acting\nI think the voice acting in Risen 2 is consistently excellent.  The pirates sound really harsh and gruff.  There is one voice actor who did both pirate and Inquisition voices who I absolutely love.  I can't recall him voicing any major characters, unfortuantely.  Commandant Sebastiano's actor is amazing.  He speaks with sophistication and vigor.  I recognized his highly distinctive voice on some random NPCs.\n\nThere are many, many characters to speak with in Risen 2.  I enjoyed the dialog in this game very much.\n\nCombat\nCombat in this game is pretty bad, overall.  It is extremely bad for the first 10 hours, as you have very few moves.  Enemies hit extremely hard and have a lot of health.  The first Risen game was like this too, though by midgame it evened out, and in the late game you became an unstoppable god.  I had the same experience with Risen 2.  At least in this game there are companions to help with combat.  They can tank enemies very effectively, so don't be ashamed to let them do so.  Cheesing fights with terrain exploits shouldn't shame you either.  The fights are THAT difficult.  If you stick with it, by end game you will be able to destroy entire taverns full of drunk and angry pirates.\n\nI played the voodoo path rather than the musket path, since it seemed far more interesting that firing a gun.  Voodoo has some very good stuff going for it, such as scepters to make enemies fight eachother, tremor in fear, or summon a permanent ghost companion.  Even so, it seems underdeveloped.  The Ritual (potions) talent was completely useless to me, other than creating improved permanent stat-booster elixirs.\n\nGraphics\nI had the pleasure of playing Risen 2 both in 2560x1440 and 1080p stereoscopic 3D.  The game runs very well with 3D Vision after disabling water reflections and shadows.  The lush jungles were an absolute treat in 3D, where each tree and each leaf helps to give the sense of a rich 3D world.  The draw distance is unlimited... there is no fogging whatsoever.\n\nBut, the graphics have many technical issues.  Level of detail changes cause trees to "grow" and the ground/rocks to change shape as you move through areas. Textures are consistenly low resolution.  When a canned execution animation plays, the Unnamed Hero's neck distorts horrifically.  Animations are poor across the board, really.\n\nI have seen absolutely ridiculous criticisms of the Risen series as having poor graphics that don't improve across installments.  Risen 2 is a major improvement over Risen 1, and Risen 3: Titan Lords obviously looks better than Dark Waters.  The graphics are definitely flawed, but the engine pushes DirectX 9 to its limits.\n\nConclusion\nI had a great time with Risen 2.  I play video games less and less as the years go on, and Risen 2 was the first in a while to hook me into very long play sessions.  I will definitely be picking up Risen 3, but I just spent 43 hours in Risen 2, so I'll take a break before diving in.\n\nI recommend the Risen series to people who can appreciate a hardcore RPG experience.  There is a lot of "jankiness" in Risen games, but I really wouldn't have it any other way.  There's a charm to NPCs that instantly repeat their lines before finishing if you spam-click them.","August 30, 2014","true","44.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","8","12","4","0"

If you are honestly wanting to play an RPG, I would suggest you try the Witcher or Skyrim, as your time would be better spent with those games. In regards to Risen 2, I will say this: the combat is broken and frustrating for the most part, there are all manner of glitches which break any sort of immersion you have in the game, the story is incredibly bland and unexciting and most of the characters you meet are devoid of personality. In essence, the game is unpolished and truthfully not worth the time investment. It is sad, because the pirate setting seemed interesting, the voice acting is remarkably good at times, and even the music (though repetitive) is enjoyable. The idea of scourging for hidden treasures, finding legendary artifacts and the different ways to buid your character are great... but in the end never really amount to anything. If you enjoyed the first one, you will probably like or at least tolerate this game. But having so many incredible RPG jewels out there, Risen 2 just isn't worth the effort.

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","If I had one complaint for Risen 2 is that it's a bad Pirhana Byte game.\n\nI'm not someone who complains about a game being too casualized or too easy, but I can't ignore how many ways Risen 2 is a step back from Risen 1.\n\nThat being said, I can still admire Risen 2 as a good game. Maybe someone who doesn't like the style of Gothic 1/2 and Risen 1 would still enjoy the game. The power of the game's theme carries it far, and if you want a light-hearted, challenging pirate game then Risen 2 is a great choice.\n\n(Just don't expect ship-battles.)\n\nIf you have played Risen 1, you MUST play this game on Hard mode (even if you played the first game on Easy, like myself). Even at that setting you'll probably get by with far fewer deaths than the first game.\n\nIf you haven't played Risen 1, I wouldn't recommend Risen 2 as an entry into the Gothic games. It's an accessible title for newcommers, yes, but the game doesn't have that freeform sense of discovery, replayability and challenge which makes PB games what they are known for.\n\nIt wouldn't prepare you to play the other games.\n\nArr Role To Play the Game (ARPG)\nIf Risen 1 was centered on the mage role with Rune Magic, then Risen 2 is focused on a Thief/Pirate character. The difference is R1 allowed you to be more liberal with your playstyle and offered you multiple paths to make you curious to play the game again. R2 feels tailored to a specific playthrough.\n\nSwords, Guns and Thievery are what you will want to specialize in to get the most out of the game. Voodoo is far too strict/limiting to use in the main game and you'd be better off not crafting items of any kind and be better off looting what you can find. Alchemy, Distillery, Smithing and animal trading are useless fluff for immersion.\n\nEven if you don't care of replaying the same playstyle over again, then you'll find little to offer a second playthrough. There is a fork in the road to make the game feel like it's made for two runs. In reality, however, it's all a ruse.\n\nFor one, if you're someone like me, you'll side with what you think is the good/right faction. The benefit of R1 was that the Don's men and the Order had both positive and negative qualities, making it unable to say who were the good guys. In R2, the natives are obviously portrayed as the underdog with little to no faults.\n\nSecond, the branching paths connect together sooner than they part. They only shape how you go through the scenario, which feels way too linear to make you feel like you're accomplishing anything. (For example, you can't just make voodoo dolls of anyone to figure out how to solve a problem.)\n\nMy recommendation is to make a Pirate-themed character, side with the natives for the Voodoo to change things up a little bit for the rest of the game--you don't even need to invest in the skill--and you'll get an enjoyable 25 to 30 hours of an experience. (Especially if you get the DLC.)\n\nStreamlined Combat\nUnlike other fans, I am actually okay with the new format for the control scheme. It plays similar enough to Risen 1 that it doesn't feel out of place--instead of side-stepping we have Witcher 2 style rolling and we also have Demons' Souls memory of your inputs.\n\nHowever, it's far from being perfect. The problem is actually that PB didn't make the controls simple enough, and the combat animations are too janky to read properly.\n\nOn an X1 controller, you use X for attack (power-attack, riposte, etc.), Y for kick, jump and dodge, LT for parrying (the block) and RT for using a projectile weapon. When you hold down the LT button, you lock on to the nearest enemy and you can do a real parry and riposte (clicking X then Y simaltaneously). B and A are not used in combat. At all.\n\nThis becomes a problem when you want to dodge rather than kick. Had they maped it to another button then you'd never have the problem of kicking by accident when the enemy circle-strafes your camera in the forward direction. And because you get a different control when holding LT for Y, then I don't see why they didn't do the Assassin's Creed layout of mapping buttons over one another. Switching them out with the LT.\n\nIf that's too technical, the problem is they mapped way too many actions to one button when they have a better alternative, overlaying the buttons with a way to switch between them. It causes problems because some actions are based on where you are moving and how the camera moves.\n\nAnother change I would suggest is implementing a Dark Souls stamina meter. It would counter-act spaming the dodge-roll button or make your attacks carry more weight in every battle. That would be one innovation I'd like to see.\n\nSpeaking of abusing missing frames, the other major problem with R2 are the animations. Some enemies are too inconsistent to know when to strike in order to counter their attack, so you're better off dodging than parrying.\n\nAlso, the block, for example, will sometimes block some enemies but refuse to block other attacks (like the Warthog). It's not clear what is acceptable and what is not from the animations shown. You simply won't know until you try, which I don't think is all that great.\n\nDespite these problems, I think the combat is an improvement; it's simpler, which makes each encounter full of tension with every strike you make. So long as you get over that inconsistency curve.\n\n(Oh, and the boss fights still suck. Not surprised.)\n\nIs Less More or Is More Less?\nThe biggest change from R1 to R2 is the exploration. Instead of being on one landmass with multiple entrances/exits and shaping how you traverse the island from the story's progression, you are exploring about 10 islands (with DLCs included) of a similar size.\n\nIt's hard to tell whether every major island is bigger or smaller than R1's location because the enemy mobs are much less of a problem than Risen 1. That change is definitely something I like as I found Ch 2 to 4 tedious from the enemy mobs.\n\nAs a result of the variety of the islands, and the non-linear manner of the game, the islands sometimes lack an identity. Only a few have major differences than being a tropical beach for colonization.\n\nBut because you're always finding something new to explore you will want to continue playing. The game has some Legendary items to give you permanent stat boosts and secret crew members to accompany you to make the exploration worthwhile. The best thing to do when arriving on an island is to ignore the settlements and go wander on your own--you'll get a lot more done that way.\n\nThe worst change in exploration, however, is how much they've neutered the sense of exploration. Climbing is no longer as free to the player as in R1; dungeon crawling isn't about spatial awareness to traps or secret pathways; and exploring the environment to shortcuts doesn't feel as rewarding as before.\n\nSome might argue that it's due to consoles--especially the unnecessary QTEs--but Risen 1 was on the 360, even in a crappy state they didn't implement these changes. So why they limited the game this way makes no sense.\n\nSomething To Be Found Beneath the Grime\nIf it seems like I'm bashing Risen 2 a lot more than prasing its improvements, that's because there is a gem of a game to be found underneath the rough edges. The lore continues on from Risen 1 in some interesting ways, the characters you come across are more memorable, and even the horrible voice-acting and writing continue to have an amusing charm.\n\nInstead of being a grim, hardcore Pirate RPG, we have a light-hearted, self-aware yet still challenging Pirate game that has a lot more to enjoy than to lament on its shortcomings. At some point you should consider playing this game for fun.","January 14","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because i played Risen and read the bad reviews, i was hesitant to try it, but i was positively surprised. Imo, this game is better than Risen 1.\n\nI assumed my old save would be used together with my backstory, but this was not the case. I also seem to have lost an eye.\nIn the beginning it was confusing, because the story tells i joined the inquisition, while i joined the bandits previously. If they had a story to back this up, i would have accepted it, but now they just assumed i chose to go with those arrogant p r i c k s.\n\nMy review on Risen 1 would be a bit the same on this game.  Enemies are still overpowerd. While you start from scratch, enemies are fully skilled. People with muskets do overpowerd damage, wether it is ranged or just stabbing you when you're close. Upgrading skills isreally expensive.\nBarely any gear you can buy, which almost makes no difference, other than how you look. Quite disappointing.\nIt is really the skills you invest in that makes the difference in how good you are at something.\nIf there is an option to dress your char, i would like to take advantage of that, but the gear i liked did not have stats :(\nUnforunately, the ship cannot be used manually and/or upgraded, that would have been cool. You barely have any crewmembers.\n\nI like the fact you can now play with  a companion early in the game. Your compation knows every skill, so i often used them as a tank.\nAgain, i liked the story.\nI would recommend the game contrary to Risen 1.\n\nA detailed story will be written later on.","September 1, 2015","true","72.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Gothic 3's level of freedom & choice was incredible and was the reason I dropped well over 160 hrs on it, Risen 2's only real choice is Voodoo or combat.\n\nFurther to this is the ability to KILL.  Gothic 3 you could kill just about everyone, Risen 2 let's you kill NO ONE outside of normal enemies.  The best you can do in Risen 2 is knock them out BUT you CANNOT loot them and another NPC will quickly get them back on their feet then they will INSTANTLY be back at full health then go back to whatever they were doing with only a litttle "offended" message that shows, the consequence of which im yet to figure out.\n\nNext is the one choice you do get:  Voodoo or sword/guns, the former being fun but mostly useless, especially if you don't cheat.  Voodoo is pretty pathetic, it helps with a a handfull of story parts but for combat it's detrimental.  Sure you can possess enemies to fight eachother but that deprives you of precious Glory points and on NPCs it's a midly fun yet brief distraction at best.  Further to that it's almost entirely useless until it's leveled up which again, unless you cheat, won't be till later in the game.\nIn a game where the combat is so unforgiving, especially ealry on, this choice essentially becomes: Swords/gun OR get your ♥♥♥ handed to you over and over.\n\nOverall the game felt rushed and, compared to Pirahna Bytes earlier offerings, terribly restricting.  The one bright spot was the gnome companion and his cute potty mouth.\n\nPay no more than $5.\n","September 20, 2015","false","52.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Not a lot of pirate themed games out there, and certainly not a lot of pirate RPG's.  You can learn voodoo and choose between the natives and the colonists.  You get to fight an ancient sea goddess.  Recruit crew members, and then take them with you when you're on land.  A little rough around the edges in some places, but I just found it charming.  There's a skill you can learn that lets your pet monkey steal things for you.  Guys.  Guys.  You can put points into "Pet Monkey Theivery".  That should be the whole review right there.  I think you can also get a parrot, but he's not as great as the monkey.","August 4, 2015","true","27.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Compared to Gothic 1+2 and Risen 1 it's kinda poor, but compared to everything else it's totally worth it.

Aside from some annoying deaths near the beginning though, the cutscenes are fine, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the sound is, suprisingly enough, not disappoining, even though Kai Rosenkranz didn't return as composer.\n\nSome pluses! As stated earlier, the music is great, and keeps in the spirit of the first title despite a change of composers. I liked the environments near the beginning a lot more than those in the first game, particularly the blazing city backdropped against a nice, gloomy, rainy, dark little fort.\n\nThe first thing I look for in a game on Steam, even before solid gameplay previews and managable system requirements, is solid localization. Russian and English voices and subtitles are nearly a requirement, and messing around in German and Polish is fun. This game has all of those, while a lot of popular titles seem to skimp on this.\n\nI think this has been on sale at least twice for something absurd like 15-20$ for all three Risen titles with all DLC, so if it goes on sale again, buy the damned thing.\n","November 3, 2015","true","43.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is the clunkiest I've ever seen in any game ever (even worse than the original Risen which was also pretty awful).\n-The difficulty curve starts off as a brick wall that turns into a damn cliff once you get over it (as in, it's hard as balls at first, then it becomes laughably easy).\n-The first "real" boss at the Earth Temple is interesting but then every other boss in the game save for the second to last (which uses the EXACT same mechanics as the Earth Temple boss) is just standard swordfights.\n-There are exactly two characters that are even remotely memorable throughout the game, and they both either die after the first boss or are as useless as voodoo.\n-Oh, and Voodoo is useless except for the points where it's shoehorned into the plot and you have to learn it and use it from time to time.\n-Money is damn near impossible to come by early on, and any time you DO have money you have to throw it at a skill trainer to learn the basic freaking skill set for your desired weapon(s) because SOMEHOW the player character forgot literally -EVERYTHING between the first game and this one.\n-Speaking of... after a certain point money starts piling up all at once. During the first 3/4 of the game you're poor as dirt, and then during the last 1/4 of the game you've got a minimum of 10k gold unless you specifically buy EVERY skill, period.\n-What the hell were the developers doing switching from a fantasy RPG to a ♥♥♥♥ing Pirate RPG?\n-There's no real feeling of your character's growth - you just buy new gear and more skills every now and then when you can afford them. You don't get that feeling of "Holy crap these enemies used to be so tough but now I'm oneshotting them! I'm so badass!" it's more like, "Ugh, these things again. It's a good thing I got this new sword so I can kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of it slightly quicker."\n-There are no stats. Your health is capped at 100 with no way of increasing it. You cannot increase your character's strength as a fighter, you can only increase your base "Blade" ability and then beyond that buy more blade-related skills. You choose from slashing, piercing, and thrown weapons (sabre, rapier, and spear/throwing daggers, respectively), and pistols, muskets, and shotguns.\nMagic was completely removed in favor of Voodoo; which, yeah, it fits the whole "Pirates of the Carribbean" thing they've got going here, but it's still pretty dumb - especially how they wrote it off as "The Inquisition (who, by the way, you joined up with between games regardless of which faction you sided with in the first game) banished all mages because they didn't stop the Inquisition from ♥♥♥♥ing up in the first game."\n\nPROS:\nThe story and world are interesting.\nIt's fairly lengthy. Not as long as the previous game, but not short as 90% of AAA titles out there.\nSome other things which I honestly can't describe (see below).\n\n\n\nNow, all that being said I actually have to recommend this game, just not at full price. Wait 'til it's on sale, or better yet wait 'til the collection is on sale and you can get the first and second game for just shy of $10 like I did. I don't know what it is about this game and its predecessor, but the things they do right they do EXTREMELY right; it's just that the things they do wrong they do really, really, REALLY wrong, so it averages out into a decently albeit mediocre game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...seriously though who the hell changes themes like that? That'd be like if the next Elder Scrolls game was about pirates, or if the next CoD was about Vietnam war protests, or if Half Life 3 ended up being a third person fantasy RPG like the first Risen.","August 25, 2014","true","20.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Lots of exploration of intresting environments, looting and lots of killing turkeys for chicken (yes im serious).\n\nOne thing to note is that its hard to gain skills and level up your character, unlike in most modern RPGs where you level up and gain skills from doing things over time (like in Bethseda games) in this and Risen 1, skills cost gold and  'glory' (both of which you need a LOT of) to level up your attributes, talents and skills etc. So be prepared to sink a hell of lot of time in just building your character to be able to defeat harder foes.","September 22, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Rewarding exploration, open-world, interconnected dialog and questing system, interesting characters and story, tons of loot to plunder and adventure around every hand-crafted nook and cranny that you find.\n\nI would say this game is a must-play if you are into RPGs at all. At first I didn't think I would like a pirate setting as I'm more into medieval settings, but the setting was so well-crafted that I quickly became hooked until I completed the game in just about 60 hours.\n\nWell worth checking out if you're a fan of RPG games.

"The player doesn't need to feel like they're controlling the combat - we'll just have them try to press buttons at enemies until they die." - "Explain the game mechanics to the player? Meh, Dark Souls doesn't do that, either."\n\nThere is one word that perfectly described Risen 2: "curde", as in "crudely made". So why am I actually recommending this game? Well, because it's crudeness is sort of a "Mount & Blade"-like crudeness.\n\nYes, Risen 2 is crude. But it's also charming and captivating. How captivating? Well, I was really pining to play Dark Souls again while playing Risen 2, put I decided to put it off. The dialogue in this game is well written, though not always well voice-acted. The characters are all you'd expect from a pirate game: drunks, thieves, ruffians and weirdos litter the various islands of its world. But its biggest asset is the sense of exploration that it gives the player. It always makes you curious for the next thing. I don't know how they did it, but ever since Gothic 1, Piranha Bytes has been able to make running around and picking up random stuff off the ground an intriguing passtime. But that is not all that Risen 2 is, of course. There are many interesting conversations to have, talents to learn, quests to undertake and enemies to slay, despite the abysmal combat system - seriously, it takes the guy like 2 seconds to execute the input! Could be that I'm playing with a controller, but it's just so much more fun.\n\nGet the game on a bargain and enjoy!","April 7, 2015","true","22.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Then they introduce the Hero and I was like who the ♥♥♥♥ is this long haired, One-eyed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? I almost lost interest from the get-go. lol\n\nThen I played for a bit, now Commandant Carlos is now a fat dude. Well at least Patty was hotter than in the first game.\n\nAfter playing the game (and reading on the wiki) I now know what happened to the Nameless Hero. Apparently he was blamed for what happened in Faranga. Got his eye destroyed by the Monocle from Inquisitor Mendoza which turned out to be cursed. The ban of magic also forced him to let go of the titan armor (what a waste).\n\nAll in All my final verdict is that Risen 1 is better and far more engaging than Risen 2, however Risen 2 is still a good game.\n\nPros:\nThere are a lot more place to explore in this game.\nYou're a pirate? Yarrr?\nAnimations are better at least there are a lot more diversity in the looks of NPC's.\nCompanion System.....?\nBetter fast travel than in Risen 1.\nIf in 1 you got Lizardmen in 2 you'll get gargoyles that looks like dragons standing on 2 legs weilding an axe.\nYou'll get to meet some of the people from Risen 1 in better graphics and new models.\n\nCons:\nThe animations are still clunky, but can be overlooked.\nSometimes (Most of the time?) when exploring, it felt like a walking simulator.\nLore didn't get me as hooked, so it felt like a chore to finish the game.\nThe Pirate ship could have been more than Aesthetics, like naval battles, for cryin' out loud you have sea monsters.\nProfessions (crafting) and Factions are useless.\n\nI've read that the game was rushed etc, so that's why it wasn't that polished but it's still a good game.","October 1, 2015","true","82.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

The first 2/3 of the game I'd say I preferred the original, but towards the end I was all about #2 (I also haven't played Risen in a couple of years so my memory of it is a little foggy). I do like how Risen was more like Gothic overall, and Risen is definitely more challening than #2.. There were times it felt easy for this kind of game (I played it all the way through on Medium except I turned it on easy during the annoying target practice part). Risen 2 does have some pretty good graphics, but nothing mind blowing. There are also some graphical glitches from time to time, but nothing major. It doesn't run as smooth as the first Risen either. I also do prefer the combat in Risen, but after unlocking a ton of skills the gameplay in Risen 2 does get better and better as you go. The story also gets better the further it got along, but I also think that Risen and the Gothic games I played are the same in that way.  Well, in the Risen and Gothic games everything just seems to get better and better. They're all really fun games that put a big emphasis on exploring. Exploration is the main ingredient, and Risen 2 gives you lots of area to explore. It's not a huge game, but it is big. The soundtrack is pretty solid, too. The voice acting is good most of the time. Some of the dialogue is fun. Most of it is kind of what you'd expect in a RPG game like this, but the pirate theme adds some rough dialogue that can be amusing. When the game was all said and done I felt I had enough, but I really enjoyed my time with Risen 2. It's an underrated game, for sure. 8/10","March 8, 2015","true","60.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

После событий первой части, в которой  Герой пленил Огненного Титана, человечество оказалось на грани существования. Целью Безымянного стал один из Лордов Титанов - Мара, которая, при помощи осьминого-подобного существа Кракена, потихоньку уничтожает корабли Инквизиции.\nПервой задачей ГГ становится проникновение в ряды пиратов, у которых есть оружие для борьбы с Марой. Помогает ему в этом Бэтти - бывшая владелица трактира на Фаранге и дочь капитана Стальная Борода, к которому и направляется наш герой.\n\nМир игры очень сильно изменился. На замену Мечу, Луку и Щиту пришли Шпаги, Сабли и Пистолеты.  Такой резкий переход из одной эпохи в другую почти никак не объясняется...\n\nПервые 2-3 часа могут показаться очень скучными. Во первых это из-за того, что вас держат в рамках сюжета, который не позволит вам покинуть остров, пока вы не выполните все необходимые задания, а во вторых - из-за малого количества самих заданий... Однако после второй локации игра начинает расцветать.\n\nИгра заметно прибавила в масштабе. Вместо одного острова теперь целый Архипелаг, поделённый на островные и береговые локации. Между ними вы можете перемещаться совершенно свободно с помощью своего личного корабля. Плавать на нём, как в AC4: Black Flag, вам не дадут, но это на само деле не нужно, Risen - игра не про часовое стояние за штурвалом.\n\nВ каждой локации вас всё также ждёт море квестов, которые стали ещё интереснее. В пример я могу привести квест, в котором нужно помочь кандидату стать вождём и сюжетный отрывок на острове Воров, в котором вам придётся встретить мирное поселение Карлов (я знаю, что в Risen 2 они называются своим оригинальным названием "Гномы", но "Карлы" мне привычнее...). Интерес к квестам прежде всего вызывает появившийся в игре Юмор, например в выше названном квесте с новым вождём, по заданию нужно будет вселиться в тело одного из кандидатов и ответить на вопросы Вождя. На вопрос "Где тебя так долго не было?" Герой отвечает "Нужно было отлить сходить!", что вызвало у Вождя недоумение.\n\nВ геймплее игры произошли некоторые изменения. Из-за них игра стала заметно проще, чем должна быть, но это не критично. Изменения коснулись прежде всего Ролевой и Боевой систем.\n\nВ ролевой системе теперь не нужно качать Очки Обучения с каждым новым уровнем. За выполнение квестов и убийство различной мерзости вам начисляют Очки Славы, которые вы вольны потратить на любую из 5 веток развития: Холодное оружие, Огнестрел, Выносливость (прокачка здоровья), Ловкость (воровство и красноречие) и Вуду - новый вид магии, который пришёл на замену Кристальной магии из первой игры (по сюжету, после Фаранги кристальная магия стала "вне закона"). Учителя тут также остались но теперь их задачей стало обучение различным "особым" навыкам. Ещё была улучшена система взлома и в не самую лучшую сторону изменена система торговли.\n\nВ боевой системе появилась возможность использовать пистолеты или какой-либо из "грязных приёмов". Комбинации ударов сократили, теперь большинство битв проходятся простым "закликиванием" врагов, в то время как в первой игре нужно было постоянно использовать различные удары, чтобы убить врага. Автонаведение стало вести себя более адекватно, что меня искренне порадовало.\n\nЕщё из плюсов хотел бы отметить отличную постановку сюжетных сцен, чего только стоят сцены битвы с Титаном Земли и Кракеном, а так же  гибель Стальной Бороды и его последующее появление на острове Мертвецов.\n\nИз минусов же во первых хочется отметить отвратительный подход локализаторов к проекту. Описывать всю убогость перевода и озвучки я не буду, это надо увидеть и услышать самому...\n\nИз других: запуск игры на Восьмерке при помощи танцев с бубном, всё так же малое количество моделей персонажей, однотипные корабли, крохотные посёлки с максимум 10-ю жителями и уже отмеченную систему торговли.\n\nИтоговая Оценка - 8/10 если смотреть на игру со всеми её минусами, и 10/10 если просто наслаждаться всё так же отличным миром, хорошим сюжетом, свободой действий и персонажами, включая Главного Героя.","March 7, 2015","true","35.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

First off I'd like to point out that Risen 2 has made some vast improvements in certain areas: the graphics, layout, fast travel and I haven’t got stuck in a jump animation once (Which was a regular occurrence in the original) Along with a range of other things.\nBut despite all of the improvements that have been made, one thing lets this game down for me. The combat. In Risen 1, the combat was difficult, but once you got the hang of each type of enemy it was a difficult but rewarding system. Risen 2 handles human combat (player vs human AI) well and is a little reminiscent of Risen 1 (Maybe even a little better) But the animal combat (Player vs anything non-humanoid) is painful. There's no better way to describe it, you cannot block or interrupt animals attacks, you're forced to either dodge and bunny hop around like crazy or just burn through health items  simply to stay alive.\nI really would like to recommend this game, but it's just not enjoyable having to fight packs of wild boar while getting rammed repeatedly by whichever one you’re not currently dodging.\nI would suggest you try Risen 1, which has its own flaws, but I still found significantly more enjoyable than this.\n","March 26, 2014","false","5.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

At first I did not liked it, and thought fighting system is bad, but as I was playing longer opposite showed to be true. I have found melee tactitcs almost for all enemy types. And only melee skill I learnt for most of the game was kick, I was playing as woodoo thief. When I read reviews that they say you have to spam mouse 1 clicking in melee I have to feel bad about them because spamming is viable only in realy rare ocassions. Agaisnt some enemies works blocking, agaisnt some not (there are even some enemies which you can't block, sadly one of them is enemy where they are trying to learn you blocking via tips :-) ). When blocking fails, try kicking or dodging. And so on. You have to use your brain, see enemies patterns and use them agaisnt them. And even when you don't like it, there is other way to enjoy the game. You can use firearms, by joing right faction. And this si lots of fun as well, and it is way easier. Another contributin to fighting in general are dirty tricks, you can throw sand/salt to enemy eyes, so you get free hit, if done succesfully. Later you can even use parrot to distract your enemies for longer periods of time. Woodoo gives you adventage in fight as well, if you choose woodoo instead of firearms. Of course as in most RPG game, luring out enemies one by one is the way to go most of the time.\n\nAnother thing I liked about the game was, that  it made laught many, many times. Especially some mission fullfiled using woodoo were amazing. Another good thing is that you have companion of your choice availabe due to most of the game, which makes fighting easier as well. Story was  somehow predicitble, but still fun.\n\nI haven't encountered any bugs, except one minigame seemed to be as hard on normal as on hard (on easy it was easier), but maybe it was not bug. And some achievments does not unlock. One complain I will have about the game is that some skills seemed to be underused. For example great idea with trained monkey. Yes it pays for itself, but could be used way more during the game. Weapon smithing and gun smithing seemed to be pretty much useless, taking into account price of recepies and materials, with exception with use to forge legendary weapons. Another complain will be that there was no normal fighting teacher on the second island, or at least I did not  found him.\n\nAs for the replaybility, you can play it once using woodoo, and once using fire arms.  Solution to some quest (mainly main story quest) will be different. And fighting is different as well.\n\nI wil reccomend RIsen 2 to all gothic fans, because as one of them I love it.","November 28, 2013","true","65.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

And continues to be....\n\nfirst i love the game in every aspect but these....\n\n1: Clunky as hell- Even with a beast PC I have had lag, when it rains, when I'm in shadows, even when I play for long times with out end. I couldn't walk around the Gnome town without lag, the rest of the island was fine.\n\n2: Combat- Lags SOOOOOOOO MUCH if you fight more than 3 opponets, and you companion will just watch the battle more than fight, throwing in the occasional hit or so... Makes them more of a rage then help. Glitch with Slane battle never fixed, if you don't follow him on the island of thieves the game never makes him a bad guy and once yu two fight it out it just turns into a slap fight where no one gets hurt. Had to use console commands to kill him. Final fight with Mara sucks, easy as hell, but great video after.\n\n3: No Cursor sensitivity- Like WTF ARE WE IN THE 90"s\n\n4: Ending was very anti-climatic and set up nothing for another game, which there was and my review on that points out like the Devs just started a whole nother time line with no conection to the trilogy.\n\nI try so hard to love this one and it completes the story line (meaning it ENDS it with this game)  but WTF did anyone give a ♥♥♥♥ about bugs in this, or even FPS????? Still a ok game to buy (Cheaply) But Devs where you pushed to release this or what.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PuppetSoul/recommended/40390/","PuppetSoul","PuppetSoul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PuppetSoul/","100 products in account","I'm a fan of pirate scenarios and naval combat.  Unfortunately, despite carrying that theme, Risen 2 is stylized and plays like an Elder Scrolls Lite title, but without the support of the absurdity of ES modding communities to provide and/or refine all the needed elements.\nThe basis of the game is "Yay Pirates" combat, which while it can occassionally be entertaining, is often nothing more than frustrating due to the mechanics.  Melee combat has two modes: attack and die.  If you block on a melee character, you're awful and need to reevaluate your life choices.  Blocking is purely useful to ranged characters, because on melee, blocking an enemy attack staggerlocks you, which causes you to delay before being able to counterattack, allowing the enemy to hit you again to interrupt your counterattack, or to blockbreak you.  You can tumble away though, allowing it to be viable to ranged combat.  The problem with ranged combat though is the limited resource of bullets.  Bullets are fairly rare, and must be conserved for boss battles and duels, because entering into melee combat in those situations is suicidal (mostly due to bugs: bosses can't be staggerlocked, you can, so you lose in a melee slugfest), but going ranged trivializes these encounters.  Easiest example?  The very first "challenge" duel in the tutorial area: if you melee him, he outdamages you, staggerlocks you and you lose.  That fight is designed for you to lose, give up and come back later when you're on his level (he hits ~4x as hard as you do at low levels).  But if you block, tumble back and hit him with a pistol shot, then kite until he catches you, rinse and repeat?  You can complete the fight without getting hit.\n\nThe skill trees, while entertaining in theory, are plagued by a very clear "Best path", due to the alternatives not being viable. For example, pursuing the Monkey skill requires you to forgo combat specs (making the game harder), but the Monkey is awful, so there's no reason to suffer through a path with no benefits for the first half of the game, when the big payoff is a complete letdown.\n\nThe game also lacks naval combat, so it's not truly a Pirate game.","December 26, 2013","false","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The only few things that make this game even qualify for the RPG genre are the functions of Lockpicking, Smithing, and that it is single player.\nThe dialogue options are incredibly basic, the tutorial time totals around 1.5 hrs, and the lack of being able to kill any non-hostile NPC's devalues the game. Instead, you can knock out an NPC (such as the Worker, who is unarmed) and they will crouch for about a minute before getting right back up. Similarly, when you try to assault the town guards, they quickly defeat you and you get back up, in additon to losing 50 'Honor' points. These aspects make the game feel very restrictive.\n\nThe one decent thing about Risen 2 is its art and graphic design, which mostly applies to specific objects like the first ship you sail on. In terms of facial design and resolution, both are low.\n\nTo be completely honest, I only ever finally installed it just to get the Steam Trading Cards it has.","December 13, 2013","false","1.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You'll end up having to play the opening chapter several times just to avoid making a few easy mistakes which prevent you from getting past a bottleneck, thus fencing off the rest of the game from you.  Unless you can do enough great deeds to convince the pirate captain to take you with him, you might as well just give up, and it really does all hinge around that.  Tip: don't introduce yourtself to the pirate captain until you have finished all the quests in chapter one, or you will lose the use of his daughter as a co-fighter.  Or just blast your way through and learn this for yourself and have to play the first chapter several times over to get it right.  It's just too dull to bear repeat plays.\n\nMore bottlenecks await, they've chosen that path for this second instalment.  I find myself pecking at this game from time to time as slight enthusiasm returns.  There's a mild humour, but nothing you'd miss if it wasn't there.  Some bugs too, preventing you from completing a couple of quests at least.  Voodoo pirates might make slick viewing in family adventure films (a la Walt Disney) but in games like this, where people play in their own private world, they just don't roll like they ought to.","June 12, 2014","false","54.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The backdrop is nonetheless equally epic (you could interpret all this as the events taking place in a different part of the world of Gothic, somehwat later), and you still get to make significant choices which  influence gameplay based around factions selection. FInally, there are memorable characters with whom you will share many sarcastic conversations.\n\nTwo playthroughs are advised, you'll see why!\n\nNB: Some reviewers have complained about the combat system taking a while to get into the flow, and this is understandable. This is partly a Gothic legacy, and partly a reflection of modern RPGs where too many of what should be basic moves are only unlocked gradually throughout the game - presumably because players are otherwise assumed to be bored too easily. The difference is, here it is up to you how urgently you address the matter. If you like fencing, then you need to work on it. This is one of the reasons I suggested two playthroughs. In one, focus on muskets and thievery/exploration and side with the inquisition you begin with. In the other, side with the ... um, other guys, and focus on their special voodoo secret sauce and swordplay.","July 8, 2014","true","112.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This can get very repetetive and boring after a while.\n2.

I enjoyed it about the same as Gothic 2 but with an ease of use not found in the Gothic games.  The controls have improved IMMENSELY since Gothic 1&2 and combat is more intriguing compared to Risen.  The story isn't the most engaging, but it is fun, including a few surprise moments.  The voice acting is good, but accompanying hand movements can be silly and repetitive.    I encountered some minor graphical glitches (swords not being in NPC's hands, for instance) but no major crashes.  The environmental graphics were quite a bit better than I expected.  The characters and their animations seem to be a slight step up from Risen.  The HUD is unobtrusive and allows for some sense of immersion.\n\nNow, I am comparing it to Risen and Gothic 1&2 because of the setting, protaganist and system.  It is not an action RPG.  It is not Diablo, Skyrim  Choices can matter to how the quests resolve and the story progesses.  There is action and prompts for traps.  Combat isn't the easiest, either to use or to survive against the monsters until a few tricks are learned.  All in all, I recommend the game if you like RPGs or wish to try one.","January 28, 2014","true","36.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It takes place a couple of years after Risen 1.  It was kinda wierd to go from a heavy medieval theme in Risen 1 to a heavy pirate theme in Risen 2, but I kind of liked it.\n\nMy biggest problem in the first installment was the combat and the sticky focusing.  Sticky focus is gone, and it makes a HUGE difference in gameplay for PC users.  It's much easier to control and maneuver your character once you get used to it.  Dodge roll is your friend and incredibly powerful in it's defensive capability.  Once you get the timing and the angles you won't even bother with parry.\n\nAt first I thought they pulled a 180 and made combat just as difficult as the first one but in a different way.  They took away a lot of the timed attacks and blocking that was notorious in Risen 1, and added what felt like a button mashing system for Risen 2.  Different style, same frustration.  Once you get a bit of Glory (XP) and put a few points into Blades you can get access to riposte and powerful riposte but I never bothered to build it past 6/10.  The real game changer was getting a bit of gear and access to muskets.  This made combat a LOT easier.  Dodge roll then musket shot, repeat.\n\nThere is also the addition of the companion system.  This allows you to take a companion with you for most of the game.  It's a huge help to have mobs focus on another npc or have a pack focus on you while they kill them off 1 by 1.  Overall I'd say this was an improvement in the combat system.\n\nEquipment is a lot better in the sense that, it felt you had a little bit of choice in what you could use, at least more than Risen 1.  I focused on Thief-skill, Musket, and Toughness items but you could just as easily build a more melee centric or voodoo based class.\n\nI feel that they improved the leveling and skill selection system as well.  Killing mobs, completing quests, etc gives you Glory.  Glory is spent to increase your main attributes: Blades, Firearms, Toughness, Cunning, and Voodoo.  Each of these Attributes affects 3 skills.  Talents that give you better abilities, both passive and active can be purchased with gold via trainers IF your main attribute is high enough.  So there's quite a bit of flexibility with character customization.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game.  More so than the original, but mainly because I didn't have to wait until the end of the game for combat to be easier and the addition of the companion system.  Definitely recommend this whether you enjoyed the first Risen or not.  It's a continuation of the first game but it can be played as a stand alone.","August 25, 2014","true","57.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is similar to gothic and some old rpg, which give it added nostalgia value. You may find the combat system lacking, and yes it's not very good, but again it seemed old timey and likable to me. The plot if fun, but again not fanstastic. The whole game is a nice gaming experience\nThe main problems are bugs, and random crashes the game suffers from. They seem more common on the steam platform for some reason, go figure.\nSecondly, the achievments are broken. Badly, and a lot of them. For example to get many badges you'll need to complete objectives in one go e.g. kill 2000 monsters WITHOUT SHUTTING OFF THE GAME. Obviously this is a big problem, and the worst achievment fiasco on steam i have seen since Darksiders 1.\nAll in all, if you have nostalgia for the old times and patience for some sluncky game mechanics and designs and every now and then a glitch or crash, then get the game, it really can be fun if you let it.","May 18, 2014","true","42.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Easily the best graphics i've ever seen in a pirate game.. Puts assasins creed to shame even black flag as far as graphics go.\n\nBut its too shallow.. Not enough depth.. Just find money and get experience from killing monsters. I beat entire game with just a musket.. Upgrading different skills have virtually no effect on the damage either.. Enemies were a joke and i never died a single time due to a boss or enemy.. You can also just open inventory which pauses it and you can take a health potion without any chance of dying.. Its just stupidly easy.  Its nice for scenery and exploration. But thats about it the combat system is basically non existant.

Risen 2 had a lot of potential with the pirate theme but ended up tripping all over itself trying to tie everything in together. the controls are the biggest issue here. They're the worst RPG controls I've ever experienced. Your character moves as if he is locked on a grid and he reacts poorly to the keys most of the time (maybe its just me, I can be wrong here).The combat was disappointing, it had the premise of being a tactical swordplay type of game but ultimately timing is pointless when the enemies have unblockable attacks and are faster than you. What fun is an RPG game if you don't look forward to fighting? That means a good chunk of the game is already unenjoyable and lost due to this poorly designed system. Levelling up is a chore, thousands of gold and glory are required and you're barely rewarded for taking the difficult quests. The characters are flat along with the disappointing story. the loot is barely worth the time with the lack of variety. The graphics are quite outdated and tax low end computers badly despite the quality of the graphics (my low end machine barely gets 30fps with the bad graphics). The writing isn't that good as well, the humor can be funny but most of the time the jokes are shallow. The voice acting isn't exactly good either. Aside from the main characters the npcs sure sound half baked when they talk.\n\nI fear that the Risen franchise may be in too deep to redeem itself with failure after failure. 5/10. The game is painfully average and doesn't give any sense of accomplishment with its quests.","November 9, 2014","false","3.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

If you like playing role playing games (Skyrim, the witcher etc) like me, this is a must have. You have absolute freedom in this game, there are many islands and locations to explore and there are a lot of side-quests and other fun stuff to do. The main story focusses on pirates, but there are a lot of things going on around it. You can recruit people for your ship, buy a monkey etc. The graphics are also stunning, even though at first i had to get used to the slightly different style of the graphics, i now absolutely love it. The detail in the towns and buildings is just incredible. You can play this game hours and hours without having the feeling there is nothing to do, it's incredible!\n\nThere are however also some downsides which could have been better:\n1. The combat is basically the same through the whole game, it comes down to hitting, evading and hitting again with now and then an pistol move which has to be recharged. This can get very repetetive and boring after a while.\n2. There are some glitches in the game, it doesn't ruin the gaming experience but it can be annoying now and then.\n\nIf you have any questions about Risen 2 or you don't know whether the money is worth it, i will gladly answer them or help you in any way!\n","April 24, 2014","true","31.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

This is probably not a good place for newcomers to get introduced to the studio's unique style of RPGs.\n\nRisen 2 could have been so much more. For every step forward from the excellent Risen, there are several steps back. Combat, while functional, is clunkier than it should be and plays like a low rent version of The Witcher 2's combat. Parts of the game seem unfinished—some of the skills, like the promising monkey training and intimidation skills, are poorly implemented into the game. Worse of all, the dialogue and character animations seem like they came out of a game from the 90s.\n\nSo why the recommendation? For all its faults, Risen 2 still manages to capture what makes PB's games so enjoyable. Few developers craft such lush, believable worlds that are fun and rewarding to explore. While there are a ton of quests of varying quality, the game really shines when the player is just exploring new areas, with the danger of coming across enemies more powerful than you.\n\nUnfortunately, technical issues still plague this game. Nvidia users are advised to uninstall any 3D Vision components, as it's been known to mess with framerates. Also, a simple "Anti Warp" mod is needed to fix the awful and emersion-breaking foliage warping problems.","April 1, 2015","true","26.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Easily the best graphics i've ever seen in a pirate game.. Puts assasins creed to shame even black flag as far as graphics go.\n\nBut its too shallow.. Not enough depth..

Enemies were a joke and i never died a single time due to a boss or enemy.. You can also just open inventory which pauses it and you can take a health potion without any chance of dying..

The protagonist of the first part of the series is already faced with the pirates on the island of Faranga. But now, freed Titans create storms, drown ships and sea settlements and claim the lives of hundreds of marine civilians. Here we come, the hero of Faranga, in order to save the day, and destroy the raging Mara the Titan. Our old friends will help us with this, such as the daughter of a famous pirate Captain Steel Beard, Patty.\n\nIn the second part of the trilogy, the protagonist becomes a pirate, in order to enlist the support of the local filibusters and Captain Steel Beard. The plot, as it is stuck at Piranha Bytes, banal. We are looking for treasure using old maps, swim to the islands in search of adventure, drink rum in the port taverns, fire at bottles, general are living a normal life of the average pirate. From untypical for pirates, we are destroying sea monsters created by the Titans, travel to the realm of the dead and looking for artifacts to defeat the villain. The plot - not the main advantage of Risen and Gothic series, it is simple, does not stand out, but sometimes intriguing and exciting.\n\nGraphics became more beautiful, brighter. Beautiful tropical landscapes, ancient ruins and settlements look amazing, the graphics pleases the eye. The visual effects are better, more realistic. The monsters, characters and various wild animals looks wonderful with textures of high quality. In visual terms, it is the same Risen 1, only better. The only thing that looks bad, it's character animation, it is terrible as before.\n\nThe role-playing system has changed. There is no more magic but voodoo witchcraft, but there are guns and pistols. Now, the main character can treat the characters and convince them, he can tame parrots and monkeys and use them to steal items. Now we have many different talents, abilities and skills, their numbers literally dazzled. It's very interesting to develop and put into practice.\n\nIt is fashionable to make games easier for consumers. Risen 2: Dark Waters does not suffer the same fate. The game is very hard, the combat system is no exception, especially in the early stages of the game when we do not even know how to counterattack or use witchcraft and shoot straight with rifles and pistols. Money is not always enough: there is nothing to heal yourself, a weak weapon, nothing to pay for skills training and so on. It difficult to gain experience, and as result we cannot learn all skills in one walkthrough, it is necessary to distribute the experience points wisely, learning only what is necessary.\n\nRisen 2 has so much content to offer, so many side quests, worlds to explore, everything. I have put almost fifty hours into this game, doing all of the side quests, a good amount of grinding and of course the main story. It's very rare these days to find a game this good that gives you that amount of gameplay.\n\nAs a result, we can say that the atmosphere of piracy transferred perfectly, as in visual terms and in terms of the atmosphere. The game is to play it. All will be happy, especially those who love the pirate theme. Yo-ho-ho!","August 29, 2015","true","37.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is similar to gothic and some old rpg, which give it added nostalgia value. You may find the combat system lacking, and yes it's not very good, but again it seemed old timey and likable to me. The plot if fun, but again not fanstastic. The whole game is a nice gaming experience\nThe main problems are bugs, and random crashes the game suffers from. They seem more common on the steam platform for some reason, go figure.\nSecondly, the achievments are broken. Badly, and a lot of them. For example to get many badges you'll need to complete objectives in one go e.g. kill 2000 monsters WITHOUT SHUTTING OFF THE GAME. Obviously this is a big problem, and the worst achievment fiasco on steam i have seen since Darksiders 1.\nAll in all, if you have nostalgia for the old times and patience for some sluncky game mechanics and designs and every now and then a glitch or crash, then get the game, it really can be fun if you let it.","May 18, 2014","true","42.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's NO grinding, you really need to EARN gold and treasure search is interesting and satisfying.\nThe graphics are breathtaking and lots of times I wanted to switch the game to first-person mode.\nThe music by Tilman Sillescu is amazing.

It's such a rare case for videogames in general, you just need to listen it for yourself.\nAs of 2014, there are almost no bugs.

The combat is VERY bad, the skill/XP system is worse and seems mostly half-♥♥♥♥♥ and not thought-out. The quests and the storyline are kind of domb, but not as dumb as literally every main character in the game. The characters have one-liners that they repeat to no end, and it gets annoying.\n\nI have to go back to the combat, because it's legendarily bad. It just queues your actions when another action is in progress,  and it's impossible to stop the queued actions. For example, you press attack three times, you cannot do ANYTHING until you've attacked three times. ANYTHING includes pausing the game, running away, using secondary attack, opening inventory etc. but not using items in your quickbar, which is a relief, because you need all that healing when you can't dodge any attacks.\n\nThe skill system is the weirdest. You have "Glory" which is XP and used to increase your 4 base talents, which increase their 3 or so each sub-talents. The talents are useless if you don't know any skills, which you need GOLD to learn, by paying someone and also having the required talent (and prerequisite skill) levels. The XP amount needed to increase the talents is also half-assedly chosen, just multiply the talent level by 1000.\n\nThe movement is hilarious, Jumping works like if you are put on an invisible conveyor belt that transports you 0.5 meter up and 1 meter forward.\n\nThe thieving system is half-♥♥♥♥♥, you need to learn two skils and then just keep increasing your thievery skill and you can open any lock, if you have a lockpick, that is. You can also pick pockets, but you do this by talking to someone, instead of sneaking up to them. And you can only pickpocket certain characters at certain times. Lockpicking is the least challenging in all the RPG games, you just move the mouse back and forth and it will open, you can't fail.\n\nYou can dig for gold and treasure, the treasure appears as a literal red X on the spot  once you have the map. You need a shovel for digging treasure and a pickaxe for mining gold (there are very few randomly scattered gold veins). You can have many pickaxes and shovels and they are classified under consumables, but they never get consumed, like the lockpick. Seems like they were maybe planning to make them consumable? I don't know.\n\nOne good thing is, that you can skip all dialogue sentences and it makes the horribly stretched-out dialogues more bearable.","April 18","false","23.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

I bought it on sale, so I don't feel too bad about my purchase, but it's a shame that there's a few bugs that just make the game unplayable, in my opinion. I've been looking for a good, open world, pirate RPG for ages, and as of R2:DW, I'm still looking. It's been sitting in my library for months for a reason.\n\nThe bugs in question are mouse sensitivity and combat, and both seem to be the result of a lazy console port. Combat is extremely difficult due to timing oddities. You see your opponent start to move, and you react to him. Good so far, right? Next, he hits you before your character even starts to move. There's some sort of breakdown between user input and character reaction. If I recall correctly, rolling around works fine in combat, so it's really just the dedicated combat controls that offend. The other bug is axis sensitivity. Ohhhh boy. This is the one that put the first and last nail in the coffin for me. It was the first thing I noticed, and the last thing I remember before pressing alt+f4 in a huff. The y-axis is slower than a snail moving up a hill covered in molasses on a hot day, and the x-axis is faster than Sonic the Hedgehog on crack. Just recently, I revisited the problem. The internet says that you need to modify a specific config file to adjust the sensitivity. As far as I can tell, that file doesn't exist in the Steam version of the game. The only one we have is a template file.\n\nPros? It's pretty, I guess. I like the general atmosphere.\n\nIf not for those two glaring issues, I could probably get far enough into the game to complain about the game's staleness and repetitive nature (which I have not noticed, for obvious reasons.), which everyone else seems to complain about. I might pick it up for a console at some point in the future, but right now, I can't be asked.\n\nBefore we go, here's a little ditty to cheer you up.\n\nYo-ho, ahoy and avast\nBeing a pirate is really badass\nHang a black flag from the end of the mast\nYou are a pirate!","March 25","false","16.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

The battle-system is a nightmare when you fight a group of enemies. However, I do agree with what people say about ''learning new skills in this game is too expensive''\n\nYou should play Risen 2.

This game has the worst fighting system I've ever seen, leveling up is a chore, every skill costs a fortune and your character who is supposed to save the world can barely hold the sword for the first 5 hours of the game and misses every other shot in point blank range. Meanwhile your opponents have unblockable attacks, do not stop their animations even when get hit even though that applies to you. A flask of grog to the one who wins any swordfight in the early game in other way than by rolling around the enemy like an idiot and shooting them with the pistol. You have to pay 1000 gold to LEARN HOW TO KICK. FFS.

Instead of mages we now have Voodoo witches, the natives living on some islands. The bows and crossbows have been removed and instead we have pistols, shotguns and muskets.\n\nThe leveling up has been changed from how it was in the first game. You now earn Glory, which kind of represents your XP. Glory can be used on the character menu to upgrade your stats. There are still trainers who you need to pay to learn spesific skills like smithing or how to do a riposte. This was confusing to me at the beginning and it took a while before I figured that I can buy skills, but need specific stat level to do so.\n\nThe graphics are rather good and modern looking, but sometimes there would be glitches where while walking towards a tree, you'd see its leaves becoming smaller as you got closer, until they were the right size. The menu screen has been changed so that you can easily access all the info you need from any selection you're looking at. This also makes the game look a bit clumsy at the beginning, if you start right away from the first game, since it is completely different.\n\nThe game itself is much more bug free than its predecessor, but sometimes you'd encounter minor bugs that don't harm playability.\n\nFights are still rather difficult and you'll be using quick save a lot. During my 20 or so gameplay hours I saved over 2200 times (Which was a tad too much than needed, but better save than sorry). This is also my biggest complain about the game. Using quick save creates a completely new save and doesn't overwrite the older one. This means that I had over 2200 save files at the end and the game started to load longer. Easily fixable by removing the older saves though.\n\nOverally a great game after you get used to the new mechanics, but a lot less fantasy like when compared to the first game. If you like pirate stuff and RPG's, then this is the game for you.","September 11, 2015","true","20.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","4"

The pop-in is unbearable (at highest settings mind you). Walking 5 meters from a tree makes half of it's leaves dissapear, textures flicker in the distance, and lighting bug out _everywhere_.\n\nThe gameplay is even worse, after completing the tutorial you're put out into the "open" world (which from the little I saw in my 20 minutes of trying to get the game to work was not very open at all).\nHere you will HAVE to do "side" fetch and work quests to get money to buy the items REQUIRED TO PROGRESS IN THE GAME, but the game does *NOT* tell you this, not only that, but *GIVES YOU THE OPTION TO DECLINE THE JOBS*.\nI successfully got stuck here because I didn't have enough money to continue and there were no NPCs I could talk to, or any dialogue options to bring back the possibility of getting money. It tells you "Save often" on the loading screen, this most be why.\n\nI came across numerous physics glitches, and the AI seems like they were copy/pasted from another game and not even slightly adapted. They would spin around in circles randomly, have trouble sitting in chairs (walk around them for a good minute and a half first) and have trouble attacking you as well.\n\nThe combat is clunky and floaty at the same time, if you hit an enemy they slide back an unreal distance without even playing an animation, there is only 1 button to attack, no heavy attacks, no other types of attacks.\nYou will spend most of the game pressing one button, and ignoring the "blocking" because it's literally useless.\n\nAlong with that, the framerate, for a game that looks barely on-par at best rarely exceeds 45fps even in the starting area on an R9-270.","March 16, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Also realistic fighting system - with stuns, interruptions, dodges - different tactics against animals/humen/insects/other races. And cool interiors - like laboratory in monastery or the flame sanctuary.\n\nIt seems to me that the devs tried to change features that players who didn't like their games wanted to change, but what their fans loved about Risen 1 is not really there.\n\nYes, you can choose which island you will visit first, graphic is better, the story is still good, but there is no unknown hero  you could customize and you would be curious where it would develop - you play a well known hero who doesn't evolve in anything - he still looks the same, he talks like he knows it all, not even learning voodoo would change him to something more mystic. The islands have still nice natives/cities, but with no gradation - you just do some quests for them and that is all.\n\nMaybe it would be better if they would use the world of Risen but not the old hero - like they did it in Dragon Age - you could meet him, but your new hero would be yours and you could do really free choices.\n\nBut still I would recommend this game - it is still a good game with a pirate theme. The fighting system is a torso of what it was before - so it wouldn't be difficult to learn it probably, but it is not rescripted, so it doesn't work as it could if it would be made new, but otherwise everything else is OK.","December 24, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

From the envirionments to the actual atmosphere of the game-world and its actual inhabitants, the pirating theme here is just extremely well done + the player will get immersed into the game and its world.\n\nAs always with PB's games, the level of interactivity & immersion factor is high; & NPC's run on schedules. There are choices to often make to finish quests differently, as usual.\n\nThe camera is now unlocked, so moving left or right doesn't strafe. The up-side: this makes it easier to battle numerous enemies & swing directly to them. The down-side: to strafe now, you have to hold your Secondary Action key. These control changes do take some time to get used to, if you're used to Risen 1's controls. A key for rolling would've helped, since double-tapping a direction makes your character roll - which can happen accidentally. The feel of the combat itself & its controls do again feel clunky, even though this is par for the course w/ PB RPG's since Gothic 1.\n\nEven despite its few minor issues, Risen 2 is another really good RPG from PB & easy to reccommend.\n\nGrade = B","June 5, 2012","true","46.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Early combat, graphics. story, game design/environment, quests, camera a little bit\n\nStayed the same? Movement, some of the combat (sometimes you can get "attack-locked", meaning a monster keeps attacking you so fast you cant block.. this is very frustrating) as well as the voice acting. The game bugs out as well every now and then.\n\nMade it worse? Picking up items like food is considered stealing and makes guards angry at you even though the food was clearly there on display for visitors to take. what the ♥♥♥♥? Also the low early gold really holds you back and you waste a lot of time going back and forth between camps/bases. Lightning strikes (weather) are more like flashes and don't look good. There is a shortage of food because of having to fight so many enemies with flawed combat.\n\nThis is a early first impression "review". I just want to say that the game is very similar to the first one of the series and the combat/movement and overwhelming enemies thing is still there.\n\n8.5/10 so far, with combat holding it back.

The story isn't mind blowing - but hey, Pirates, Sea Gods, and Colonial might, there's nothing wrong with any of that and it would make for an enjoyable jaunt if only the gameplay held up to allow the story to be told.\n\nCombat is slow and uninspired. I've never found combat in a Gothic game to be particularly good, this just took the cake in terms of rigidity and slowness. It's a bit like Demon Souls with crappy controls (which basically makes the combat).\nReading a few of the other reviews, I guess I responded quite negatively to the combat as you would expect SOME sort of improvement in the combat of this series, but things have not progressed since Gothic 2. Back then there was so much NEW stuff that these games were doing, that you could accept a bit of dodgy combat stuff. But this isn't new. It's prettier, and in a different setting, but there's nothing new here.\n\nToward the end of my session I found myself switching on God mode, purely so I could skip through most of the frustratingly combat stuff and focus on the story and exploration. But after a few hours I thought to myself, "What am I doing? This isn't how the game is supposed to be played". The whole point of this uncompromising style was that there were some places you just weren't supposed to go at the start, but God mode ruins that - even though I wasn't trying to break it, I just couldn't be bothered dealing with the combat system.\n\nSo if I felt inclined to destroy the unique aspect of this series, just so I could run around talking to people and gathering stuff, that basically signals that something is horribly wrong with the balance of this game.\n\nGraphically it's pretty. Story is ok, and the world is actually quite interesting. Kudos for that.\n\nBut I won't be getting back into this series until something changes with the combat. Enough time has passed that this cannot be accepted anymore.","August 2, 2014","false","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And less buggy than Gothic, I only found two glitches that affected game play. Although it's a sequal, it doesn't matter if you've played Risen or not as it is in another part of the world and you don't miss much. World was enjoyable, but backwards - the end of the game was stupidly easy, unlike the first. Unlike Gothic, the world isn't quite as dangerous (shadowbeasts ftw!), but just like Gothic, there's lots to discover and explore.

The pirate theme is a welcome change in this RPG market of nothing but elves & dwarves, the story & characters are much more enjoyable & memorable even though the story is the standard chosen one must rise to save the world & most of the NPC models look the same. Unfortunately the combat while improved still suffers from the same tedium that the original had. Improving skills is also just as annoying as the first, you will never have enough gold & everything costs it even quite a few quests. Still while the Risen series has so far had many an issue the games are still enjoyable enough for me to recommend them.

Movement is a little stiff but one gets used to it. The quests are reasonable, the leveling up is competent. I just wish that they had not fired the QA team after the second of several islands became available.\n\nThat's the only thing that made sense to me. The bugs and inconsistencies in dialogue, the growing graphics stuttering, all this and more grew worse and worse as the game progressed. It got to the point where I was restarting every hour just to keep playing. And that is just one issue, I can think of more off the top of my head. Each of them by themself is a non-breaking issue. You can still play, you can still win (although you may go Huh?) but when you put them all together, well - it's just tiring.\n\nI REALLY wanted this. The premise is first rate, the original was fun if not a little "off" at times, and then it went downhill in the first scene. I still played the stubborn pirate like a stubborn pirate and put up with it until completed. Filled with a sense of accomplishment I went back to mine a few steam achievements - only to discover more quirks preventing further play.

I played for 57 hours to complete (including the DLCs), 45 of which included actual save-point-to-save-point progress through completion.  I like to explore and feel like I hit every corener though, so the game itself could probably be played through in around 30 hours.\n\nAll of the islands have enough unique features to keep the otherwise island-by-island story grind somewhat interesting.  The different player upgrades, character interactions, unlocked islands and so on along the way are all rewarding.  Having one of many companions with you is also a fun feature. The story was interesting and the quest system is handled in a way that kept all of the next (of many) objectives obvious.\n\nFrom owning a ship, to building a crew, locating legendary treasure, and following a story arch to save the pirate-world from a Titan, this game is a solid pirate game.  I liked that it followed a (very different atmosphere'd) Risen 1's story, continuing with the main character, a few side characters, and the same world; while shifting from a dark warrior's temple quest (Risen 1), to a pirate captain's artifact-hunt story (Risen 2).  Defeating a fire titan in #1 and then a water titan in #2 was a nice touch, which left me looking forward to at least two more titans to defeat in the future.... ?\n\nCons:\n-The world, while nicely broken into smaller chunks, was too big for me, as compared to Risen 1.  I hate feeling like I missed a handful of treasures becuase I failed to climb every ridge, check behind every bush and trace every shore.  I finished the game with a few unfinished legendary weapons, which I couldn't all the pieces for.\n\n-I never really felt like combat reached its potential for me.  I went from hacking at weak monsters while wearing weak gear, to hacking at stronger ones with simply better gear.  The combat stayed hard and a bit frustrating throughout, even though I upgraded my melee combat and gear almost completely.  It wasn't overly difficult, just never made me feel like I had awesome gear and awesome skills.  The moves introduced along the way (aside from power attacks), were too hard to know how or when to use, so felt like a waste of the hard-earned booty to train.\n\n-Load times are nuts!  This is a good game for working on art, or playing a phone game on the side, as dying (which can happen easily if careless) results in a good minute or two load time.  Thankfully each island is seamless, inside and out... perhaps the reason the loads take so long?","December 2, 2013","true","56.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Why force us to keep a thumb on the Spacebar?\nIt seems weird that the highest Intimidate check is 90 but the highest Persuasion check is 55-60.\nDialogue aside there seems no reason not to use Verano (musket-wielding NPC).\nMechanics sometimes poorly explained. For instance, you have to hold Left Mouse to stab and do actual damage with a bayonet.\nCutscenes play every time you travel between islands, before and after loading. No option to disable them either.\nAside from Sword Smithing, crafting skills seems kinda useless, especially the voodoo ones.\nI don't get why guns require ammunition. It's cheap, there's no variation and the system just screw you if you forget to buy it.\nMuskets are overpowered, like Rune Magic in Risen 1.\nIf you don't buy the shotgun on Tacarigua combat will be really tedious for a few hours.Conclusion\n\nRisen 2 is a flawed game and doesn't have quite the same atmosphere as the first installment. Nevertheless, aside from wonky melee combat and poor animations, it is quite good and well-made. If you want an open-world game with lots of dialogue and cool guns, give it a try.","June 5, 2015","true","39.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razonix/recommended/40390/","razonix","Razonix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razonix/","604 products in account","I've actually published a long review for this game on another website but I'll try to list the most crucial points here:\n\n\nStory\nAlthough this game is a direct sequel to the first game, it seems like all your previous choices were simply neglected. Despite the fact that the indigent hero saved the world before, he's now working as an employee for the Inquisition and is also an alcoholic. Well, since it's a game about pirates, there's that famous eye-patch cliché (alongside others, such as buried treasures), and the reason for that has to be one of the stupidest ideas I've ever seen. If you've already played the game you'll know what I'm saying. Oh, by the way, Patty is back... Anyway, if in the previous game you've created any positive expectative about her, in Risen 2 just a few moments under her presence is more than enough to make you wanna just shove her into one of the ship's cannons and fire her into oblivion.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay haven't changed much, except perhaps for the possibility of now being able to use firearms, which certainly makes life much easier when compared to the first game. The prices everywhere are still outrageous and the chests of loot that you find lying around are often filled with cheap and useless crap. Besides that, you may now have a companion to assist you during the battles, but the AI is extremely dumb when it comes to follow you, so it's not uncommon to fight several enemies all by yourself while your companion is "making out" with a tree or something. Compared to the first game, the fast travel method has significantly improved too. Ah, the main character's pocket still has the size of the universe!\n\n\nGraphics / Sound\nThe visuals look nice (I really like the day to night transition effects) and the OST isn't that bad either, although it's nothing exceptional. As for the voice acting, somehow they've managed to make it worse than before. For instance, it looks like the main character is a pothead by the way he speaks. As for the other characters, there're moments that are meant to be sad but the acting is so awful that it makes the scene extremely funny.\n\n\nGlitches\nJust like in the first game, this one won't disappoint you when it comes to find these around, not to mention a few random crashes (although they're much less frustrating than on the first game). The weirdest one I've met during my gameplay happened right after I killed one of the bosses. After doing it, when I'd try to jump, I'd keep going higher and higher (I believe I can fly). Ah, it was also really funny to talk to a floating Patty.\n\n\nOverall, while this game brings many improvements compared to the first one, it still has a fair share of flaws (it also happens to be shorter too). To be fair, it's not a masterpiece but it's actually fun if you actually buy it with a nice discount.","September 21, 2015","true","24.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I looked through the reviews here, and it says that around the third hour you'll have amassed enough experience (or fame in this game) and money where you can actually begin to truly experience it.\n\nI'm don't get games to endure a good 3 hours of it in order to see the real meat. I want that presented to me, THEN a barrier or two has me grind through the experience.\n\nAnother complaint I have is the fact that the grinding required to do anything. 1,000 glory to start amassing skill points, even moreso after. You get 52 per monster kill.\n\nIt doesn't require a huge amount of mathematics to determine that you'll be grinding ALL. DAY.\n\nThere are other indie RPG games out there that are able to execute what Risen 2 has been trying to do. Maybe if the game goes on a major sale again, it might be worth it. But spend no more than 5 bucks on it.\n\nMe? I regret doing even that.","March 17","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In fact, I personaly like it much more than first Risen. It has many rough edges, there are visual glitches, few dialog errors (but no game breaking ones), combat is clunky and hard at the start, but that changes with more skills You learn yet it remains challenging.\n\nI liked that opponents had their weakneses which you can take advantage of (for example: you can turn giant crabs on their back with kicking). There are often 2 or more ways to solve a quest. I enjoyed being a thief again as I enjoyed it in good old Gothic: Night of the Raven. Atmosphere is great especially when there is a thunderstorm. Locations are smaller than in previous game, but they feel more... personal, detailed and thought trough and it's fun to just explore (not to mention that it's also rewarding).\n\nStory isn't that breath-taking, it's a classical "have to save the world" story, but I liked it, it goes within the footsteps of Gothic saga. Characters are deeper then in Risen 1 and I found a few memorable ones which is a huge improvement from the previous game, from which I don't remember a single character (except for Patty, which is also accompaniing you in Risen 2).\n\nGraphics are (at least for me) fine looking, sometimes even gorgeous (Storms, Sunrise, Dawn) and are not HW demanding as I could play it even on my old work notebook.\n\nI still didn't finish it after 25+ hours of gameplay, but so far I would give the game 8 out of 10. I can only recommend it for all the other RPG-positive players out there.","March 4, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It has a major choice to make at the start that ends up branching quite significantly so there's a lot of room for replayability. This crashed on me once but with frequent autosaves it wasn't really an issue. The autosaves themselves also track quite far back for quite a number (easily 10+). Same for quick saves.\n\nI used a controller for this as there are only a few times you need to aim unless you want to use guns a lot but even then it's quite forgiving. The few minigames also tone down for the controller, switching back to keyboard/mouse for them doesn't give you an advantage as they then ramp back up difficulty wise.\n\nIt's not necessary to have played the original but there are a few references to it here and there. The story can be completed in any order with a variety of ways to approach quests and solve problems. I found the combat quite difficult initially. I am confused by the low metacritic score. All in all this is a very solid choice for anyone who enjoys RPGs of this setting.","March 18, 2014","true","40.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

RPG's are usually to big to complete properly.\n\nIf you've ever played the Gothic games (except 4) then you actually know how combat and learning skills work in Risen 2 as well. It's pretty much an exact copy. The fights can become tedious and frustrating sometimes, especially with the glitchy/cheaty AI. On the other hand it does feel good when you finally defeat that annoying opponent.\n\nThe game is filled with quests and treasures and exploration is being rewarded. I remember Gothic 3 doing the same thing, meaning; lots of exploration and no(t) (too much) hand holding when doing quests. It gave a sense of immersion.\n\nThe graphics are colorful most of the times and fit the theme well. The whole thing can become glitchy sometimes.\n\nThe voice overs are ok-ish. They're not terribly bad. The writing is at times, though.\n\nI enjoyed Risen 2 a lot, and you can get twice the amount of playtime if you do literally everything.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","June 2, 2012","true","19.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Combat goes from outright insane to ♥♥♥♥ easy and bosring over the game. Other than that, Risen 2 is an awesome game perfectly in line with other works from Piranha Bytes. In fact, I was surprised at how smoothly they managed to integrate a piratey settings with the cloak&dagger, sword&sorcery from Risen (and, previously, Cothic I and II: whose universe is technically unrelated to this one, although it does not really feel so).\n\nOverall, the game is really nice, and has an old-school feeling to it. risen 2 even caters some funny moments and the attempt at a couple of more serious ones (mostly crippled by the voice-acting, otherwise fine). The story is compelling enough and paced well enough to get you playing through all of it, there is certain (however small) degree of "sandbox", and some unexplored potential, but the game plays well and it turns out to be really enjoyable, and just the right length.\n\n8/10\n","November 29, 2013","true","27.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I didn't play the first game, so I wasn't as horribly disappointed like some other fans of the first game.  The animation is cheap, but the dialogue makes up for it and the graphics itself is nice with the tropical environment.  Since blood and violence don't warrant an M rating in my book, the excessive swearing does end up warranting a mature rating as pirates use sailor's language to talking about women's bodies, shagging organisms, and the f-word like it's going out of style.  The side quests were more interesting than the main story, sadly, but side quests are fun to do since you will have to run around town quite a bit or backtrack during the main quest.\n\nGold is key here since combat is hard even on easy mode.  The learning curve is steep because you need to spend gold on learning how to dodge, parry, riposte, and other things.  Yes, you will have to spend a fortune to learn the skills necessary to survive.  Mashing X is going to be hard if you haven't saved money to learn how to dodge, parry, or counter attack.  A frustrating bit about the combat was that it took me a while to realize that going to the inventory to restore my health was a terrible idea, because the MC will have put away his sword and I had to quickly pull it out to guard.  But halfway through the game gets easier as you do a bunch of sidequests that award you glory points (for leveling up attributes) and gold.  Because it costs more and more glory points to level up an attribute (Ex: Level 2=1000, 3=2000, etc), it's wise to figure out what kind of fighting style you want, melee, voodoo, or rifles.  Toughness is important for staying alive and cunning helps to bypass speech checks that would save you the trouble of fighting or getting loot.  A tip is that you don't have to max out the attributes because points can be supplemented with your equipment's passive boosts, unless you want the achievement that comes with it.\n\nOverall, I'd say give this game a chance with low expectations when it goes on sale if you're looking for a lighthearted pirate adventure with some plot twist here and there.","February 19, 2014","true","28.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I didn't play the first game, so I wasn't as horribly disappointed like some other fans of the first game.  The animation is cheap, but the dialogue makes up for it and the graphics itself is nice with the tropical environment.  Since blood and violence don't warrant an M rating in my book, the excessive swearing does end up warranting a mature rating as pirates use sailor's language to talking about women's bodies, shagging organisms, and the f-word like it's going out of style.  The side quests were more interesting than the main story, sadly, but side quests are fun to do since you will have to run around town quite a bit or backtrack during the main quest.\n\nGold is key here since combat is hard even on easy mode.  The learning curve is steep because you need to spend gold on learning how to dodge, parry, riposte, and other things.  Yes, you will have to spend a fortune to learn the skills necessary to survive.  Mashing X is going to be hard if you haven't saved money to learn how to dodge, parry, or counter attack.  A frustrating bit about the combat was that it took me a while to realize that going to the inventory to restore my health was a terrible idea, because the MC will have put away his sword and I had to quickly pull it out to guard.  But halfway through the game gets easier as you do a bunch of sidequests that award you glory points (for leveling up attributes) and gold.  Because it costs more and more glory points to level up an attribute (Ex: Level 2=1000, 3=2000, etc), it's wise to figure out what kind of fighting style you want, melee, voodoo, or rifles.  Toughness is important for staying alive and cunning helps to bypass speech checks that would save you the trouble of fighting or getting loot.  A tip is that you don't have to max out the attributes because points can be supplemented with your equipment's passive boosts, unless you want the achievement that comes with it.\n\nOverall, I'd say give this game a chance with low expectations when it goes on sale if you're looking for a lighthearted pirate adventure with some plot twist here and there.","February 19, 2014","true","28.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'm Guybrush Threepwood and I wanna be a pirate..." Wait a minute... thats the wrong game. Well at least after beating the first part of Risen I found myself on the quest on completing this one playing as  a pirate. The start of the game left me scratch my head a bit, as the story wasn't picking up the pace in comparision with the previous title. After a while (leaving the second island occuping your own ship) the quest to defeat the evil sea godess "Mara" is getting more interesting. In general the flumsy combat system and especially the use of firearms isn't much fun, however after beating a vicious enemy (finally) feels quite compelling. On the bright sight the setting and the companions you get during your "journey" is quite rewarding and the search for "legendary items" is keeping up the motivation (mine at least). In total the title has it's pro's and con's, but looking at my time I spent within this title I can recommend this title for people who like pirates and always wanted to command their own ship, like to use Voodoo magic/Firearms and want to collect treasures and legendary items.","February 26, 2014","true","49.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

However, they made it all Pirates of the Carribean theme, where as before, the game was dark Medieval.  I overlooked the pirate theme, but the combat system I could not.  This is an obvious console tard combat system.  Mash buttons at the right time, but even then, the animations suck and the combat is even harder and dumber than the original game, which I actually liked!  They changed too much of the game and I stopped playing after I completed the first island.  I'm not interested.  This game sucks.\n\nEdit:\nRiften 1 is a go anywhere you want, kill anyone you want type of game.  We call that non-linear.  They mimicked the Gothic play style where you feel out various factions, earn its trust, and annihilate the other faction and complete the story.  Even terrain exploration in Riften 1 is exemplorary because you can climb on roofs and obstacles and really get around obstacles, even if the developer didn't really intend for you to.  Risen 2 essentially locks you into a linear story and traps you on islands and you can't climb or escape the linearity.  I uninstalled it because of this very game mechanic.  I hate prison RPG's that pretend to be sandbox.  They feel like fetch quest games.","June 26, 2015","false","4.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Graphics are barely a step up from Risen 1, but if you have a low-end PC and experienced near zero lag on the first game; you're still likely to get frequent game freezes on this one\n\n- Looting NPCs after beating them up is no longer possible, thus removing plenty of quest alternatives that would have been possible in Risen 1","May 7","false","1.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

A bad quest log.\n\nRisen 2 they butchered everything.\nThe graphics are spoiled by the over use of lens flare.\nThe story basically takes what we know of Risen 1, and tells us it was nothing, meaningless, a dream.\nThe sandboxing is done horribly - you're on a very crappy pair of rails, and good luck trying to move outside of them.\nLast and even worse, the quest system is abominable.\nI didn't think it was possible to make a worse quest log than Risen 1.\nThey managed it in Risen 2.  Indefinate quests, poorly explained, no maps, no dots showing where to sortof head to.\nOh, and the combat system sucks ♥♥♥♥. Humans - crappy knock off of Risen 1 combat. Everything else?  special moves and pins and other BS that you can't deal with.\n\nLastly, open world insta-kill traps. Da fuq? Why would you put insta-kill, invisble, unseeable traps out in the open world?\nIn risen 1, you'll find insta kill traps flagged by cracked and damaged floor, or by vents. You may not notice, but after you reload you'll see it.\nIn risen 2, you're stuck - anytime you walk anywhere in the open world, there's risk of getting insta-killed by a trap.","September 6, 2014","false","7.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wudichao/recommended/40390/","wudichao","谭松韵seven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wudichao/","514 products in account","Risen2: Dark Waters is an open world RPG game based around the theme of pirates. Its the sequeal to the original Risen game developed by Piranha Bytes. Risen 2 was released in early 2012 on the PC and then later released on consoles. Even today, the game is still popular among PC gamers with at least one million people owning the game on Steam alone.\n\nThis is an action RPG where you play in a third-person perspective to explore the world. You complete quests and customize your characters abilities and equipment through leveling up and assigning glory points. This takes RPG games back to their routes, allowing you to customize your character exactly how you want to play with the amount of abilities and talents on display. The combat much like Risen 1 is not exactly a strong point; it seems clunky at times, and you will often find your self dying through no fault of your own other than the strange combat system. You have two weapon slots, a melee weapon and a range weapon. You aren't able to use the range weapon unless you are within melee range of an enemy oddly yet your enemies have almost laser guided aim against you with their spears and guns.\n\nA nice little change I found was the infinite amount of inventory space you have, some will think this removes some of the challenge of the game, but for me I have always found a limited inventory space to be a chore which is not always needed. Obviously this means that currency is never a problem once you reach the latter stages of the game since you are able to just sell everything though.\n\nThe graphics in Risen 2 are certainly an improvement on Risen 1, however there are a few glaring problems I found. The main one being the terrain pop-in throughout the open world. As you are roaming around the jungle, all of a sudden you will quite clearly notice trees and plants suddenly expanding before your very eyes. It's clear this is done to try and reduce the strain on systems for loading the world, but it is done in such an obvious way that sometimes it can ruin the immersion. I also found the game to be very very dark. The day/night circle while adds to the realism, the game is sometimes virtually unplayable in the night hours due to how dark it is. I found myself actually having to turn up the brightness settings at times to keep playing.\n\nWhile the game is completely voice acted, it does have some very bad acting in it; some of the lines which are said are very out of place and just don't fit right. That being said; there are some absolute classics such as "...off, before I put a banana on your c*ck and call for the gorilla" being easily the best line I have heard in a video game.\n\nRisen 2 is a hard game; as you begin your adventure you will die a lot of times due to being under geared and under trained and having no money. A lot of the early quests require you to have certain training in sneaking and lock picking, which all require gold to learn, so the game starts out very slowly. I would say the first three hours are the hardest part of the game due to the speed in which you are able to carry out even the smallest side quests.\n\nThis is a well designed open world game. The world is full of life and plenty of items, weapons, buildings and much more to find. You are able to go mining, or skinning animals as well, which reminded me a lot of the MMO type games.\n\nRisen 2 has so much content to offer, so many side quests, worlds to explore, everything. I have put almost fifty five hours into this game, doing all of the side quests, a good amount of grinding and of course the main story. It's very rare these days to find a game this good that gives you that amount of gameplay.\n\nI had a few little technical issues which were random frame drops in certain areas, as well as long loading times but nothing that can't be overpowered by either using a SSD or a DIMM drive.\n\nDiChao Wu's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play","October 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dpfl/recommended/40390/","Dpfl","sharktemplar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dpfl/","76 products in account","4/10\nThis is below average.\n\nHere are some of the things I ran into with my experience with Risen 2:\nSexist character writing.\nNo, really, the first island you travel to with steelbeard as you hunt down Crow, the guard at the natives camp says something like "You sound like woman. Women talk, men act!" as he chastises you for talking too much after being accused of having hostile intentions as a pirate. He wasn't even written as a villain, just a regular passive-aggressive guard that you cannot kill or interact with beyond this.\n\nBroken Map Markers.\nWhen it came time to duel Slayne, I did not actually know where the blood square was which is where we had to duel. I checked my map, and the red objective marker simply lead me in front of the Admiral's house, when in fact Slayne was waiting for me a ways off to the side instead. This is but one of many examples where the map is flat out broken with some quests like here, and simply nonexistent with others. Another quest had required picking up multiple items, but the objective marker disappeared once you picked up just 1, so if you did not realize there were more to find in that area, and you cannot remember where it was, you wander aimlessly for a very long time, pulling your hair out.\n\nIdiotic Movement Mechanics.\nNo, seriously, there is NO stamina bar, and rolling is by far a quicker means of on-foot travel than simple running. There was no sprint feature, even though npcs had the sprint ability which they occasionally used to catch up to my rolling being faster than their jogging. Why not just give the player that same ability!?\n\nSloppy Level Design.\nMany, many, many many many times did I come across a stone staircase at a temple or tomb that did not actually connect properly with the stone floor at the end of the staircase, allowing players to see massive gaps into the game world void. This also happened a bit with terrain, such as at Garcia's Treasure hiding spot.\n\nLazy Design.\nSo becoming a ghost pirate is just you putting a filter over the player's screen, and changing a few detail models in the exact same environment, huh? Yeah, you disgust me Pirhanna Bytes. Also taking screenshots hard-crash the game to your desktop more than half the time based on how long you have been playing. It's unstable and sloppily coded.\n\nVague/Stupid Quests.\nCertain story-required quests require the player to locate specific npcs to talk to, like normal. However, these npcs do not always show up on the map as an objective marker, and as the npc is only referred to by name, and some game areas have dozens of npcs, it's annoying to have to run around and check every single person's name just to find who you are supposed to talk to to continue the quest.\nEven worse, certain quest objectives themselves are just stupid. A gnome on Isle of Thieves wanted something only defined as "round and black", but there was no map marker to locate it. Again, this is a story-required quest. Round and black made me think bullet, cannon ball, bomb, lead pellet, or black pearl. Seeing as I had a black pearl on me, but no new dialogue showed up, I assumed it was something else. Little did I know, there was a hidden gnome in one of the caves that gave me a "pitch-black pearl". Each cave has only one bed, suggesting there is 1 cave per gnome, and there was already a gnome outside of this cave I had already talked to, which is why I ran all across the island for an hour and a half, checking every nook and cranny for another "round and black thing" instead of going inside.\nAre you serious? He didn't want a black pearl, he wanted a "pitch-black pearl" that can only be gotten from a concealed, non-map-marked npc? Yeah.... No.\n\nThe list of problems do NOT stop there by any means. There are literally over a dozen other topics I could complain about and provide examples to but the review character count does not allow it, just trust me from the above citations from my experience, this is a garbage game that only people with low-standards and an abnormal admiration for RPG games should even bother with. It had a few moments which weren't really played up to their full potential, but even if they were, they would be far too few and far too far between to justify the passionless mistake that is this game. Risen 1 was a bit better, but not by too much. This was just desperate, stupid, rushed, sloppy, and an overall embarrassment of a product, which becomes blatantly clear when the customer really spends the hours to sink their teeth into it only to be greeted with a rancid waste of their time.","August 14, 2015","false","25.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","17"

You start out with a game that looks bad, and you can not really do anything, then just by playing, and making choices, you will find that there is actually a lot that you can do, and your skills just keep getting better.  You actually have to figure out how to use the new skills that you are taught by the various NPC's all on your own. There is no hand holding, though you do get a lot of clues if you pay attention to the NPC's, and what they tell you.\n\nThe first 6 hours or so you will be completely confused, and afraid to do much, but that will change considerably as you reach hour 8, then by 11 hours in you are able to really see the forest, and the trees.\n\nI am 22 hours in, and having a lot of fun.  This is no AC4, but AC4 looks to have taken a lot from this game. The depth of the characters, and the story will keep me playing to the end.  Now I really want Risen 3, with this sort of open play-style, and improved graphics, and power 3 can only be incredible.\n\nJesse of www.Jesse.ca","August 1, 2014","true","52.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its open world with plenty of exploration featuring everything you would expect to see in a fantasy pirate RPG title.\n\nOverall, its an average RPG. If you're into an in-depth story, this game isn't it (an element that is also lacking from the first Risen game). To be honest, I felt like that I was playing a different lead character than to the one that was present in the first installment. Piranha Bytes really needs to focus on tying everything together (like how Bioware does) if they want to taken Risen to the next level.\n\nThe other issue with Risen 2: Dark Waters is the amount of glitches that occur (to the point that its comical) and lastly, well, the combat sucks. It amounts to nothing more than spamming the mouse.\n\nIf you're going to get this game, get it when its on sale.","July 16, 2014","false","54.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went where the guy told me to move. I jumped 2 inches off the ground and managed to land on the left wall. I slipped. I died. Had to start game over again. Yes from the very beginning and listen to the intro again.\n\nI played the first Risen and thought "This is a pretty hard combat system to get used to yet also pretty interesting." and was actually fun to play. I played 1 minute and immediately felt the difference between both games.\n\nI never realized that when the 2nd of a game came out, they thought "Hey! Let's change the movement mechanics!" and was annoyed and could only turn the camera with the mouse which frustrated me for some odd reason and upon opening a chest, I was introduced to a different screen which confused me more and wondered was wrong with the way it was before. Sure these problems seem stupid but  is a bit irritating since I got used to the first Risen and expected some similarities in the way mechanics work.\n\nSo annoyed by the difference in moving and jumping I actually quit out of the sheer annoyance of "Is it really a better game if they changed things to make it more difficult if you have played the first game?" To be honest I liked how jumping while running actually made you go farther, but that is not the case in this game. Being a fan of the last game, I do NOT like even some of the simplest changes that have been made because I just like little conveniences of the last game, which this doesn't.\n\nOh well.

Only the atmosphere (I simply love pirates, voodoo and the old gothic games etc.) will let me try to finish this game.\n--> Do you remember the first versions of Gothic 3 where at least 20% of the skills did not work at all (like all poison perks) and there were at least 30 reasons why the game crashed or had heavy graphic issues? They patched it (especially with those fanpatches), but do not expect *any* of those fixes for Risen 2.\n\nI'll change this rewiew to a "thumbs up" as soon as the game gets some fixes so it would run stable, but let's be honest: it's more likely to accidently stumble (in real life) into a time-annomaly to find yourself in the golden age of piracy ;)\n\n--> get this game in a sale if you want to finish the whole Risen storyline and love pirates, but expect *many* frustrating moments while doing so.\n--> do not buy this game otherwise; try Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag instead if you want a much better open world Pirate game or Gothic 1-3 instead (yes, I'd rather play Gothic 1 than Risen 2 if it wasn't for the pirates (and voodoo); Gothic 2+3 feel much more satisfying than this one; but I finished each of them several times and want to see the Risen 2 ending).","July 17, 2014","false","38.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeah it's true that you don't get to sail your ship as you would in BF but you spend far more of your time doing the other piraty activities that are sorely missin' from the AC game. Duelin', Drinkin', Diggin' up treasure, thevin', gettin' your monkey to do your thevin', chattin' up wenches, blowin' a guys 'ead off with your pistol in mid convo, gettin' your parrot to bug your enemies in combat and enjoyin' hours and hours of piraty conversations with the fine upstandin' gentlemen of the southern isles.\n\nSome have critised this game for lacking the faction choices of the first game and being more linear in it's story tellin', but you can choose which islands you travel to and in which order (once you have your ship) and there's just so much stuff to do and to be gettin' on with you'll never really notice that the story is on rails.\n\n(I will say one other critism which is the end game is buggy as sin so be aware of that before you pick up the game.)","July 15, 2014","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First the worst part of the game: the combat mechanics.  Clunky and frustrating, but can be 'finessed' by levelling up your Blades skill and getting used to the controls.  (It's also much easier once you can bring a companion.)\n\n2.  Boring Game Design:  I understand why game designers want to prevent grinding, but gameplay and atmosphere suffer when there's little to no monster regeneration.  Clear a map and all of a sudden this once dangerous jungle is now...  empty.  Six days later- still empty.  Better game design would've been to regenerate the creatures and lower the amount of experience you get.\n\n3.  Unbalanced Game Design: My favorite part of a RPG is getting your ♥♥♥ kicked at the beginning and slowly becoming stronger- better skills, better armor, etc.  The beginning was hard, exploration was fun, keeping track of locked chests to return to unlock later- great, but pretty early on, I acquired 90% of the equipment that I used for the entire game.  Boring.  Chest after chest and nothing good.  Tons of gold, jade, gems- but you didn't need it.  No skills that you were dying to upgrade.  No equipment to save up for.  Nobody wants to finish a RPG with 10,000,000,000 gold and 99 health potions, but it happens.  There should always be a struggle- especially towards the end.\n\n4.  Damn you, DLC!!!  DLC should be extras- you shouldn't feel like the designers removed part of the full game to make a few extra bucks.  You have all these empty crew slots and it wasn't until the very end that I realized that those slots are for DLC characters.  I'm going towards the big battle, but I still have empty crew slots, so I get excited that there's going to be more.  There's not.  Final battle is stupid easy.  Additional crew isn't necessary.  Better equipment isn't necessary.  Higher skill levels definitely not necessary.  Game designers- It's poor game design to put a hint in the game to visit a location that's only available through DLC.  Eff you.\n\nPROS:\nthat satisfying THUD when you kill a turkey\nTrained Monkeys\nAttack Parrots\nVoodoo Dolls\nTreasure Maps\nAtmosphere\nGeneral Exploration\nLocked Chests\nBrew Alcohol / Potions\nForge Weapons\nBuild Guns\nCreate Amulets & Sceptres\nFoul mouthed gnomes- F**K YES!\n\nIt was fun while it lasted- my disappointment only set in towards the end of the game.\n","July 29, 2014","true","71.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Their games have been plagued from the start with programming issues and frustrating gameplay (like enemies that can just repeat-charge you to death), and yet the stories are consistently engaging, the worlds large and accessible, and the variety of progression rich.\n\nRisen improved SOMEWHAT on the poor combat model of the Gothic franchise and Risen 2 is even more polished.  Taken by itself, it is probably the most beautiful and professional game Piranha Bytes has produced to date (Risen 3 is due out soon) and it's genuinely fun to play.  Skills are extremely varied, from having your own parrot/monkey to do your bidding to various attacks to using guns, rifles and even voodoo; Risen 2 really throws a lot of gameplay options at you and surprisingly doesn't screw up any of them.  My biggest complaint was that if you choose rifles over voodoo there isn't really much in the way of skill progression available, but that's a minor issue.\n\nSo to summarize, the game has pleasing visuals, solid gameplay and an interesting story that will take you to multiple islands and require much exploration and adventure to complete.  If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed: Black Flag for the setting you will likely enjoy this game.","July 22, 2014","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I dont know why it has such a low score. I would give it a solid 85.\n\nYou start off on your own, pathetic at combat, easily killed. It takes a long time to level up. And unlike some games where enemies scale with you... this is one of those games where enemies are what they are from the beginning. Treasure isn't randomized. That powerful sword is in the same place with every run through.\n\nI played the original Risen and I wasn't impressed with it. The world felt empty. There were no major decisions or plot twists. No NPC companions to play with game with.  I would not have recommended it to others. But Risen 2 is a great game that I will play a second time.\n\nPeople who appreciate a good challenging RPG will appreciate this game. It has elements that I really enjoy. For example, travelling companions with unique capabilities, personalities and good voice acting. (Eventually) a homebase where you can store NPCs you don't want to travel with you. The game reminds me a little of Knights of the old Republic in that you have a list of places you need to visit and major tasks to complete, but you don't have to do them in any particular order and there are multiple ways to accomplish many of the tasks.\n\nThings that could have been better: There was no option for controlling your companions gear other than how many health potions they had. The soundtrack was good, but short. During 40 hours, I heard the same songs repeat quite a number times.  The day night pattern was good, but the weather changes were unnatural. The game could have benefitted from more NPC romance dialogues.","August 22, 2014","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start out with a game that looks bad, and you can not really do anything, then just by playing, and making choices, you will find that there is actually a lot that you can do, and your skills just keep getting better.  You actually have to figure out how to use the new skills that you are taught by the various NPC's all on your own. There is no hand holding, though you do get a lot of clues if you pay attention to the NPC's, and what they tell you.\n\nThe first 6 hours or so you will be completely confused, and afraid to do much, but that will change considerably as you reach hour 8, then by 11 hours in you are able to really see the forest, and the trees.\n\nI am 22 hours in, and having a lot of fun.  This is no AC4, but AC4 looks to have taken a lot from this game. The depth of the characters, and the story will keep me playing to the end.

One is patience the early part of the game is slow dull and due to the cool idiea of needing to buy skills to use them unforgiving. Your goal in the start is not going to be one of stop the evil it will be find all the stuff to steal to get money to get skills to steal more to then fight the giants. Second thing you need is to understand that the game is very much story run you are not going to be trown out to see it all from the word go like many games let you do now and if you try you will learn that the great pirate is very crap when dealing with savages and animals. But once it gets going it gets good. get the right skills and learn to manage your stuff and you will have fun. it does well with making you feel like a pirate as you go through.

Give up yer plunder, lest we send ye down tae Davey Jones' lockerrr!\nOver the top pirate language like this contributes to our overall "enough with the pirates already"-attitude and it speaks for Risen 2 to refrain from exactly that. Yes, Risen 2 is essentially about pirates in a Caribbean-like setting, fighting each other with sabres and pistols and sailing the oceans in pursuit of treasure. All of this is more of a setpiece, though, as this game is a sequel to the first Risen, which only featured a handful of pirate-like characters. Being a sequel, Risen 2 does what Risen 1 did, only better. The combat is more refined (though still wonky, more later), the story was expanded and everything looks even better. Considering this is a low-medium budget title, the graphics are gorgeous, with the exception of character models.\n\nRisen 2 is a classic PC RPG, third person and with a healthy balance between action-oriented combat and interactive narratives. Depending on how interested in the story and sidequests you are, you will spend most of your time talking to people. The English VO is, unliike the early Gothics or even Risen 1, not as terrible as it used to be, although you will run into various people with the same voice over and over again. Combat is definitely not one of Risen 2's big strengths, as it ofttimes feels unresponsive and flatout unfair, when fighting against multiple opponents. It turns out some of the fighting-styles just are not very good in this game. My tip would be to stay away from a purely melee-focused build and invest in firearms, throwing weapons or magic. Also be sure to have a companion with you whenever possible, as they make everything a lot easier. Risen 2 does enough to keep you interested, offering a plethora of different skills, including some for forging swords and even firearms, to alchemy and Voodoo, this game's magic. Speaking of Voodoo, at one point in the game you'll have to decide whether to ally with the Inquisition (sort of like colonial marines) or the natives (your standard, dark-skinned indigenous people), which will affect how the rest of your game is played. Not only will you have access to their specific areas of expertise (natives use throwing spears and magic while the Inquisition favours muskets), you will also have different possibilities to tackle some of the quests, with Voodoo clearly being the more entertaining choice as it lets you take over certain characters for a while and speak with their voice.\n\nMy complete playthrough of Risen 2 took me 24 hours in total, with a good amount of exploration and sidequesting, though I did skip a lot of the dialogue (your classic "I'm much faster just reading the subtitles than listening to you"-behaviour). What you can expect of the game is an adventurous experience of once reknown RPG-artisans PiranhaBytes, intendet to be a treat for those who loved Gothic I and II and were sorely disappointed by Gothic III. If you would like to relive some of those days, but do not want to go all the way back to Gothic, I would definitely recommend giving Risen a chance.","July 10, 2013","true","39.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By actually moving the Game to a new Pirate-and-Exploration Themed World was the best thing that could happen, because with Risen 2, the Franchise got its own character. It's NOT Gothic, and that's as it should be. Slight Critisism is due for the unbalanced combat, and the Graphics could easily have been twice as beautiful if they hadn't put so much Focus on Consoles - but it's still pretty. Overall: there were few RPGs I've enjoyed as much as this since Gothic II, which was by all means one of the greatest I've ever played. Ironic that the Piranhas did that exactly by moving away from their biggest hit, but I sure hope they'll continue the franchise, after all, Gothic II got one of the greatest Addons of all times as well.\nA Must-Have for all Role Playing Fans who like to delve into a rich, open world with tons to explore.

When it was over, I wished there was more. I really liked the story, I liked the characters, and I loved the locations. Risen 1, on the other hand, was an ok time waster, but by the time it was over, I was really ready for it to be over (because I had gotten bored).  Get both if you can, but if I had to chose I would definitely recommend this game.\n\nRisen 2 is set in gorgeous island jungles that feel a lot more open they actually are, and there are a good number of islands you get to visit.  Early on you are allowed to fast travel so you don't have to keep running the same paths over and over - and OVER - again (like in Risen 1).\n\nThe pirate aspect of the game is only to get a ship for transport between locations and to hold your crew (you can chose between most of them for traveling/fighting companions when you leave the ship)...there are no sea battles.  It would have been great if there were, but they had no part of the story.\n\nThere's a crafting system is based on the skills you decide to acquire and the recipes you find/pay for...you gather the materials as you play.  Money is really hard to come by in the beginning, frustratingly so...and every skill has to be bought.   I am not really thrilled with the skill system, most of the skills aren't as useful as they should be.  A number of them are really useful once or twice, but then you never need them again.  Others you want to max out as soon as possible...but you don't know which till the end of the game.  (or unless you look at a game guide)\n\nI am also not thrilled with the fighting system.  I ended up hack and slashing despite the fact I was also supposed to be able to parry and riposte...I don't know for sure that I ever managed to...I can't swear that they actually work.  I had the same problem in Risen 1 though.  I was never sure if I was doing it right, so quit trying after a while.  Have lots potions and grog on hand.  I lived and my opponents died though, so in the end it worked out.\n\nThe game has faults but none that ever made me yell at the screen.

I've very much enjoyed Risen 1, and even though many disliked the pirate setting with firearms and voodoo stuff, I didn't mind them at all in Risen 2. It was great fun for me to explore the islands, hunt for loot, I liked the flat dialogs with the even more flat humor. I loved the graphics and the light- and weather effects and didn't mind the clumsy character animations. It's a fun mix of modern role play gaming with pretty old fashioned elements, both in style and execution. I think, all in all the game is just as good as Risen 1 was. For 66 hours I've had a lot of fun playing it, and look forward to playing Risen 3 soon.","May 21, 2015","true","65.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dvk/recommended/40390/","dvk","Dyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dvk/","632 products in account","I feel like Risen 2 is Pirhana Bytes' effort to step away from the Gothic and original Risen formula. Almost everything has been redesigned from the combat system to looting and theivery. Much of it works rather well; PB did away with shields in exchange for a more advanced sword fighting system that, unlike Gothic 3's (and to some extent Risen's), actually works. Bows and crossbows have been replaced by muskets and shotguns which some people claim are overpowered but I think they're actually weaker than the late-game bows in PB's other games and are virtually useless in close combat even with a bayonett. The inclusion of off-hand weapons adds more variety to combat allowing you to fire a pistol to finish someone off, throw sand or salt in their eyes to stun them, or cast a variety of effects with voodoo scepters and dolls.\n\nSpeaking of voodoo... I haven't played with it much but it doesn't seem to be that useful. It allows you to brew potions early in the game but there is no offensive magic in Risen 2 such as fireballs or lightning. It's all supplementary magic to help your melee combat. There are some fun things you can do like take over the body of another person or make everyone run away in terror as you throw spears into their backs, but it's a huge departure from Risen's magic system (there's also no mana).\n\nTheivery has become somewhat of a mini game which makes it a lot more interesting IMO. You actually have to pick locks by moving the tumblers up in different orders which I suppose is just a different visual representation of Risen 1's system. The one thing about theivery I don't like in this game is that you can only pickpocket one item from very few NPC's, you don't get to pick what that item is, and it's never something you need for a quest unless the quest specifically involves pickpocketing that person. It's a good way to get extra gold and ends up paying for itself pretty early on but it isn't useful for anything else.\n\nAnother cool feature is you can train a monkey to run through smaller openings than you could get through and steal items / pull levers for you. This is a lot like Nautilus Transformation from Risen 1 but the monkey can actually interact with the environment and you have to make it come back to you to resume playing as the hero. Oh and your monkey can die. :'( You can also train a parrot to distract enemies but I haven't done that yet.\n\nEnemies in this game are much harder than in Risen or Gothic and until you get the hang of the combat system, you will die. A lot. I remember when I first started I was getting slaughtered by Claw Monkeys and now they aren't even a concern because I know how to dodge and parry better. You will eventually face 9 foot Temple Guardians and Gargoyles that can kill you in 3 or 4 hits and you have no way of blocking their attacks, though (much like Ogres in Risen but in Risen 2 you can't dodge, only tumble away, and when you stop tumbling the enemy is already facing you and advancing again. Kinda useless).\n\nI love everything PB has ever released with or without bugs and design flaws. The world is fun, there's tons of stuff to do, and with Risen 2 they've come a long way with dialogue and plot. Even the voice acting is getting closer to the level of bigger titles like The Elder Scrolls. I can't wait to see what Risen 3 will bring to the series!","September 14, 2014","true","94.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have just 1 basic attack and a parry mode which rarely works. No dodge ability so you have to just mash the attack button. You can get defeated by a random crab or whatever if you're unlucky to be hit constantly just when you want to attack, as it will interrupt your attack. I can't think of a game with worst combat mechanics. Oh and the pistol takes forever to reload (30-60 seconds as I recall, feels like an eternety) and often misses. Played iPhone games with better combat mechanics than this.\n- Terrible, completely terrible voice acting. It's not even synced to the characters.\n- Dialogues aren't that great either, the effort put into the dialogues and voices altogether is no better than on an iPhone game.\n- Story isn't great and the dialogues don't help make it better.\n- The main character jumps very weird. The DEV team should look into other games for how the jump should work.\n\nGraphics are nice, except that the environment looks nicer than the characters...\n\nGot this game in a bundle and still feels like I wasted my money.","September 15, 2014","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Been playing for 26 hours or so, and there's a bit of diversity, plenty of exploration, but, boy does it take time to get skilled up.  I think i paid 14 quid for this, and I'm happy with my purchase. Don't expect an elder scrolls romp, or a assassins creed game though. It's more like Two Worlds Two. Good game, loads to do, loads to explore and steal. Decent loot, and I don't mind the combat system, though I've heard people slag it off. It's basic but it gets the job done. There's a god mode too if you need it. The hero is a bit of a knob head, so you'll most likely skip all the cutscenes to save punching a hole through your screen.

It falls back on the "it's not all about the graphics and material things" theory. The game IS glitchy at times (I haven't experienced any glitches personally, but others I know have), and it feels kind of un-finished, but that doesn't necessarily make it a "bad" game in my books. The gameplay is there, and so is the story. The characters (although corny as some may be) are immersive. I find myself in small areas for hours because of how many lines of dialogue there are whilst having conversations, and how many different treasures/hidden areas can be found. Speaking of the areas, contrary to what most people are saying, the graphics in this game are beautiful (IMO). The different islands and playable areas all have new lighting effects, lore, and flora. It's definitely no Skyrim, but it isn't an eyesore. Overall I give this game an opinion based score of 7/10. I would pick it up when it's on sale, as I do not really see it being worth the $22 price tag.","March 5, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One is patience the early part of the game is slow dull and due to the cool idiea of needing to buy skills to use them unforgiving. Your goal in the start is not going to be one of stop the evil it will be find all the stuff to steal to get money to get skills to steal more to then fight the giants. Second thing you need is to understand that the game is very much story run you are not going to be trown out to see it all from the word go like many games let you do now and if you try you will learn that the great pirate is very crap when dealing with savages and animals. But once it gets going it gets good. get the right skills and learn to manage your stuff and you will have fun. it does well with making you feel like a pirate as you go through.

After playing for several hours the charms begin to reveal themselves, and the game's strengths and addictive qualities really start to shine through. Its weaknesses are fairly obvious from the beggining, and include poor graphics in some areas, particularly with NPC models. Other weaknesses include poor scripting, player-character immersion, and a general feeling of frustration due to unpolished content. There were a lot of great ideas not fully exploited. However, the RPG adventure with the pirate theme, with ships, crew, treasures, and some particularly hilarious gnomes, made this a worthy investment.

It doesn't go any near the grand epicness of games like The Witcher 2 or the like of it, but it certainly has a lot to offer. Be prepared for a regular Piranha Bytes like gameplay, as all that makes the game different from Gothic is the story and the setting. The game is definitely good looking and has some nice tunes to play to, but overall you wouldn't say it's an AAA quality product. In general, it feels like an indie RPG, different from other games (except PB games) and definitely with some fresh ideas and a good plot. Worth a shot, get it now if you simply like a good adventure or wait for a Steam sale if you have a better game in mind. If you spend a good deal exploring and get all the DLC, you'll find yourself in a 30 - 35 hour game with amazing atmosphere and sense of exploration.","June 26, 2013","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Give up yer plunder, lest we send ye down tae Davey Jones' lockerrr!\nOver the top pirate language like this contributes to our overall "enough with the pirates already"-attitude and it speaks for Risen 2 to refrain from exactly that. Yes, Risen 2 is essentially about pirates in a Caribbean-like setting, fighting each other with sabres and pistols and sailing the oceans in pursuit of treasure. All of this is more of a setpiece, though, as this game is a sequel to the first Risen, which only featured a handful of pirate-like characters. Being a sequel, Risen 2 does what Risen 1 did, only better. The combat is more refined (though still wonky, more later), the story was expanded and everything looks even better. Considering this is a low-medium budget title, the graphics are gorgeous, with the exception of character models.\n\nRisen 2 is a classic PC RPG, third person and with a healthy balance between action-oriented combat and interactive narratives. Depending on how interested in the story and sidequests you are, you will spend most of your time talking to people. The English VO is, unliike the early Gothics or even Risen 1, not as terrible as it used to be, although you will run into various people with the same voice over and over again. Combat is definitely not one of Risen 2's big strengths, as it ofttimes feels unresponsive and flatout unfair, when fighting against multiple opponents. It turns out some of the fighting-styles just are not very good in this game. My tip would be to stay away from a purely melee-focused build and invest in firearms, throwing weapons or magic. Also be sure to have a companion with you whenever possible, as they make everything a lot easier. Risen 2 does enough to keep you interested, offering a plethora of different skills, including some for forging swords and even firearms, to alchemy and Voodoo, this game's magic. Speaking of Voodoo, at one point in the game you'll have to decide whether to ally with the Inquisition (sort of like colonial marines) or the natives (your standard, dark-skinned indigenous people), which will affect how the rest of your game is played. Not only will you have access to their specific areas of expertise (natives use throwing spears and magic while the Inquisition favours muskets), you will also have different possibilities to tackle some of the quests, with Voodoo clearly being the more entertaining choice as it lets you take over certain characters for a while and speak with their voice.\n\nMy complete playthrough of Risen 2 took me 24 hours in total, with a good amount of exploration and sidequesting, though I did skip a lot of the dialogue (your classic "I'm much faster just reading the subtitles than listening to you"-behaviour). What you can expect of the game is an adventurous experience of once reknown RPG-artisans PiranhaBytes, intendet to be a treat for those who loved Gothic I and II and were sorely disappointed by Gothic III. If you would like to relive some of those days, but do not want to go all the way back to Gothic, I would definitely recommend giving Risen a chance.","July 10, 2013","true","39.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though the first installment of the past-Gothic franchise was not especially great, it had some great elements and in overall, it benefited mostly from the vibe of the original trilogy of games. However, this does not apply in most parts to the sequel which felt like a cheap stuffing made on a tight budget, where the pirate theme as well as pirate stereotypes did not help. Bad character animation, and relatively short single player campaign filled with rather simplistic quest design did nothing to drag the game out of the mediocre.\n\nSo to keep it short - Risen 2 is a mediocre RPG, which is at parts relatively fun, but does nothing new, inventive or worthwhile.

The combat has improved; albeit, not by much. You are the same exact character as you were in the first game, you don't get much exposition as to what happened in the previous game so hopefully you can do as I did and finish the first Risen before playing this.\nThis sequel to the Gothic successor is another great action RPG for fans of cult-hit games that many people seem to just dislike simply because they only care about AAA titles but seem to buy other games just to rag on them.\n\nSimply put: Risen 2 is the Pirate Action RPG that no one asked for and nobody knew that they wanted. It is a very fun game and I just love allocating my skill points, you don't get XP, you get GLORY! Little things like that, make this game well worth while and a fun experience for Action RPG fans to enjoy. If you're into games that don't look amazing or control super smoothly (IE: Splatterhouse, Venetica, BloodRayne, Way of the Samurai, The Force Unleashed, Of Orcs and Men, etc.) then this is an excellent choice.\n\nPROS:\n+ Great Pirate game\n+ Fun action RPG\n+ Graphics look pretty good\n+ Animations, though clunky, look alright\n+ Good soundtrack\n+ A lot of fun side-quests\n+ Improved combat\n+ Weapon system and equipment are good to use\n+ Easy to learn\n+ That water sure is pretty\n+ A good story worth telling and worth listening to\n\nCONS:\n- Voice acting not so great\n- Combat still kinda clunky\n- Some characters are annoying\n- Sometimes feels a little too linear\n- Frustratingly easy to die at some times\n- Traps can one hit kill you\n- Animations can be clunky\n- So many jagged edged\n- Still no swimming, curse those dangerous waters","October 21, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

See further *** markings below.\n\nAs of being halfway through Risen 2, it is my opinion that while this game does have some minor to moderate issues that affect gameplay, there's still enough meat in the game to keep me playing.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nGraphics performance: this game has optimization issues. By no means do I have a beast machine (3rd gen i7, Intel HD Graphics 4000, 8 GB RAM), but Saints Row IV runs faster for me than this game does; I've not had a moment of smooth movement for ~15 hours of gameplay, and that's on low graphic settings. I usually don't let graphics get in the way of my gaming, but for a 2012 game, I at least expect a decent frame rate if the graphics are going to be sub-par for its era.\n\nCamera and Mouse Sensitivity\nI'm lumping these two together because Risen 2 makes a strange relationship between these two things. First, there is NO mouse sensitivity--your only option for what is a ridiculously high default camera movement speed is to lower that, but you're not out of the woods. Mouse sensitivity is really high for menus, dialogue, and some minigames. The mouse sensitivity is particularly an awful experience when in some minigames, like the shooting range; the only option you have to try and keep your sanity is to lower the game's difficulty to slow everything but your cursor down.\n\nPerspective\nThe player's perspective throughout the game is a touch annoying at times; you can never look up, and trying to line yourself up right to notice items on the ground, on tables, or next to sleeping NPCs that will murder you if you wake them can be an unreasonably frustrating part of this game.\n\n***Combat: This game's combat system is horrible. The game clearly tries to create a complex system for swordplay, but guess what? You won't be needing it, and you won't want to use it, either. Advanced swordplay techniques can't be used on monsters, so there's more than half of the enemies in the game you don't get to use that with, but there's an even bigger reason not to use swordplay: GUNS. Guns are SO OVERPOWERED that once you start, you'll never go back. A half decent rifle and pistol ensures victory over every enemy with a hit-and-run approach. It should not be up to the player to make the game more interesting for themselves--this game fails to make combat interesting.\n\n***Bugs and glitches: And here we are, the reason I came back to edit my review. The bugs and glitches in this game are the worst I've personally experienced. I should not need to worry about a boss disappearing while still holding loot I need. I should not have to use the in-game console to grant myself said item. There are so many little things here and there that are broken that the overall gaming experience drastically declines--you are playing a broken game, and it doesn't feel good after the time this game takes to complete.\n\nStrengths:\n\n***Difficulty: Technical issues aside, this game is actually difficult--until you get access to guns. I will congratulate this game for making difficulty a strength early game, but the game doesn't adapt to the weapons you later get access to--you'll eventually dominate everything because the game does nothing to challenge you further than it does from the start.\n\nCulture and humor: The pirate culture of Risen 2 is really entertaining. While the voice acting isn't always awesome, the content of what you hear usually sticks pretty true to what we think pirates said and did. The humor is also fairly rich for a game that doesn't seem to have the best writers ever; I caught myself laughing a tad uncontrollably once or twice. I'll give the game that much.\n\nFinal say:\nThis is a game that is close to doing many things right but leaves nothing polished. My first pass at this review happened halfway through the game, and now that I've finished it, I can confidently denounce this game.

By actually moving the Game to a new Pirate-and-Exploration Themed World was the best thing that could happen, because with Risen 2, the Franchise got its own character. It's NOT Gothic, and that's as it should be. Slight Critisism is due for the unbalanced combat, and the Graphics could easily have been twice as beautiful if they hadn't put so much Focus on Consoles - but it's still pretty. Overall: there were few RPGs I've enjoyed as much as this since Gothic II, which was by all means one of the greatest I've ever played. Ironic that the Piranhas did that exactly by moving away from their biggest hit, but I sure hope they'll continue the franchise, after all, Gothic II got one of the greatest Addons of all times as well.\nA Must-Have for all Role Playing Fans who like to delve into a rich, open world with tons to explore.

I didn't listen to those reviews saying that this game is bad. I had to play this.\n\nAll i can say is this: this game gave me a hell of a journey. I duelled with pirates, soldiers of the inquisition and native warriors alike. I killed more rats and giant crabs than i can count. I possessed a native and attempted to speak in his native tongue to his peers (albeit very badly). All those hours i've spent into this game, it all leads to a duel with none other than the titan lord, Mara. In the end, i was rewarded with that nice little end game music that made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. It kinda reminds me of Kai's work somehow, from the Gothic series.\n\nSure, the plot might be lacking, the combat system feels more like a button mashing puzzle minigame which mostly relies on timing and the game itself is glitchy, i enjoyed it despite all that. If you're like me and you like the old Gothic series i'd say go ahead and play this game. Do not heed the bad reviews and most definitely do not listen to that silly excuse of a video by AngryJoe. They cant seem to enjoy the little rpg titles like this and Gothic just because the experience is rough in the beginning, if you know what i'm saying. A few flaws wont make this game bad, in my opinion. This title deserves to stand between the 1st Risen and Risen 3, even though it lacks a bit in a few areas.\n\nI guess i'll give it an 7/10\n\nAlso, you can earn glory by killing rats, so that's a 1+","October 28, 2015","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

So I was excited to play this pirate-filled sequel. But any virtues the game might have possessed were overshadowed by my feeling uncomfortable playing it. I couldn't enjoy the roleplaying experience soon after arriving at the Sword Coast, and just put the game down.\n\nIf they were going for a level of social authenticity with the rampant racism, they definitely nailed it. Unfortunately I can't enjoy a roleplaying game where the protagonists are violently racist.\n\nThe first instance that really surprised me was when you meet the governor of Tacarigua, an obviously corrupt and shady character. He requests you to bring him the heads of some escaped slaves. His character is further proven as he regards them as completely sub-human when you express doubt about his goals. "Oh boy!" I thought, "I can't wait to side with these natives against this horrible governor!" But no, not an option. This side quest has only one possible outcome: murder the escaped slaves for the governor.\n\nThat was just one optional side-quest though, and I was enjoying the game play and other quests well enough, so I continued on with optimism that I could still be a good guy. Until the Sword Coast.\n\nWhere we encountered some natives who'd allied with Crow's men. Not an optional part of the plot. And I don't expect every colored person in this white-dominated game to be a good guy, so natives I had to attack wasn't the problem. The problem was with what Patty said. The protagonist says, "What does that mean?" in response to one of the natives speaking a foreign language. To which Patty replies, "It means first we kill the idiot that doesn't speak our language."\n\nI was shocked and disappoitned at the racism coming from a major ally NPC. I realized then that these were protagonists I wasn't going to be able to enjoy playing, and I put the game down. It's a shame, because I enjoyed many other aspects of the game. But I don't recommend it for anyone who might share racial and sociopolitical sensitivities. The protagonists are just not worth rooting for.","December 31, 2015","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In both Risen and Risen 2, you’re rewarded for exploring.  Quite often with actual loot, but in a more general sense with the same feeling you get when visiting a natural landmark or castle for the first time in real life.  I’m not saying the graphics are photorealistic (though Piranha Bytes’ use of lighting and sound does a lot to mask any deficiencies in the objects themselves), but what stands out to me is the world design.  So many game maps seem designed to fit the mission, but in Risen it feels as though a game was laid on top of a pre-existing world that follows natural laws of geology.  From the mountains and caves to the rivers and shores, the terrain feels natural instead of gamey.  I’ve played a lot of games where the design of a particular location was good enough for the memory of a specific location to stick with me -- but in other games I remember an interesting map, whereas in Risen my memory catalogues it as an interesting place.\n\nNo Risen review would be complete without a mention of combat.  Yes, it’s darn tough at the beginning.  I mean really tough.  A pair of wild boars hardly considers you a danger when you first start out.  But if you are patient, make use of your companions, and admit that a low-level adventurer needs to run away sometimes, your power will grow over time to a point where only the most dreadful monsters are challenging.  The magic of this is that you actually get a sense of your character’s increasing talents.  And, unlike some games where a numeric increment is all you get when you level, in Risen you actually get new abilities as well as improving old ones.  By the time the end of the game nears, you’ll smile when you meet up with any pesky boars, and you’ll think, “Only two?”\n\nThe Good:\nWorld design: terrain, light, sound, music.  The world builders are clearly familiar with geology and history.\nExploration is rewarded.\nActual sense of progression as your character gains experience.\nWry sense of humour without being too adolescent.\nWhile the overall story isn’t terribly innovative, there were enough twists to keep it interesting.  The smaller NPC-related arcs were definitely above average.  I also found it interesting that they went for an adult rating solely based on dialogue, and not the more sensationalist paths of gore or nudity.\nUnlimited inventory space!  So nice not to have to micromanage bags.\nTreasure maps!  Who doesn’t like treasure maps?\nThe Bad:\nA number of non-game-breaking bugs, like rain not appearing after loading a previous save, a companion getting stuck on a roof, or an ability not showing up as being learned in your skills display even though your character can perform that action.\nNPCs with short memories: you can steal from them, defeat them in a fight, and a moment later they will still happily trade with you.  Also, some NPCs never sleep.  Really, never.\nSome abilities not explained well.\nSome instances where if you don’t do x before y, you can never do x again.  There was one NPC who was the only one who could train you in certain skills, but after you’ve reached a certain point in the story he won’t train you anymore and just talks about the final boss fight.\nOne clue to treasure that made no sense outside the German version.\n[I feel I should note that my play time, which is only for a single playthrough, is a good deal longer than the minimum required to finish the game.  This is because when I visit a world that is this rich in detail, I don’t make my character run unless there is a reason he would do so in the game, and I don’t use quick travel unless there is a plot reason for it (e.g. magical crystals).  Risen 2 has very generous quick travel, but I preferred walking everywhere to soak in the lush scenery.]","January 14","true","122.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When it was over, I wished there was more. I really liked the story, I liked the characters, and I loved the locations. Risen 1, on the other hand, was an ok time waster, but by the time it was over, I was really ready for it to be over (because I had gotten bored).  Get both if you can, but if I had to chose I would definitely recommend this game.\n\nRisen 2 is set in gorgeous island jungles that feel a lot more open they actually are, and there are a good number of islands you get to visit.  Early on you are allowed to fast travel so you don't have to keep running the same paths over and over - and OVER - again (like in Risen 1).\n\nThe pirate aspect of the game is only to get a ship for transport between locations and to hold your crew (you can chose between most of them for traveling/fighting companions when you leave the ship)...there are no sea battles.  It would have been great if there were, but they had no part of the story.\n\nThere's a crafting system is based on the skills you decide to acquire and the recipes you find/pay for...you gather the materials as you play.  Money is really hard to come by in the beginning, frustratingly so...and every skill has to be bought.   I am not really thrilled with the skill system, most of the skills aren't as useful as they should be.  A number of them are really useful once or twice, but then you never need them again.  Others you want to max out as soon as possible...but you don't know which till the end of the game.  (or unless you look at a game guide)\n\nI am also not thrilled with the fighting system.  I ended up hack and slashing despite the fact I was also supposed to be able to parry and riposte...I don't know for sure that I ever managed to...I can't swear that they actually work.  I had the same problem in Risen 1 though.  I was never sure if I was doing it right, so quit trying after a while.  Have lots potions and grog on hand.  I lived and my opponents died though, so in the end it worked out.\n\nThe game has faults but none that ever made me yell at the screen.  It was quite an enjoyable ride while it lasted.\n\n\n","June 4, 2015","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While there are plenty of locations to explore, treasure to find, NPCs to interact with and enemies to slay, the core gameplay mechanics revolving around combat have taken several steps backwards. Gone is the fluid and intuitive combat that Risen boasted, where a combination of player skill, character stats and gear met that allowed one to tackle the most dangerous enemies in the game from the start if they had the skill and timing to back it up. Melee combat was very much like Gothic 1/2 or Dark Souls 1 in that way. You also had magic and ranged weaponry which were both highly effective if one desired that approach.\n\nRisen 2 does away with skill-based melee combat, featuring stilted, often broken animations and combat reduced to you and your foe hacking away at one another until one dies with a token dodge thrown in here or there. Magic is gutted and beyond worthless, and ranged weapons (guns) are extremely powerful to the point of trivializing the entire game.\n\nThat said, if you're willing to overlook the atrocious downgrade combat has taken and want to see how the story plays out, it's worth a playthrough; but keep your expectations low.\n\nFinal Score - 6.5/10","June 30, 2014","false","36.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love games with immersion and a fascinating storyline. And Risen 2 does a great job at delivering this.\n\nFirst of all the pirates setting of the game is great. It's good to see that the devs have gone away from the magic theme of the first game and made something more interesting (I still like Risen 1 don't get me wrong). Instead of one big island there are now several smaller ones you can head for on your own pirate ship. There also are new weapons like pistols and muskets. Furthermore you can learn voodoo magic from the tribal guys in the jungle, unearth treasures, loot dangerous ruins, drink rum and grog - just pirate things. I love it!\n\nThe graphics and the graphical effects are stunning. It's not to colorful (like Risen 3), not to grey, just right. And especially the creatures look great and realistic because of high resolution sprites. The only graphical letdown are the NPCs: Many of them look alike, their eyes are a bit too glossy and stuff like that.\n\nThe graphical and weather effects as well as the sound effects are doing a great job at adding to the atmosphere. Especially rain and storms are really heavy and atmospheric.\n\nThe main characters are charismatic. Every crew member has their strengths and weaknesses which makes them believable. Voice acting is above average.\n\nBut the combat system is crap and by far the biggest letdown of the game. It's worse than Risen 1's combat system (Risen 3's is even worse!). Ok, it's a Piranha Bytes game but still.. this is awful. But luckily there are companions in this game, so it's playable. Seriously now, it's not that bad if you get used to it. You may need some time but it's well spend, believe me.\n\nConclusion:All Risen and Gothic games have a certain something that makes them so extremly immersive. They are all great in some way but also have severe flaws. Despite the bad combat system, I think Risen 2 is a gem. The setting is great. The atmosphere is great. The story is ok.\n\nBuy the Gold Editon! The DLCs are nice, you won't regret it.","May 21","true","43.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's at least my opinon.\nYou can try to skill yourslef as a blades, marksman, or cunning thieve pirate - that uses dirty tricks - or even a vodoo casting character.\nIt has a great (Pirate) story and inbetween exploring the maps and fighting there is much to do. You can craft various staff, like blades, guns or potions. You can dig up treasure, solve sidequest...lots to do.\nTry to sneak into a house when the owner is asleep and rob him via minigame lockpicking a chest etc. Or even better use your monkey (if you trained that skill) to rob the place. There ar drinking contest or shooting minigames aswell!\n\nGranted its not as good as Risen I but i still enjoy the game.\nAfter hours of playing (i am not even into half the game) there is still plenty of content waiting.\nSo you have to invest some time.\nI especially laughed my ♥♥♥ of when i first met the gnomes on the Isle of the thieves...but i won't spoiler the fun for you :)\nCombat is the only downside it is especially hard to do ripostes. It nevertheless is fun to offhand throw salt into the enemies face, or shoot him with a pistol etc.\n\ni give Risen 2 a 8/10","July 12, 2013","true","48.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the ideas were not bad, dialogues were very interesting, but the hero is very weak, prices too high and there is litterly nothing to do into regions, than to just move along\n\nPros:\n+ Great visual style and original athmosphere\n+ Decent sound\n+ Story and storytelling\n+ Jokes\n+ Very own Parrot and a Monkey :D\n+ Really good but not original leveling up\n+ Guns are great\n+ Gonmes are great too\n\nCons:\n- Very weak hero for more than a half of the game\n- Very slow game tempo, low stamina and running speed\n- No gold coins can be found when they are needed the most (treasure chests 60lvl with 15 gold coins in it?! Seriously!!!)\n- Health regeneration from plants is very slow and not effective with fast playstyle, lots of waiting to continue fight each 2 minutes\n- Voodoo?! Never heared of it\n- Most of achievements are glitchy and if you are crazy about it like me, than this game will kill your nerves (still can remember 2000 monsters killed in a single play without quitting even to the main menu)\n\nI guess this is what players call German RPG, although all the cons, I do recommend this game for RPG fans like me.

It's got intricacies and bugs like none other. Everyone talks like they're speaking sign language. You will complete missions before you are given them. At times, you will breeze through the combat. Other times, you will fire 180 degrees away from the enemies, roll into attacks, and instead of casting or shooting, the character will put down their weapon. Fighting is fun when it works. A lot of the time, it doesn't.\n\nYou are constantly picking flowers, and you can't help but look like a pansy. Cutscenes will skip without your consent. You can beat people up, rob them blind, and STILL they'll help you a few moments later. You recover healh slowly by eating food and quickly by drinking booze or sleeping on a random bed you happen across out in the open in the jungle. Auto-save will happen about once every 5 minutes to 3 hours.\n\nYou spend the whole game searching for amulets to defeat the ultimate evil... but in the end you don't really ever use them. The second to last boss will be unreachable for most of the game, but every 12 seconds will alternate between using the same predictable attack, and opening itself for retaliation... A leviathan monster, the Kraken, capeable of sinking ships.The rest of the time... you wait.\n\nBut, it's all-in-all, a pretty alright RPG. You have the leveling system, unlocking abilities, a choice between two factions, a gaggle of creatures with varying abilities, minigames. It's all nothing new, nothing you haven't seen plenty of times elsewhere. But it was still fun.","May 30","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This might be the first game when PB ( the developers) goes away from the gothic formula. This game has  new mechanics which more or less work...\n\nBut they delete  elements from the first game like shield blocking against animals, magic(replaced by voodoo spells), archery replaced by some guns which  are alright (I quess)\n\n-Voodoo spells are mostly use to make some story missions a lot easier, sometimes in combat but they aren't game changing, kinda a wasted effort but the story bits were cool.\n\n-Hand guns are used like in MMORPGs , click on something and you have a chance to crit/miss. I don't have a big experience with muskets.\n\n-Story-wise the plot from the first game is kinda ♥♥♥♥ed and no one basically gave a damn, there is a wiki page with the backstory from the developers but besides that this game tolds a whole different story. BUT I kinda liked this story more, the dialogues are funnier.\n\n-Combat is ...bad. It's more of the *click click click* thing than the *swing right block swing left advance dodge*. Sometimes you lose without even knowing what you did wrong. There is a block button but it's mediocre at best.\n\nOverall while not a very good I think is something worth your time : especially if you get the chance to get the whole risen pack with like 15$ like I did.\n\n6/10","June 1","true","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just dont feel that the Pirate theme was a good idea and as someone who loved Risen 1 I felt really letdown by this sudden change which I didnt feel was either wanted or required. Secondly I really dont like combat in this game and feel this was the area from the original they should have been focussing on improving rather than the theme, combat just feels clunky and the progression system means in the early game you will suffer but by late game its all a bit to easy. Suffice to say I didnt enjoy fighting which proves to be a significant issue. I also really didnt like how the magic is completely replaced by Voo Doo which doesnt feel like its properly balanced. Lastly I did notice some performance issues whilst playing this game.\n\nIMO Risen 2 and 3 are very average offerings and I would instead recommend playing the original Risen unless you really have a thing for cheesy pirates.","June 6","false","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
