"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ness1228/recommended/438080/","Ness1228","Ness1228","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ness1228/","83 products in account","I'm gonna start by briefly comparing this game to Timberman; if you enjoyed Timberman, you'd probably enjoy this. If you don't know what Timberman is, then continue reading.\n\nPros Gameplay is simple and controlled with 2 buttons\nVery fast-paced\nLots of characters to unlock\nSteam achievements and trading cards\nSupports both local and online multiplayer complete with in-game ranking system\nVarious resolution, texture and fullscreen settings as well as audio volume settings\nCons Game becomes too fast-paced early on; many of the achievements are nigh unfathomable to get without nearly overdosing on caffeine just to compensate for one's human reaction time\nThe soundtrack composed of one song that gets old after a while; fortunately, the in-game volume can be adjusted and/or muted\nDoesn't actually teach you how to surf.\nSurfingers is a game that is controlled entirely by two buttons: the up and down arrow keys (or the W and S keys for up and down if you don't want to and/or can't use the arrow keys). The object of the game is to prevent your surfing character from crashing by moving the terrain he's on (be it water, snow, etc) up and down to keep his path continuous. You gain a point for each 'section' of terrain your character successfully surfs.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the game supports both local and online multiplayer, and also has achievements and trading cards.\n\nEvery rose has its thorn, however; My complaints about this game begin with how fast it is; it feels like I'll be punished for even blinking once whenever I get to the snow area (i.e. zone 2), as the game is moving so fast that it's based purely on lightning reflexes (which quite honestly feels faster than the average human reaction time). To prove my point, Zone 1 ends at around 80 points; as of writing this review, only 12.4% of players (according to global achievement stats) have the "Score 100" achievement (meaning they've made it a little bit into the Snow zone), whereas a measly 2.5% of players have scored 200 (presumably beating the Snow zone). To add insult to injury, the highest scoring achievement is "score 500", which a whopping 1.2% of players have achieved. Another thing is, unlike Timberman, Surfingers has an active multiplayer search function rather than a passive one; If you want to play online multiplayer, you're gonna have to wait for a match rather than be notified after each run in singleplayer when a multiplayer lobby is available.\n\nOverall, the game serves as an excellent timekilling game that shouldn't be taken too seriously.","February 1","true","1.2"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

It's easy to understand, but it gets really bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ once you reach later levels. That being level 2. It's bad.\nThe start is PAINFULLY slow and your surfer's speed accelerates way too fast, as by the time you reach twenty waves, your head will get very dizzy.\nAbout those waves I mentioned earlier, that's the scoring system. The more waves you passed succesfully, the higher the score. However, once you reach a set amount, you'll switch levels, and boy oh boy, the difficuly curve gets ridiculous.\nThe soundtrack consists of 2 songs. Two. You heard right: the menu and the gameplay. That's it. The one on the gameplay side starts off well once you play this the first time, but gets extremely irritating once you have to restart over and over and over again.\nThere are unlockable characters to choose from, all of them locked a score rating OR you could buy them with stars that are somehow scattered within the waves. Most of them are just masochistic to get via the score route, so you'll end up using the stars, which are plentiful if you enjoy playing. Also, some of them are unique, and make the game even harder than it is. yay.\n\nThat concludes it. If you are willing to buy this, here's my tip:\nTurn. That. Piece of sh!t of gameplay song. Off. And put something else.\nIf you are wondering why I have 2 hours invested in this is because I wanted those bloody cards and I tried my best to find something redeemable within this. Nope.\n\nIn the end, spend your money somewhere else and don't buy everything steam coupons give you.","April 20","false","2.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","1"

If you liked Timberman, then you'd like this.  Just timing up/down to keep the water platforms connected.  I got bored after 5 minutes.  Just no incentive to keep going other than to beat your best score.  I would have much preferred if it had some jumps, air time, or let you see a few waves ahead to plan your moves (like tree limbs in timberman), or something to add some thrill.  Or perhaps only having to match up with higher waves to the right, and let him shoot off a wave if higher.  But he just crashes if your wave (platform) is higher than the next.  Seems like some more depth could have been added.  Just way too boring to me.  Timberland was actually slightly more engaging, and had a more active online multiplayer (at this time).","April 17","false","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Very simple with only two buttons and quite challenging as the speed increases. I absolutely reccomend picking this game up, especially for how cheap it is. The multiplayer is super fun, whether onilne with buddies, or locally, it works really well. The only downside to this game in my opinion is the "soundtrack". There is only one song and it gets pretty annoying pretty quickly. Fortunately the game allows you to mute the music. So I would reccomend just putting on your own jams and playing to your hearts content!\n\nPros:\nSuper cheap\nGreat online multiplayer and local multiplayer\nSimplisticly fun\n\nCons:\nOnly one song on repeat","April 16","true","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
