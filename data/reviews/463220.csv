You cannot deactivate the double tap dash, which will occur frequently and always lead to certain death.\n- This game is incompatible with JoyToKey and there is no controller support whatsoever.\n- Level design is pretty dull.\n- Boss battles are uncreative.\n\nIf you can live with those flaws, I guess you can buy the game. I couldn't, however. A platformer without controller support in 2016 is just not okay.","May 12","false","0.4"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","2"

It's a serviceable Metroidvania with a jump-and-shoot mechanic that is reminscent of Mega Man in that you can only have 3 shots on screen at a time.  There are several design decisions I'm not a fan of.  The enemies feel like bullet sponges.  The music restarts everytime you die, and you can die a lot.  Jump is initially mapped to the up arrow (which thankfully can be changed) but prompts still exist in the game that ask you to press up that no longer work, despite being specifically prompted (though the new jump button works).  When you unlock the power dash, you're told to double tap left or right, which doesn't work anywhere near as reliably as I'd like.  If you decided to check the control screen, you'll find this is also mapped to the shift key.  Why the game didn't direct you to this much easier alternative, I have no clue.  The one boss I fought did not feel terribly inspired, it just moved in a giant circle around the room, shooting discs at you.\n\nAll that said, I wouldn't call it a terrible game, it's just that there are many other titles out there that should be able to scratch this itch, if you're so inclined.","May 11","false","0.4"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","25","36","2","0"

Basic exploration and power based style, but that's really all it has going for it. The basic graphics are basic to the point of just being bad, even as retro goes these are just painful.\n\nThere's not much to say for this game. The combat is not good. The jumping and exploration is not good.\n\nWhen you get to the boss of the game, you don't even realize it's the boss of the game. You get an unceremonious victory screen with your time and item completion.\n\nAnd it's short. It's very short. The first time I beat it took me 28 minutes.\n\nIt's not expensive, but honestly, it still wasn't worth it.

Thats worth more than money in my book.  No reason to not play this game now.  Buy it.  Play it.  Love it.\n\n-end of edit #2-\n\nGreat game.  Obviously reminiscent of Megaman.  Music is great.  Love collecting upgrades and exploring.\n\nGET RID OF DOUBLE TAP DASH YOU CLOWNS!!\n\nReasons:\n\n1.  Whoever actually uses double tap dash instead of the designated dash button in ANY game that has such is a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n2.  Maybe my fingers move quicker than the average person, however, when I want to make a very small movement so I can better time my next jump over the wall of spikes that will obviously kill me I DONT WANT TO ♥♥♥♥ING DASH INTO THE SPIKES AND DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH.\n3.  When I want to turn quickly and fire a few shots mid jump, I would like to just turn quickly and fire a few shots mid jump, NOT DASH INTO THE ♥♥♥♥ING BOSS AND DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH.\n\n\nAnyway.  Anyone who loves the Megaman series or even castlevania, or metroid, or all the other great side scrolling shooters, play this game without a doubt for sure.\n\nP.S. Get rid of double tap dash or at least give me an option to turn it off in the menu.  Gosh...\n\n\n\nEDIT:  I wanted to come back after reading other peoples reviews of this game.  We all seem to have the same gripe with the double tap dash, however, MMX is the same way its just that the SNES controller is superior to any peripheral for PC so its not as big of a deal.  I don't think, though, that its a bad game because of that.  it might make it a bit more challenging and forces you to be careful, but hey, one of the achievements is literally called "Be Careful."\n\nDon't say the game is bad and you wouldn't recommend it JUST because you died a lot.  Sorry it doesn't hold your hand and give you soft cushy edges so the spikes don't kill you.\n\n\n\nTLDR; Buy this game and then play this game.","May 14","true","3.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

While the bosses are a bit uncreative, the enemies fits the feel of the game well. You can aquire various powers that are hardly ever useful, but all are conveinent (for example, rapid fire allows you to have more than three bullets on the screen at once, which while unnecessary, is quicker).\n\nMy greatest qualm is the world design. The entire dungeon is pretty steamlined, which gives a false sense of exploration. There is hardly ever more than one path you can take, and even when you can, you find a few rooms and then maybe an extra heart power. I would love to see the dungeon expanded upon so that multiple branching routes exist.\n\nI'd give it a 7/10, would recommend, and at a dollar, highly recommend it. You'll get an hour of entertainment if you only play through once, which is much better than most other things you can buy with a dollar.","May 12","true","1.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
