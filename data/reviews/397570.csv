He said:" Wany!! there is this new developer made his first new game! Try it out!!" I was like.. what the heck... any games that increase my game collection count would be fine! So I did just that.\n\nOne week later the review count for this game was still kinda low but the rating of the game stayed 90% postive after 32 people reviewed...\n\nWell.. I better play and try this...\n\nFirst impression.. What is this!!.. you are a white dot travel in black space and shoot black dots hidden in shadow? At least music is great!!\n\nSecond impression.. Hmm this is a bit harder then i throught.. Being a TouHou veteren it's nothing that i couldn't handle...\n\nThird impression ...Wow.. speed is increasing.. and enemy is going getting more massive... Hmm beat all boss achievements already? Well.. at least it's still keep getting harder....\n\nFourth impression.. okkiee.. this is getting much more insane and crazy to stay alive... Darn it I died and lost all my power.. Darn it again.. IT's like impossible to recover at this stage without my power.. And I am dead again!! And Again!! Grr... Last life!.. Bosss? no.. Dead...\n\nThus end my first try at this game..\nRank 28 on Normal .. beats all my friends that tried this.. CatzZz rank 45, dkny rank 182.... Cool...\n\nSince I unlocked a few new weapon.. Let's try this again!!!\n\nSimple Indie Game and i would call it great success!!

One of the special things about this game is that it features 4 player LOCAL co-op(Xbox and Playstation controller fully supported and required for co-op), something that is not often done in video games these days. You can play this game with your buddys on the coach while drinking root beer and eating Oreo's.\n\nBut on to the actual substance of the game.\nYou are a ball of light navigating through the dark with the help of your bullets to light the way and destroy all that goes against you (which is pretty much everything on the screen except for the background). You can get power ups after defeating bosses you encounter. These bosses can be very brutal, from slowing down and speeding up time, to bombarding you with lazers and drowning you with bullets. All while trying to avoid or destroy black blobs that damages/kills you opon touch.\n\nThere are three difficulties: Casual, Normal and Nightmare. These names don't lie. Casual is fairly easy with some practice, Normal is what you would expect and Nightmare is for those who enjoy getting pwned (I know I still say pwn, I'm stuck in 2007). The game also features a leaderboard for each difficulty.\n\nAnd the music in this game is fairly decent. Goes well with the game.\n\nFor the core price of 2$, I personally think this game is worth a checkout.","November 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","24","30","2","3"

However this game is a simplistic space shooter and bullet hell. You fly through dark space and only your shots can light it up. Black bubbles everwhere. Then appear the bosses in a row. Like rotating red and yellow bullet spreading twisters, rotating lasers or bubble spaceworms. One is changing gravity so that all background bubbles come from one side. Tho the game is flat 2D and the powerups are not very useful or there isn't even a decent tutorial the game makes fun for a short while. If you get hit your dot shrinks down to a minimum dot. A nice game mechanic. Achievements just count from normal difficulty up to nightmare. Local coop included, steam leaderboards and a techno loop soundtrack. Nothing special but quite enjoyable.","May 15","true","1.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

I haven't been able to play local-coop yet, but it's a thing I'll have to try, sooner or later.","November 16, 2015","true","5.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"

There isn't very much to say about this game but let's talk about it anyway. You're a ball of light who shoots other balls of various colors. Your character and your bullets produce light allowing you to see through the darkness. The more damage you take the less light you produce making it harder to survive. You get get an attack that recharges over a short cooldown and you pickup powerups which can also be used to assist you. You fight bosses and your objective is to make it as far as you can without losing. That's pretty much all there is to say about Shmadow.\n\nThe Good\nOne of the easiest achievement hunts you'll ever see.\nYou can play through the entire game and refund it if you don't enjoy it due to the game being so short.\nYou don't need a controller to do well (I got every achievement using keyboard and mouse).\nDue to trading cards existing you'll make a large portion of what you spent on the game (if you bought it on sale) back from selling them.\nVery short soundtrack although it's a very fitting song that doesn't get annoying.\nRegardless of how much playtime you get it's still only 2 USD.\nSeveral difficulties/modes.\nReally cool bosses.\nThe Bad\nSuper short playtime (15 ish minutes if you're playing normally and 30-90 minutes if you're achievement hunting depending on how good you are at Shmadow). One playthrough of the game is enough for a player to see every boss along with the majority of the content.\nI like the graphics although I cannot deny that there was very little effort put into them.\nThere's no tutorial although there's a controls section on the main menu.\nYou have to use the powerup to know what it does (they have no titles, just icons) and for a game this short I doubt you want to memorize all of them.\nIf you're poor (and I mean very poor) this game isn't a good choice for you considering the lack of playtime you'll get out of it. If you aren't poor you've got nothing to lose no matter how much playtime you get out of it.","March 25","true","1.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

The game is a side scrolling shoot em up where you are a light mote using your light to fight against the darkness. The game has fog of war, and your mote and your bullets reveal an aura around themselves. As you are damaged your mote gets smaller, the healthier you are the bigger your field of vision.\n\nThe game is very challenging, at no point playing this game did I feel like "well with this power up it's game over"\nPower ups do not last long so you are never over powered. The bosses can be quite troublesome, and the fact that you can't see obsticles until the last moment make the game very punishing. That said, it can be played casually and is very enjoyable, a good little time waster. The fact that the game is very straight forward (I played it the first time without even reading the controls, and I figured everything out as I went) but still has enough content and challenges to keep the most hardcore shmups players engaged.\n\nPros:\n- Smooth, responsive\n- Different\n- nice simple look\n- pleasant background music\n- works on Mac and PC\n- Great price, has cards, achievements, leaderboards\n- no Issues with controler, and was responsive on my macbook keyboard too\n\nCons:\n- Difficult (this may not be a con to some people)\n- Limited soundtrack\n- Somewhat limited menu\n\n7.5/10, a must try for any shmups fan","November 14, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

You illuminate your surroundings with your bullets and with the ball of light that serves essentially as your vessel. Plenty of random blobs of darkness hurtle toward you like asteroids, and will darken, and even blackout the area until destroyed or passed. Occasionally you face bosses, whom will drop various power-ups.\n\nThat’s really all there is to the game, and that’s the trouble with it; I want to like this game, but there’s just not enough to it. The shadow gimmick remind me a bit of Limbo  (though the art isn’t nearly to that caliber), and it’s kinda a neat one, but there’s very little to the gameplay. There’s no levels, or end boss, you just play for a high score; and while that’s not necessarily a bad thing (both the original Geometry Wars and Waves are twin stick shooters that do just that), the gameplay isn’t gripping enough to compel me to aim for a high score. The levels and enemies are randomized, so that at least helps mix up the gameplay a bit, but it’s still not enough.\n\nI want to be able to recommend this game, but I can’t. After playing it for a mere 15 minutes, I’m probably not ever going to touch this one again. It’s not bad per se, so much as it’s not enough. Still, I only paid $0.50 for it, so it’s not like my wallet is hurting from it. But if you need a twin stick shooter, you’re better off buying Geometry Wars 3 instead. It’ll cost you a bit more than this game, but it’s well worth it.","January 3","false","0.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The dots of shadow that are randomly flying around would be fine if the area you could see was not limited.  The area of the screen that you can see them consists of a where you are shooting and an area around you that get smaller and smaller as you loose health.  The other enimies you can always see, but it is hard to deal with them when you cannot see your suroundings.\n\nAnother problem I had with this game is that the controlles did not feel right.  (Although it may just be me)  In a shmup game like this feel is every thing.  When the movement and shooting do not feel right it is hard to enjoy the game as a whole.  (I played with keyboard and mouse and with an xbox controller)\n\nAlthough I do not recomend the game, I do like the music and I think it could be a great game.","December 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sure, with enough training and experience you can make ugly people look attractive and make all of the shame disappear with a few brush strokes. It's a powerful thing. But any random kid using it can make something way cooler. Photoshop is full of fun little tools that can make it look like you know what you're doing when you really don't. That's why you need to pay for it or, you know, just find a free copy somewhere. Just lying around. I found it. So it's mine.\n\n\nAnd it looks like someone else found it too, because they made something pretty dank.\n\n\nIt's a game! One whole game.\n\n\nNice job with the gradient tool, guy. You made some nice circles. Nice going. You did it.\n\n\nThis is... uh... well. It's a game, yeah, but... the title is... well, uh... How do I put this lightly? Ha, that's kind of a pun. Light. Heh. Because the game's name is Shmadow.\n\n\nShmadow. ♥♥♥♥ing Shmadow.\n\n\nShmadow? Really? REALLY now? That's what you're going with? Shmadow? Of all ♥♥♥♥ing titles you're gonna name it like you're naming your Sonic original character? Is this named after your fursona, Shmadow the Shmedgehog? This is by far the stupidest title I've ever seen. If you named the game "Black Ball Assault" we would've gotten the same idea. The idea that you made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and dared to charge real money for it.\n\n\nWell, what is Shmadow exactly? Besides the stupidest sounding word I've heard since "twug", which is apparently short for "Twitter Hug", Shmadow is a little PSchee game on Shteam. Shmadow, according to the developer, is a portmanteau of "shoot-em-up" and "shadow". Because that's what this game is, summed up in a word. Kind of.\n\n\nIt's got the basic building blocks of a shoot-em-up. You move around the screen, aiming your nonstop barrage of white particles around with the mouse to hit all the black things coming at you. Like an interracial porno. The little white circle is you, the good guy. The little black circles are the bad guys, because they're black. You need to stop them from mugging you, or banging your wife. Or voting.\n\n\nYou can acquire power-ups and charge up special attacks to help you take down the bosses that'll randomly appear. They'll be made of a fancier gradient, and shoot bigger balls at you. Very fun sounding, I'm sure. Maybe not so bad for a dollar or two.\n\n\nBut Shmadow plays like a fancy version of Asteroids. Only instead of jagged triangle shapes they're just big black balls. There's no structure, bosses just kinda drop on you randomly and in no particular order. Things are just kinda flying at you from all directions, and your only real purpose is to get points. It's like someone's final project for their Flash class, but they waited until the last minute on the character design and just said "♥♥♥♥ it, we're doing circles".\n\n\n"Inspired by light and shadow", yeah right. "Limbo-inspired graphical style". Sure, buddy. And Shmadow the Smegma is actually a knockoff of Shmonic the Smegma. Totally not original at all. You got it, buddy. Whatever you want us to believe.\n\n\nIt's shmallow and dull. There's not even an interesting hook to the game, unless you think a black background with a white circle as the main character is a totally killer art style. You could easily google "Asteroids" and find a free version of it to play online, which would probably entertain you about as long as this does. I've played better on Flash game websites. I'm not even knocking it for being arcadey, I've played some really fun arcade-style games. It's just not fun to play, it's not shmatisfying at all. If I waved around a flashlight in a dark room for a few minutes I would've had about as much fun as I did playing this game.\n\n\nWhat I find most offensive and off-putting about this game is that the name probably came first, and then the game. I can totally see someone sitting at their desk, thinking of the name "Shmadow" and saying "Oh my God, thish ish the funniesht name I've ever come up with, I better make a game about it right now". Was Shmadow really the best you could come up with? Really? I shudder to think of what names didn't make the cut. Were there worse names? Is it possible to have a worse name than Shmadow?\n\n\nThere's a lot of better things you could do with a dollar and some change. Like use the dollar as a little scoop to scoop the coins into your mouth. At least then you're getting your daily required copper and zinc. Important nutrients for a growing body. And maybe if you're lucky one will get caught in your windpipe and you'll get the rush of choking to death.","January 10","false","3.0"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","45","14","31","14","0"

This game is an exercise in torture: it's a simple mouse and keyboard shooter, but the majority of your enemies are little black dots that you can't actually see until they're half a pixel away from your character. This means that when you try and fight and dodge the real enemies you end up randomly dying. Combine that with your view radius getting smaller if you get hit means that it actually gets harder if you make a mistake.\n\nMaybe I'm weird, but I don't want to play a game just to die from (virtually) invisible enemies every time it starts getting interesting.\n\nPlus the soundtrack is terrible.

There's a lot missing from this game. The major thing is consistency. I feel like a shoot 'em up should have consistency. But in this case, it's all about points and not necessarily getting to level 10 or 20. Aspects of power ups and maybe variety? Not quite sure.\n\nWith all that negativity said and done, I will admit, I had a fair bit of fun.
