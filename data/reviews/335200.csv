First of all, I felt this game was SIGNIFICANTLY better using a controller. Second: I am a huge minesweeper fan. I play it a lot to kill the time and I'm pretty good at it. Also, bought this at -10%.\n\nSo this is like minesweeper. Except you are marking the mines and then killing them whenever you like (if ever: you can complete a 'floor' without clearing and it's basically exactly like minesweeper.\n\nIn the multiplayer (or vs bots) mode: There's like 8 characters. Each one has exactly one special ability. If you've played Puyo Pop: it's sort of like that. You guys are both contesting the same mapand you both want to mark and collect as many mines as possible whilst retaining your combo of selecting mines without clearing or selecting an incorrect tile.\n\nI'll be honest: the story is really bad and very stupid. The AI is not horrible and will sometimes make mistakes (this is good). The art direction is OK. It's an anime-style game. The Dungeon Mode (ie, endless mode) is very fun and I enjoy playing it. It relinquishes the fighting bit and you're basically just playing nearly endless minesweeper.\n\nThe long and short of it is, if you like Puzzle Quest or Puzzle Fighter and games like that: you will like this game most certainly. If you like minesweeper: you will probably like this game. If you like little moe anime girls running around and clicking mines: you will probably like this game. I recommend this game, especially at its tiny and honest pricepoint.","April 17, 2015","true","2.4"," 31 of 31 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","31","31","0","0"

While the setting doesn't exactly execute that well and the story is meh, the puzzle battle element is done well, and is good for local multiplayer games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/335200/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","I am huge fan of the games that come out of Japan. They are strange, innovative, and show a completely different thought process. Especially when it comes to their games. Fruitbat Factory is one of my favorite publishers for these types of games. Bringing us such games as 100% Orange Juice and War of the Human Tanks. All games I have had the pleasure of reviewing. ManaCollect and all the aforementioned titles, have a certain charisma and personality to them that is hard to describe. Simply put they must be experienced. However I will do my best to bring it justice.\n\nFirst off, when you boot up the game, the first thing you are greeted by is the cheery, over the top, cutesy music. The kind we have all learned to love and expect from these types of games. The soundtrack is catchy and poppie. It flows with the gameplay in natural style. There are several tracks to enjoy and for the most part the music is not grating on the ears. The only thing I could've wished for was the ability to choose which track to play. No big deal.\n\nNow again most games from Japan usually like to add a twist to games. 100% Orange Juice is still the strangest card/board game I have ever had the pleasure of playing. ManaCollect takes the concept of Minesweeper, you read right, Minesweeper and adds a heaping of anime, kawaii style. The gameplay is more or less the same as the American version except it's hexagons that are numbered and you must find the "Mana spot" AKA the mine spot. Added to that, is the games versus style combat. You see the mana you collect is turned into points. Points that you can use to hurt your enemy. Hence the more more mana you find the more damage you can inflict.\n\nHowever your opponent is far from helpless. The opponent is collecting mana as much as you are. Running around the battlefield in a mad dash to collect. They can use this mana to attack but also defend themselves, so that all your precious attack mana is wasted and the game continues. Also each of the ten playable characters comes with a unique power, one that can easily give them the advantage if played right. This adds a pretty tactical aspect to ManaCollect. Not only using your powers at the right time but knowing when to attack or defend is crucial. Also being damn good at playing mine....ahem. Collecting mana.\n\nNow the game comes with an assortment of different game modes. All of which are more or less a different variety of the combat versus mode. The Story mode is decent enough and adds some pretty decent AI that can easily dispatch you. I know, I lost many times. Story mode has four chapters total, ranging from easy to chaos. Now if you were to ask me what ManaCollects story was all about, I wouldn't have the foggiest idea. This is kind of typical though. Most games from Japan have a very over the top story. ManaCollect just kinda throws you into the middle of things, with little to no explanation. I feel as if I missed a prologue or some sort of introduction to the world and characters. Alas there isn't one. There also isn't a large visual novel aspect to the game, compared to lets say, War of the Human Tanks. You kinda just are these characters and go!  No questions! Collect mana!\n\nThe visuals of ManaCollect are fair enough. Giving you an over head view to see the action and numbers. Your eyes are usually so focused on the numbers and mana most of the time. I barely noticed the avatars themselves running about the field. One thing that is kind nice to note is that ManaCollect comes in 16:9 resolution. Which is very rare for some games coming from Japan. Other options like rebindable keys, Anti-aliasing, full controller support are all options that are nice to have.\n\nThe game does offer plenty of replay value, including several difficulties dependent on your skill level. The local versus mode does add quite a bit of Mana collecting chaos. I can imagine having a few quick fun rounds with friends, battling it out as we use our powers and plan when to attack, then moving on to another game. I guess the mileage you will get out of ManaCollect all really depends on how much you enjoy Minesweeper.\n\nIn all, I had fun with ManaCollect. I felt though that there was something missing, a gaming Umami, if you will. The usual games I see coming from Fruitbat Factory and Japan in general, all have this unique style to them that makes me smile. ManaCollect needed a bit more of this in my opinion. It's what makes the genre of games unique. Otherwise it's just Minesweeper with an anime skin and versus mode. This "gaming umami" is hard to define. It's not exactly a specific aspect, but just how the game made me feel. I had fun but it was forgettable. If you play these types of games constantly, you may know what I mean. It's fairly priced ($6.99) and you may get a few hours, to a couple of days worth of entertainment out of it.","June 13, 2015","true","5.5"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","24","28","4","0"

Thereâ€™s a sentence I never thought Iâ€™d be saying, but Fruitbatâ€™s latest offering in their crusade to localise the vast, untapped richness of the Orientâ€™s Doujin networks presents exactly that. Youâ€™re still working with a grid that, when you explore it, gives you a numerical prompt about how many mines are in close proximity, except that youâ€™re no longer trying to avoid stepping on a mine. Youâ€™re trying to ferret out mana points and collect them. And youâ€™re no longer just clicking about a grid; youâ€™re running around a hex-based map controlling an adorable anime girl.\n\nItâ€™s kind of like that crazy nightmare I had that night I overdosed on sugarcane vodka and believed the Skifree guy was not devoured by a yeti but torn to shreds by nomadic lolis, except several hours of gameplay tell me this time, itâ€˜s real.

For background, I am not a veteran minesweeper player, and I have played ManaCollect up until I have finished Chapter 4.\n\nI think the biggest infraction is that there's no epilogue from completing the final chapter. We don't even get to know what happened to our heroes. The story may not necessarily be an important part of this game, but an explanation or some lines of text would be nice. After beating the final boss, literally the next thing you see is the final credits. Besides that, difficulty levels scale fast even on the easiest difficulty possible. Folly me for thinking that the game would be kind to players new to minesweeper. The UI could also be done better. There's a bunch of blank space on the video game screen that isn't being used for anything. These spaces could be used to make the maps easier to see or make the map bigger. Also some of the character's special powers block your ability to see the screen.\n\nThe character designs are the best part of the game and the only part of the game I didn't hate.","January 31","false","2.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

(This abbility is very cool, but useless against the computer)\n1 abillity to make your attack 3x stronger. (no comment on this one)\nOn solo mode, the game is not easy. This is a fast phased minesweeper.  You need to have a very good memory and the ability to calculate and think very fast, especially on the higher difficulty settings. (That is, if you are aiming for high scores with combos). The computer, even on the easy settings, can be tough, mainly on bigger boards. (more mines)\n\nIf the action is too fast for you, there is still the dungeon mode, where you need to clear fields with increasing difficulty by yourself. You dont have anyone else on the board, so you can take your time. This is where the game resembles more to the traditional minesweeper, although you still can't see the whole board, but unlike the original, you can mess up once or twice before game over.\n\nControl wise, the game works ok with both keyboard and controller.\n\nAlso the music is great too.\n\nStory is rubish, but no one really cares, came to play a fast phased minesweeper, no to see a drama.\n\nFor its asking price, the game is well worth it.

There's actually a lot more to this game then just playing Minesweeper, especially in the 'Match' modes. My major complaint is that the opponents never miss, even on Normal difficulty.

This game fuses the two in such a manner where it's fun and complex, but not to the point of being incomprehensible to a novice player, such as my father(who has never played Minesweeper, mind you). This game, though simple, is actually quite strategic.\n"Do you attack now, before your opponent has collected any power on this layer? Or do you wait for them to strike, knowing you'll have enough to do a counter-attack afterwards? Do you limit your opponent's movement with a skilll, or will you wait for them to almost achieve a Full Collect and stop them dead in their tracks?"\nThat's what this game is.\nWhile I do love it and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys both Minesweeper(or any classic puzzle game, for that matter) and any tactical battle simulation(generally referred to as RPGs), the majority of people reading this likely will not be a part of this niche audience that I have described. Thus, for the majority, I do not recommend this game.","April 8","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"
