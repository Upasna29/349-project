Nothing here will jar you out of enjoying the game, though there are some quirky animation glitches that give some good laughs.    Gameplay  9  Hands down one of the most intense firefight games I have ever played. If you want to win, you need to be tactical, or you're going to get picked off real fast. The firefights are intensified through audio and visual effects, from the crack of a sniper's bullet, to the hiss of a round passing by your head, to the pings and putters of the bullets hitting the environment around you. The controls are solid, and lend themselves to improve the gamplay (there is lean in this game, use it). With several different game modes to choose from, including playing against AI bots, you're able to have hours of endless fun without getting bored. There is a timer between spawns, but it goes fairly quick, and spectating your friends is entertaining in and of itself.    Story  N/A  You're a soldier in Iraq. That's about as deep as it gets.    Multiplayer  10  The mixture of new gameplay styles (you can't just run and gun here, you'll die), tactics, and some funny glitches on occassion, add up to be one of the most wonderful times I have had playing a game with friends in a long, long time. There are many, many laughs to be had here. If you're into moving tactically, this game is also your ticket to a good time. Even if that's not your thing you'll enjoy this one.\nSome tidbits of my friend's and I playing, for everyone curious (I did not create the video, was merely playing with them at the time): Insurgency Gameplay    Replayability  10  This one will keep you coming back for a long, long time. With free DLC releases containing new content, and the recently boosted community, there are few things to keep you from returning to play another round of Insurgency with your friends.    Overall  9.2/10  I'll be honest, I didn't expect to have such a grand time with Insurgency, but it is easily the most fun I have had with a group of friends in several years. If you're playing this one alone, it's good. But when you're playing it with buddies, it is absolutely grand. A refreshing game in a field of run-and-gun FPS games, demanding you to take your time and not go rambo.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","November 16, 2014","true","45.4"," 3,960 of 4,146 people (96%) found this review helpful 330 people found this review funny","96","960","4","330","71"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhaxavier/recommended/222880/","jhaxavier","Haxavier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhaxavier/","312 products in account","Insurgency is a strange animal - a blend of various ideas characterized by other games like Counter-Strike, Red Orchestra, and the cult classic Firearms mod - that manages to do a very good job at providing a tactical, hardcore shooter experience.\n\nOn paper, Insurgency seems very normal - two teams, the classic push/conquest/objective style game types, and guns. However, that's pretty much all Insurgency has in common with its modern military shooter bretheren. Insurgency is mechanically a very different beast. Let's start with spawns - instead of having reinforcement pools like Battlefield or Red Orchestra, Insurgency uses spawn waves to regulate gameplay flow. It sounds weird, sure, but it works extremely well in practice.\n\nLet's take a basic game mode, Skirmish. Five objective points, conquest style. Each team's closest points to defend are objectives that can be destroyed, which removes them from the map and tightens up the cap order. Each team starts with 2 spawn waves. These spawn waves kick in every 60 seconds or so. Anyone alive by then stays alive, anyone dead by the end of this timer comes back. Every time an objective is captured, another spawn wave is added to the capping team. This means that players are not only incentivized to do objectives in order to extend their own playtime, but it also increases the team's overall effectiveness. It also means that rounds can take a while or be over extremely quickly depending on the degree of teamwork and individual player ability to stay alive.\n\nThe other thing that this game does very well mechanically is its gunfights. In other tactical realism games like Red Orchestra or ARMA, an average engagement is a sniper fest - whoever sees 'em first ends it pretty much instantly. Now don't get me wrong, Insurgency has its share of ingloriously quick deaths and sniping corridors, but an average medium-range gunbattle can often devolve into a stand-up fight involving suppression, repositioning, and grenades, much like a real fight. Part of this is enabled by the fantastic sound design and particle effects - guns are spectacularly loud, a blinding amount of smoke and dust gets kicked up from fully automatic fire, and suppression effects seriously mess with a player's accuracy. Ducking away from a window to have a burst of automatic fire rip up where you were just seconds ago is quite unnerving. Insurgency also seems to be one of the few games that really understands that shooting a real firearm often results in a sort of almost-blindness from the muzzle blast and recoil, which makes attempting to shoot enemies less of a "line-up-and-click" moment and more of "frantically fire in their general direction and hope they don't shoot back". tl;dr: the guns feel realistic and meaty, and getting shot at is freaky.\n\nWith that said, however, I must be clear with you - Insurgency is NOT a game attempting infantry combat simulation like ARMA or Red Orchestra. The accuracy and damage dealt by the game's large selection of weapons is on par with those kinds of games, but this is also a game tuned for balance and fun. There isn't any superflous mechanics like changing the zeroing on your ironsights or wounding (like RO2 does), but it does make thematic concessions, like fully animated fire selector switches. The inventory and loadout system also emphasizes that it's still very much a game . The end of rounds gives your team Supply Points, which you can then use to build your character's weapons kit. You can equip armor to hopefully increase your survivability by a shot or two, attach a 4x scope to your SKS to plink at range with it, or shunt your points into a slow-handling rocket launcher, which is good for objectives and heavy suppression. There is  no grindy metagame progression system like Call of Duty. It's just the loadout and inventory - all based on your team's performance in and out of rounds. Kind of like Counter-Strike!\n\nAs someone who cut their teeth on games like Red Orchestra, I can say this about Insurgency: it is NOT the most hardcore, realistic shooter I've played, but it is most definitely the most FUN I've had with a realistic team-based shooter! For an early access game, they have a very good product released as of this date (12/29/13). I haven't had a single crash yet, it looks amazing, and runs like a dream! They also have quite a selection of maps and well-balanced gameplay to top it all off. If what I've said sounds good at all to you, go on and get this game, even if it isn't on sale. It's worth it.","December 29, 2013","true","310.1"," 1,591 of 1,686 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","591","1","0","32"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bikeintruder/recommended/222880/","Bikeintruder","BikeIntruder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bikeintruder/","193 products in account","One of the best FPS game I have ever played. It's more realistic than Counter Strike, but not as hardcore as Arma. By default, there are no health bars, no ammo indicators, no crosshairs and no kill messages. Kill messages can be toggled on by the server.\n\nEnemies drop quick in this game if you're using AP rounds; usually in 1-2 shots. The 'sniper guns' (M14,FAL, M40A1, Mosin) will kill in one shot with AP ammo, even if the target has heavy armor. All guns will kill with one shot to the head. Most bullets that are able to pass through a wall, will retain enough energy to kill someone in one shot to the head. Guns shoot straight, you don't get an unrealistic spread cone like Counter Strike and shotguns are still lethal long range using slugs. Suppressive fire exists and it's tactical. However, there is no bullet drop at all. Teamwork, heavy armor and being tactical wins the game.\n\nThis game also has a better community and less 12 year olds than most FPS games such as Counter Strike and Call of Duty.\n\nThe best gamemode and the one I play most often is Ambush.\n\nEven though I got this game for 25 cents ($1 for a 4 pack in a humble bundle). It is worth the $15 in its entirety.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","September 17, 2015","true","603.1"," 1,015 of 1,062 people (96%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","96","015","1","83","17"

I am going to keep this straight up what i think about it as a whole with no fluff. Short and sweet.\n\nShould you get it? It depends on what type of fps's you like. Many CS players have fell in love with it because they like the realism and they've grown tired of the arcade feel that most other shooters have. Don't doubt it for a second, this game is hard to pick up on but once you do, you realize how well reflexes really help if you're rushing but don't expect to be 360 no-scoping people because there is almost no chance in hell that that will happen. Those with good aim that are looking down sight as you turn a corner will get you every time so this is a game best played instinctively and safe (just don't be one of those snipers that sit at spawn and let the enemy capture everything). There are few grenade, C4, or launcher spots that few people know of and use at the start of some maps which can be frustrating, so that is why I'm really hoping that much larger maps will be released in the future that are more open and don't feel as constrained/guided (Heights and Buhriz are like that but i still love them). Maps that were easy to spawn camp have been updated heavily to prevent that which is great. The devs are absolutely brilliant at balancing and opening new areas of maps, always on top of it so kudos to them.\n\nCommunity engagement is stronger than i've ever seen it, there was a public playtest of player submitted maps that were voted on in hopes of them being added to the game and the rise of The Digital Gaming League is starting their first official Insurgency competitive season with a multitude of teams signed up.\n\nThe Nightfall update just added so much more to the game, it feels totally different than it used to in every good way possible. Noises are made when crossing though brush and leaning, leaning mechanic feels more 'stiff' (meaning not fluidly unnatural), the night vision is spot on and well-balanced, flares look awesome in the night sky, but my only complaint is that the running animations with weapons look kinda wonky now, i preffered it the way it was before but i won't nit-pick things for the sake of the length of this review. Also the new co-op survival is an amazing idea, i could see myself spending hours on that alone with friends.\n\nI could write a list of 10,000 reasons to get this game but none of that could possibly describe the feeling that it would give you if you were playing it yourself. It needs to be experienced, the feelings it gives never dies and that in itself says something. Kills are rewarding, objectives are highly valued, teamwork is vital. You need this game in your life if you are looking for a realistic shooter!\n\n*12/20/14 edited formatting*\n\nNEW UPDATE! 5/3/16\n\n1,290 hours logged, i just can't seem to get enough. New maps, improvements, feautures, etc. OH and a new Insurgency game is coming out soon hell yea! Community is growing steadily, a lot more Pick Up Games (PUG's) than there used to be when i wrote this review for those interested in competitive. My only wish is for ranked competitive matchmaking to exist instead of the typical unranked.

A solid tactical shooter with a slow pace and punishing time-to-kill where a few bullets will take you down.\n\nInsurgency is Rainbow Six in Iraq with lots of sudden death and PTSD and jumping because you're shot out of nowhere.  It's a game of hide-and-seek with laser sights betraying their owner's position and footsteps betraying your own position.  Imagine if Red Orchestra had a baby with Rainbow Six.  It's got a lot of that in its blood.  In fact, one of the original devs for RO is the guy behind Insurgency.  Now, the hypothetical RainbowOrchestra child was raised by Counter-Strike.  Some round-based game modes and not all of them have respawns without some major coordination.\n\nIt's a tense package where you might go with no kills or a lot, depending on how well you can plan ahead with your teammates because if you don't get the drop on your enemies, you're dead before the bullets leave the chamber.  If you liked the mod, you'll like this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibbleskid/recommended/222880/","kibbleskid","BurntCornFlakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibbleskid/","754 products in account","I started playing Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat many, many years ago as a mod. As soon as I heard they were making a standalone, I bought it without thinking twice. Throughout early access, the developers listened to what the community had to say, and made changes accordingly. I have heard the developers say several times that they 'made it to play it.' This is the best mindset a developer could have, and it shows. Even though the kickstarter for Insurgency failed, the developers managed to keep it alive long enough to enter early access on steam. Their dedication to this game is really amazing.\n\nThe game has a minimal HUD, meaning your screen isn't cluttered up with useless things, such as a minimap. They also implemented a 3D VOIP system that allows you to hear anyone, including the enemy, at a realistic distance. If you decide to talk to a squad member over the radio and an enemy just so happens to be on the other side of a doorway, god bless. It requires a good amount of teamwork and communication in order to win.\n\nThere are a large amount of original game modes. Some of these modes were taken directly from the mod (such as Push), and some are brand new (Ambush). All of the game modes are original, and are mostly based off of capturing points, rather than getting kills.\n\nOne of the main problems I had with Red Orchesta 2 was the super clunky movement controls. This game has very smooth controls, but still manages to keep it medium paced. You will find it necessary to rush a corner sometimes, and other times you may need to wait for the enemy to move up. Running and gunning in this game is very, very hard to do.\n\nWhen Insurgency was released from early access, the developers decided that it was in their best interest to LOWER THE PRICE. Read that sentence again. Usually, games that come out of early access RAISE their prices, but the developers of Insurgency decided to cut the price down and increase the playerbase. If that's not dedicated, I don't know what is.\n\nThis game is easily up there with the $60 games, and you can get it for 15 bucks or less. I have played over 600 hours, and I loved every minute.","August 27, 2013","true","071.1"," 966 of 1,111 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","966","1","0","56"

I laughed. Then, I did what any reasonable person would do. Pulling out a claymore, I screamed ALLAHU AKBAR at the top of my lungs as I sacrificed myself for Allah and wiped his ignorant face off the planet.\n\nActual review:\n\nBoy, did I hate this game when I first got it. Looks like a fast paced shooter, right? I downloaded it, deciding that it would be something new, maybe similar to CS:GO. I enter my first game, and get a sniper. I'm a pretty good AWPer in CS:GO, so why not try sniping. I run out of spawn... hmm... this is weird. The running feels like I'm actually running, the movement is crisp... I was loving the game already! A smile crosses my face as I see someone all the way across the map: a target! Focused, I scoped in. I lined my crosshairs onto his head, and... WHAT THE FUUUUUUUU- My body collapses. I am dead. Who killed me? What the butt just happened? I shake my head. This life will be different. I run outside, and, long story short, die. An hour later, I have killed 3 people, and died... around 50 times.\n\nWhat was I expecting? A fast-paced, 420 blaze it MLG game. What did I get? A slow-paced, gritty, realistic, EXTREMELY TEAMWORK-BASED tactical shooter that makes you think before every action. And to be honest, that's what made the game so much better for me. It's different, it's unique, and it's rewarding. Kills fill you with pride; you realize that you're actually DOING something. The other team doesn't have infinite respawns, so you just contributed to victory. This feeling of being a part of team and capturing points makes this game like no other.\n\nBuy this game, and play it with friends. Your first hour or two will be brutal, and you will die constantly, but once you figure out what you're doing, this truly is amazing.\n\nI know most people aren't going to read the long text I have above, so below I have a pros/cons list... Because that's all people look for in reviews anyways...\n\nPROS:\nVery realistic\nTeamwork-oriented\nExtremely fun with friends\nMods allow you to change your game UI/looks/music\nSeriously, I have the "Murica, F*** YEAH!" music playing at the start of my rounds" and my knife is just a spatula\nRewarding\nUnique, different shooter experience\nIndie devs that listen to their community, and even promote some of the modders\nLots of updates\nMany different maps and game modes\nVery polished for an Early Access\nVery few hackers\n\nCONS:\nbullet drop not possible with Source Engine (not too important, but detracts from realism if they ever add maps large enough for this to matter)\nVery frustrating to get into\nLike seriously... VERY frustrating\nI'm not joking... I still suck HARDCORE at the game, and I've spent quite a few hours in it...\nDefault setting allows you to join empty servers (very insignificant, but a little annoying sometimes)\n\n"Competitive" matchmaking needs LOTS of work; people leave randomly with no punishment, and games are reset without warning. Also, the use of voice chat is not promoted enough; in CSGO, people use voice chat because there is a clear objective that everyone strives for. In Insurgency competitive, people split up at round start to do their own thing, and there doesn't seem to be any sort of actual competitive gameplay happening. Part of this is lack of an actual objective. Sure, you're supposed to capture points, but that's a lot less defined and concrete than in CSGO, where you have to plant/diffuse the bomb. Lack of a clear, defined, INTERESTING objective makes people less inclined to care enough about the game to talk and strategize with each other.\n\nGame has a few bugs here and there, but is EA","May 21, 2015","true","41.6"," 747 of 852 people (88%) found this review helpful 296 people found this review funny","88","747","852","296","20"

The version I bought in August and what I have at December are different. It feels like it's a sequel already: map design, ui, gameplay, sounds - everything evolved and changed in a positive way. And developers are not afraid of hotfixes. That's how you do an Early Access.\n\n*  The sound. If you have good sound card and speakers/headphones setup, you'll hear one of the best gunshots sounds. At Least the best I ever heard. Yes, it's better than War Tapes settings for BF:BC2 or BF3. While it's not yet enabled for all maps, ones like District are just a joy to listen in 5.1.\n\n*  The weapon handling is very well done. It feels like the real thing, it looks like the real thing, it kills. Like the real thing. Attachments are done right too. You don't consider them like an upgrades, they are to change weapon behavior in a special way. Most of the time I'm using the gun in plain ironsight mode because it fit my play style more.\n\n*  Contains 5 different game modes for each map, like Skirmish from the original mod, all classic team deathmatch, Firefight (last team standing), VIP escort and everyone's favorite Push (aka Rush, aka attack-defense).","August 24, 2013","true","184.1"," 502 of 573 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","502","573","0","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyloo_wnv/recommended/222880/","tyloo_wnv","Arthur V","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyloo_wnv/","402 products in account","Insurgency is a HARDCORE FPS at its finest which doesn't follow current FPS trend. The game strips you of most realism shooter mechanics such as a cross hair and simply says hunt or survive. From my point of view it combines all the best features of Counter Strike , Red Orchestra and Arma. This game has a very good sense of realism in that there are no hit indicators to tell you where you've been shot from, it doesn't take many shots to kill - fewer from the neck up - and the only feature that breaks the realism is the small indicators to show you that the person next to you is a teammate, and also where the objectives are. That's it! No radar either, which makes the game even more involving. And friendly fire is always on at any time and it is forgivable. However, I would not recommend this game to people who ONLY like really arcadey shooters like CoD and BF since these two are really casual comparing with Insurgency. But if you really try to explore this game, well I would say you may find much more teamwork and strategies here. What I love the most about this game is how difficult it is, and how it focuses upon tactical play and cooperation with your teammates. I haven’t seen a game like Insurgency for a long time(except for CS:GO), We need more games like Insurgency, and less of the CoD Advanced Bulls**t that we are overwhelmed with nowadays.

It looks like a Ken Burns documentary compared to Call of Duty’s and Battlefield’s more Hollywood approach. For one thing, your screen isn’t filled with information. You have no health bar, no compass, no map, and no aiming reticule. Flashy text doesn’t congratulate you after every kill.Without it, Insurgency looks cleaner and more authentic than its peers, letting you focus on strategy and action instead of keeping track of an enemy’s location on a minimap in the corner of the screen.Insurgency also doesn’t have a lot of the flash you see in modern shooters.At first glance, you’ll want to compare Insurgency to Counter-Strike. Both are competitive, team-based shooters that pit terrorists against counter-terrorist forces, but the two play differently. While you only get one life per a round of Counter-Strike, most game modes in Insurgency permit you to revive your entire team if you complete an objective, like capturing a certain point on the map or destroying a weapon cache.This dynamic provides for some fun comebacks.Insurgency offers roles like demotion, sniper, and recon, but you can’t necessarily be whatever you want. Each match offers a set number of slots for each class. The available loadouts change depending on the map and mode you’re playing. Since Insurgency is so much more realistic than most shooters, it’s also a good deal more complicated and less forgiving.Also, you won’t find any sort of training or single-player mode, so your only option if you want to improve is to jump into some online matches and suffer through some punishment. Insurgency was originally a Source-based mod, but this standalone release still uses the almost 10-year-old game engine. As a result, Insurgency isn’t the most-detailed game, with a lot of textures looking flat and dated. Ultimately, Insurgency is going to win fans for its gameplay. The action is highly competitive and focused.Sure, it doesn’t have the flash that most shooters proudly throw at your face these days, but Insurgency’s quieter, more realistic, and tenser take on modern warfare deserves a look, especially if you’re tired of instant knife kills and exploding buildings.","November 13, 2014","true","15.8"," 284 of 312 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","284","312","14","6"

You take a second to adjust your position, then quickly peek around the corner and unloaded a burst of AK rounds into that barely conceivable shadow of the enemy behind the counter in the dark room.\n\nYou go flank alone, sneak into the next room and see three enemies' back facing you. You swore under your breath that you didn't spend a few points on a suppressor, take a deep breath to stop yourself from panicing out and shooting uncontrollably, then fire a short quick burst into each of their asses before they realize what's happening.\n\nAs you charge toward the bomb site, you literally run into an enemy. Both of you freak out and started blind-fire, your gun start to shake as his bullests thunder by and your vision turns blurry from his muzzle blast, but you get lucky and managed to knock him down before he gets to it first.\n\nYou're sure the sound of that shot came from above that giant rock in front of you. You kneel down, slowly and surely move up the gravel slope, trying to cover every angle in front of you without making any sound. As you climb to the top, you look around carefully and finally see that sniper bellying behind that bush, his giant boots betraying his position. You smirk, switch to your knife and sink the blade deeply into his exposed butt.\n\n=======\n\nThose are all real Insurgency moments I had during the beta. Long time Insurgency player since the original mod, and dare I say that Insurgency is the best infantry combat game out there. It's slightly arcady in the sense that you don't need to learn 25,000 key mappings to do things down to knee-jerking. It's realistic in the sense that your HUD is stripped down to minimal which means, one, you actually have to look hard to tell what you're shooting; two, your view is super clear for you to do so.\n\nInsurgency managed to explain the term "firefight" in the purest form. On smaller, Tactical game modes, you'll see players break into small groups or single out, followed by short gunfights breaking out across the map. On larger, Sustained game modes, it's common to see many players grouping up, taking points, pushing and holding for objectives while exchanging franantic automatic fire.\n\nThose adrenalin rushes.

This makes the pace of alot more rythmic and steady, forcing you to check that corner , make sure the objectives are clear etc.\n\nThis by no means makes your ability to aim  any less important, the game being focused on realism makes weapons with heavy recoil and bright muzzle flashes.\n\nThere is no killing based objective mode in Insurgency, each mode is heavily objective based forcing you to work with your team to capture the objective, each team has a certain ammount of waves that determine the games length, so those more intent on fragging are still aiding the team.\n\nUnfortunately some game modes are fairly boring and some are completely unbalanced for certain sides.\n\nCo-op\nA really big feature of this game, up to 8 people per map can work your way through a series of modes that will test your skill and communication against bots that really do live up to the "Brutal" difficulty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nuh1/recommended/222880/","nuh1","sum1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nuh1/","976 products in account","Wow... just wow. I've been told this game is just a standalone upgrade of the Source Insurgency Mod and I'm very sad face that I missed that gem. Hands down the best infantry game(not too sim not too arcadey) I've ever seen / played. It still runs on the Source engine so you won't be see amazing graphics but the upside is that the source engine can run on a potato so you can still run 200+ fps with ease (in case you want to take advantage of the client speed being slightly faster with higher fps even though your monitor won't render past the 60/120 refresh rate).\n\nInterface wise, It's the closest thing to minimally immersive that I've seen in a shooter. You get the basic UI showing what points are capped, your fire mode on your weapon, and how many magazines you have left (It won't show you current ammo so you have to estimate how much you have fired from the current mag). The weapons you carry will appear in the fade-out box only when you switch weapons like usual. No minimap showing you where the enemies or your teammates are so you have to figure it out for yourself, be it the bullets flying by to clock your enemies position, or calling out through voip to make sure no friendly fire happens when you cross flanks. There is a label on your teammates to give you that little help in deciding who is friendly though if you pay attention (hopefully they will add a server option to disable this).\n\nThe bullet count is even realistic, which so many other shooters try to simplify. The magazines left are just that, magazines. There is no magical extra pouch that you dump the unused rounds to somehow top off the last mag you have, so you have to decide if you want to top off or risk running out of rounds mid firefight, although for some reason you get an absurd amount of spare mags. The mags you replaced without being empty will actually go the bottom of your stash, then when you get to them you end up shooting like 2 rounds then having to switch mags again. Kind of annoying but kind of an awesome way to use up the unspent rounds when you are low on ammo.\n\nNow I'm not a fan of free-aim (where your gun isn't locked in place on the center of the screen) but it fits so perfectly in this kind of game. It isn't overly done like in RO2's full screen free-aim, there is a deadzone that will free-aim, then turn when you reach the edges. It will force you to ADS (also not a fan of in other games) if you need the accuracy, which also isn't ridiculously instant like in other action shooters(visual delay only); and the movement in ADS mode will actually sway instead of snap making OP drag shot a little less potent. The free-aim deadzone is pretty realistic, giving you realistic accuracy, and rewarding you for instinct shooting from high ready. There is also emphasis on crouching in front of teammates so you don't get shot in the back, prone to get better cover, or even feigh death behind cover (there is no kill confirmation). The realism really has a Red Orchestra feel to it but in a modern setting.\n\nThe respawn system really makes you value your life because anyone who dies won't respawn until your team has captured a point or the next wave comes in sustained mode, which also encourages grouping up instead of just running, gunning, and dieing. So the gameplay may seem slow at first because of this but that all changes when you get into a fire-fight. From calling out where enemies are, to staying behind cover and watching bullets wiz past your head. You really feel like you are in the thick of it. The maps are extremely well made, there are multiple places you can fire from (lots of buildings with windows and cover) and encourage teamplay even more with a common tactic being team A advances while team B covers and suppress fire or throw smoke to rush. The maps can feel a bit asymmetrical but this is infantry realism, you are not always going to be on equal terms.\n\nRecommended that you have a mic on the ready because the VOIP is pretty crucial in communication. It's somewhat positional audio so it's easier to tell who is talking just by the direction of the voice; but beware, enemies can hear you too if you are too close to them, positional audio is just that. It will also help when flanking, calling it out so you don't get murdered by your own team when you come around a corner.\n\nAlso, don't expect neglectful devs. The devs for this game are very involved and determined to make this game happen. I've even run into a few devs while playing and constantly responding to forum posts, so it's not like they are going to easily give up on a game they actually play.","December 27, 2013","true","181.2"," 196 of 219 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","196","219","0","2"

I wouldn't believe it is quite as addicting as your typical shooter, but you will be more satisfied, I promise you. And this game would be one of my closest FPS titles to Realism. This game will punish you to an extent where waiting and peaking around a corner can be more satisfying then doing the same old stabby stabby in TF2.

First, if you're coming from BF3/4, the COD franchise, or CS:GO/S, forget everything you've learned about gun fights. Two, or often one, hit will kill you which means you need to use cover, suppression, smoke, and flash to get around. Gun fights are TENSE - this is partly due to the lethality of weapons, but also the suppression mechanic: you can hear the bullets wizzing by your head, your screen blurs, and if you pop your head out at the wrong time - THWACK, and your dead.\n\nMAPS are expertly designed, consistently updated, lots of variety, and new ones are created suprisingly often for such a small developer.\n\nWEAPONS have character and I've found new favourites for given situations even 100 hours into playing. UNLIKE CS:GO where you have to memorize spray and spread patterns for each weapon, Insurgency weapons perform realistically in that, wherever the sights are pointed, THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE BULLET WILL GO - weapons still recoil, but you know exactly where the bullet is headed when it does.\n\nGAME MODES - brilliant. Co-op is awesome, multiplayer modes are relatively diverse and awesome. What's really unique here is the emphasis on teamplay. You really need to coordinate with your team to win certain modes, whether its popping smoke or having someone cover you while you move up. What sets this game apart, other than everything else, is that players work together here - you're not playing with the silent majority on BF4 or COD - people are on their mics, strategizing and celebrating the game - mostly adults too (well, adults who yell "Alloha Snackbar" as terrorists while throwing grenades at American Soldiers, haha). If you get this game, get mic please, you miss out on a lot of the fun and you contribute to making this game less fun for everyone.\n\nFinal Words...\nOne of my favourite games on PC. Kudo's to a great development team who keep this game alive with frequent updates and tourneys. They obviously have a passion for what they do, and it's part of what makes this game great.\n\nIt also happens to have a total conversion mod for my first multiplayer FPS (TPS*) addiction, Socom 1 & 2 ( "Socom: Source" ).","October 21, 2015","true","195.9"," 105 of 110 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","105","110","8","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WoolyM/recommended/222880/","WoolyM","/A\Wooly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WoolyM/","93 products in account","Many of the games at a 60$ price aren't worth that amount. This game is definitely worth MORE than 15. It doesn't matter if it's on sale, you should get this game and tell your friends to get it. Here is why:\n\nI have accumulated over 1,200 hours on this game and have actually founded a competitive insurgency team. It's only fair that I give the game the review it deserves. If you want to know about a lot about the game before you buy it, you're reading the right review.\n\nThe Competitive Scene:\n\nThe competitive scene, while not as big as CSGO, has been mostly developed by the players-many of which have played the game for a long time. These leagues (DGL, ESL, ANZ) spread across every region of the world and have offered regional seasons, tournaments, draft tournaments and even world cups. No matter what region you are from, you can play this game. I've played with guys from South America, America and Canada, Eastern and Western Europe (from the UK to Ukraine), Australia and New Zealand, etc. The game does not boast ten's of thousands of players but the players that play this game in the competitive scene are very dedicated. It is not as hard to learn how to play as it used to be because the game has been allowed to develop and the players have figured out how to play the different maps in general. If you're wondering what "game type" the competitive scene revolves around, it's a game mode with 3 points that you can capture, objectives similar to that of the battlefield genre or starwars battlefront. You own one, they start owning one, and then there is a neutral point. If you cap a point, you bring your whole team back. You start with 5 players and they start with 5 players, you fight to the death to kill the other team, using all sorts of strategies and tactics, but also try to potentially cap a point (or bait a cap) and bring the rest of your team back. Sounds fun as hell, right? It's awesome.\n\nGame Types:\n\nIf you're not a competitive guy, there are a ton of game modes to suite your fancy here. Want to play fast paced with 32 people and respawns? Choose Push. Want a slower paced mode much like the one I described for competitive, but with 16 players instead of 10? Choose firefight. Want a mix of Push and Firefight, with points you can capture but also respawn waves? Choose Skirmish. There are a few others as well- ambush for instance puts you on an attacking or defending side, where you are forced to escort your VIP (a player who cannot die) to one of two possible objectives. These are the 4 most common game modes, in that order.\n\nServer Activity:\n\nInsurgency recently broke the record of an all time high in the number of players online at once. No matter what time you get on to play, there are always active servers to play on.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is quite different from any other game. It's a lot like the Call of Duty 4 Pro Mod or hardcore mode. You don't have any HUD's or ammunition/health bars. You have your gun in front of you, the time of the round, the points and their status at the bottom of your screen and that's pretty much it. It's a source engine game, a lot of former COD 4 guys and CSGO players like it, although it's not really anything like CSGO.\n\nPace/Mentality/continued comparison:\n\nIt can be pretty fast paced- especially push. There are people everywhere and they're all trying to kill you. Other modes like firefight and ambush can be much slower paced. Yeah, you can go for that initial kill, and if you're good you might get it. The other team might also be playing slowly, and you might pay dearly for a risky move. I'd say it's relatively realistic enough to make it different from COD or Battlefield but still arcady enough to be fun for the guys who like that aspect of games- it's a good balance. Reloading takes a little longer than your average FPS, but not too long. Sound is really huge in this game- you can hear tons of things and when you run around people can hear YOU in the next room. You don't know how many bullets are left in your mag unless you've given it at least a little attention, etc. The game requires a lot of mental attention if you want to do really well, but also is arcady enough to where it's completely in your right to mindlessly shoot virtual people at 3 AM. For instance, you can't really mindlessly play Arma or Squad, but COD or Battlefield doesn't require quite as much mental attention. It's hard to be really good at CSGO- but for different reasons. CSGO is a lot about aim. I'd say it's relatively "harder" to be good at insurgency than it is to be "good" at Call of Duty or Battlefield, although prior shooter experience certainly helps. The mental aspect of insurgency and attention to detail isn't really found in another shooter. You'll definitely get a new experience here.\n\nWhat are you waiting for!

Still, if you really want to, no one would stop you from doing it.\nThe author disclaims any liablity or responsibilty for any consequences of proper or improper use of this review.\n***\nBecause of my strong love for f-word, I'll replace it with the word "chainsaw".\nCredits of this idea go to Jon Lajoie (cheers).\n***\nOperation Flashpoint, Rainbow Six (the old stuff, like Raven Shield),  SWAT - that is the kind of names that comes up in my mind when I hear the combination of words like "fps", "tactics", "realism", "hardcore" and so on. Unfortunately, related words usually were "dead genre", "empty multiplayer", "what the chainsaw they've done to the series, why couldn't they chainsawing do it just like the old times, chainsawing chainsaws". But things have changed for me in March 2014, when I purchased Insurgency. To tell the truth, my hopes weren't really up about this one (even though I played Insurgency when it was a mod back in 2008 and I really enjoyed it), for I've seen too many new fresh games that looked promising and got positive reviews to turn out to be, em, disappointing, including the sequels of series that kicked ♥♥♥ back at the time. So I was pretty scepctical when I started playing, my judgement wasn't clouded by so called "wow-effect", the one you get when you start a game you've been waiting for and looking forward to, but in the meantime I  wasn't too sceptical, and I actually even forgot that I played the mod.\n\nSo here I am, playing Insurgency, trying to figure out who is who, what to do and where the chainsaw I'm being shot at from, and the more I play, the harder it gets to ignore this thought screaming through my brain: "THIS IS CHAINSAWING IT MAN THEY FINALLY CHAINSAWING DID IT". And it actually _is_ it. The game is challenging: you\ndon't have crosshair, healthbar and even ammo count on your HUD, only the amount of magazines, o you have to elaborate some sort of "feeling" of how much ammo you have left in your magazinge and how bad you are hurt; you can actually die from a single bullet, and that makes you act carefully and steady; it's hard to aim because of the "trembling hands" effect after you sprint for some time and the suppression effect that is caused by being shot at (really cool feature that is also implemented in a nice way); equipment weight and resupply points that make you choose the equipment wisely - you can't assemble a "wunderwaffe" and have it all; and many other things that make this game hard, complex and challenging, but so damn enjoyable. It really feels great when you accomplish anything in this game, even a single kill, and the key to success is your tactic thinking and experience, and only after that come reaction time and velocity.\nThe game has multiple game modes, and each of them plays a little different; that adds to gameplay variety pretty much. There are even coop modes against bots, and that also creates more ways to play the game (for example, you can play it alone, which I prefer sometimes).\nThe game's techincal side is also in a good state, I've had no technical difficulties since the very start.\n\nTo sum it up, Insurgency is challenging, old-school, hardcore, interesting, intense, rewarding and just fun.\nP.S. The two things that make me love this game even more:\n1. The updates, that often include new content, features etc are free. That is just amazing, two thumbs up for the developers, or whoever is resposible for this.\n2. Once you start the game, the first thing you see after it loads up is the main menu. Yes, you heard me right, this game has NO CHAINSAWING INTROS at all. At first I thought it was temporary, but it's been like this for more than a year now. This is my personal favourite, and it may be even greater than the updates thing for me.","March 27, 2015","true","424.1"," 114 of 133 people (86%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","86","114","133","57","5"

The title offers good realism of firearms, a personalization system treated classes, a decent graphics and sound rendition definitely noticeable. Co-operation with their team is a key part of this title and play to help his team rather than get a good personal result is required. If you're the kind of player who prefers a quick and immediate and perhaps loves being the Lone Wolf of the situation, then Insurgency is not for you, but if you're the kind of person who likes to cooperate with fellow to develop complex tactics and a type of gameplay less frenetic and more reasoned, you have found a game worthy of your attention.Insurgency is a multiplayer shooter that delivers everything it promises and it does it with the weapons of the maximum realism, without compromises or concessions modern.

'Cos that's how you get shot!\n\nThis game has been described as a cross between Counterstrike and Red Orchestra 2, and I think that fits.\n\nThe arcadey pew-pew of CS is absent and instead you play in a more realistic environment where your cautiousness and tactical thinking is rewarded. The sense of immersion is greater than in CS, and while the pace is (generally) slower, as a result it's also more intense with the stakes seeming higher.\n\nYou WILL get one-shot-killed in this game. AND you will one-shot kill others. You know going in that this is the case: that bullets are very deadly. This affects the way you play and you value your life more, and this in turn increases the immersion.\n\nYou will NOT find yourself (as seems to happen in CS:GO) plugging several rounds into an enemy standing right in front of you who immediately one-shot-insta-kills you, and be left with the feeling that your death was somehow unfair.\n\nThe bots in co-op mode; waves of enemies that unlock after an objective has been achieved to protect the next objective or re-capture the one just taken (randomly triggered) behave, on the most part, very realistically. You'll get ones that see your head as you lie prone and headshot you and you'll get ones that rush past you, failing to spot you waiting round a corner (as well as ones who anticipate you hiding there). They never feel either under or over-powered and do a good job of convincing you they're real. The only exception is their tendency to disregard fire (from molotovs/incendiary grenades) and they will quite often simply stand in the flames and burn to death without fleeing or run straight into the fire, disregarding it and ... die. That needs fixing.\n\nCo-op with 5 other players feels very good. Six player teams mean you don't feel too much individual responsibility most of the time, but that can suddenly change when at the last moment as your comrades have fallen you're thrust into the  role of saving the team, capturing the objective and triggering their re-spawn against the odds. This can result in an Immense sense of achievement and reward when successful and (unless you're playing with Grade-A A-Holes) good-natured sympathy and/or hilarity when you fail. Communication with your team is often essential to succeed, the whole game mode is very enjoyable.\n\nPvP is a blast and where the comparison to Red Orchestra 2 is closest. Squads of up to 16 players (although, as this is a Source-based game 12v12 is the norm) fight against each other across some beautiful and realistic maps.\n\nYou will love the warm glow of the sun in the late afternoon as you run through the crunchy snow, but you will also curse that very same sun getting in your eyes and obscuring your view of the other side of the ravine and that blasted snow for giving away your movement.\n\nThe feelings of "oh crap, oh well, here goes" as your squadron marches into uncertain death that games like Red Orchestra and Planetside provoke is here, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale, but Insurgency does it better. It's prettier, smoother and  more polished than RO2 and your value to your team is much higher than in both that and Planetside.\n\nAnd did I mention how inexpensive it is? The Fun:Value ratio on this game is very, very high. If you have a few spare quid and a few friends to play this with, you will have a blast with Insurgency.","November 24, 2014","true","71.4"," 58 of 64 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","58","64","0","0"

The authenticity of this game is due to HUD realism (no radar, no hit markers), sound realism (let's just say you'll understand why people are hiding behind cover when you hear the bullets whizzing by), weapon feel and control, and loadout customization. The variety of guns, maps, and modes lend to its replayability. The AI in this game is probably the best I've seen so far, sometimes rivaling the skill of real players. The game supports the Steam Workshop where you can find some of the best maps, gun mods, and audio packs that really spice up the experience. One of the biggest personal selling points is the dedication and passion that the developers show for this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark_raven13/recommended/222880/","dark_raven13","Raven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark_raven13/","309 products in account","Insurgency is one hell of a beast, created by mixing up all the good things from other great FPS title.\nIt has the realism of Red Orchestra / Rising Storm that adds a great immersion and intense atmosphere, the small skimrish maps akin to Counter  Strike for a quick and fun close quarter battles, great weapon customization system that reminds me to Rainbow Six / Ghost  Recon, and Battlefield's class based gameplay.\n\nLooks unoriginal eh? Nah, not at all. Insurgency DO feels like a combination, something "in between" of those game, but the devs executed the ideas impressively that I can consider Insurgency as an original, somewhat one of a kind game that still maintain its own unique identity among an ocean of FPSes nowadays.\n\nGameplay (10/10)\nImmersive, intense, hardcore, yet it still can offer a fun and enjoyable experience. Insurgency is one of those "easy  to learn hard to master" game. Naturally, Insurgency itself is a very simple game, the thing that you'll have to learn is how the general system works, weapons and attachments, the different set of classes, and the realism factor itself. I believe you'll fully understand how the game works in around an hour, or even less. Insurgency isn't for a trigger-happy FPS player. Patience, teamwork, and careful observation of your surrounding is the key here. Even if you already do that, like walking slowly, crouch, peeking on corners, you'll find yourself in  "WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THE BULLET COME FROM?" situation, first shot, screen blurred, second shot, you started to panic, third shot and you're dead. In many occassion you don't even have the time to be panicked, you'll have an instant death.\n\nAnother great aspect of this game is how devs design the overall system. No grinding, no perk, just pure skill and tactic. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of varied game modes that actually..well..varied, a balanced class system. Overall Insurgency is, one of the most balanced and fair FPS I've ever played.\n\nSound (10/10)\nI could've put it in the gameplay section, since the sound isn't just to make the game more atmospheric, but the sound design is a part of the gameplay, its a crucial part. For a modern military FPS with a flare of relism, the sound must be designed to make the game, not only immersive and realitic, but also "usable" and its actually a part of the tactic. Yes, the sound is mind-blowingly fantastic. I love how detailed the sounds are, the sound of bullets blazing over your head, hitting the wall or floor, fly near your ears, and when it do hit you, everything become muffed. The guns sounds realistic, it doesn't sound too weak, yet doesn't sound THAT powerful.  Sound is your best friend and your greatest enemy.\n\nGraphic (9/10)\nInsurgency is built from Source Engine, which is, in a way..dated. But. thanks for the great level design and visual effect, and of course the gameplay. You'll find Insurgency's graphic to be a brilliant one. You might think Battlefield has the most realistic graphic for a FPS game. That might be true, but Battlefield's graphic is just too beautiful to be realistc, I find it more in the cinematic side. Insurgency, in the other side can capture the overall atmosphere of a battlefield. A battlefield is supposed to be "ugly", no filtering, no lens flare, it's rough. No, no.. I don't say Insurgency graphic is  ugly, far from it. It's a bit dated yes, but the "dated" factor and the genius devs behind the game make Insurgency's graphic looks truly believable.\n\nConclusion (10/10)\nImmersive, believeable, realistic, hardcore, tactical, yet still fun, enjoyable, and pretty much accesible. Insurgency is a perfect balance of realistc / hardcore FPS game with the close quarter combat fun and quick matches of a more arcade-ish FPS game. Insurgency does take inspiration from a wide range of FPS game type, but the devs cleverly managed to distinguish the game to something more unique that can stand at its own two feet and overall maintaining its own identity of a new kind of FPS game.","November 7, 2014","true","30.2"," 72 of 87 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","72","87","0","3"

First day at bootcamp, this instructor (who am I kidding, he wasn't teaching us recruits jack sh!t) told me to run and crawl through a warehouse. Assuming I never shot a gun before, he intructed me to shoot non-moving targets with a pistol. Let's be real, it wasn't any trouble at all, especially since I've had a prior background with guns. I moved through the rest of the training like it was butter. I was here to show this jack@ss that I wasn't here to mess around. At the end, something unexpected happened. Insurgents started attacking our base. My unit quickly took positions to take out the enemy. Nothing would ever prepare you to get into a firefight on the first day of boot camp. After what seemed like hours, we finally pushed them back. Taking count of the casualties, we pushed out of the base to push back the rest of the lingering Insurgents. Months later, my unit and I were assigned to an Insurgent filled area in the desert. We had to take control of the immediate area and eliminate as many hostiles as possible. It was rough, sand flying in your face, the hot sun beating down on you while you're loading with 50 lbs of equipment. You hear war stories from vets back at base about men, friends, they've lost. Those don't prepare you for when it actually happens in battle. My bud was laying prone next to me, trying to pick off hostiles with his M4A1. Watching the left flank, I didn't notice the goat-♥♥♥♥er coming up to us on our right. Next thing I knew, I heard a gunshot, immediately followed by a yell. I looked over and saw blood gushing out of my buddy's neck. No matter how many pills I drink or how much booze I ingest, nothing will ever let me forget the look on his face as he died. Or the stream of blood painting the sand red. To avenge my fallen comrade, I unleashed hell upon the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that killed him. Even after my mag was empty, I continued to pull the trigger, the clinking of the empty chamber the only thing I was hearing. The Insurgents unleashed something inside of me, something I didn't even know I possesed. I scavenged a grenade from a casualty and pulled the pin. I threw the little green ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into a building, hearing the explosion and screams following it. My squad and the Security squad accompanying us eliminated any remaning tangos and took the area. We called in a medivac for the injured and waited until we were extracted. Most sat on a nearby building's stairs, staring off into the distance or messing with their equipment. The relief we all felt when we saw the evac coming was undescribable.\n\nTL;DR 10/10 would complete the training course and play Buhriz Push again.","April 23","true","232.3"," 71 of 89 people (80%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","80","71","89","43","3"

The chatter on your radio indicates that they're all clear, but soon after you hear gunshots ring out. You begin to hear muffled voices coming from above you, and they don't sound familiar at all. You send one of your squadmates in there to see if there's anyone there, and more gunshots are fired, ending with your teammate screaming, "THEY'RE HERE!" The VIP and the rest of your group run hurriedly to one of the extraction points, while others try to combat the ambushers. Many die, but as you approach the extraction point with your last magazine, not knowing how much ammo you have left, you see one last ambusher waiting for you to arrive. The VIP ducks into cover, but you try to return fire to the assailant. He shoots you twice, but you land a lucky shot on him and kill him.\n\nInsurgency is filled with moments like these. The learning curve isn't as steep as you may think, and the game is reminiscent of other hardcore FPS's, such as Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm. With your little amount of health, you must coordinate with your team members in order to assure victory for your team. Patience is key, because running out will end up with you being shot at from 10 different directions. The game is excellent and should be enjoyed by anyone that wants to have an enriching multiplayer experience with or without friends. Be wary, though, if you prefer games like Call of Duty or Battlefield, then you will have a much harder time getting into this game. The guns are harder to aim, and it takes only a few well placed shots to kill someone, so make sure you aren't entirely visible. All in all, this is a really good game that may not be for everyone, but deserves to be tried.

Or do you like the first Rainbow Six, up to RavenShield?\nThose games focuses on CQB mostly. But what if you want the same realism with bigger maps?\nAnd with lots of co-op, lots of player at the same time and mandatory friendly fire?\n\nOkay, then we are talking about Arma; except that you need the whole keyboard mapped in order do play.\nI could mention the famous America's Army, but the murika's BS might p!ss you off.\nWell, for me, Insurgency is very close to AA, but in much better IHMO.\nThere is also Red Orchestra even closer than AA, but you might also be tired of WW 2.\nOf course there is the HL2 mod named Insurgency - Modern Infantry Combat too. In that case you already know what I am talking about here.\n\nIn Insurgency you will find realism.\nOne shot, one kill mostly. You will also experience bullet penetration and ricochet. Friendly fire is always on, forcing you to advance in coordinated groups and with a proper formation. There is no magic radar where you can see friendlies, no indication of the rounds left in your mag. Bring up the full screen map to know where people are, but then you are vulnerable during that time.\n\nThe recoil is similar to the one you might find in RavenShield, and the aiming and movements (running, sprinting, sliding) are smoother than in America's Army.\n\nWeapons modifications will drastically change your gameplay and behavior. It is absolutely not cosmetic here. You can choose the rounds types (JHP, FMJ, tracer) to suit your class. It's not BS.\n\nThe sounds/SFX are awesome. The voice comm is directional and "spacial", meaning that you will have to be close to the guy using his mic/talking to hear him. Which the opposing team will hear too!\n\nThe objectives are very cleverly made: clearing an objective will make your teamates respawn, which can turn a situation around. Sometimes, a single match can last quite a long time when both teams are skilled. The objectives will get captured, lost, etc. making people respawn and so on.\n\nAnd finally, the community is mature--for now at least.\n\nIs it hard? Definitly yes.\nIs it worth it? Damn right!\n\nAre there other alternatives to this game? Short answer is "not really".\nTakedown was (is?) an attempt to revive the Tactical FPS but has failed so far IMHO.\nAmerica's Army is too tied to murika, and is full of bugs and not maintained anymore.\nArma is too slow paced, and feels like a sofisticated airplane simulation so many key bindings there are.\n\nHence, Insurgency is pretty much the only tactical game since RavenShield released in 2003.\nYeah, it is the only tactical game available since a decade.\nSo no, there are no alternatives.\n\nNow you should clearly know what you oughta do:\nGO GET IT.

This game is difficult, but rewarding.\nSecondly,  THE DEVS ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT\n\nNow, for the nitty gritty (sorta).\n\nTeam play is nearly a must. You can do well on your own, and you can decimate a group of enemies on your own if you're experienced enough or just have a great position, but more times than not, having a competent squad at your back or your front is typically always better than being a lone wolf.\n\nCommunication is just as important as it is in any other game, and if you don't (have/want to use) a mic, this game gives a good means to do so, with (mostly) fleshed out voice commands. I could recommend a few, but this isn't the place for it. What matters, is that you can generally get your message out without having to type. It is typically easier to communicate with someone who you've spent a few hours playing with.\n\nGunplay and controls are tight; it's a source game, what do you expect? As for gunplay, weapon recoil is not going to have you admiring the skybox, but it's not going to have every weapon acting as a lasergun. Almost every weapon can one-shot the chest (Depends on target's armour, what type of ammunition you are using, and caliber of gun.), and all weapons will one-shot the head under average circumstances.\nMovement and navigation is crisp and as clean as any other source game, save for the small map props that can peak up from the dirt, or a ledge that's just barely elevated enough that you have to jump. Other than that, movement speed itself is not fast, but you won't be a slugman.\n\nOverall/TL;DR: Teamplay is recommended, Communication is concise, Gunplay is dandy, movement is crisp.\nRecommended if you enjoy games like Red Orchestra 2 or Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.","April 30","true","432.3"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","41","45","2","2"

Let that sink in for a bit, over 10 months I've put 765 hours into this game. The majority of people who im friends with that play Insurgency (most of my friends list), have over 300 hours. That alone speaks for itself. Even with it's faults, and dissagreements over the certain pathes this game has taken, it is still one of the best games I have ever played/watched on Twitch.\n\nYou die in around 1-3 good shots depending on your loadout, and rely on your teams help in order for you to win. If you know what you're doing, you can make your way from point a to point b mowing down everyone in your way. Be warned, this game does have quite the learning curve, and until you bring up your game awareness, it'll be hard to even get far from spawn.\n\nBe warned, this game is indie. It's made by a small dev team. There are some bugs that creep up from time to time, and there are a few quirks that get overlooked. At the end of the day, these guys have a good product. It may not be 100% refined, but they release regular updates (1-2 months always). They're commited, and they've stated they have a "vision".\n\nRegardless of any issues, I would HIGHLY reccomend this game to anyone who's enjoyed Arma, anything from BF, or even CS.

I have been gaming over 30 years (yes I'm an old fart) starting way back in the days when we had an Atari 800 and floppy disk. I have pretty much played every FPS out there (well most), messed around with map making for various games, and currently am the creator and manager of www.ShakesPub.net. I served 4 years in the military as a Army Ranger with the 3/75. I only tell you this as I know what ♥♥♥♥ sounds like when all hell brakes loose.\n\nSome of you are wondering is this game any good? Are there enough players? It's the Source Engine isn't that kind of out dated? Etc. etc. Forget all of that nonsense....this game got it right when some of the latest AAA releases have gotten it so wrong! The core mechanics in this game (i.e. weapons handling, combat/ambient sounds, suppresion, etc.) are some of the best if not best I have seen in an FPS. The battlefield in this game is unforgiving and if you don't check corners, cover your buddies, avoid danger areas, etc. you will be dead...that simple. There is no hud to aid you, hit detection, or indicators to tell you where fire is coming from, or a medic to come revive you....it's raw battle at it's best & to be honest one of the best FPS titles I have played.\n\nThrow in COOP where you hook up with strangers you don't even know and quickly the comradery of battle brings you together and your covering each other's six's, chatting over mics, and just trying to make it to the next objective. The AI are so incredibly tough which even makes the COOP that much better....it's a challenge and keeps you coming back for more.\n\nI think this FPS will be the cinderella story of 2014. If you are looking for a truly immersive combat experience that will have your ♥♥♥ puckered at every corner then you need to get this. We will be doing quite a bit of coverage of this game at www.ShakesPub.net (i.e. YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, etc.) as we think it's pretty incredible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/preventDefault/recommended/222880/","preventDefault","┐AkH└ prevent ☪","http://steamcommunity.com/id/preventDefault/","72 products in account","This is the best infantry based FPS out right now.  Period.  Before I begin, if you liked America's Army 2.x or Red Orchestra 2, you can skip my review and just buy it now.\n\nInsurgency combines highly deadly weapons (1-2 hits across the board for the most part) with Squad based combat.  Unlike games like Call of Duty, you choose a role on a fireteam and certain weapons and equipment are available to you, while others are not.  This promotes teamwork which you otherwise wouldn't get in games where every player can equip themselves as a one man army.\n\nThere is no crosshair to help you to fire from the hip.  And players can't put a dot on their screen to cheat their way around that, since your gun moves independently of your screen to a certain extent.  This makes firing from the hip that much difficult, but also more rewarding if you can pull it off.\n\nThe maps feel immersive and set in Middle Eastern environments ranging from Iraq to Afghanistan.  They aren't the shoebox style maps present in other mainstream FPS, but shaped and structured like real cities or outposts that you'd find in that part of the world.\n\nIn most game modes, your team will respawn in waves based on capturing objectives.  There is no run and gun team deathmatch mode here.  Nor are there killstreaks, perks, or other rewards to help bad players.  When you die it will be your fault, not some UAV or airstrike.\n\nYou'll die a little bit before you get the hang of it because it's unlike anything you've played before.  But once you master it (I've seen friends of mine get good over the course of a day), this is the most rewarding FPS you'll ever play.\n\nIt only costs $15 but you also get constant free updates that contain new maps, gamemodes, and even weapons.  These developers also conduct surveys to see what their customers want, and incorporate those changes into the next update.","February 11, 2014","true","882.7"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"

E.g. in Firefight mode you will respawn each time your team captures an objective so you don't have to wait until the next round to get back in the game.\n\nThe brutal and realistic sound effects of the weapons and explosions (the sound of firing an RPG is phenomenal!) and lifelike ambient sounds all add to the unique atmosphere in Insurgency, it just feels right and the completely clutter free screen will only pull you further into this virtual world. There is no minimap, no permanent crosshair, no health bar, no bullet count, no kill cam or kill feed so you have to confirm your kill visually: just like IRL! The music complements the different environments very nicely: Insurgency is one of those rare games where you can leave the music turned on while playing.\n\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nThe gameplay mechanics of Insurgency are solid and robust and are working fine; there are no netcode problems, no hitreg problems (all weapons are hitscan), no sudden "killed in action" deaths, no trade kills, no tickrate problems (many servers run at a tickrate of 100 or higher) and you will not die when you are already well behind cover. In short: this game is based on skill, not on luck or random events! Of course this could be expected from the latest iteration of the proven Source Engine that is used in Insurgency.\n\n\nOther Features\nInsurgency has many other great features, such as:\na stamina system that affects your aim and your breathing\na weight system that affects your running speed and your stamina, all items weigh something and there is a limit to what you can carry\na unique free-aim system: there is no permanent crosshair on your screen!\nbuilt-in 3D proximity VOIP: you can hear other players, also enemies, talk if they are close to you in-game\na supply point system, all weapons are available right away (no boring grinding or lame assignments to unlock weapons) but supply points are limited so you have to make tactical choices for your loadout\navailable classes and how they are always balanced in the teams (no 16 snipers in one team)\nco-op modes with upto 7 of your buddies to play against bots with different AI levels (this mode is so good that a bunch of players are only playing co-op!)\nquickly accessible mute function for players you do not wish to hear\none of the best implementations of multiplayer night maps of any FPS\nvisual map voting system\nmany different and challenging game modes, i.e. Skirmish, Conquer, Occupy, Ambush\na ranking system (with pvp, co-op and individual stats)\nSupport\nNew World Interactive (NWI) is a small indie game developer fully focused on the continued development of Insurgency so whenever there is a serious problem the devs are on top of things with quick fixes and active involvement on the forums. There are also regular updates, new features,  DLCs and full Steam Workshop support for the many different mods that are created by the community.\n\nVery surprisingly in this day and age is that all updates, DLCs and improvements are  completely free, there is zero extra cost for the user. NWI reminds me how it used to be back in the day and they deserve our support & praise for that.\n\nLastly, players can opt-in to the Insurgency Beta branch to help test new features, weapons and maps by playing together with the Insurgency developers (how cool it that?!) and give them valuable early feedback on the game.\n\n\nRoom For Improvement\nAfter all this praise you would think Insurgency is perfect, well it may be one day but some things can still be improved:\ntexture wise the Source Engine is showing its age here and there even though Insurgency is doing an amazing job and still produces some really nice graphics and great looking maps\nthe bots in co-op mode sometimes seem to get stuck in corners or behind a wall\nthe in-game server browser is not integrated with the rest of the game GUI and the filter settings are not saved\nin-game menus could be more user friendly Done!\nit would be great if the volume of the ambient sounds could be set louder separately from the gun sounds\nplayer shadows are sometimes missing on some surfaces\nthe player character customization and looks could be better (we need more visual clues to see if someone is wearing heavy armor or not)\nthe spotting mechanism could be better Done!\nsaving loadouts would be a very welcome feature (and a time saver)\nthere are no goats, cowbells, chickens or dogs ... for that extra immersive effect :)\nVerdict\nIn the end, what matters is this: is Insurgency worth your time and the retail price of €14.99? The answer to both questions can only be an overwhelmingly "YES!". Insurgency is one of the best tactical FPS games that I have played in recent years, I have almost stopped playing all other FPS games because of it - I'm hooked! Absolute must-buy game.\n\n9.9/10","August 9, 2014","true","954.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manticore18/recommended/222880/","manticore18","MANTICORE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manticore18/","10 products in account","Insurgency is one of the best and most intense shooters I have ever played untill now and I think that, after having played over 450 hours, I am ready to give a review!\n\nGameplay:\nInsurgency isn't a kind of hardcore or fast pace shooter where you just blast your way through players but, instead, is more like a slow pace game of precision and strategy where every corner must be checked in order to make your progress and achieve your goals.\nOne of the things that clearly contributes to this slow and very tactical pace is the damage model: 1 or 2 shots....and BAAM...you're dead! Here, there are no medics or healing tools....if you go down you will have to wait for your respawn. This feature is important because you will really have to adapt and evolve in a very particular gamestyle that Insurgency demands from you.\n\nTeams:\nThere are two factions in the game: the Insurgents and the Security Forces,a kind of American Marines. These two have different kinds of weapons and each weapon has its own behaviour like firerate, recoil, damage impact and sound. For instance, the sounds coming from guns are inportant because, to help you during a gunfight, it will be wise to memorize each sound from each gun to get a clear notion if you are near a friend or enemy.\n\nTypes of Challenges:\nThe game has multiple types of challenges available like Push, Skirmish, Firefight, Strike or Occupy, all these based on battles supported by waves being permanently deployed for both teams.\nThere are also new and innovative modes like the V.I.P, in which you have to defend or kill (it depends on which team you are) a player whose goal is to get to a safe point across the map.\nYou have the possibility to play P.V.P (against other players) or fighting against A.I.\n\nMaps and Levels' Design:\nInsurgency's maps are some of the most intense and well designed arenas that I ever played. There are different kinds of backgrounds like urban settings or open landscapes.\nThe urban maps are characterized by high density streets and buildings, which are more destined to infantry and close quarters battles, with many narrow alleys and open courtyards, top floors, walkways, bridges and ground-floor shops....many spaces to hide or ambush!\nThe open maps are more favorable to snipers and sharpshooters backing up the attack of the infrantry on the front line of the battle.\nAs you can see, each type of map will determine your strategy and the way you react during a battle. Fighting on a street surrounded by windows will have a very different feel than fighting completely exposed on an open field...\n\nNight Maps !!! (use your Night Vision Goggles !!!)\nOne of the most incredible features in this game are the night battles that clearly distinguishes Insurgency as a top-notch game. In these battles you may need your night vision goggles in order to make your way through the map. Trying to spot your enemy in the darkness as you walk your way through the map is one hell of a challenge! For instance, if you have your night vision goggles on and if you stare at a bright light...then DAMN !....you may get blinded for a few seconds, giving your enemy a chance to kill you!\nThe night battles have some of the most incredible environments you will ever have on a shooter...needless to say the battles are epic and very tough to win.\n\nGraphics / Source Engine:\nInsurgency runs smooth and is well polished for a Source Engine game. If you are expecting for a top of the chart graphically optimized game...then Insurgency is not what you are looking for.\nInstead, Insurgency relies on using an old but trusty graphics engine to create an immersive and well conceived shooter for people who want to experience a true tactical game.\n\nCommunity and Developers:\nThe community is very friendly and receptive and new players have been welcomed day by day. The quality and singularity of the game contributed to gradually establish a loyal and commited legion of players who help to improve the quality of gameplay for every newcomers and also to maintain high levels of players thoughout Insurgency's many servers.\nEven so, today I think that this community is still kind of small, a fact that I hope changes soon given the extreme qualitiy of the game, its developers and the people who play it and help it to improve. This game fully deserves a larger community.\nThe developers are incredible and they created a game whose purpose is to achieve an immersive game, instead of a dull and only graphically optimized game.\nThe new contents for the game are always free and new stuff is always being implemented like maps and guns.\n\nNowadays, Insurgency is a rare pearl that concentrates and explores to the limit everything that we want in a game: fun and innovation!","December 18, 2015","true","675.6"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","29","31","2","1"

I would say the game is less realistic than Red Orchestra but more realistic than Counter Strike. The maps are also in between those games, so bigger maps than CS but smaller maps than RO.\n\nObviously, gameplay is the most important aspect of a game like this. Controlling your character and shooting just feels great. Since you often die in just a few hits, taking cover is essential and it makes your adrenaline pumping, every time you find yourself in a tight spot.\nAt the start of each game you have to pick one of the many classes and spend your points on guns (20+ in total) and other gear like; light/heavy armor, flashbangs, grenades or Nightvision goggles.\n\nThere are quite a few different game modes for you to choose from like; Ambush (one player is the VIP and should be protected, otherwise your team loses), Firefight (defend objectives from the opposing team). There are also a few modes to co-op vs bots like; Checkpoint (destroy, occupy and defend your positions, throughout the map), Hunt (Kill all bots and destroy their cache).\n\nThe graphics look great, nothing really to complain about.\nAs you would expect from a game set in the middle-East, most maps have a lot of sand and brown/yellow colors (although there are a few snowy maps as well). Still, there's lot of variety between the maps. Some for close quarter combat, some for open ranged combat, the developers simply did a great job creating interesting maps with the same template.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Insurgency over Counter Strike, at least for the time being. I can recommend this to anyone, who's looking for a good tactical multiplayer shooter.\n\n\n\n","May 5, 2015","true","62.9"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","0"

Their community manager even streams the game now and then.\nAlso, workshop! There's some cool skins and sound mods so far.

In their attempt to recreate the tension and brutality of old-school tactical shooters of decades past, New World Interactive have created an original and satisfying gameplay experience that rightfully sets itself apart from its contemporaries. Welcome to Insurgency.\n\n\nThe base concept of this title might initially seem all too familiar to fans of the FPS genre; two opposing teams engage in pitched close quaters combat attempting to outmanuver and outgun each other accross a variety of objective-based game modes. However to turn away at this initial similarity would be to miss out on arguably one of the most refreshing and authentic presentations of adversarial modern combat that stands out within a genre so often cited for its notable lack of innovation.\n\n\nIn Insurgency bullets are as lethal as their real life counter parts and many players may swiftly meet their end with little more than a single mouse click or the shortest burst of enemy fire. This fact alone enforces a chilling uniformity to the title's playing field, where advantage is gained primarily through individual player skill, experience, team cohesion and map knowledge. Insurgency is unrepentent in its difficulty and newer players will likely face a substantial intial learning curve as they spectate proceedings from beyond the grave. What is worthwhile however rarely comes easily and Insurgency's unapologetic lethality, combined with a tense and at times frenetic pace serve to create a satisfying portrayal of close combat that is at once engaging, unquestionably challenging and always deadly.\n\n\nThe expansive arsenal of modern (and some decidedly older) weapons are without exception brilliantly rendered and immensely satisfying to use. Whether picking off foes from afar with an M14, storming an objective with a german mp40 or laying down suppressing fire with an RPK or M249, the the authenticism and individual characteristics of the weapons depicted in Insurgency are immediately apparent; to put it simply they just 'feel' right. In addition, a formidable array of equipment and attachments are made available to the player depending upon their class, from grenade launchers, bipods, silencers, body armour and hand grips to a variety of ranged and close quater weapons sights, armour pericing, tracer and anti-personnel rounds as well as grenades that burn, stun, obscure and destroy, the list of equipment is long with each addition offering up a different tactical advantage.\n\n\nThe ferocious nature of the events unfolding on screen are expertly narrated by a robust and terrifyingly diverse and authentic sound design. Everything from the distant pops of enemy fire, an AKM expounding virtue on full auto, to the sharp supersonic snaps of incoming fire are all superbly realised and serve to enhance immeasurably Insurgency's gritty portrayal of close combat.\n\n\nInsurgency's battles rage accross an impressive range of extremely well designed maps encompassing tense urban engagements with nerve-shredding ranged firefights accross a variety of diverse topographies. From the dusty streets of a middle-eastern hillside town, to the frozen wastes of an afghan mountain village, Insurgency's maps each carry a distinct, authentic atmosphere and are at once immediately engaging. Multiple routes to objectives create ample opportunity for tactical flexibility while multi-levelled buildings and high mountain peaks present three-dimensional battlefields where keepng an eye on a window overlooking an alley might just save your life. Each of the maps are further enhanced by night-time variants where the tension reaches new heights as players equip nightvision, flashlights, smoke grenades and flares in an effort to keep the darkness at bay.\n\n\nInsurgency comes bundled with a variety of different game modes from those centred around the traditional seizure of map zones and the destruction of weapon caches, to the more novel VIP escort missions and intelligence retrieval (Insurgency's take on capture the flag) where teamwork and communication becomes increasingly paramount. Cooperative mode sees players securing successive objectives while facing an extremely skilled AI opposition with frighteningly swift trigger fingers and a seemigly unhealthy appetite for RPGs.\n\n\nInsurgency deftly avoids a politically charged narrative in the depiction of its principal adversaries who are known only as Security and Insurgents. The precise identity of these groups and their motivations are at best left up to the player's imagination and at worst, a casual irrelevence. The injection of a welcome touch of dark humour (and strong language) in the game's impressive voice acting seems to remind the player of the game's true intent as foremostly an entertainment piece. The focus here is not on white-knickle realism but rather on creating a fair and brutal sense of authenticism. While material penetration and surpression effects are present, one should not expect to find an accurate ballistics model or any semblance of a functioning wounding system. The ommission of such features is due in part to engine limitations and the remainder to conscious decisions surrounding game design. Insurgency is purposefully not a military simulator and arguably emerges a far better title as a result.\n\n\nInsurgency is heartily recommended to fans of the tactical shooter genre and those looking for a fresh and lethal take on squad based infantry combat. Fans of more robust military simulators might all to easily find this title a guilty pleasure and one no less intense or satisfying, while other fans may find their loyalties to more established franchies severely tested.\n\n\nNew World Interactive, a relatively small team of developers, have actively and continually supported, updated and refined Insurgency, all the while remaining engaged with a growing and passionate player community. This level of dedication and fidelity is to be highly commended especially during a time of notable ambivalence by their larger AAA peers and this hard work and resolve readily shines through in the quality and polish of the title.\n\n\nInsurgency's greatest strength remains its presentation and execution of core gameplay mechanics which culminate in the creation of a fast paced, nerve-shredding competitive combat experience where each and every encounter with the enemy is brief, terrifying and always lethal.","December 28, 2014","true","279.1"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","2"

Without a single doubt in my mind this is one of the best purchases I have ever made on Steam. This game is the definition of a gritty, hardcore, and realistic shooter. It can have it's ups and downs, bugs and etc, however this game is amazing and I truly mean it. If you've ever played games such as ARMA or CS:GO and enjoyed them then you will undoubtfully love this game. Not only is the gameplay a key role to a great game, but so is the community. You may be saying "What community? All I hear is a bunch of idiots yelling allah akbar!", this may be true, but what I mean by community is the developers. It isn't very uncommon for me to run into the developers while in game. In fact I have played with Mikee on his stream on multiple occasions. The fact that they are so close to the players that you can touch them is amazing. If you were ever to watch Mikee stream (every saturday at 3PM EST) you would get the sense of close knit communtity I feel whenever playing. The developers in a whole are very open to suggestion in the community and know exactly what it takes to make a gritty and hardcore FPS.\n\nPros:- Hardcore and gritty gameplay.\n- Immersive gameplay.\n- Fantastic voice acting and weapon sounds in general.\n- Strategic planning can be easily made with the right team of players.\n- Great content within the community workshop.\n- It feels like it's own game, not some copy of another FPS. This is a true original.\n- Challenging gameplay whether it is on co-op or PvP.\n- Realistic recoil on larger assualt rifles.\n- Ethusiastic developement.\n\n\nCons:- As of late there has been some bugs related to hit detection. However I've only came across this issue in co-op so far.\n- The shout wheel can be some what hard to maneuver when moving around/firing a gun.\n- Many, many players constantly yell "Allha akbar", "Snack bar", etc. If you don't like it when people ruin the immersion as such, you may want to mute them.\n- Competitive mode is practically empty, sadly. It is extremely hard to find a competitive game which is full.\n- As of now there is no actual ranking system for competitive, but this is understandable since competitive is relatively new.\n- The lower difficulty for AI in co-op can be slightly mentally deficient, however the higher levels of AI can see through smoke and blow your head off. This isn't overly common, but it does happen.\n\nConclusion:I can recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and hardcore take on the FPS genre. I have very much enjoyed this game, myself and I hope to put many more hours into it as the game develops and grows in the forseeable future. If you have been contemplating buying this game and my review has pointed out qualities you want in a game then now is the time to buy it.\n","June 6, 2015","true","239.2"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

It actually isn't, as the game proves it's stable and well-working engine. Let's start off with a list of good things about the game!\n+ Very complex and smart level design, keeping you edgy in the Modern-War set game\n+ A good amount of arcade and realism aspects keep you entertained with a good variety of weapon customizations\n+ Extended controls allow you to Arma-like use realistic movements that can help you out in many situations\n+ No need to play hundreds of hours to unlock each and every attachment; grinding doesn't exist in this game and makes it a very methodical and fair way to tweak your guns\n\nGameplay-wise, the realism-style weaponry ranges from modern tactical Iraq-War gear, up until the classic good old WW Mosin Nagant. Insurgency offers you a variety of realism, arcade gamemodes and an overall nice feeling, which keeps you edgy with a very smart level design and clear sound design. Gunplay gives you a good amount of fun balanced with skill. Nobody's perfect, and neither Insurgency; so here are some quite game-breaking flaws:\n\n- Headshots give you a 100% 1hit kill chance, making some weapons very overpowered\n- A lacking good AI in singleplayer doesn't make this the best game to play by yourself\n- Sadly, like most shooters; odd hitboxes can probably cause you to be very angry; so be warned.\n- Unbalanced health/damage system, very COD-like you may die because someone shot you in the ankle. Twice.\n\nI'd like to keep it short, so here's the conclusion about Insurgency:\n\nOverall, it impresses me how "unpopular" Insurgency is, among all of those modern-shooter trends. It's very slow-paced, methodical and is alot about skill and tactics. It gives you an opportunity to think about every step you make, but sadly enough the odd hitboxes and upsetting flaws quite often takes you away the vibe the game appears to show. I do recommend it, and would buy it again, but I am most definetely sure there are better games regarding realism;tactics; and so on - but if you're not into Call Of Duty, but dislike Battlefield, this game will serve you well, and keep you entertained (atleast for a while.)\n\n\n7/10 flashbangs","November 2, 2015","true","23.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","23","26","4","5"

The aiming is extremely smooth and accurate. The controls are simple, the weapon models are sexy, the connections are great, the optimization and graphics are good too. The realism comes close to Red Orchestra 2, but there sometimes is even more tension than in Red Orchestra which surprised me. Especially close quarters is a tensionride for itself. Sniping is balanced and feels very natural. Feedback is great and recoil as well. Shotguns aren´t overpowered but are realistic and hella lot fun to play and overall even the weaker weapons are accurate and feel very realistic. Insurgency makes everything right, from customization and layout to HUD, balancing and especially fun. I knifed two people, I sniped three in a row while they were moving, I was the hero of the round several times and that good old Counter - Strike feeling was there again.

This game is down right brutal with a unforgiving damage and health system. Gun play is fabulous and the weapons help add and authentic feel to your combat experience. Devs are awesome too, for instance, Mikee, the community manager live-streams over at the Official insurgency twitch channel, and highlights are posted up on Youtube if you are so inclined. All the devs are jsut down-right kind and compassionate about what theu have made here in this virtual world and are glad to help in any way possible.\n\nThe maps flow niceley from a river bending through a snow mountain top villiage to a city in rubble. A new challenge always is waitng around the corner for you with Insurgency's AI system. They can hinder you squad useless in an instant, or pick you offf one by one. Team-play is great, everyone hops and and you just get a big "tactical" feeling from playing the game either with freinds or random operators.\n\nPeople are always worried about the player base in this game and don't want to waste their money for a game with no players on it.

Where to start with what i think is an absolutely amazing game?\n\nStarting out as only a mod this game has come far in my opinion.\n\nInsurgency offers tactical team-based shooting missions and fights to its players. With a wide variety of balanced maps; and an even wider range of weapons with various attachtments to fit your playstyle. Insurgency is the perfect game for you if your into fast paced tactical and action filled fights.\n\nOne thing which i think seperates Insurgency from any other FPS is it's realism. Motion blur, wounds, body hotspots, i could go on! You ever wanted a game where you can storm the enemy lines, sliding and ducking for cover, luckily dodging bullets and winning the game for your team? Or maybe you want to lay back with a LMG and suppress your enemies, providing backup to your allies and team members and winning their favour? Well, let me tell you. This. Game. Is. That!\n\nBefore i go into more detail i'll tell you why i love Insurgency over games such as Call of Duty. As many of the fellow FPS gaming community knows, some FPS's unbalance the way they work. Some involve vehicles which makes not being in a vehicle a massive disadvantage to playing. Other games simply are played by running around spraying bullets everywhere until a kill is obtained. Well not Insurgency. In this game there are no vehicles, and running in the open carelessly will get you killed. This game is balanced in that sense, it's as easy to die as it is easy to kill someone. A few shots and you're dead. None of that; "I can take a whole magazine of SMG rounds to my chest and walk it off" nonsense. So overall it's the balancing which attracts me to Insurgency.\n\nWhen i first started playing Insurgency i admit i was bad and it was a hard game. But unlike others this didn't throw me off. Any good gamer knows practise makes perfect. The more i played, the better i got. You may also find this game very hard if you're used to Call of Duty or Battlefield. So take my word when i say don't run around. Take cover, think, know your surroundings, then fight!\n\nSo you're probably asking yourself, "Ok, this guy is sorta making sense" or maybe "This game sounds great for me". Well if i haven't convinced you already let me give a summary in a few words.\n-Fun\n-Money's Worth\n-Friendly\n-Thrilling\n-Replayable\n-Overall Amazing\n\nNow my ratings on various aspects for an FPS shooter:\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nRealism: 9/10\nBalanced Gameplay: 9/10\nCommunity: 8/10\n"Good-Time Feeling": 10/10\nMultiplayer: 9/10\nStory: N/A\nReplayability: 9/10\nOverall: 94/100\n\nSources: 650+ Hours of Gametime\nMassive variety of FPS games played\nRuns a highly known Insurgency Clan","January 20, 2015","true","759.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","2"

Insurgency has the best elements of old school Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six combined with smoother graphics and movement. Insurgency is a little more forgiving than true realism sims like Arma or Red Orchestra, but it does so to help you stay engaged and keep you from becoming overly frustrated. One shot can kill, ammo is limited, and you can only carry one long gun along with other weight and burden restrictions. This keeps every player from turning into Rambo and the game from becoming another spray and pray trifle, yet cuts down on the learning curve of different weapons and keeps you on the front line of the action with the other players. At no time do I feel like the game is over dramatic or being sold to the Jerry Bruckheimer crowd.\n\nWeapons are, for the most part, based on modern military technology carbines and rifles and the standard fare rebel AK-47. Movement and holding down automatic fire can throw off your aim, while moving more slowly and sighting in on a target will give you endless satisfying headshots and center mass impacts. Scopes and grips can be swapped out, different magazines provide different ammo options, and frags, flashbangs, and molotov cocktails give you an edge without overpowering the rest of the map. Weapons are balanced well and play and sound realistic. I do wish they could factor bullet drop, especially for the bland sniping, but I realize that's an entirely different level of programming.\n\nThe cooperative maps are more linear than Arma but you don't feel funnelled or stuck on rails like a typical action map. Most coop missions are limited to seizing waypoints or hunting enemies in the dark but it has yet to get old for me. There's no single player story per se but the fan base for Insurgency is generally more mature and coop games make for quick, fun missions. The AI does a good job of flanking and even uses grenades and fire bombs effectively, but they do periodically turn blind or run the wrong way. PvP maps are wide open with tons of hiding spots, tight corners, choke points, and high and low points to gain an advantage on your enemies. Either way, this is not a run and gun game, and the gogogo crowd is usually the first to say the game is bugged then rage quit because they couldn't hit anything at full auto while sprinting. Crouch, move, think, shoot. Developers release new maps and new weapons at times and some of the fan base have produced custom maps as well, keeping the game fresh.\n\nThe graphics are pretty standard for a non-mainstream game. Shading is limited, textures repeat, and explosive effects are minimal, but the animations are fluid and when a real fire fight gets going, it's easy to become immersed. The smooth textures make distance shots easier as you can actually see your target rather than a blob of pixels in other games. Insurgency should play easy on mid-range computers as, even with a maximum amount of bots or players on the screen, my aging PC doesn't seem to have any issues. It's stable too, as I've nevery had a crash that I recall outside of a custom map not loading at the beginning.\n\nIf you love combat simulators over standard first-person shooters, why are you not playing this game? It's not the most challenging and compared to Arma it feels "casual", but the challenge is more than satisfying in that you have to think while you play. Give it a shot and don't forget to duck.","October 28, 2015","true","174.8"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

Security uses mostly military grade weapons (M16's, mk18's... anything you would expect to see the American army use), while Insurgents use mostly old Russian weaponry (AKM's, SKS's and FAL's). Each team has two squads, each with 8 roles to pick. The point system in the game balances out the amount of attachments and armor you can pick, giving you the choice to either deck out your gun with fore-grips and weapon sights and run un-armored, or armor yourself up and give yourself extra ammo with no optics or attachments on your gun. Most primary weapons are a one shot kill to the torso and head at all ranges which forces you to pick your cover and pathing to the objective carefully.\n\nThere are 6 game modes for multiplayer: Skirmish, Push, Firefight, Ambush, Occupy and Strike. Skirmish and Firefight are objective zone based; go to the objective and occupy it until your team has captured it and eliminate all enemy players until their respawn waves are ceased, capturing an objective gives you a respawn wave. The only difference between Skirmish and Firefight is that Skirmish has an addition 2 objectives which can be destroyed. In Push one team needs to hold back the enemy from capturing the two objectives in each zone until their respawn waves run out. Occupy is the classic King of the Hill, Ambush is a VIP escort mission and in Strike you must destroy the enemies objective while you protect your own. Servers can hold up to 32 players (16 per team) and there is an addition co-op game mode.\n\nOverall Insurgency is a tense, strategic and realistic game, brought to you by a small and intuitive game studio that will give you endless hours of fun.\n\nPros- Well structured maps that suit every game mode,\nExtremely polished weapon models and weapon animations,\nLimited Heads Up Display,\nHarsh damage model/ Health System.\n\nCons- Movement animations are a bit "On rails",\nand Bullet ballistics are simple and outdated.","October 1, 2014","true","94.9"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

Over the years, I've always been a huge fan of the immersiveness that this game provides, of the realistic sounds (you can hear the echos and dinks!), and of the great community that surrounds it. Only one thing had stopped me from becoming the gamerest gamer of this game, and it was the inability to play it natively on Linux. I did run it in Wine without much trouble, but it still had some issues with the soundsystem, and in the end I opted to just dualboot for gaming purposes. About a month ago, I managed to destroy my Windows partition, and now have only Linux.\n\nFor a long, long time, I would open my Steam Library and almost poop my pants whenever I saw Insurgency on the top of the list (favourite games tab). Up until today it had always been a disappointment - the Library showing all owned games as opposed to only those that run on Linux. But today... Today it happened for real. I cannot express the happiness. I checed three times to make sure it wasn't some sort of strange glitch. Now, I'm downloading the game.\n\nThank you, devs. If it matters at all, you just made a grad student a lot happier :)","October 22, 2015","true","127.8"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

Cover, sides, suppressing fire and other aspects are fairly remarkable. If you're the one likes fighting all the way down, Insurgency would be terrified to you, absolutely, without skilful abilities. Weapon seletion and combination require you to have a good study on them. Alas the map is not large enough and the game takes some time to get familiar with. Still I highly recommend it to you.

Everything is built to bring an immersive feeling to the player and the game does that successfully. The weapons feel like real weapons while moving, aiming and shooting. The maps look realistic and detailed. Only the sounds are not optimal and don't feel right for some weapons. Something the developers should keep and ear on.\n\nAddictive tactical gameplayThis game is nothing like the purely action-based and fast shooters like Call of Duty, but it is also even slower and more tactical than Counter-Strike, yet faster than tactical simulators like ArmA or Americas Army, while still maintaining all tactical elements. It feels like it takes that perfect line between tactics and action and once you get used to it, it becomes really addictive. Although it may be initially frustrating for some, if they are used to fast shooters.\n\nHuge potential for skillAn important factor for competitive players: Skill really matters and can make a huge difference. Although this is a different type of skill than in games like Counter-Strike, which is heavy on aiming and hitting. The actual killing in Insurgency is not too difficult, as people die from just a few hits after they get spotted. But what the focus lies on in this game is the right positioning, movement and teamplay to actual get the advantage over your opponents. Outplaying comes more from the mind in this game.\n\nCompetitiveness is rather poorDespite having all that potential for it, the game is not making much use of the competitiveness. Currently there is no real matchmaking with team balance and competitive matches. The competitive scene is pretty much not existent. The developers are rather implementing more different types of gamemodes to add versatility for casual players, which is totally fine, but they also end up splitting the playerbase too much between these modes. The game is certainly lacking something like a main mode for players to compete between each other.\n\n\nThose 4 points are the main ones you have to know, if you are wondering if it's worth buying the game.\nOverall I would definetly recommend this game for tactic fans. But if you are looking for a game which brings quick and fast paced matches, it is not the right game for you.","June 21, 2015","true","42.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","3"

The old-fashioned shooter doesn't forgive mistakes: on the screen there isn't enough interface, enemies strike from one-two bullets. The system of classes is very similar even. Each of the parties well limited number of fighters of a certain type so it is impossible to make group entirely of snipers. The main difference of Insurgency from a "brotherly" series — cards. Fights generally take place on narrow small streets and in rooms. This clear decision, after all open locations look absolutely modestly, and the closed spaces — is tolerant. Technical shortcomings smoothes and the thought-over design of levels. All of you won't examine plaster in hazardous firefights equally, but you will feel on the skin as it is sensible roundabout routes are laid and shelters (by the way, it is possible to be driven to them from running start and then accurately to lean out) are placed. The revival system is curiously realized: in some modes — the only way to return capture of a key point to a system of the left players. Forcing to work carefully, we are given after all chance to break a battle course. Other rules more liberally. Besides "fights for the territory" in five variations are escort of important persons and mission against bots (approach or defense). About 10 years ago this game would get lost among similar: from dusty gates, Saddam's portraits and "Kalasha" then felt sick. Today the shooters applying for gravity, leave too seldom to disregard "horoshist" like Insurgency. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).\n","February 23, 2014","true","2.0"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","22","31","2","2"

I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a hardcore realisitic modern shooter experience. The game is based upon situations that realisitically simulate warefare, gunfights, capturing and seizing objectives - how you do this is entirely based upon the players, however in this game you will need to work as a team in order to be successful. It is rather realisitic and you can die very quickly, so if you're used to fast paced or standard shooters, this game will challenge you.\n\nI personally find it more fun to play with friends who have the game as you can communicate with them more efficiently and really enjoy yourself. Insurgency offers you a small array of training practice to get you used to the game, how it plays, the weapons, etc and it's important to play through the training part as well as have a couple of practice sessions 'till your firm with the gameplay. The game can be taken rather seriously if one wishes too, but honestly, it's brilliant fun!\n\nThe only downside I have with this game is that I wish there could be more gamemodes and tactical equipment (For example tripmines/claymores) Apparantly some features are in the original mod version of the game that didn't make it to the purchasable title, but I understand this is most likely for gameplay purposes!\n\nOther than that, a fantastic game inwhich I personally waste hours of entertainment with!\n\n7.5/10","October 2, 2014","true","28.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

This new release, while in a lot of ways less developed and mature than the mod, is surprisingly good. The old maps and weapons we remembered are gone (Can't wait till they bring back the FAL) but the new maps and weapons are brought together in a pretty slick way. It's a tight, focused tactical shooter, not for the impatient run-and-gun style players. I sometimes end up sitting in a spot for minutes at a time, watching my lane and anxiously hoping that my battle buddy upstairs is still alive and alert, only to have a frag thrown into my face and be obliterated before I even get a chance to see the enemy. For something that should be ragequit-inducing, it's actually more suspenseful and fun than one might expect, as being on the delivering end of that quick single shot that takes down an enemy from your firing position or sneakily fragging them before they react seems appreciably more rewarding, knowing that any second can bring you instant death if you're not totally on point and alert. It's not a realism game per se like the Arma series; as a combat vet I can attest that probably nobody outside tip-of-the-spear SOF units can shoot this well, let alone how bad most of the irregular forces were at actual infantry tactics and basic marksmanship. Taken less as an attempt to recreate realistic modern combat in Iraq or Afghanistan, and just as a unique gaming experience, I really enjoy it, but it does need your full attention, as looking away for a second can result in your seeing that old "Waiting for Reinforcements" screen until you get your next chance to get it right. I highly recommend this for anyone that liked the old Rainbow Six/Ghost Recon games from the early 2000s, and anyone looking to get into a shooter that values patience and team communication and runs at a pace different than the current BF3/MW crop of shooters.","February 7, 2014","true","399.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

Don't get me wrong, I'm really enjoying some EA (not that EA) and on the other hand Insurgency need a bit more polish, but still.Main question that gamers could ask "Is it better than CS?", fair question though, both games made originally for same audience. I tell you that, Insurgency might take same place as CS got 15 years ago. It got that potential. But it can't be wildly popular. No way. It's hard, not like Flashpoint,  but enough to scary ♥♥♥♥ out of casual players who like weapon skins\stickers\hats\etc.\nInsurgency reveal itself after 40+ hours of gameplay (maybe earlier if you are playing with friendly group), it shows really wide field for the tactic battle. It's all about details, like you could hear radio talk of the enemy who seat right round the corner. Another strong side of the game is "shooting", guns feels like they should, and it's truly enjoyable by itself. Developers communicate with the gamers and listen to their needs making updates pretty fast for small company.\nI played CS since 1.1, I liked Source, I gave a try to GO. It doesn't feel right anymore, maybe it cause of "casual features", maybe it's cause of my age, don't know. Anyway Insurgency make me happy with its solid gameplay, I didn't feel it for a long time in multiplayer shooters. So maybe you'd want to try it too?","June 5, 2014","true","119.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solinarius/recommended/222880/","Solinarius","Solinarius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solinarius/","176 products in account","Long have I waited for a properly made tactical shooter that I could finally enjoy as much as I did Infiltration, Red Orchestra, SMOD Tactical, and Hostile Intent. I can see myself playing this for years to come. The clunkiness that is present in most games of this genre is nowhere to be found. Animations are top notch, and I will add that they are the most important thing for inspiring immersion. The weapon handling is almost perfect. Perfect enough for its flaws to be of little consequence. I can honestly say this game has the potential to outshine every tactical shooter that currently exists.\n\nInsurgency's controls are quite simple. You've got the usuals, such as aim (iron sights), lean, prone, and sprint. Then there's the extra features that bolster the gameplay. Focus gives you extra zoom and tightens your aim a bit, but only lasts for one breath. Ducking while sprinting allows you to perform a slide. This maneuver is relatively helpful, boosting your speed briefly and allows you to dodge shots or fall into cover. Reloads can be interrupted through several means, such as double-clicking, sprinting, or jumping. Bolt-charging can be delayed by simply holding fire.\n\nThere are a range of modes to play, in which, you'll most likely find one you love and stick with it. All modes, versus or coop, are objective-based which includes wide variations on capture points, cache destruction, and a single mode with a VIP. Aside from 'Occupy', the modes don't intrude on the overall experience and take varying amounts of coordiation. Occupy is the black sheep of the bunch because all strategy and tactics are more or less removed in favor of dogpiling onto the objective. Whether this is fun or not is subjective. I say nay because it contradicts the other modes, much less the 'thinking man' philosophy behind the tactical shooter genre.\n\nI've played many co-op game modes in various hardcore FPS games and Insurgency's take on it certainly holds its own. If versus is not to your liking, you can easily spend all your time in the two co-op modes, which are more than adaquate. The AI, as in most other FPS games, can have its cheap 'aimbot' moments that rob you of well-deserved success. It has many other flaws such as but not limited to: predictibility, brain-farts, superhuman senses, superhuman reflexes, etc. but the experience is nonetheless rewarding and challenging. I'm hoping for the day the AI recieves much-needed polishing that will really help the co-op modes shine.\n\nIf you've played any AAA FPS for the past... ever, you'll recognize the all-too-familiar loadout system. You are allowed a certain amount of points to spend and you cannot exceed the maximum carry weight. Each weapon has various 'hard-points' to which you can add one accessory. While it's more flexible than other games that sport a similar system, you're very limited in your choices unless a given server has a higher point minimum, and points can only be obtained by accruement of game rounds.\n\nInsurgency's greatest flaws lie in its cheaply designed weapon balance. Many weapons are far too homogeneous with each other for their own good. Others are so far from what they should be and need to be, that you wonder what the devs were thinking or why they even bothered. The M249, for instance, has the 200 round drums. The implemented disadvantages of this from both a game standpoint and a realistic standpoint are almost non-existent. This is nothing compared to the ridiculously lethal RPG weapons. They're so exagerated they may as well be hand-held nuke launchers from Starship Troopers. What hurts the most is that ballistics are non-existant in firearms. Yes, Insurgency has primitive conical hit-scan. If there's one thing that should be changed, it's this because proper ballistics would add so much to the game, it can't be stressed enough. Even the AI would be improved by consequently leveling out its cheapness at medium and long distances. While the suppression and accuracy systems partially counter-act the exploitation of hit-scan, they also introduce some measure of dice-rolling to firefights, something that absolutely does not belong in a tactical shooter. What a pitty.\n\nAt the end of the day, the most important thing is that Insurgency achieves what it strove for. To give an immersive and suspenseful experience, deferring realism and authenticity when necessary to easily maintain a competitive and tactical atmosphere.","April 17, 2014","true","272.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

You want to carry an RPG ?? You can ! But because its heavy you can't wear a heavy armor. You need to pick and match your equipment to give the perfect balance for you. The weapon recoil is really realistic and very satisfying, the kick that the weapon give and your mouse movement when you try to control the weapon its just fun factor of its own. All the match objective is like some improvement version of capture the point kind of thing, your objective is either capture A, B, and C point, or hold them. There is no heath system in this game you been shot ? You are dead, you shot someone ? They are dead also. I think 2 bullet in the chest is enough to kill any player. There is no indicator when you killed someone, so you have to make it sure yourself, is the guy that you shot is dead or not.\n\nThe graphic and the sound this game have is pretty epic also, i never ever play a game that have this kind of epicness into it, when you shoot something, lets just say a wall, there is some white dust come out of that wall when your bullet hit it, so the more you shoot at something the dustier the battlefield become. The sound.. well.. Lets just say it will scare you and your enemy. When the bullet that the enemy shoot hit the object near you, you will hear some loud noise that will make you duck in fear of dying and vice versa. So, you can give your friend some covering fire because when the enemy is been shot at, they will cower in fear too. the sound is that good. Its really hard to explain it, If you try it you will know what i'm talking about.\n\nApart from the pvp, this game have some co-op option too, which is more tactical than the pvp one, the mode Is 8 players vs 25 AI. (Note that this is in hardcore mode) You didn't have any friend indicator what so ever, so if you go behind the enemy line and your friend see you from far away, prepared to be killed. You need to actually announced your position to your friend so they didn't mistakenly shoot you.\n\nWell, to conclude my review, this is by far the most realistic and fun first person shooter i have ever played and this is coming from a guy that is already played ArmA 2 and Tom Clancy Rainbow Six: Raven Shield.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/recommended/222880/","seriouscatnz","SeriousCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/","365 products in account","Rating: 8/10\n\nInsurgency is a semi-realistic first person shooter (FPS) focusing on small skirmishes at close quarter battle (CQB) distances (e.g. <100m), fought between Security Forces (i.e. Private Military Companies, or PMCs), and Insurgents. Fierce, attritional fights are conducted to capture and secure streets, narrow corridors, and even individual rooms. The British Army aptly calls this type of warfare "FISH and CHIPS", or Fighting in Someone's House and Causing Havoc in People's Streets. The environments range from the rocky desert villages and farm settlements in rural Afghanistan to heavily urbanised areas resembling downtown Fallujah, Iraq. (There are no civilians present, probably due to a matter of good taste.)\n\nAs a refreshing change to the FPS industry, you can't grind your way to getting superior equipment to get unbalanced equipment. There are no level ups or weapons unlocks. Skill, tactics and teamwork are the only things that determine your success. Both sides have access to the expected standard equipment, most of them instantly recognisable classics. Examples for PMCs include: M16A4 Assault Rifle, Mk18 Carbine, UMP-45 SMG, M249 LMG, M14 EBR DMR, M40A1 Sniper Rifle, and AT4 Rocket Launcher. Examples for the Insurgents include: AKM Assault Rifle, AKS-74U Carbine, RPK LMG, SKS DMR, RPG-7 Grenade Launcher, and even an antique MP40 (German SMG from the Second World War). Both sides also have access to different attachments such as reflex sights (e.g. Aimpoint RDS, EOTech Holo-Sight, Kobra Sight), magnified optics (e.g. 2x Aimpoint, PO 4x24), performance enhancements (e.g. Heavy Barrel, Foregrips, Bipod), underslung grenade launchers, suppressors, and flashlights.\n\nThere are two main competitive (i.e. PVP) modes, with variants of both types: Push, and Firefight. In Push you have to capture points (e.g. Conquest mode in other games), which opens up new objectives to capture. You have a limited number of reinforcements (i.e. respawns). When depleted the only way to allow your dead team members to respawn is to successfully capture a point. There are two co-operative modes, both of which can only be played on the PMC side: Push, which almost identical to the competitive mode, and Hunt. In co-op Push you still capture points, but also face waves of enemies in counter-attacks. The number of enemies you'll face in a counter-attack usually outnumbers a full co-op team by 2:1. In Hunt you have no reinforcements and are only told the approximate location of objectives. You'll have to kill all AI enemies, find the weapons cache and destroy it with explosives. For co-op, the greatest issue is the AI. They are unaffected by lighting (e.g. darkness), foliage (e.g. grass, trees), suppression, and have inhumanly incredible aim and reflexes.\n\nThe game mechanics are somewhat realistic, but with a few problems. Bear in mind many of the game mechanics that are unrealistic are due to limitations in the Source Engine. The player movement is far too fast, there's imperceptibly little weapons sway, and weapons accuracy and recoil are heavily understated. Maximum turning speed is superhumanly fast (e.g. compare Counter-Strike to ARMA 3), crouching is virtually instantaneous (e.g. Matrix dodge like you're The One), armour is arcade, some weapons are arcade, muzzle flash is arcade, and the AI on co-op modes have some serious deficiencies. Similar to other Source games, bullets come out from players' eyes, not the barrels of guns. Health is modelled simply as hit points with no bleeding or first aid system, so shots to the arm or leg that would incapacitate you in reality are shrugged off in the game. Frag grenades have an unrealistically low damage radius (e.g. M67 has a 5m kill radius and 15m wound radius, compared to 5m kill radius and 6m wound radius in-game). 12G Buckshot has an effective range of 40m in reality with a tight spread at first, but the effective range in-game is closer to 15m. Somehow, the 12G Buckshot that has no penetration ability in reality is deadly against armoured enemies wherever you hit them. The RPG-7 uses the PG-7VM HEAT grenade, which has virtually no blast radius but creates a deadly shower of debris on impact compared to a blast radius of 6m in-game. The muzzle flash for unsuppressed weapons in-game appear to use real-world cinematic special effects blanks, which produce a flash 10 times bigger and brighter than normal rounds.\n\nBy far the greatest issues are armour that offers unrealistic protection, prevalence of AP rounds, and no terminal ballistics. There are two types of armour in the game: Light armour (i.e. NIJ Level II Armour), which offer good protection against pistol calibres only; and Hard armour (i.e. NIJ Level III Armour), which offers excellent protection against multiple impacts from rounds as powerful as 7.62x51mm NATO (e.g. used in M14 EBR DMR) and virtually unlimited protection against pistol calibres smaller than .45 ACP (e.g. used in UMP-45 SMG). Light armour in-game unrealistically gives you protection against rifle calibres, whilst heavy armour unrealistically gives you very little protection against rifle calibres. At a minimum, Level II armour must protect against 6 rounds of 9x19mm Parabellum FMJ or .357 Magnum JSP, and Level III against 6 rounds of 7.62x51mm NATO FMJ (US National Institute of Justice[www.nij.gov]).\n\nSome of the cheapest hard armour plates you can purchase as a civilian offers protection against several dozen impacts from 5.56x45mm NATO with virtually negligible deformation of the rear of the metal plate. Strangely, the game offers armour piercing (AP) rifle rounds, which are rare for actual militaries, let alone PMCs. Even Insurgents have easy access AP rounds in-game, whereas in reality their rounds are usually made in amateur workshops and have significantly less gunpowder. Their poorly maintained weapons and non-existent quality control means that if insurgents were to use factory-grade munitions or improvised AP rounds, their guns would literally explode from the pressure. There are even AP pistol calibre rounds in-game, which are so rare in reality (because they're so pointless) they're virtually non-existent. Rounds follow a straight trajectory (i.e. no bullet drop), regardless of whether or at what angle they strike a object (e.g. poles, walls).\n\nEven given the deep realism issues, on the whole the experience is an authentic depiction of the havoc of CQB combat for PMCs in a worst case combat scenario—it's also seriously fun. You can die in an instant and not even know who or what killed you. The only other game that offers such an authentic and realistic CQB experience would be Red Orchestra 2, which is set during the Second World War (and also has its own realism issues).","September 1, 2014","true","295.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","4"

It was up to me alone to capture an objective in order for them to respawn, so I make it to alpha. The area is full of crates, stacks of bricks and stacks of wood, but soon my Jihad senses are tingling... there is an infidel or two nearby! Armed with my MP40 with suppressor attachment, I stalk my prey, sneaking behind objects, checking my corners... until I see the infidel, but he doesn't see me. Allah has blessed me with the element of surprise, so I quickly fire my suppressed MP40, RAT TAT TAT TAT TAT!! The infidel is dead, but I haven't captured the objective yet, so there's another infidel nearby. I continue to stalk my prey... I find the other infidel, but this one sees me too... but Allah has blessed me with a quick trigger finger and I fire first, RAT TAT TAT TAT TAT!! Then I capture the objective and all my fellow Mujahideen respawn, each of their 72 virgins in heaven will have to wait.\n\nThis is a most excellent FPS, probably the best multiplayer FPS I've ever played and definitely worth the money, especially considering that they add new maps, modes and weapons to the game free of charge (no microtransactions or costly DLC). The game is realistic, yet can still be fast paced. You can run and gun if you want, but nine times out of ten that will just get you killed. The sound effects, gun recoil, and damage are realistic and there's no hip fire crosshairs, so you almost always have to aim down sights to be accurate (unless you're barrel stuffing them). The only complaint I have would the be the extremely annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that like to team kill just to be trolls, but things like that happen with just about every other multiplayer game and they can always be vote kicked from the game.","August 27, 2014","true","97.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","7"

You will die, and you will die again, but when you learn the ins and outs the rewards will be plenty.\n\nSeriously, this game is worth every penny at full price, so much so that you're practically robbing the developers when you get it at discount (and it gets discounted often). It's insane that the game costs a quarter of the price of most franchise shooters yet gets way more love and attention from its developers; they're not selling you a game in the hopes of turning maximum profitability before moving on to a newer, flashier title; they're selling you an investment, an experience that you will carry with you every single time you touch any other tactical shooter.\n\nOh, and they update this game. Regularly.\n\nPROS:\nINTENSE REALISM:\n\n- Damage done is based on round-type; different weapons utilize different calibers of ammunition, though you are given the choice of utilizing armor piercing rounds or hollow point rounds for any given weapon;\n- your character will tire after sprinting for longer distances, resulting in increased weapon sway until he's had enough time to catch his breath;\n- you need to confirm your own kills as there are no hit markers (however, competitive servers do have kill confirm);\n- there is a supression system in place and your screen will start to blur when fire from critical angles;\n- the ability to drop into prone, or slide if previously sprinting;\n- some nice particle effects when firing at a wall or someone taking cover; the impact of the shots will kick up dirt, which can then be used as an impromptu smoke screen to either run away or move in on the target;\n- player models react to where they were last shot when being killed, changing the trajectory of their ragdoll;\n- don't stand behind a dude firing an RPG, you will die!\n\nAWESOME AUDIO:\n\n- The realism doesn't end at gameplay mechanics, shootouts are audibly intense;\n- weapon sounds are varied;\n- indoor/outdoor sounds are realistic.\n\nGREAT MAPS:\n\n- Since purchasing this game in 2014, they've added quite a few content updates which include a few great maps;\n- the core maps are mostly balanced and wonderful to play on;\n- if maps aren't balanced, the devs usually rebalance them in updates.\n\nTHE DEVS:\n\n- These guys give a ♥♥♥♥;\n- they release regular updates to address issues, rebalancing or just provide us more free content (at this point I would pay for more content, because I love them).\n\nGREAT COMMUNITY:\n\n- For the most part, love the game and love to play tactically; I usually find myself on servers where the team is communicating effectively;\n- some really funny people on this game, just down to have a good time;\n- trolls are dealt with fairly quickly.\n\nFREE CONTENT UPDATES:\n\n- As alluded to earlier, since buying it during the summer of 2014, I've lost count to the amount of FREE content updates the game has received.\n\nCONS:\nPUSH:\n\n- I'm probably alone in this, but I'm rarely excited when playing Push; the objectives don't allow for a wider range of tactical movement and it encourages lazy play from the defenders, while encouraging relentless balls to the wall stupidity from the attackers.\n\nUI:\n\n- The UI in the vote menus could definitely use a bit of a UX upgrade;\n- at the moment, you can't have preset loadouts for the classes presented in the game; this would be a nice feature to have.\n\nSummary:\nIf you got this far, don't be an idiot... buy this game.","July 20, 2014","true","404.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Insurgency takes the typical war zone and adds intensity you rarely see in other titles. Firefights are brief and terrifying and give you a thrill you are unlikely to find anywhere else.\n\nInsurgency is a military shooter that aims to be more on the realistic side of the genre. It creates a more tactical and tense gameplay experience, which might be a draw back for some people. Players will have a low damage threshold, sprinting for extended periods of time will hurt your aim unless you are given a chance to recover.\n\nInsurgency uses a somewhat standard load out system in where you pick your specialty and gear at the start of every match. With an assortment of classes that have unique guns and gadgets, there is sure to be one that fits your play style. You are given a set amount of supply points and each piece of gear costs a price. A standard M9 pistol will run you one point where as a full auto M4A1 carbine will cost you a bit more at three points.\n\nWith two factions facing off it opens the game up to a nice bit of variety on each side. The security soldier’s will have reduced prices to body armor and ammo where the insurgents will have access to Molotov cocktails. The obvious difference will also be in the gun selection with AK’s and other lower tech guns on the insurgent side. While the security forces sport a burst or semi M16 and other higher end guns you would suspect.\n\nNow that you have gotten through your team selection, picked a class and loaded up on gear it’s time to really dig in. With objectives being the focal point in every match, it is important to work with your team and not run off hungry for kills. Completing and objective will yield one hundred points where a kill will only grant you ten points. There are decent amount of objective varieties, ranging from capturing points to detonating an enemy’s supply cache or even both of those examples in the same match.\n\nEach match typically starts with people rushing for choke points/hot spots or flank routes. After the first blood has been drawn groups tend to start working toward objectives. The game will either won by the last man standing or whichever team has taken the objectives. When it only takes one or two bullets to end someone people tend to take things a little slow, luckily if an objective is capped when you are dead you will respawn with the rest of the team in a reinforcement wave\n\nInsurgency all in all is a well-rounded game that brings rock solid versus multiplayer, a functional co-op game mode and tons of fun to the fps genre. Whether its heart pounding gun fights or just admiring the little things like gun smoke off of your barrel, Insurgency most likely has what you are looking for.\n\nIf you finished reading all of that, I apologize if it is poorly writen, still working on my writing. Hope this helped someone purchase this amazing game.","May 14, 2014","true","108.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

Not many games can match the intensity of a fire-fight than Insurgency.  In many ways I find myself intimidated by the game and often curse out loud or jump when I receive fire.  There are however some issues that I find annoying, for one some of the map assets have bad collision and you end up shooting invisible walls (the rocks on peak in particular).  Another issue is the unneeded wait times between rounds, beginning and end of levels, etc (however this has greatly improved recently).  Overall the game play is one of the most intense experiences I've had in gaming, one of the most challenging, and one of the most unforgiving.  I love it.\n\nSound/Music:\nThe weapon sounds are top notch and only add to the experience.  The sound of receiving fire is the most realistic I've ever heard (over Arma, Battlefield, Darkest Hour, and other authentic seeking games).  One thing I feel most games fail to achieve is creating weapon sound effects that produce a feeling that the gun is appropriately powerful-scary, Insurgency does not fail in this regard.  Suppressors work like a charm and sadly most people use them, I'd advise the developers to increase the supply cost of them.\n\nControls:\nIn early access I found the controls annoying and had to rebind them I also suffered from mouse sensitivity problems.  There were inconsistencies and I even noticed certain weapon actions were changing my mouse sensitivity.  I haven't had a problem since the game released.  I never use default controls in a game, so I'm used to rebinding them.  My current controls are perfect for me.\n\nGraphics:\nSurprisingly I have to say graphics in Insurgency are amazing.  Something about the game's level design allows for much more detail and atmospheric effects than other games on the engine.  Personally I'm very immersed in the game and find the levels in Insurgency very realistically portrayed.  I can't imagine the graphics getting any better on this engine.\n\nValue:\nCurrently at $15 it's not much a risk.  Really, Insurgency has been a steal from Early Access.  An authentic gamers' must buy! Even if only to support the developers and their future.\n\nCoop Game Play:\nInitially the coop was laughable and I felt it posed little chance of future success.  However Coop has come a long way and though it does get dull after a bit, it is a great way to practice and hone in skills and knowledge of the game.\n\nConclusion:\nHighly intense, unforgiving, and immersive.  Insurgency offers what most games don't, an authentic realism shooter that doesn't heed to idiots or lack of skill.  Insurgency leaves itself open, open to teamwork, tactics, (virtual) combat effectiveness, and does so with rigorous intentions.  And thus it has my utmost respect.","April 27, 2013","true","63.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

Getting shot at is scary, going out of cover is sweat inducing and managing to pull your pistol out to kill that one dude is exciting as hell.\n\nTeamwork is key – especially with the 'hardcore' mechanics – but not an absolute necessity (it will help you win, that's for sure). As a bonus, there is a (small) competitive scene!\n\nIf that doesn't take your fancy, why not play with teammates to clear out objectives one after the other of AI-controlled ennemies? Hell, if you feel like pwning some other players, why not give a shot at the many gamemodes available? At this price point, there is no way you can regret it.

This doesn't try to hard to be the best shooters yet is succeds in it's simplicity. You have a few weapons for each class and few gadegets so not much there, almost any weapon kills one to two shot in the upper body so mistakes are paid for dearly. The maps are pretty large bigger than your average cod map and some are close to them , it also supports more players I believe 24. The weapons have heavy recoil so single fire is adviced or controlled burst is a must. The game focuses on objective gameplay and teamwork pays off comminication helps tons. My only gripe is with the rpg launcher it just feels cheap and overpowered other than that the game is fun and very intense since hardcore mode is always on, no hipfie crossjhair no health bar so no crutches.

SMGs, more DMRs, and a launcher for the Marines has been added, as well as options to customize your weapon to adapt to the current envionment. The attachments are all pretty cool and varied, without being so plentiful as to be overwhelming and redundant. Different ammo types have been added as well like AP rounds which allow you to more effectively cut through cover in order to hit targets hiding behind it, or hollow point rounds which can tear your target to shreds, drastically reducing your time to kill (essential in a game like Insurgency). If you've ever played a modern military shooter, I'm sure I'm not telling you anything new so I'll move on to why you should buy this game.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThis game is like my ex-girlfriend; cold, brutal, and unforgiving. The weapons have ACTUAL recoil, and getting shot once in the chest with most weapons is enough to make you dead over-easy. A well placed machine gunner can decimate a whole team, getting shot behind cover is a common occurence, centering your sights on someone takes about half a second (more than enough time for you to get blasted), when you fire an unsilenced weapon EVERY ONE and their grand mother knows where to find you, and the people you're playing against will more than likely have been playing for close to a decade (seeing as how they're vets of the original mod) and will perpetually butt **** even experinced FPS players until they get it together enough to the point that they realize this isn't COD, BF, or CS.\n\nYou will die A LOT. Went through a door first? Dead? Didn't stick with your team mates? Dead. Some one texted you, and you looked away for juuussst a second? Dead. And when you die, you don't just sit at a respawn screen for a few seconds and get back into the fight. You must shamefully sit there and wait until your team mates capture the next objective. Making the shame of dying pointlessly/stupidly that much worse because your team is really depending on YOU to win.\n\nAUDIO:\n\nThis game sounds better than anything I've played in a long time. The ambient sound is oddly calming and serene, making it that much more jarring when the staccato of gun fire thunders all around you or the audible *WUMP-BANG* of an RPG explodes and murders your whole squad. I love playing in the mountains and camping just to hear all the different sounds going on around me (Sorry to the people I played with), or even in the city where it honestly SOUNDS like a city. Headphones are definitely recommended to enjoy this game to it's fullest.\n\nVISAULS\n\nNot the best looking game in the world, but still very pretty; especially when the settings are cranked to max. Is this the next Call of Crysis Modern Battlefield Ghosts 3 in terms of graphical fidelity? No, but it definitely holds it's own, especially when you consider this was made by a relatively small team with an even smaller budget.\n\nMAPS\n\nVaried in size, uniform in the acute attention to detail that has been payed to them so that players can have the best experience. I have a few maps that I love, more that I like, and none that I hate. Each time there's a vote for a new map, you really can't go wrong by just picking something random and going with the flow.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis game is fun and made by and indie developer to boot. The gameplay is crisp, fast, and addicting, while still maintaining it's originality and loyalty to it's fan base.The devs are STILL adding new content to the game and tweaking, so while it still has some ways to go, I can't reccomend this enough. Plus, at the time of me writing this (1/27/14) it's on SALE.\n\nIf you're an INS fan; buy it. If you're a modern military shooter fan; buy it twice. Once so you can play it, and then the second time so that after you smash your computer, delete your Steam account, and swear off FPSs for the rest of your life because of getting hurt so many times, you come crawling back with your tail in between your legs and beg for more.\n\nSee? Told you the game was like my ex-girl friend.\n\n9/10","January 27, 2014","true","93.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","2"

There is no dumping 9 rounds into someone and hoping they're dead.\n\nHowever, at the same time, it's not realistic to the point of having bullet drop.. the ballistics are nice and there are quite a few sound mods that increase the immersiveness as well as re-textures for weapons available from the Steam Workshop. It's also fair to say that there is a plethura of custom maps for both co-op and multiplayer game modes.\n\nTL:DR -- A great co-op game for playing with a few mates, decent ballistics, immersive sounds.. A great game for players who enjoy tactical gameplay more then arcade style'd games.\n\n\n","July 27, 2015","true","157.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

Everything is amazingly accurately depicted, from the grenade weight, the audio, the physics, the bullet penetration going through different materials, the suppressing fire system, everything about this game is intense and punishing if you ♥♥♥♥ up for a second while in a firefight.\n\nIt's times like this in a match where you're scoped in, looking to pick off any enemies, especially opposing snipers or grenadiers. You see an enemy sniper far away, and he sees you too. It's all a matter of who pulls the trigger faster, and you hear an empty dull click from your gun. No more bullets loaded in the chamber? You soon find yourself dead.\n\n\nThat's right, there's no ammo counter or anything that indicates how many shots you have left, nor a crosshair or a life bar. The only thing you have on your HUD is how many magazines you have left and a compass w/ a map you can toggle. This game requires good teamwork and communication to win matches, and it's rewarding to blow up the final enemy cache with a brick of C4 when you're the last man standing.\n\nBottom line: if you want a tactical shooter that delivers intense close quarters combat action, with a variety of huge maps as well, get this game, you will not be disappointed. My only gripe is that I wished the developers spent more time optimizing the game, because it only utilizes less than half of my cpu and gpu combined, which can lead to minor fps drops at times.\n\nOh, and get ready for all the "allahu ackbars" on the mics.","April 6","true","101.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/w1z1k/recommended/222880/","w1z1k","Wallet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/w1z1k/","86 products in account","This is the game that will stop me from playing Counter-Strike, I didn't expect to have so much with it. I've played so many different FPS and for a long time, like Battefield (since 1942), COD, I've played every CS, my playtime is ~1000 hours on CSGO and I think I won't play anymore cause of this game, cause of how addictive this game is. I think Insurgency is now my favorite FPS, but I do wish to see a bigger player base in the near future for this fantastic realistic fps. You won't see any usable airplanes, tanks, or jeep, just you and your feet.\n\nInsurgency offers severals mods for every map to play, and you can customize every weapon at anytime while in spawn. The gameplay offers a realistic battlefield experience just by giving "nothing", I mean it has no spotting at all on the HUD, you have no clue (no radar, no crosshair) where your ennemies are and who is shooting at you until a teammate tells you or you see him, and that's absolutely great. You actually don't know if you've killed someone, until you see the blood on the wall or see his dead body where he was standing. You just see where the objectives are, like Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, ... You need to cooperate with your teammates to win, voicetalk can be a real asset, having a squad leader too.\n\nInsurgency was a few years ago just a mod for Half-Life 2, I've played it and I didn't enjoyed it, the gun mechanic was not at his best, now the gameplay is INSANE. This is the one shot, one kill game, in a realistic battlefield, you have been waiting for.\n\nThe graphics are not the best, but guess what? The game looks better than CSGO and they use both the source engine. You won't ever find a game with such a great sound effects. Guns feel real, they sound real, they will scare the hell out of you. Getting a kill is so rewarding, even more when you are the HVT (High Value Target) and you kill half of the opposite team by yourself before you escape and win the round (hey hey). However, getting kills is not your only priority, you need to do the objectives to revive your teammates (called waves) or you will be alone. You need to watch your corners, stop rushing cause sometimes defending a point you hold it's the best thing to do.\n\nFinally I want to say someting about the smoke grenades, how they look awesome and how really effective in this game they are, so cloudy, dark and huge [insert a bad taste joke here], those grenades are a real asset in the battlefield if you want to take control of a point (A-B-C). I also like what developpers did to bullets that hit the ground, it makes the dirt/dust goes everywhere around you, it's something that helps you to notify that an ennemy is firing at you, so you can take cover or just disappear right away. You can even see where the bullets are coming from if you pay attention to it.\n\ntl;dr : I recommend it.\n\n9/10  : -1 cause the fan base is really low...but it's not the dev team fault, so +1.\n10/10","June 26, 2014","true","83.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

In co-op the newest AI is absolutely horrid. It is the worst AI I have ever worked with. They managed to make it even worse than they did with the October 2015 update. There is absolutely no challenge. They run wildly around corners, walking into their own molotovs, or onto frags they just threw. The bots spawn at random intervals, sometimes spawning behind players that have already cleared an area and moved up. It was never this bad until the most recent update. Basic server config tweaks haven't been enough to fix it. It looks like I need to find a way to fix the AI myself. If I can't... Thanks devs, your game is almost dead to me.\n\nThe older part of this review still holds true.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I absolutely love this game and I've had plenty of good experiences with it. It's a hardcore, tactical shooter with a huge emphasis on teamwork. Even though it's running on the source engine it's still fairly visually impressive. The player and gun models look good, and some of the particle effects are great. The smoke and dust puffing up through a firefight really add to the experience. The sound design is also worth noting. You really feel like you're there. It's powerful, and at times almost scary. Getting shot at can really be intense. A year and a half ago the experience was great. Everyone playing was interested in playing the objective and knew what to do. If someone needed help learning the game people were willing to give advice. If a troll joined everyone would bash him to the ground and then vote kick. It was just an amazingly fun experience. I would have definitely recommended it.\n\nUnfortunately I can't recommend this game due to some developer decisions. They continue to add more "newb friendly" mechanics to the game, such as a directional damage indicator. The addition of incendiaries and molotovs in the molotov spring update along with the addition of the second grenade slot completely killed the importance of supply management in coop, and has started to turn multiplayer into a grenade spam festival. Them repeatedly putting the game on sale for 75% off, or putting it in the humble bundle for $1 has made it a flood of trolls and idiots. Now you join a server, everyone is playing music or screaming "Allahu akbar", people are trolling in spawn, no one plays the objective, and if you try to get your team organized you might end up with a votekick directed towards you. Multiplayer is an absolutely toxic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that just isn't worth your time.\n\nThat being said, I still find ways to enjoy the game. I have a private server set up that I play on with my clan or my friends. I've set it up to be much more hardcore and restrictive than the default preset. The nice thing about this game is the servers are highly customizable. It also has workshop and mod support, so you can have custom maps, models and sounds. If you join a community and do some server tweaking you can get a coop or multiplayer experience that truly is incredible. Unfortunately that's the only way to get anything decent from this game.\n\n\nUPDATE: So it's been half a year since I initially wrote this, and I can still honestly say the online experience is exactly the same. The playerbase is full of nonsense. I've given it plenty of chances and tried plenty of servers, and I just can't consistently find a good game. I played on public servers for 3 hours last night with a group of friends, and the only decent servers were empty NWI official servers.","July 21, 2015","false","269.7"," 183 of 336 people (54%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","54","183","336","10","8"

There are several big comp scenes for players, being the ESL (Euro) and DGL (NA), but as far as pick up games go, both are open no matter where you call home, if you don't mind dealing with ping around 150-200.\n-I've heard it is pretty realistic.  I have personally never been shot at, but playing Insurgency makes me not want to be shot at.\n-Tactical, yet fast paced.  While you have the option to play slow and wait for an enemy to run into you, you don't need to, as a majority of people will play fast or switch up their speed of play.  There are many game modes that cater to the individual's play style.\n-Difference in modes.  Want to die and respawn a lot? Play push.  Want to still die but not as much? Play skirmish.  Want to be the last guy up, realizing that your teammates are talking crap about you (and calling you ugly) in the chat you cannot hear while they are dead and you are not?  Then play firefight, elimination, or ambush.\n-Lack of Clutter.  Insurgency, by default, has no HUD, no kill indicators, no ammo counts, etc.  It is about as bare bones as it gets.   You have the option of bringing up a small compass now, but it will do you no good when you are getting shot at.  You also need to learn to count bullets, as mags are independant from one another, meaning no bullet cross over.  If you take a couple shots with each mag, then reload, and do that 4 times, you are going to find yourself with half empty bullet holders.\n-Great dev support.  The devs are always tweaking things, updating maps, guns, etc.  The game feels different from when I started.\n\nCons-\n-The (making a generalization here, no hate please) community can be a bit childish.  If I had a dollar for every "Allahu Akbar" I have heard, I wouldn't be writing reviews, I'd be on a beach with beautiful women.  Granted, its funny the first few times, but the next 1000, it gets old (Positive here - MUTE BUTTON!!!).\n\nOverall - BUY BUY BUY, and join the comp scene to have some real fun.","December 22, 2015","true","429.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/portiermaison/recommended/222880/","portiermaison","Bub Clubbem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/portiermaison/","396 products in account","TLDR: Buy this if you like Red Orchestra, Counterstrike, and intense gameplay where you actually care about how loud your footsteps are, you'll love this. Intensity comes from interesting spawn ticket system and high-stakes firefights. Also FAL best gun, objectively.\n\nInsurgency started life as a Sourcemod way back in god knows when under the name Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat. It was a time where Red Orchestra was considered pretty new and fresh, and I remember it actually being one of the first games that I ever saw that had weapon deadzoning involved. It was a slow-speed, long-range, lethal shooter that was set in the very real world of Marines fighting Insurgents in the middle east, probably Iraq.\n\nNow it's simply called Insurgency, and it's changed a lot. The biggest change is the maps are smaller, making it feel much like the bizarre lovechild of Counter-Strike and Red Orchestra. It's a gifted child. Other changes include that the USMC forces are now simple, unnamed "Security Forces" which appear to be Security contractors cooperating with Marines under a different name. The Insurgent forces also now have no real-life name attached to them, opting for a more "don't offend anybody" style approach to the game. Does it ruin everything? No. I think it's clever that the game worked like that, particularly how they included Marine uniforms in some classes for the Security side.\n\nSpeaking of classes, rather than a purer class-based system like in the original Insurgency mod (Let's call it INSMIC from here on out), Insurgency allows for more customization in the way of a point-based accessorizing system. Each class has specific equipment it has access to - Machinegunners are the only ones with access to RPKs and M249s, for instance, but may opt out and use an AKMS or M16A4 respectively at less point-cost - and 10 points to divvy up amongst weapons, optics, accessories, explosives, body armor, and load bearing equipment (which allows your little soldier to carry more magazines, and even grenades). Each individual class has its own model, too, so a Specialist on the Security forces is going to be some T-Shirt wearing, Beard-sporting Chris Costa lookin' summa♥♥♥♥♥ that you'll probably be running pretty light with for high-speed, low-drag operating conditions, while the Machinegunner on the same team will be wearing a full uniform and look more like the average Marine and by default will be wearing the (optional) heavy body armor that makes him slow and strong. Like a turtle. With a 5.56mm automatic rifle capable of sending 2/3 of a pound of lead down range in a minute.\n\nMy only complaint regarding equipment in the game, though, is that there are no Grenade Launchers and no Grenadier class. The closest you get are the respective RPG7 and AT4 launchers, both only get one rocket, and I've heard this is because some complained that grenade launchers would be overpowered in a primarily CQB-based game like this. That's an addition I'd really like to see made.\n\nThe sound design is really good. The gunshots might not be Heat-tier, but they're better by far than many, many other games currently on the market. The best part about the sound design, in my opinion, is how they capture the almost muffled, underwater sound of gunshots in the distance and the screaming snaps of a supersonic bullet narrowly missing you. And suppressors do serve a much more realistic purpose in this game. While slightly reducing the noise level of discharing your firearm, it'll make it difficult for enemies in the area to determine whether you're chopping off with an AK like the rest of their Kebab-chomping buddies, or if you're ripping it up with a Mk18 CQBR like a true Hamburger-inhaling imperialist of democracy.\n\nThe reason you'll care about that, though, is that the game runs on a wave-based respawn system. In many gamemodes, it operates on the basis that everyone gets one life, when you die you spectate, and when an objective is captured all those spectating for that team are sent in on another wave. This makes it possible to either have the enemy team completely wiped out in a mater of minutes, or can stretch a simple king of the hill game into a tug-of-war over reinforcements. Gamemodes I personally care less about involve a more simple system where there's X amount of respawn waves per team, and as those deplete more can be gained by capturing objectives. Other modes simply have no respawns involved. It covers a lot of bases. There's also a co-op gamemode that one would think would be tacked-on, but it's actually pretty fun.\n\nBasically if you like something like Rainbow Six, Counter Strike, Red Orchestra, even Arma, I'd suggest checking this out. Also it's cheap as hell oh my god I'd totally pay $30 for this game.","June 19, 2014","true","68.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

First thing to note, the pace of the game and firefights feel just right. Gun mechanics, hit boxes, ballistics, sounds, and maps have all been polished quite nicely. The level of immersion you will feel while playing the game is incredible, and you will be provided with many tense moments while playing. Whether it's the RPG being fired from a distant spot in the map, or the sound of your comrade screaming as he's being shot at, you'll find yourself doing whatever it takes to stay alive because you'll truely fear for your life.\n\nInsurgency doesn't BS you by making you level up guns to unlock attachments. Everyone gets an allocated amount of supply points to modify their loadouts freely, at spawn. Want a optic site? You got one. Want to carry a molotov instead of grenade? You got it. Want heavy armor? Sure. You pick your own loadouts based on your preferences. This adds a tremendous amount of variation in the loadouts that you can create.\n\nOverall, this is one of the better realism FPS shooters. The learning curve for new users can be considered steep, but this makes it all the more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of things.

It takes a good team the win, not just people that can get kills. It is more of a hardcore game where you don't have a minimap that shows where the enemy are. You also don't know your health status or your weapons ammo status. The emphasis is not on what rank you are but if you are a team player that communicates well. The game play is intense. Give yourself time to learn the maps. The longer you play the better you will become. It is not a run and gun game, it is tactical.

I only hope that this game gets a bigger player base and becomes better because of it.\n\nThe fact that it doesn't have features such as kill cam or radar or crosshairs just makes it all the more fun imo. Having features like kill-cam ruins the games because it makes it much easier to see where you got killed from. The fact that it doesn't have them means it is slightly harder than normal fps's, but when you get used to it it just becomes easier.\n\nI've also heard that this game requires a fair bit of team communication but from what I have experienced on the servers I have played there has been little or no communication between teams.

Each decision you make is more important with these limitations and you have to use your head to stay alive.\n\nThe community is not quite as vibrant as with the original Insurgency, with less people in total and a lack of competitive play, but it's still good for some exciting games here and there. The game modes lack the tension of the original mod (they are designed to be more fast paced and have shorter game times) and the maps feel less well thought out - but maybe that is just nostalgia. I really liked grinding up the hill at Karkar.\n\nWorth a try if you haven't already.\n","July 3, 2014","true","568.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It is not Counter Strike, nor is it Battle field; however, this game will have you peeking around corners and begging your friends for cover as you cross the street.\n\nI only play the game for the co-op aspect.  I don't play PvP with the exceptions of a few games, so if you are reading this for a review on the PvP multiplayer, I would take this info lightly.\n\nThe sounds!  Not that I have ever been in a fire fight, but I feel more like I have now than ever before.  The pop from your weapons and the cracking of bullets ricocheting off rocks will have you, the player, ducking in your seat!  The frantic screams for help that the characters shout while under fire can be extremely dis-concerning.\n\nI feel that  the bullet physics are lacking in comparison to Battle field, but the guns have excellent recoil, and the dust as well as the blur that arise from fully auto fire is lovely.\n\nThe AI is decent.  Certainly not the best I've ever seen, but far from the worst.\n\nAll and all, if you want an intense co-op fps to play with your friends, I highly recommend this game.  There are TONS of dedicated servers, so finding an empty server for you and your peeps is never a problem.  And the game carries a very fare price tag: $15\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=238396628","February 12, 2014","true","72.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's different than let's say CS for example, playing Counter-Strike you're aware that it's only a game etc. but here... here YOU are directly in game. There is no minimap or bullet counter, there is no hit markers, when you're being suspended behind your cover by enemy fire, you simply experience being trapped in there. Watch out for yourself and good luck!\n\nAdvantages\nStunning graphics, not made to look pretty, made to look realistic\nSounds are really great, you'll understand what I'm talking about when you will hear those bullets flying right next to your nose\nImpressive variety of detailed and greatly designed maps. Night modes for most of maps, what is something really nice\nConstantly updated content with steam workshop access, what makes game so customisable as almost none other game\nFair price for that kind of game\nThe most authentic mechanics I've ever encountered\nIt's literally tactic shooter, not like "rush B fast", but you really need to think tactically to defeat your opponent\nPleasant co-op mode\nDisadvantages\nLittle bit buggy\nProbably the most toxic comunitty I have heard in a long time\n\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","February 1","true","15.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","6"

You have no crosshair and no way of knowing how much ammunition is left in your magazine (unless you count how many rounds you have shot).\n\nThis game clearly seems to focus on the realistic side of shooters, depending on what sort of body armour you have, it will usually take 4-5 shot to kill someone, also depending on the weapon you are using. Headshots on the other hand are instant kills.\n\nAnother great feature about this game that makes it more enjoyable is the community. Many have provided people with additional content e.g Weapon skins or retextures. Others have also made modifications that may suit your requirements if the game itself does not.

I played it a little here and there for about a month.  Some friends and I were RB6:RVS players about 10 years ago and wanted something challenging like RVS was.  Insurgency was was promising then, but we're  all mid 30's and video games just don't have the priority they did 10 years ago for us.  Insurgency could have used some polishing up.\n\nFastforward to yesterday, Feb. 21st 2015....\n\nUnknown to us that a update with new playlists was coming, we had decided to give Insurgency a go again.  Wow!  We had a lot of fun.  It's really been refined.  The Firefight 5v5 gametype is suberb so far. I love it.  I think I could even play it without my gaming buddys, which is something of a rarity for me.  Even though I was stuck as a Flanker and didn't have many primary weaopon options, I didn't feel at a major disadvantage.  I assumed I was stuck with the player type nobody wanted, but I was wrong.  5v5 Firefight offers a good balance of players.  There aren't so many that you can't find a way through to an objective, but not so few that you don't consider taking calculated risk.  A good team could control the map with solid team work, but not to the point where luck is a non-factor to the equation.\n\nI think the 5v5 Firefight gametype is my new go-to.","February 22, 2015","true","14.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

They can seem to have aimbot.

Humble Bundle boosted the games popularity and made it so much easier to find servers. i have 23 hours into the game as of this review. and I play this game often!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/super_xanther/recommended/222880/","super_xanther","Faguette","http://steamcommunity.com/id/super_xanther/","81 products in account","Simply put: this is the game that EA and DICE tried to make but instead created a flaming pile of horse ♥♥♥♥. Insurgency is the delicious air freshener to cover up the aroma of mistake and disappointment that EA and DICE have created.\n\nThis game is literally a Source Engine Battlefield that actually works as a game. Plenty of maps and gamemodes but a map, minimap or health indicator are nowhere to be seen - in fact, the only HUD elements in this game include the CTF-type objectives (just one of many game modes), squad members and a mag count,  that is all . It encourages you to guess where the enemy is and to keep up to date with teammates on the whereabouts of said enemies.\n\nThere are a decent amount of weapons to choose from. Instead of getting a weapon for each slot (primary, secondary, explosive etc.), you get equipment tokens (not sure if thats what they are called). They do not cost anything but are reduced everytime you equip a weapon, explosive or attatchment (some equipments are worth more than others, for example, a laser sight uses 4 tokens where as a red dot sight uses 1). If you remove an attatchment, for example, then you get your tokens back.This system is such an effective and streamlined mechanism which, at first, I thought would be a mediocre and half-arsed twist to another FPS title.\n\nTo conclude, this game is the greatest alternative to EA's latest installments of Battlefield. Especially since this game isn't £50 and can go as low as £2! It nurtures a community that is not so salty, a rarity in the FPS genre. Just grab it or go and lick the ♥♥♥♥ stain that has been left behind.","December 19, 2015","true","9.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxpowerammo/recommended/222880/","maxpowerammo","Maxpowerammo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxpowerammo/","23 products in account","This is one of the best games I have ever played! I got this game on sale for 2.50$, it's normal price is 17$, but I would have gladly payed 50$ for it. This is a fairly long review, however I've tryed to cover all major aspects of the game, please tell me in the comments if I left something out.\n\nDespite being early access there are little to no glitches and those that are present in the game are not gamebreaking.\n\nThe online community is really cool, I haven't met many toxic players at all, people are willing to communicate and use teamwork to capture objectives or to advance. Teamwork, communication and strategy play a big part in this game compared to games like CoD, where everyone kind of goes to do their own thing instead of sticking together and working as a team.\n\nThe graphics really aren't that bad and you won't need a 2000$ PC to run it, compared to triple A games like Battlefield and CoD.\n\nThere is a cool "squad member" selection when picking your loadout. Example: If you choose the Support class, you will have access to big LMG's, if you pick the sniper / designated marksman class, you will have access to high power scopes, silencers and long range guns. This way, each player has a role in their team.\n\nThe weight system is a great feature aswell. Equiping items like heavy armor, rocket launchers, large weapons and grenades will add more weight to you, making you move slower and get exhausted quicker. So players can choose light armor (or no armor) and light guns (or no guns) and rush objectives, or heavy armor and a big LMG to gun down an entire team with.\n\nThere's also a cool "radial menu" where you can say several callouts if you don't own a mic. Callouts can range from requesting backup, to notifying your team of the enemy's location. The Squad Leader also has his own set of callouts that he can use to; tell the team to flank a certain direction, monitor a certain area or move to a specific location / objective.\n\nThe HUD is very limited, showing literally nothing but your gun. No crosshair, no health bar, no ammo counter, no minimap, no killfeed. The only "ammo counter" you have shows you how many mags you have left. If you reload and your magazine still has bullets in it, it goes back to you. Therefore if you tend to reload often, you'll find yourself loading in magazines that are only half full. There IS a map that you can look at by pressing a specific key but no "minimap" like we have in CoD. When you get shot or hurt, the peripheral area of your vision will get blurry, that's the only way to tell when you are hit. Again refering to CoD as an example, your peripheral vision gets blurred, not your whole screen and it isn't covered in blood. Also theres no indicator to tell you in which direction you were hit from.\n\nIf everything I've said up to now hasn't convinced you yet, here are a few smaller points that I liked about this game:\n- You can blind people w/ flashlights and laser attachments.\n- Every map has a night version of it where it gets dark...really dark. Also, NightVision Goggles :D\n- When you kill an enemy (or your friend gets murdered right infront of you) you can not only pickup his gun, but also any grenades that he was carrying with him.\n- C4, IED's (The Insurgent equivalent of C4) and rocket launchers have huge blast radius's and can even kill people who are hiding behind stuff.\n- Frag grenades, smoke grenades and flash grenades are actually useful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxpowerammo/recommended/222880/","maxpowerammo","Maxpowerammo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxpowerammo/","23 products in account","This is one of the best games I have ever played! I got this game on sale for 2.50$, it's normal price is 17$, but I would have gladly payed 50$ for it. This is a fairly long review, however I've tryed to cover all major aspects of the game, please tell me in the comments if I left something out.\n\nDespite being early access there are little to no glitches and those that are present in the game are not gamebreaking.\n\nThe online community is really cool, I haven't met many toxic players at all, people are willing to communicate and use teamwork to capture objectives or to advance. Teamwork, communication and strategy play a big part in this game compared to games like CoD, where everyone kind of goes to do their own thing instead of sticking together and working as a team.\n\nThe graphics really aren't that bad and you won't need a 2000$ PC to run it, compared to triple A games like Battlefield and CoD.\n\nThere is a cool "squad member" selection when picking your loadout. Example: If you choose the Support class, you will have access to big LMG's, if you pick the sniper / designated marksman class, you will have access to high power scopes, silencers and long range guns. This way, each player has a role in their team.\n\nThe weight system is a great feature aswell. Equiping items like heavy armor, rocket launchers, large weapons and grenades will add more weight to you, making you move slower and get exhausted quicker. So players can choose light armor (or no armor) and light guns (or no guns) and rush objectives, or heavy armor and a big LMG to gun down an entire team with.\n\nThere's also a cool "radial menu" where you can say several callouts if you don't own a mic. Callouts can range from requesting backup, to notifying your team of the enemy's location. The Squad Leader also has his own set of callouts that he can use to; tell the team to flank a certain direction, monitor a certain area or move to a specific location / objective.\n\nThe HUD is very limited, showing literally nothing but your gun. No crosshair, no health bar, no ammo counter, no minimap, no killfeed. The only "ammo counter" you have shows you how many mags you have left. If you reload and your magazine still has bullets in it, it goes back to you. Therefore if you tend to reload often, you'll find yourself loading in magazines that are only half full. There IS a map that you can look at by pressing a specific key but no "minimap" like we have in CoD. When you get shot or hurt, the peripheral area of your vision will get blurry, that's the only way to tell when you are hit. Again refering to CoD as an example, your peripheral vision gets blurred, not your whole screen and it isn't covered in blood. Also theres no indicator to tell you in which direction you were hit from.\n\nIf everything I've said up to now hasn't convinced you yet, here are a few smaller points that I liked about this game:\n- You can blind people w/ flashlights and laser attachments.\n- Every map has a night version of it where it gets dark...really dark. Also, NightVision Goggles :D\n- When you kill an enemy (or your friend gets murdered right infront of you) you can not only pickup his gun, but also any grenades that he was carrying with him.\n- C4, IED's (The Insurgent equivalent of C4) and rocket launchers have huge blast radius's and can even kill people who are hiding behind stuff.\n- Frag grenades, smoke grenades and flash grenades are actually useful. Frags have a pretty large explosion radius, flashbang's blind players for more than 2 seconds and smoke grenades create large, thick smokescreens that fog up your view if you walk into them.\n\nFinal comments:\nAt first I thought that I wouldn't like the lack of crosshair, HUD, minimap, etc, but I found it really fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/super_xanther/recommended/222880/","super_xanther","Faguette","http://steamcommunity.com/id/super_xanther/","81 products in account","Simply put: this is the game that EA and DICE tried to make but instead created a flaming pile of horse ♥♥♥♥. Insurgency is the delicious air freshener to cover up the aroma of mistake and disappointment that EA and DICE have created.\n\nThis game is literally a Source Engine Battlefield that actually works as a game. Plenty of maps and gamemodes but a map, minimap or health indicator are nowhere to be seen - in fact, the only HUD elements in this game include the CTF-type objectives (just one of many game modes), squad members and a mag count,  that is all . It encourages you to guess where the enemy is and to keep up to date with teammates on the whereabouts of said enemies.\n\nThere are a decent amount of weapons to choose from. Instead of getting a weapon for each slot (primary, secondary, explosive etc.), you get equipment tokens (not sure if thats what they are called). They do not cost anything but are reduced everytime you equip a weapon, explosive or attatchment (some equipments are worth more than others, for example, a laser sight uses 4 tokens where as a red dot sight uses 1). If you remove an attatchment, for example, then you get your tokens back.This system is such an effective and streamlined mechanism which, at first, I thought would be a mediocre and half-arsed twist to another FPS title.\n\nTo conclude, this game is the greatest alternative to EA's latest installments of Battlefield. Especially since this game isn't £50 and can go as low as £2! It nurtures a community that is not so salty, a rarity in the FPS genre. Just grab it or go and lick the ♥♥♥♥ stain that has been left behind.","December 19, 2015","true","9.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Can't really say why, I guess because they were too fast paced, too hectic and based on individual achievements rather than anything else. So I was quite surprised to find myself saying "I think I want to try this" after watching one of many presentational videos about Insurgency. Since then, almost two months later, I can easily say that Insurgency is a great game. Not a perfect one, as just like anything else it has its flaws and such, but I'm not here to capitalise on that. Instead, I would like to underline the main component that makes this game very enjoyable and rewarding - teamplay. Because the whole game, no matter what mode you're playing, is built around objectives; you can have an incredible K/D ratio, going through the enemy team as a hot knife through butter, but if you do not coordinate with your team and work towards the same goal it will most likely be futile. You do not have to rush it, in fact it would be advisible to take it slowly, cover your teammates, provide covering fire and work as a unit while moving towards the target. And even if you don't get a single kill but instead create a distraction at the other end of the map, distracting opposing players and thus creating an opening for your teammates to capture an objective it is incredibly rewarding. Personally, I will choose this over a great individual performance any day.","March 19, 2014","true","335.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

The best comparison would be Red Orchestra and Rising Storm but with less class orientation, and multiplayer only. The game improves in many aspects upon the original Counter Strike Mod and it’s now a really unique, realistic game.\n\nThe scenery and the graphics are nice (using Source engine) but nothing groundbreaking compared to AAA games on the market. Never the less it gives a good overall look and feel and works great.\n\nThe true focus is the gameplay, which is downright excellent and fun. It is realistic, unforgiving and challenging but really fun and heart pumping. Team play is a must and you will need tactical thinking to survive. There are many game modes, where you either fight for control points or destroying enemy caches (or annihilate the opposing forces). There is also Co-op against AI enemy (terrorist hunt) which is really fun to play with few of your friends.\n\nThe weapon designs are fantastic and there is a ton of customization to go for, as well as Workshop support additionally. Each weapon sounds and feels realistic so you can almost feel the force feedback in your mouse.\n\nThe best thing is the free DLC policy and the Continuous support with updates featuring new maps, enhancements, weapons and so on every week.\n\nIf you are looking for a game which holds more tactical thinking and realism than Counter Strike or Battlefield than you MUST buy this game.

What I mean by that, is that if you are into slow paced, intense, realistic battles. Then you've found the right game here.\n\nGameplay and environmentInsurgency allows you the player to play alongside either insurgent or security forces, where you'll be given class specific weaponry to aid the rest of the team with. From this you can choose to be a sniper which only one to two can be present or a rifleman of sorts where you can carry explosives or a normal rifle. After you then have the choice of customizing your gear, where you could give yourself a holosight or scope. Suppressor or heavy barrel. You can also give yourself frags or smoke grenades, light or heavy armor and a chest rig or carrier. Then, you spawn into the world.\n\nThe world is unforgiving, you have one life where then you'll have to wait for another wave to get back in. Bullets are quick and you'll be shot before you hear the bang most of the time. From urban landscapes to outback terrain, your eyes have to always be peeled. Watching the rooftops for sharpshooters and alleys for assaulter's and machine gunners. You'll never feel safe in one place and always on the tip of your toes. Insurgency in one of those games where camping is playing the objective, keeping it safe and hard scoping is the only way.\n\nGraphics, Sounds and MechanicsThe world of Insurgency is nicely portrayed. Obviously being a source engine game you can't expect too much from graphics as it's no cry engine replacement. But it has its own quality and beauty to it. Sound is great making sure that the grunt and giveaways of firearms can be heard in the reloads along side with the well heard, life like bangs of the firearms. Mechanics are great, nothing too complicated like Arma or simple like the arrow keys but a nice balance in between. There is lean mechanics, a call out mechanic, voip, crouch, prone, jump and all the usual rest you can think of. You can change the firing mode, and aim down sights. Its controls makes it like a hardcore Battlefield 4 sort.\n\nWorkshopOther than the world of Insurgency, you also have a world outside of the one you mostly know. The workshop. many modders have model replacements, re-textures and sound packs. Others have animations and some maps and game modes. Insurgency has an extremely diverse and much alive community, and as a modder myself can say this. It is easy to completely replace the games weapons and its looks with the amount of mods out there!\n\nOverall Insurgency is a great game and is worth the purchase if you ask me. New World Interactive release patches and free content frequently (not all the time but a pleasant amount) and the community is great. If I were to rate the game it would be a\n9/10I truly love the game but I believe that it could be improved a tad bit more such as adding more weaponry and customization in my opinion.","September 27, 2015","true","260.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","7"

The bullet ballistics are A+ and the constant presence of danger around ever corner really puts urgent feeling into the gameplay, regardless of what type of game mode you are in.  Unlike shooters like Counterstrike, Insurgency excels not only in it's multiplayer PvP, but in it's co-op game modes like Hunt and Checkpoint, where players either have to eliminate the enemy AI situated throughout the map, or proceed forward and capture points to progress.  The AI in these modes are ruthless and cunning, and overcoming them requires real teamwork and communication.\n\nInsurgency also has an implemented Steam Workshop support, and the modding community has a plethora of available weapon skins, maps, and other downloads to help keep the game fresh.  While the game has a varied and wide selection of weapons available, I hope in future patches and updates they add extras, but that hardly takes away from the game experience.","September 25, 2014","true","29.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrbungle/recommended/222880/","mrbungle","Mr. Dribbles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrbungle/","144 products in account","Insurgency started off as a CS:Source mod in 2007 and is now a standalone indie game that appears to be built on the CS:GO version of the Source engine. The best thing about modders as developers is that they're gamers too. That means this game has an FOV slider, no wonky mouse acceleration on by default, and it's balanced for competitive play.\n\nGameplay-wise, it feels like a combination of Counter-Strike and old CoD "hardcore" mode. The characters can peek around corners and go prone, and it usually only takes one or two bullets to kill a player. The game also has a very minimalist HUD with no obituary - the only way to confirm you've killed a player is to see his dead body.\n\nBeing that this is something of a core gamers' game, you'll find a lot of players who use their microphones and focus on strategy and teamwork. This is not a run and gun deathmatch game, although you could probably have some fun playing that way if you insisted. Unlike most tactical "hardcore" shooters, this game doesn't have slow or clunky character movement. The movement is smooth and fast, and the gunplay is satisfying with just the right amount of recoil.","January 25, 2014","true","40.5"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","6"

Subsonic and supersonic bullet sounds different whizzing pass you, impact sounds makes you duck without overblown blurring of the screen or aim shaking. Best of all is the pacing; you are always in a CQB situation and never too far away from any action.\n\nIt isn’t complete; there is not much gun interaction with the environment, like resting on surfaces or longer rifle getting noticeable unwieldy in confined spaces. It does however have a decent bipod system for LMG and SAW.\n\nHighly recommended if you are looking for a shooter more to the realism side without getting too slow.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/travvey/recommended/222880/","travvey","✳PoPoWanObi✳","http://steamcommunity.com/id/travvey/","147 products in account","I've decided to post a review, after a very unsettling event.\n\nI bought this game, purely to re-live my long lost Socom dream. Mod developer (and now official developer), @redline, created this wonderful mod that brings back the classics and memories of our favorite Socom 1 and 2 maps. My first day logging in, I was so full of excitement I spent time running around the maps in the ranked rooms just enjoying the feeling. It was wonderful! They've taken good care and have done a wonderful job in the creation of how the map designs are, to how smooth the game play feels.\n\nI had started playing on Dec 13th, the day I discovered the game. I was hooked. I was logging in 8+ hours per day. I managed to get onto the leaderboards at probably 25 or so (due to how the tcs system works). Then they did their first ranked leaderboards reset. I managed to play a few days after the reset, and I popped into rank 1! It was pretty cool, but I had to go onto holidays, so my rank eventually plumetted. When I returned from holidays, on about January 8th, I began to play hard and focus on returning to that top rank. It was a struggle. I seemed to loom around rank 10-15 for a week or so, then I found a friend whom I got along great with and we were really great at communicating. Calling stuff out in Teamspeak; watching eachothers back (yeah, it may be a dirty trick, but you can't really avoid it, in the online world).\n\nAfter a long grind, of many hours played per day (I'm talking now, like 8-12+ hours per day; of pub stumps (destroying noobs), planting bombs, extracting hostages constantly, with the assistance of my fellows, I managed to re-emerge to that rank 1 position. This was achieved on Jan 17, late-night, around 11:00PM EST. I proceeded to farm more TCS in order to attempt to maintain this position for as long as possible. The day now, is Jan 19th. I get off work, decide to pop into play more Socom Source, and boom... Banned.\n\nI'll be honest, at this point I'm kind of depressed about the matter. There has been spectulation about me using code 9 (i.e., hacks -- such as wallhacks and aimbots) but that couldn't be any further from the truth. Anyone who knows me, knows I play games on a competitive level. I've been playing SBG's (Skill-based games) since I was a kid. I never came to Socom to be the best player, on the console I never was. I will never be as good with a controller as anyone with a kb/mouse combo. Alas, I managed to emerge as #1 again, only to find myself banned.\n\nOf course there was no discussion on the matter, and no, I will not appeal to have myself unbanned. While I want to say that it is unfair judgement, I believe they have decided based on a majority of community decision. People have been reporting me often, for what I can't say. I rely on communition and I call out every position I see. If communication out-side of game dictates what people call as wallhacking, then I am an abuser.\n\nAll-in-all, I want what is best for the Socom community, and if that means that they want me removed from it, then so-be-it. It has been an absolute pleasure being able to re-live it, and redline, BigZ (and any others), you guys have done a tremendous job, keep up the great work. I look forward to watching some streamers/youtubers in the future to see how much you are all able to pull off.\n\n\n\n;;TL;DR\nI highly recommend this game to people who are interested in re-living their Socom fantasies. The mod developers at Socom Source have done a tremendous job and they deserve every bit of credit they have done.","January 19","true","172.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","3"

Its very first iteration started out life as a mod for Half-Life 2, but a turbulent post-release development period ultimately led to its demise. Luckily, its lead developers banded back together at New World Interactive, and following a failed Kickstarter but a remarkably successful Early Access campaign, Insurgency (initially titled Insurgency 2) is now one of the greatest multiplayer shooters on the market.\n\nIts gameplay offers realism and authenticity of a tremendous caliber, with tense gunplay that relies on tactics and teamwork above all else. A huge offering of game modes that subtly change the game without detracting from its core formula, and a solid selection of maps. There's even a surprisingly excellent co-op component to the game.\n\nAdd to that consistent and remarkable post-release support with great content updates to this day (even a competitive matchmaking system is apparently in the pipeline, which will be an incredible addition to the game) and we can start to see why NWI's commitment to putting Insurgency on the map deserves some attention.

It's a tactical realistic shooter, and it's a step in the right direction. As in 2014, it's a one of it's kind. And it is unique.\nIt looks really good to be on the Source Engine compared to for example Titanfall which uses the same engine.\nThe textures and especially the gun models are some of the best I've seen, to be honest. But, the player models lack quality.\nThe maps looks nice. It's just that. They look nice, but nothing more. They're not good at all. Most of the maps are unfair, so one of the teams has an advantage so their weapon caches for example are in an open field. Easy for their snipers to prevent people from destroying them. And then the other side /team's caches are inbetween buildings and in cover, so the other team can easily go there and destroy the weapon caches without being sniped. On most of the maps, there will usually be one team that has the advantage.\n\nThis pretty much ruins the experience for me.\nSo, all in all.. It deserves a strong 8/10 as maps in a multiplayer-only game is very important.","May 14, 2014","true","58.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You bend down behind cover because you fear for your life. It seems like the fight just settled down. So do you. You sit down, and starts to reload your RPK, while preparing your pistol for another Close Quarter encouter. You think: "This is going pretty well. I've encountered ten enemies without even getting shot yet! I'm immortal, I guess." Bang. Shot in the chest twice, by an enemy coming from behind.\n\nYup. Two shots is enough. Not any of that Call Of Duty crap. Two shots can kill you in this game.\n\nAnd that is the great part! Players don't just run out from their cover and starts Rambo'ing through the whole map. And that makes the game more fun, if you ask me.\n\nYou'll also learn to worship your life more, as you're not just able to respawn after you've been killed.\nYou have to wait until next spawn wave, or wait for your team to capture a strategic position.\nSometimes, you will end up, being the last guy on the team alive. This creates some really cool Last-stand moments.\n\nOne more cool feature I really appreciate.. No "Player1 killed Player2" information in the upper right corner! If you wanna know if you killed a guy, you'll have to see him die, or just hope for it!\n\nSo to wrap this whole thing up.. This is kinda like a real war simulation game.\nIt's like Arma, but much more fast-paced.\n\n(Go look for a clan of some sort.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elgerjp/recommended/222880/","elgerjp","ElgerJP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elgerjp/","301 products in account","Review on Portuguese and English\nAnálise em Português e Inglês\n\n\nReview on English\nAnálise em Inglês\nSUMMARY: Insurgency is a FPS (First-Person Shooter) game with tactical elements that tend to realism but can be configured to become arcade (this depending on the server). Even the game not having a campaign to get more interesting, it's exclusively focused to the cooperative (against AI-controlled bots) and to the Multiplayer (against real enemies).\nEntering the game, the player can choose to join the Insurgents team or to the Security team, both have their own classes, weapons and customizations, but even so, the game can keep very well balanced during the match.\nCurrently, Insurgency has 7 different game modes in the Multiplayer, which the maximum server capacity is 32 players, about the cooperative match, the game has 5 different modes and the maximum server capacity is 8 players.\n\nGRAPHICS: As for the graphics we can say that is impressive to see how developers worked to optimize them to the maximum, even with many elements present during a match the game doesn't need a very good PC to run, the graphics stand out for being well modeled and with a excellent finish, the details of the scenarios and weapons also impresses, but it is impossible to compare them to new generation of games, I think the graphics are similar to CS:GO. There are some mods at Steam Workshop that can slightly improve the graphics of the game.\n\nSOUNDS / AUDIOS: Another extremely positive point of Insurgency is the quality of the sounds of weapons, environments and explosions, they can make you get fully into the game, because it seems that you are in a real war, and also, you can download some mods in Steam Workshop that will improve the effect and the experience, letting the game more real (or funny).\n\nPING / FPS: The game has a really good rendering which makes it possible to run even on less powerful computers (if you can run CS:GO on low graphics at 60 FPS, probably can play Insurgency without any problem), and servers respond very well, even with 200 ping, you can play without perceive any difference or interference while the gameplay.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay of Insurgency is a bit different because it tends to the realism, so it becomes a bit more complicated than other FPS games we are used to, always being very fluid and responding well to the requested commands. If you are new to FPS games, maybe you will pass a bit of difficulty, 'cause you don't have a quick answer against enemies or even an advanced coverage notion yet. To the veterans on FPS games can be sure that Insurgency will make you become better at basically every other FPS you play or have played.\nThe physics in the game is a little weak, it tries to hide some mistakes but it doesn't work so much, for example the bodies don't react too well to bullets.\nI didn't find any individual cheating, or doing some bug.\n\nDEVELOPERS: Assets and attentive, the Insurgency Support/Development Team is an example, always trying to help you with any questions or problems you have in the game, unlike many other games, the Developer/Support Community of Insurgency tries to maintain a intense contact with the public, as an example, they play matches with us. You can contact them through Steam if you need something, which makes the service be much faster and easier.\n\nCOMMUNITY: In the sense of Insurgency Players Community, I can not analyze in relation to Asian, Oceania or Africa servers, but the American (all the America, not only U.S.A.) and Europe community are very warm and friendly (also very funny, ALLAHU AKBAR) at every match that I played I didn't find any rager or any that harm your gameplay (such as abusing the voice chat, abusing the chat, or kill his own team with intent). The players community created and are creating a lot of mods to improve or vary your gameplay (some mods are very hilarious), also the artworks and screenshots created from players are very cool.\n\nAnálise em Português\nReview on Portuguese\nRESUMO: Insurgency é um jogo FPS (First-Person Shooter) tático com elementos que tendem para o realismo porém podem ser configurados para deixá-lo bem arcade (isso dependendo do servidor). Mesmo com o jogo não tendo uma campanha para ficar mais interessante, a sua proposta é exclusivamente focada para o cooperativo (contra Bots controlados por IA), e para o Multiplayer (contra inimigos reais). Ao entrar na partida, o jogador poderá escolher entre se unir ao time de Insurgentes ou ao time de Segurança, ambos possuem suas próprias classes, armas e customizações, mas mesmo assim, o jogo consegue manter um balanceamento muito bom durante a partida.\n\nGRÁFICOS: Em relação aos gráficos é possível afirmar que é impressionante ver como os desenvolvedores trabalharam para otimizá-los ao máximo, mesmo com muitos elementos presentes durante uma partida isso não o torna pesado de maneira alguma, se destacam por serem bem modelados e com um acabamento excelente, o detalhamento dos cenários e das armas também impressiona.\n\nSONS/ÁUDIOS: Outro extremo ponto positivo de Insurgency é a quantidade de riqueza e qualidade dos sons das armas, ambientes e explosões, é possível você se imergir totalmente ao jogo, por conta destes que o fazem parecer que realmente está em uma guerra, no Workshop também é possível você alterar alguns sons de armas, explosões, e outros efeitos para deixá-lo ainda mais real.\n\nPING/FPS: O jogo possui uma renderização muita boa a qual o faz ser possível de rodar mesmo em computadores menos potentes (se você consegue rodar CS:GO com gráficos baixos a 60 FPS, provavelmente conseguirá jogar Insurgency sem nenhum problema), e os servidores respondem muito bem, até 200 de ping é possível você jogar sem nem mesmo perceber diferença ou interferência durante sua gameplay.\n\nJOGABILIDADE: A jogabilidade do Insurgency é um pouco diferenciada e por conta de o jogo tender mais para o realismo ela se torna um pouco mais complicada do que outros jogos de FPS que estamos acostumados, sempre sendo muito fluída e respondendo bem aos comandos solicitados, caso você seja iniciante em jogos do gênero pode ser que passe dificuldade para conseguir ter uma resposta rápida contra os inimigos ou mesmo uma noção de cobertura avançada. Aos mais veteranos em jogos FPS posso ter certeza que Insurgency fará com que você se torne melhor em basicamente todos os outros FPS' que você joga ou já jogou, por conta da estratégia e velocidade de reação que é necessária durante a partida.\nNão consegui encontrar nenhum individuo trapaceando seja com programas maliciosos ou com bugs no próprio jogo.\n\nDESENVOLVEDORES: Ativos e atentos, a equipe de desenvolvimento do Insurgency é um exemplo, sempre buscam lhe ajudar com qualquer dúvida ou problema que você tenha no jogo, ao contrário de muitos outros jogos, a comunidade desenvolvedora de Insurgency tenta manter um contato forte com o público jogando até mesmo partidas juntos com outros jogadores, é possível contatá-los através da Steam caso necessite de algo, o que faz o atendimento ser muito mais rápido e fácil.\n\nCOMUNIDADE: No sentido da comunidade de jogadores do Insurgency, eu não posso analisar em relação a servidores asiáticos, da Oceania ou africanos, porém a comunide americana (toda a América, não só EUA) e europeia é muito amigável e receptiva (além de muito engraçada, ALLAHU AKBAR), em nenhuma partida que joguei consegui testemunhar atos que prejudiquem o gameplay de outros (como abusar do canal de voz, canal de texto, ou matar a própria equipe com intenção). O jogo permite que a comunidade poste Mods na workshop para diversificar e deixar o jogo com maior estilo do jogador assim como preferir.","December 26, 2015","true","40.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

This game features a variety of things to spice up the generic genre including: free-aim system(your gun isn't pointing in a constant direction such as in games like Counter-Strike), customization of guns, equipment, armor, etc., a supression system(rewarding for various high ammunition guns such as a MG to supress enemies being cover causing them to blur vision, increase sway, etc.), dedicated server support, multiple gamemodes, etc.\n\nCombat is simple and there's a fair learning curve, with a few factors that affect your combat such as hitbox multipliers and whatever gun you use. Focuses a lot on taking objectives(this is visible especially when you earn a proportionally higher score for taking an objective opposed to getting a kill(100 for securing an objective opposed to 10 points for every kill). Customization of your class would present new and diverse classes that fit your playstyle the best(start with a set amount of inventory points depending on your class, and then choose your gun, its attachments, armor, vest, explosives, etc. which is only limited, by then, a weight system). Decision-making is generally a big part of the game as well(ex1. should I turn on my night vision goggles or not(because it takes a few seconds for it to be useful and not blind you), ex2. should I go capture B or defend A), and like most games you'll lose the game/round because of poor decision-making\n\nA new DLC, not too long ago, brought the expansion of night maps with the addition of night vision goggles, flashlights, flares, flare guns, etc. to the battlefield. Maps are well-made and detailed for combat.\n\nThe general community is above average, considering toxicity only comes from general trolls.  Communication is a lot more useful in this game compared to other games in the genre.\n\nSome of the cons are a lack of a definitive leaderboard/ranking system(the one right now is purely aesthetic and is based on how much score you accumulate). Another one being a few exploiters(not much, but there are still some), however VAC and server owners/admins handle them quite well.\n\nTL;DR: Fun, challenging game in the shooter genre that builds and tweaks off of  minor features to create realistic gameplay","December 30, 2014","true","14.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

You bend down behind cover because you fear for your life. It seems like the fight just settled down. So do you. You sit down, and starts to reload your RPK, while preparing your pistol for another Close Quarter encouter. You think: "This is going pretty well. I've encountered ten enemies without even getting shot yet! I'm immortal, I guess." Bang. Shot in the chest twice, by an enemy coming from behind.\n\nYup. Two shots is enough. Not any of that Call Of Duty crap. Two shots can kill you in this game.\n\nAnd that is the great part! Players don't just run out from their cover and starts Rambo'ing through the whole map. And that makes the game more fun, if you ask me.\n\nYou'll also learn to worship your life more, as you're not just able to respawn after you've been killed.\nYou have to wait until next spawn wave, or wait for your team to capture a strategic position.\nSometimes, you will end up, being the last guy on the team alive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elgerjp/recommended/222880/","elgerjp","ElgerJP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elgerjp/","301 products in account","Review on Portuguese and English\nAnálise em Português e Inglês\n\n\nReview on English\nAnálise em Inglês\nSUMMARY: Insurgency is a FPS (First-Person Shooter) game with tactical elements that tend to realism but can be configured to become arcade (this depending on the server). Even the game not having a campaign to get more interesting, it's exclusively focused to the cooperative (against AI-controlled bots) and to the Multiplayer (against real enemies).\nEntering the game, the player can choose to join the Insurgents team or to the Security team, both have their own classes, weapons and customizations, but even so, the game can keep very well balanced during the match.\nCurrently, Insurgency has 7 different game modes in the Multiplayer, which the maximum server capacity is 32 players, about the cooperative match, the game has 5 different modes and the maximum server capacity is 8 players.\n\nGRAPHICS: As for the graphics we can say that is impressive to see how developers worked to optimize them to the maximum, even with many elements present during a match the game doesn't need a very good PC to run, the graphics stand out for being well modeled and with a excellent finish, the details of the scenarios and weapons also impresses, but it is impossible to compare them to new generation of games, I think the graphics are similar to CS:GO. There are some mods at Steam Workshop that can slightly improve the graphics of the game.\n\nSOUNDS / AUDIOS: Another extremely positive point of Insurgency is the quality of the sounds of weapons, environments and explosions, they can make you get fully into the game, because it seems that you are in a real war, and also, you can download some mods in Steam Workshop that will improve the effect and the experience, letting the game more real (or funny).\n\nPING / FPS: The game has a really good rendering which makes it possible to run even on less powerful computers (if you can run CS:GO on low graphics at 60 FPS, probably can play Insurgency without any problem), and servers respond very well, even with 200 ping, you can play without perceive any difference or interference while the gameplay.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay of Insurgency is a bit different because it tends to the realism, so it becomes a bit more complicated than other FPS games we are used to, always being very fluid and responding well to the requested commands. If you are new to FPS games, maybe you will pass a bit of difficulty, 'cause you don't have a quick answer against enemies or even an advanced coverage notion yet. To the veterans on FPS games can be sure that Insurgency will make you become better at basically every other FPS you play or have played.\nThe physics in the game is a little weak, it tries to hide some mistakes but it doesn't work so much, for example the bodies don't react too well to bullets.\nI didn't find any individual cheating, or doing some bug.\n\nDEVELOPERS: Assets and attentive, the Insurgency Support/Development Team is an example, always trying to help you with any questions or problems you have in the game, unlike many other games, the Developer/Support Community of Insurgency tries to maintain a intense contact with the public, as an example, they play matches with us. You can contact them through Steam if you need something, which makes the service be much faster and easier.\n\nCOMMUNITY: In the sense of Insurgency Players Community, I can not analyze in relation to Asian, Oceania or Africa servers, but the American (all the America, not only U.S.A.) and Europe community are very warm and friendly (also very funny, ALLAHU AKBAR) at every match that I played I didn't find any rager or any that harm your gameplay (such as abusing the voice chat, abusing the chat, or kill his own team with intent). The players community created and are creating a lot of mods to improve or vary your gameplay (some mods are very hilarious), also the artworks and screenshots created from players are very cool.\n\nAnálise em Português\nReview on Portuguese\nRESUMO: Insurgency é um jogo FPS (First-Person Shooter) tático com elementos que tendem para o realismo porém podem ser configurados para deixá-lo bem arcade (isso dependendo do servidor). Mesmo com o jogo não tendo uma campanha para ficar mais interessante, a sua proposta é exclusivamente focada para o cooperativo (contra Bots controlados por IA), e para o Multiplayer (contra inimigos reais). Ao entrar na partida, o jogador poderá escolher entre se unir ao time de Insurgentes ou ao time de Segurança, ambos possuem suas próprias classes, armas e customizações, mas mesmo assim, o jogo consegue manter um balanceamento muito bom durante a partida.\n\nGRÁFICOS: Em relação aos gráficos é possível afirmar que é impressionante ver como os desenvolvedores trabalharam para otimizá-los ao máximo, mesmo com muitos elementos presentes durante uma partida isso não o torna pesado de maneira alguma, se destacam por serem bem modelados e com um acabamento excelente, o detalhamento dos cenários e das armas também impressiona.\n\nSONS/ÁUDIOS: Outro extremo ponto positivo de Insurgency é a quantidade de riqueza e qualidade dos sons das armas, ambientes e explosões, é possível você se imergir totalmente ao jogo, por conta destes que o fazem parecer que realmente está em uma guerra, no Workshop também é possível você alterar alguns sons de armas, explosões, e outros efeitos para deixá-lo ainda mais real.\n\nPING/FPS: O jogo possui uma renderização muita boa a qual o faz ser possível de rodar mesmo em computadores menos potentes (se você consegue rodar CS:GO com gráficos baixos a 60 FPS, provavelmente conseguirá jogar Insurgency sem nenhum problema), e os servidores respondem muito bem, até 200 de ping é possível você jogar sem nem mesmo perceber diferença ou interferência durante sua gameplay.\n\nJOGABILIDADE: A jogabilidade do Insurgency é um pouco diferenciada e por conta de o jogo tender mais para o realismo ela se torna um pouco mais complicada do que outros jogos de FPS que estamos acostumados, sempre sendo muito fluída e respondendo bem aos comandos solicitados, caso você seja iniciante em jogos do gênero pode ser que passe dificuldade para conseguir ter uma resposta rápida contra os inimigos ou mesmo uma noção de cobertura avançada. Aos mais veteranos em jogos FPS posso ter certeza que Insurgency fará com que você se torne melhor em basicamente todos os outros FPS' que você joga ou já jogou, por conta da estratégia e velocidade de reação que é necessária durante a partida.\nNão consegui encontrar nenhum individuo trapaceando seja com programas maliciosos ou com bugs no próprio jogo.\n\nDESENVOLVEDORES: Ativos e atentos, a equipe de desenvolvimento do Insurgency é um exemplo, sempre buscam lhe ajudar com qualquer dúvida ou problema que você tenha no jogo, ao contrário de muitos outros jogos, a comunidade desenvolvedora de Insurgency tenta manter um contato forte com o público jogando até mesmo partidas juntos com outros jogadores, é possível contatá-los através da Steam caso necessite de algo, o que faz o atendimento ser muito mais rápido e fácil.\n\nCOMUNIDADE: No sentido da comunidade de jogadores do Insurgency, eu não posso analisar em relação a servidores asiáticos, da Oceania ou africanos, porém a comunide americana (toda a América, não só EUA) e europeia é muito amigável e receptiva (além de muito engraçada, ALLAHU AKBAR), em nenhuma partida que joguei consegui testemunhar atos que prejudiquem o gameplay de outros (como abusar do canal de voz, canal de texto, ou matar a própria equipe com intenção). O jogo permite que a comunidade poste Mods na workshop para diversificar e deixar o jogo com maior estilo do jogador assim como preferir.","December 26, 2015","true","40.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

It brings the fast-paced CQC action and brings that system where you can't stay alive on your own against overwhelming numbers heading towards you into your flanks. The game runs on very good reasons to take cover. It is a very fluent game with devs still updating it time-to-time when possible. Insurgency deletes that Call of Duty or Counter-strike feeling where you can just hipfire everyone and get a killstreak, drop a nuke or something, there is a free aim feature that is part of the game. Indeed it does bring a good portion of simulation feeling to it, with a big bit of arcade-like playability.\n\nAnd if you do not want to play PvP, you can always practice on Single Player, or play Co-op with friends to stretch out your way of combat into the game and later on apply it against other players.\n\nThere is, however a downside on certain maps, as well as the all mighty unsupressable AI. The AI is reasonable.\nAs for the maps, however, they need a little bit more of fixing to be easier for the offensive to get to it.(I'm looking at you, Sinjar and Peak.) Yes, you can reach and cap them, but you'd need a cooperative team, then.\n\nTo sum it all up, Insurgency is a fun game to try out, it is very replayable, there is a fine amount of guns to chose from(For all you crazy firearm fans out there.)And the squad classes all have different choices of them. I so recommend this fantastic game added to your virtual shelves, if you haven't yet.\n\n\n","April 29, 2015","true","262.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Its mixture of one-shot kills and a fast round-based game structure make it a great compromise between Counter Strike's arcade-like style of gameplay and the realistic/extremely tactical nature of games like Red Orchestra and ARMA.\n\nAlso, while this is entirely unrelated to the quality of the game itself, I may as well mention that if you're a Coloradoan I'd recommend buying this just to support the fledgling game development scene that's slowly emerging here. C'mon, we can't let California and Washington dominate the market forever.\n\nOne last thing: NWI's DLC policy is fantastic; I highly recommend reading up on it if you get the chance.\n\nEdit: As NWI will soon be moving to","May 28, 2015","true","88.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Feels good.\n\nBreached through a narrow alleyway with a shotgun and broke a stalemate which ended in a win for us. The team saying “good play” really made that moment for me\n\nI die as the last one left to an enemy hiding in a corner, a few meters away from the objective. I don’t get flamed, instead everyone says “good try” either in mic or in chat.\n\nJoin a random game and the team is seamless in its pushing and defending, allowing us to complete a map in record time.\n\nJoin a wave defence game mode with random people and we all take an entrance, calling out when we die and what we were covering. We all set a new record for ourselves in that game, the feeling is great.\n\nI ask to swap roles with a random person, despite them being the MVP, the answer? “Sure!”\n\nJoining a server to find two guys playing Arabic music over their microphones while using fully automatic AK-47s and shooting only from the hip\n\nLow points:-\n3 people are running around with knives stabbing their own team mates to death and vote kicking them… *great*\n\nSomeone is shouting down the mic while trying to eat it again…\n\nJoined a game, selected my loadout after 20 seconds of "umm" and "ahh?", only to be killed by an RPG as I spawned\n\nJoin a game as the last man standing, took down 14/16 enemies before dying, becoming the MVP in that round alone. The result: kicked.\n\nTeam recently took a point; I respawn on that said point and die instantly to a grenade within two seconds. Back to waiting to spawn for another 6 minutes…\n\nTeam takes a point and I take this opportunity to reconfigure my loadout, but I’m still in the game and basically standing in a wipe open room with no cover nearby while I play loadout simulator. I die while equipping…this happens several times over the 10 hours.\n\nEveryone decides to huddle round a corner waiting to get hit by an RPG.\n\nEveryone huddles round a corner and gets hit by an RPG, killing 6/8 of the team.\n\n===================================================================\n\nA lot of the complaints I have about insurgency are mainly to do with the few bad apples of the bunch. For every 6 games I play I normally have 1 game that’s a nightmare to play and that I normally end up leaving early on.\n\nAs far as the game goes; the sound assets are perfect, the gameplay is great, the teamwork is even better and there isn’t a single thing I could pick out as a bad point. The only thing I mildly dislike is how quickly you can crouch, leading to people dropping to a crouched position as soon as they see you, which can be frustrating sometimes.\nIf you are easily frustrated and impatient in general, I wouldn’t recommend playing Insurgency, running around spraying from the hip and wanting to get kill streaks isn’t rewarded. The atmosphere is very tense and fire fights are normally very quick.\n\nDepending on your armour, you can take a few shots to the body if the shooter doesn’t have armour piercing rounds, but a headshot is a headshot and normally you will go down in 1 shot. No excuses.\n\nIf you don’t mind leaving a small handful games due to horrible people, then Insurgency will take the place of pretty much every FPS shooter in your Steam library. Insurgency fits perfectly between more realistic than Counter Strike but not as hard-core and overwhelming as ARMA","January 14","true","46.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It will be frustrating and it will seem like you died for no reason. But the only reason you died is because you exposed yourself. 1 bullet is more than enough to kill. So be careful, and treat it like your own life. Start out in more public games, once you hit 30 of 50 hours, you get a good idea of the maps and you can move on to competence 5v5. That's when ♥♥♥♥ gets real. There are tons of teams and if you are decent at the game the community is very nice. Even if you think you know what you're doing remember that there is always, ALWAYS, something more to learn.

There are full conversions for the game, like a Vietnam one is coming out soon. So it's like you're buying 5 games instead of one.BUY IT. It's only 15 damn dollars you foking cheapskate. Drop your silly battlefield and counter strike and play like a real man. Who needs health bars and ammo counters and no friendly fire. GET THE DAMN GAME. Also, one quick note, there seems to be a small amount of idiots who think that bullets drop like rocks. This is NOT TRUE.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelam43/recommended/222880/","xelam43","[NWE] Dreamz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelam43/","121 products in account","Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat was a free multiplayer first person shooter mod for Valve’s Source Engine that was released on Steam back in 2007. The mod placed an emphasis on realism and teamwork, and cultivated a loyal fan-base of dedicated players. Indie developer New World Interactive, which consists of members of the original mod team, has brought the concept back, now as a standalone game simply titled Insurgency. Despite a failed a kickstarter campaign back in 2012, the game has now made it to full release on Steam.\n\nThe core fundamentals of what Insurgency aims to be are very similar to those of the original mod. The game’s prime focus is to provide a realistic portrayal of modern combat with objective based gameplay and an emphasis on teamwork, and in that respect it is a success. The obvious aspect of Insurgency that really lends to the realistic feel and distinguishes it from most other multiplayer shooters is the damage model. Weapon damage is handled much more realistically than most other shooters, meaning a single shot will more often than not be enough to kill you. This gives the game an outstanding sense of urgency and brings the need for careful and tactical play to the forefront.\n\nComplimenting the tension the fragility of your character provides, the majority of the game modes in Insurgency feature either limited or no respawns, so staying alive is of paramount importance. On the topic of modes, the game has good variety of different game types, though interestingly there is no deathmatch. The standout mode is “firefight”, which is a mix of “last team standing” and a territory capture mode. The goal of this mode is to either capture all three territories on the map or eliminate the entire enemy team. The twist is that every time you capture a territory all your teammates respawn. This gives the mode an outstanding intensity, where the tide can turn in the blink of an eye. We had instances where only a single teammate remained against overwhelming odds, but he managed to capture a territory and bring our entire time back into the fight, suddenly shifting the odds back into our favor. Rounds in this mode can be very brief or last quite a while, with hard swings and a tug-of-war feeling to the back and forth nature of the mode.\n\nNot all of the modes are as unique as firefight, but even the ones that are typical FPS game types are enjoyable due to the tactical gameplay and solid weapon handling. Weapon handling is one of those intangible things in shooters that can be hard to quantify, but you know when it feels it right, and it definitely feels right in Insurgency. The game has absolutely phenomenal sound effects that give the weapons a satisfying punch when you fire, but it’s also little things that really stand out, like the subtle and believable way the weapon sways while you move. Recoil also feels just right, and the different types of weapons all sound and feel different. Having weapons that are enjoyable to fire is one of the most important aspects of a first person shooter, and Insurgency completely nails it.\n\nWhen looking at the core pillars of what makes a multiplayer shooter great, you’ve got the actual shooting mechanics, the game modes, and the maps you play them on, and unfortunately Insurgency isn’t quite as strong in the latter department as it is in the two preceding areas. The game features a decent number of maps, but none come across as being especially memorable, and too often they are hard to even tell apart. The majority of the maps take place in urban middle eastern environments, and overall just feel too similar. Visually, the game isn’t super impressive, possessing that distinctive look of the source engine in terms of environments and geometry. It isn’t just that the maps are visually unimpressive, but that they don’t feel as thoughtfully designed as some other games. The maps seem to be designed to appear like realistic locations more than as arenas for gameplay to take place in. That’s certainly a valid approach, but often there will be rooms that feel pointless and paths that seem as though they should be passable but aren’t. The maps don’t hurt the game all that much, as the other aspects of the game are very good, but they could be better.\n\nThese days, the majority of multiplayer shooters feature customizable loadouts and a persistent leveling system, but Insurgency takes a different approach. Instead of having weapons that are unlocked through the course of play, you have all equipment and weapons available from the outset. When a match first begins, you choose a class, but there are only a certain amount per team. Each team consists of two squads which each have a set of classes to choose from (determined by the game mode). Once a player selects a class, it is claimed and can’t be selected by anyone else. Once you select a class, you will start with a set loadout, but you have the opportunity to customize if you so choose. Each class has access to specific weapons and equipment, which each have a point value associated with them. Everyone starts with the same amount of points, which gives you the freedom to customize without sacrificing game balance.\n\nIt’s not just that the game doesn’t tie the loadout system in with player progression, but that it doesn’t have any form of player progression at all. Some purists may be in favor of this, distilling the game down to gameplay and forgoing all the “carrot on a stick” external hooks, but many are going to find the lack of any persistence disappointing. Lacking a pointless number next to your name that goes up just for playing isn’t a huge loss, but the game doesn’t have any form of stat tracking or ranking system whatsoever, which is a kind of expected at this point. The lack of persistence is just one of the ways in which Insurgency feels a bit dated. Another, and a fundamental issue with the game, is that there is no easy way to play with your friends. The game doesn’t have any sort of party system or friends list integration. If you want to play with friends you are going to have to find a server with enough space to get everyone in and then scramble around trying to get everyone on the same team. It’s a minor inconvenience, but one you’re going to have to deal with every single match if you plan on playing with friends.\n\nClosing Comments:\n\nWith the absurd number of multiplayer shooters available on steam, Insurgency stands out as one with both great gameplay and some degree of uniqueness. Yes, it’s yet another modern military shooter set in the middle east, but it’s adherence to realism and objective based teamplay to go along with satisfying shooting mechanics help it rise above its tired template. It lacks some features most would expect from a shooter released in 2014, most notably any sort of party system, but its tense and exciting tactical gameplay more than makes up for it. If you’re sick of the run and gun nature of Call of Duty but find the simulation aspects of something like Arma a bit too daunting, Insurgency is the perfect middle ground, and a supremely enjoyable multiplayer experience.\n\n\nRating: 5 of 5","August 20, 2014","true","456.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

That's because with a very low TTK the game focuses less on twitch shooting and arcade skills but more on tactics and teamwork. Also the game is objective-based and playing the objective is a lot more important than K/D ratios.\n\nThe gunplay and controls are pretty solid and easy to understand (it's a Source game - everyone knows this engine). Once you learn them you need to master 3 things: tactics, teamwork and map knowledge.\n\nTactics - Start by reading the Steam Guides. This game features some real CQB tactics which is nice.\n\nTeamwork - Use a mic. If you don't want to use a mic, don't buy this game. For best effects, either play with your friends or join a clan (there are some good ones.. like the one called TAW or sth). This game requires teamwork and finding team-oriented players on pub servers is a hit-or-miss.\n\nMap knowledge - this comes with experience. The maps are pretty good, small but detailed, with many flanking routes.\n\nThe game's technical quality is ok. I mean it's what you can expect from an indie Source engine game.\n\nThe devs are great and really supportive and constantly add new content to the game. New updates are released more than once a month!\n\nGenerally it's very good online FPS. Quite fast-paced, very tactical, not overly complicated. For me this game is a perfect mix between realistic and arcadey.","September 23, 2014","true","215.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The developers focused on creating a game which was a realistic hardcore military shooter, and they succeeded.   As a player you are not given any benefits of having a HUD like in other shooters ie. Counter Strike or Call of Duty; not knowing how many bullets are left in the chamber or who is friendly.  Additionally, friendly fire is always turned off so be careful.\n\nPros:\n+ The graphics are spectacular everything from the blade of grass to the smoke grenades.\n+ The sound effects are intense, not many games pull of realistic sound effects like gun shots and grenades.\n+ As a player you have the ability to play as both Security Forces & Terrorists - Similar dynamic as in Counter Strike.\n+ You have the ability to customize weapons, due to the fact this is a realistic simulation you can only customize by weight & points system.  This system makes it so that you have to decide if you want features like a scope or silencer etc.\n+ Each player has to pick a specific class upon joining a team. Each class has specific weapons types and gun modifications, making it a unique game experience with each class. -- Being a realistic simulation each team only has a select number of people in each class - ie. no more than 2 snipers per team.\n+ Insurgency has a fully functional party experience.  Joining on friends is simple.\n+ Insurgency provides many modes between co-op and regular multiplayer gameplay\n\nCons:\n- As discussed before, each team limits the number of individuals who can play a specific class, due to this, if you wanted to switch classes with another player the only way to switch is if you or the other individual were to swap to the spectator position. I wish there was a request option to change positions with another player.\n\nAs all hardcore games, the quality of the gameplay will depend on your team and communication skills.  This game is hard to master, which can make it both fun and frustrating.\n\nTips: Always reload when you can, beware of your surroundings, and keep your ears open.\n\nVerdict\n9/10","February 27, 2015","true","22.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

This game requires a specfic set of skill that you don't see in other FPS games often. Note, Insurgency is nothing like Call of Duty or Battlefield. ♥♥♥♥ happens in this game. This game gets you on edge, since you can die at any moment. Hitboxes are very well executed. A headshot to your player is an automatic kill. You need ot be careful before advancing anywhere; lean around the corners, flash rooms... Lay smoke for cover. You can buy gear and attachments for weapons with supply points, which varies from every class, from Support to Sniper.. Demolitionist. A few classes have certain weapons, not available for purchase on any other class, so pick what you need. The game and your experience also varies on what gear you take, from weapons to armor. Heavy weapons like a Rocket Launcher or an LMG are very heavy, as well as armor. You can choose to carry light, heavy, or no armor at all. If you want to be quick and swift, go for a small loadout. If you want to be precise, attach a laser sight, which increases accuracy. Adjust firing rate on certain weapons, to your style. Even if you go rushing in with heavy armor and an LMG, you're still extremely vulnerable. You can't just spray down hordes of enemies, you have to control your bursts.  If you just hold down left click, your bullets will go everywhere. At least try to somewhat control where your bullets are going. Always remember to rely and work with your team mates. Take what you need, and form a plan. Teamwork is essential to this Insurgency; remember that.\n\nWell, that was... that. That was basic, overview of the game's mechanics, now onto the review. Insurgency is a great game, if you're looking for a tactical recon-like military shooter. The mechanics, and the look and the feel of Insurgency is fantastic. Insurgency also does well with an array of video options to optimize your experience. This game can relate to a lot of different people and play styles, as well. In short, Insurgency is fantastic, defenitely worth a buy.\n\n10/10 Hope this review helped.","September 27, 2014","true","41.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

These 3 games are the best tactical FPS games I know, and no I do not count Arma as a one because of all of the bugs, crafting/trading system and 3rd person view but whatever, this is a game review and no I'm not trashing or hating on Arma, I just don't like it and that is my personal opinion. So, if you want to test this game out without paying for it just download the free mod, Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat, it's a HL2 mod and it's on Steam, but beware, it has less features than this version and the maps are filled with less detail and there are alot less people playing it but you can kinda get the feeling what this one is all about, oh and btw, the old devs of the mod and a few community members are the devs of the new game. Fast patches/updates and very fast responses, the community is nice and actively involved in the game's development. Overall the game is a 9/10 in it's Early Access State, who knows what the future could but I can tell you one thing, this game will be a big title in the future on Steam, and I hope more games like it come to Steam, for now the other tactical FPS game I'm waiting for is the Somme, hope it is half good as this game.","January 22, 2014","true","96.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I've tried finding substitutes, e.g. Call of duty, Battlefield etc but none live up to the skill that is required in CS.\n\nI'd recommend inrugency to anyone who likes CS, especially if they are getting bored, tired of matchmaking, bad bullet reg etc.\n\nInsurgency requires a high degree of skill when moving and aiming, although the mechanism is different to CS.  In Insurgency you can for example fire from the hip, or look down your sights.  Sounds like COD or Battlefield right?  Except in Insurgency a stray bullet could take you out instantly- you will only be forgiven if you can think and move on your toes, both as an individual and as a unit.\n\nThe game is extremely smooth and based on the Valve Source engine.  It also looks the part- making CS:GO look and feel dated.\n\nAt the end of the day you cant go wrong at the current price.  Insurgency is a true realistic tactical shooter unlike any other, which in my opinion as a CS veteran is not something you come by everyday.\n\nRecommended?

Kills and deaths are more significant, and more rewarding. This is NOT a game where you can sprint around with a knife or run head first into their whole team and shotgun the ♥♥♥♥ out of them.\nThis game is very fun if you can be patient and tactical. Communication and teamwork is the key to success, and makes the game much more fun to play. It's also important to note that the game does a great job at keeping people occupied with defending or attacking objectives (most of the time) - since capturing objectives allows your team to respawn.\nFor those of you who have played and enjoyed Red Orchestra/Rising storm, you may want to consider this game. If you were to take the mechanics and realism from Red Orchestra and apply to to CS:GO, this game is what you'll get.\nFor $15 bucks, I'd say I've gotten my money's worth already, and I haven't put many hours in, just know that you probably won't get the hang of it right away.","February 8, 2014","true","46.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

GAMES. This game is so much dynamic in it's own way that it simply outlasts >ANY< FPS, including "Battlefield 4" or any other linear FPS like it. Either if you love multiplayer or singleplayer stuff in FPS, this is a MUST buy for you. 11/10 with a bad-♥♥♥ seal of approval! This realism in this game (without almost ANY HUD) is just so epic that I don't know how to explain it to you in English or any other language known to Mankind.\n\n"AI" opponents aren't just meat-shields like in other first pearson shooters (as I mentioned above...), one AI here is an equal match to you, if a second one joins up with him... well let's just hope you have a granade so you can throw it and fall back to a better firing position. COVERING yourself and your teammates is a MUST in this game along side with various distractions to win or kill in this game, adding up that it's almost impossible to outgun two+ opponents. Your character is unique and can't carry EVERYTHING on himself, you choose what you must and fits you best, and you are stuck with it. There are tons of weapons and attachments so don't worry too much about it, unless you are a hoarder! O_o\nI just started playing this, and this is money well spent! There is probably a LOT more I didn't mention about this game, but I say you go check it out on your own just as I will now. No regrets 100%\nOnly a fool would miss out on this masterpiece, I will tell you that I always hated most FPS's because they are mostly all the same...

The graphics are perfect for this game, the workshop is constantly a community of people puttong out daily quality mods, for multiplayer Strike and Push, are insanely addictive gametypes when you get into a 8v8 match, anything more than that and my opinion is the maps are not big enough for 12 v 12 or more. It is very very rare to have crashes (that arent mods related) with this game, and it doesnt hurt to support a game that won indie game of the year.\n\nA couple cone - The sounds of the guns can get annoying with their unrealism,  mostly the guns, but the workshop has sound mods to help you with that, im also not a big fan of the RPG, its been nerfed but the AI is insane with spawn-accurate RPG shots.\n\nOverall, This is the best shooter I have bought since at least BF2. Love this game so much fun and so hard, this is one of those games that makes FPS gamers. Highly recommended you cannot go wrong for the current sale price of $4.49!","January 20, 2015","true","214.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaFrae/recommended/222880/","LaFrae","23 SAS Regt, CDR Liam Goulding","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaFrae/","290 products in account","Components+ The gameplay makes you feel like an actual soldier, there is a very scarce HUD, barely telling you ♥♥♥♥ as to where you are or how many bullets you have left in your mag, though it doesn't matter, this isn't Call of Duty where you can spray and reload mid mag and have not wasted an entire magazine. Once you reload, that mag is gone and you have spent it. You have to make decisions carefully, spending bullets wisely. And unlike call of duty, when you are in a firefight between you and the insurgents, they are spraying bullets and not hitting you. Instead they conserve ammunition like actual shooters, and when they do fire, they have a higher chance of hitting you. Which allows for tactics to be used between teammates.\n\n+ It is also very tactical team shooter, having to rely on teammates to get to your objective, distracting so you can flank. Or providing cover fire so you can have time to heal. It requires quite a lot of communication between teammates if you want to get the best result of a match or hunt. Knowing that you have someone’s back and someone has yours, really embraces the team tactical atmosphere.\n\n+ The sound is very realistic, unlike most shooters, there is not background music playing. Instead it sounds like an actual war, if you stand still and listen, you can hear gunfire in the distance between your fellow soldiers and other insurgents. Giving you the sensation of being in an actual war against another country, it actually sets the atmosphere for a war. It is no Normandy in 1944, but it is more like Black Hack Down.\n\n+ The graphics are amazing, to the level where it seems to match battlefield 2142. Saying Battlefield 3 would be too much, as EA wants to make Battlefield the most realistic game out there and they are. Not only do the graphics look amazing, but it doesn’t run your FPS into the ground, making the game very smooth but the client does have a few crash problems. I expected for such a realistic looking game, it would be quite laggy for computers not that powerful, but somehow it does not do that and runs amazingly.\n\n+ And it is also very balanced and lacks bias between players; you don't level up, you don't pay for better guns, you start with the same armoury outfitted for your class selected in class selection, you just choose which one you want and what you want to customize yourself with, whether it be with extra mags to a laser sight on your rifle. Insurgency is one of the best realistic shooters I have ever played, Battlefield and Call of Duty play around on the fictional side of games, where as Insurgency plain focuses on the realism of war. All Insurgency needs is a no heal mode, where you don't just stand and you heal yourself gradually like in COD, it needs to have a zero heal factor and the only way to get yourself out of the red, is a medical kit provided by a medic, that is the only thing I think is a very good idea.\n\n+ There are a lot of diverse game modes for Insurgency; normal team deathmatch, then Co-op Terrorist Hunt, and other Co-op modes. That is what Insurgency does well; it doesn’t fully rely on its PvP multiplayer, but embraces the cooperation multiplayer. It allows players to act as a team and feel like actual soldiers within the game, it is no Call of Duty Co-op Campaign, but it does a lot better than the Modern Warfare 2 & 3 Co-op game mode.\n\nOverallWhen I first played Insurgency, I didn’t know what I was in for, but I do not regret it. Insurgency is a realistic shooter that parts away from shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield where it is constant shooting and unlimited ammunition. Insurgency makes you question each movement and think about each decision, gives you a reliance on your teammates and need for cooperation. That is the best part about Insurgency. It allows and embraces the need of cooperation.\n\nIf I’m not mistaken, there had to be veterans advising the developers of the game to give them the most realistic war shooter game out there. They tell them, “In war you don’t just go guns blazing into a room, you tactically enter it, checking corners and make sure it is clear before moving to the next door” or “We don’t spray our entire mag, we fire at most 3 bullets at a time, we are wary of our ammunition, it is limited”. If they weren’t told that by veterans, they must really have a good understanding of realistic war.\n\nInsurgency seems like a young game and has a lot of room and time for improvement, consider a bigger aspect, like the use of vehicles and separate tactical teams, inserting from different areas, try learning from Rainbow Six or more from real life warfare even though they are doing an amazing job so far. I strongly recommend this game and Insurgency needs a much bugger audience than it does now. I bet Captain Price would be proud of the players of this game; you actually constantly check your corners.","January 7, 2015","true","48.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Not only did I stop playing BF4 I don't see myself going back to any BF or COD or any major developer/publisher FPS franchise for that matter. That includes the upcoming AAA releases. And here's why.\nThey don't get FPSs anymore. They focus their effort on ways to make the game more appealing for general masses and ways to squeeze more $$$ out of players.\nInsurgency is a complete opposite of those traits. Not only is it smooth and responsive it is also unforgiving in the best way. It has  tactical teamplay, guns that have serious punch to them and they feel like destructive devices they are. Dust and sparks are flying, it takes 1-2 bullets to the chest to kill an enemy, there's no mini-map, no HUD and it's unbelivably satisfying.\nDid I forget to tell that since it's release back in 2013 it is still regulary updated and the community keeps growing? If that's not enough I must also add that the modding community is amazing and improves the game vastly in many aspects. Killing even 5 enemies in one life is heart pounding. It is by far the best hardcore FPS avaliable at the moment. If you like this type of games I highly reccomend you give this a try.\nInsurgency like no other FPS deserves to be an E-Sport.\nI've got to thank the YouTuber who goes by the name Matimi0 for making me aware of this gem.

Instead, you should be purchasing this game!\n\nListen, it can be frustrating at first. For the first 10-20 hours or so, you are going to want to throw your computer across the room... You'll yell in frustration as you have no idea why you are dying, struggle to come to grips with the idea that bullets hurt, and wonder why tatics you've used in other multiplayer FPS aren't working. It's going to ♥♥♥♥ you off.\n\nBut stick it out! Once you start to learn some of the tricks, you'll find an intensly rewarding gaming experience. Having well over 200 hours on this game, I still look forward to playing, and it never gets old. You have to remember this is a tactical shooter, so you have to be thinking with that mindset. Your job is to outsmart your enemy and complete objectives. Your K:D ratio isn't the focus of the game, and with the lack of crosshair, your going to have to aim down your sites if you hope to hit anything. Play the objectives, learn the maps and your K:D ratio will go up.\n\nI'm still learning, but a few tips that may help in your adventure: Take it slow. If you try to rush into the firefight, you will die. Quickly. Check your corners, and re-check them. Play the objectives, and the kills will come naturally. Communicate, communicate, communicate. Most imporantly, have fun and don't let the frustration get to you!","June 2, 2014","true","747.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

A lot like RO or Rising Storm. Not much of a hud, you have to manage your ammo, there is no ammo counter. It does realism great!\n\nRealism\nThe way the weapons feel, the way an enemy will drop when you hit thim once center mass, all great. When you get in a confined room with a couple people firing full auto, it feels like something is actually happening, bolts are smashing the back of the recievers, bullets are whizing through the air, the enviroment just feels like its being abused by combat. Hard to explain but it feels realistic.\nWeapons are good for the most part, the AKs in particular have a weight and power to them that I don't think I have seen in any game before. Some weapons are out of place, namely the MP5k, Mini14, Mp40, and M1A1 carbine just don't make sense. I feel like these weapons could have easily been replaced with weapons that made more sense for this theatre. The Mp5 could be full size, Mp40 could be some other sub gun. Just things like that. The models of the weapons look great though!\n\n9/10\n\nGraphics\nLooks great, especially when rounds hit around you, the surpression blur, the way that you see particles flying off walls. After you fire the smoke off the weapon looks great!\n8/10\n\nGameplay\nNot a huge assortment of maps or play styles, but fun. The actually fire fights are immensly fun, fighting through walls(It feel much different then CoD or other games with bullet pen) It's all so much fun.\n9/10\n\nOverall this is a great game, and for $15!!!!

Insurgency feels more complex than it actually is thanks to some well thought out map design and modes to boot, in both Player vs. Player and Co-operative modes.\n\nThere is never a moment where I have thought the game was unbalanced and that's thanks to the Classes and Supply systems. Squads (usually 2 per team, consisting of around 8 players) consists of one of each class, with the exception of sometimes 2 Riflemen/Fighters (straight up assault rifles, pistols and grenades), so you won't get a whole team of Sniper classes not playing the objectives or Demolition classes constantly RPG-ing from afar.\n\nWeapons feel lethal as it takes about 1-2 body shots to take someone down (3+ if your lucky, usually when you get shot in the legs or through cover) and explosives are capable of eliminating an entire team if everyone bunches up (a hard lesson you will learn in Co-op where an Insurgent sees 2 or more of you and takes you all down with one RPG shot, so don't bunch up!).\n\nTo compliment all this is some great sound design and soundtracks. Guns don't sound limp or synthesized, they are realistic and sound like they can do some real damage. The same goes for explosives and bullets pinging off of nearby walls.\n\nThis is also one of the best looking games running on the Source engine, looking as good (if not better) than Counter Strike: Global Offensive especially when it comes to weapon models. Great use of lighting for both day and night time scenarios. Only thing I would fault are the character models, which aren't at all bad but could do with some more work as the textures on them look a little flat.\n\nThere is also mod support through the Steam Workshop, which allows you to make new guns skins/animations/sound packs, levels, characters skins/sound packs and so on which is a great bonus. The game is also regularly updated too with bug fixes and free content such as new maps, modes and more.\n\nTo summarise: For me, Insurgency gets a lot of things right and I really can't fault it, it's a great package at a great price (I bought it at half price on a free weekend, but at full price it's still very much worth it!).\n\nHighly Recommended!

Instead, you should be purchasing this game!\n\nListen, it can be frustrating at first. For the first 10-20 hours or so, you are going to want to throw your computer across the room... You'll yell in frustration as you have no idea why you are dying, struggle to come to grips with the idea that bullets hurt, and wonder why tatics you've used in other multiplayer FPS aren't working. It's going to ♥♥♥♥ you off.\n\nBut stick it out! Once you start to learn some of the tricks, you'll find an intensly rewarding gaming experience. Having well over 200 hours on this game, I still look forward to playing, and it never gets old. You have to remember this is a tactical shooter, so you have to be thinking with that mindset. Your job is to outsmart your enemy and complete objectives. Your K:D ratio isn't the focus of the game, and with the lack of crosshair, your going to have to aim down your sites if you hope to hit anything. Play the objectives, learn the maps and your K:D ratio will go up.\n\nI'm still learning, but a few tips that may help in your adventure: Take it slow. If you try to rush into the firefight, you will die. Quickly. Check your corners, and re-check them. Play the objectives, and the kills will come naturally. Communicate, communicate, communicate. Most imporantly, have fun and don't let the frustration get to you!","June 2, 2014","true","747.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game alright was underrated from the start! I had barely any interest when it first came out but by the time of the summer sale, I regret it soo much. You see, Insurgency is a combination of so many FPS games today such as Counterstrike, Arma, Red Orchestra, Battlefield, even bits of COD too form this hardcore shooter. The game modes offer a variety of fun, yet tense hardcore scenarios ranging from the classic Push mode to the more hardcore Firefight version. The sound quality in this game is amazing! Hearing bullets flying past your head and crashing into the brick wall behind you gives you a very nervous and epic feel to the game that others fail to do. My first taste of the multiplayer was amazing, running towards Point A in Push on Peak to capture it while my teammates fired at the Insurgents in the hills, it felt absolutely immersive and cool. From the PvP multiplayer is when i got into Co-Op.\n\nNow this game mode is seriously AMAZING. The AI somehow overs more intense feelings to the already intense feel in a more realistic yet surprising factor. Lets just say the AI is stupid, but at the same time smart. Yes, they have the same extremely amazing accuracy but that just makes it more frusturating. The thing is, they throw grenade and molotovs that actually AFFECT you. I was in a game where my team was trying to push through a building to capture the point when a bot threw a molotov on top of us, burning us down until half of us died. Did i tell you Co-Op also supports teamplay? As the leader role in one of the Co-Op games, i guided my teammates by placing "Suppress this area" where the enemies were getting us from and telling everyone to stay back, take cover and kill as many of the bots before they overrun us. Now that was amazing.\n\nAs you can see with my 16 hours, i havent made it so far in the game but those hours were worth the $7.49 i got for this game. So what are you waiting for? Buy the game NOW or else the Insurgents will get you.

It does realism great!\n\nRealism\nThe way the weapons feel, the way an enemy will drop when you hit thim once center mass, all great. When you get in a confined room with a couple people firing full auto, it feels like something is actually happening, bolts are smashing the back of the recievers, bullets are whizing through the air, the enviroment just feels like its being abused by combat. Hard to explain but it feels realistic.\nWeapons are good for the most part, the AKs in particular have a weight and power to them that I don't think I have seen in any game before. Some weapons are out of place, namely the MP5k, Mini14, Mp40, and M1A1 carbine just don't make sense. I feel like these weapons could have easily been replaced with weapons that made more sense for this theatre. The Mp5 could be full size, Mp40 could be some other sub gun. Just things like that. The models of the weapons look great though!\n\n9/10\n\nGraphics\nLooks great, especially when rounds hit around you, the surpression blur, the way that you see particles flying off walls. After you fire the smoke off the weapon looks great!\n8/10\n\nGameplay\nNot a huge assortment of maps or play styles, but fun. The actually fire fights are immensly fun, fighting through walls(It feel much different then CoD or other games with bullet pen) It's all so much fun.\n9/10\n\nOverall this is a great game, and for $15!!!! This is good enough to pay $50. It is on sale all the time, pick it up at $15, really pick it up for any less!","June 29, 2014","true","38.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShawtgunHobo/recommended/222880/","ShawtgunHobo","ShotgunHobo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShawtgunHobo/","80 products in account","Replaying this game for a short time, I realised what a good game it is, and how well it rivals its more popular Source shooter, CS:GO. This was a game made by a small development team, however it excels over its counterparts in technical and gameplay feats.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is a better game than Counter Strike. This however, as stressed, is my  opinion	, and should only be taken as an invidiuals thoughts, however I will provide reasoning for my opinion and try and back it up as best I can.\nThis review will focus mainly on the postives and negatives between Counter Strike and Insurgency, to illustrate my point.\n\nAt no point in this review will I say that Counter Strike is a bad game. I love it, I think that it's a great competitive shooter, and I have no ill thoughts towards it.\n\nInsurgency- general points\nInsurgency is leaning towards the side of "realistic" (I use this word for lack of a better one, however Insurgency is not particularly a realistic game. It runs off an engine that can't use bullet physics (good work, Valve), but it does well for its resources) I didn't want to list this as a postive or negative, because it is an opinion if you prefer more realistic games or not.\n\nThe community is like CS:GO, people call eachother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ blyat this, allahu arkbar that. It happens times in all shooters, so the community for both CS and Insurgency is parallel.\n\nInsurgency- postives compared to Counter Strike: Global Offensive\nWider range of gamemodes	s- Yes, CS:GO does lack in the gamemodes department, at least in the others than people play. Whilst Insurgency sports manly gamemodes with many diffirent variations of them, CS:GO only (really) has "five" (five is highlighted in this fashion, because Hostage and Defusal aren't really that much of a gameplay changer, however are still gamemodes in their own right.) Insurgency however sports gamemodes with AI survival stuff, nighttime levels, blowing ♥♥♥♥ up, etc. There is a real variety in the gamemodes used in Insurgency.\n\nAnimations and the "gun feel"	- The animations in CS:GO are minimal. Walking, slow walking, firing, etc, aren't dynamic and pay homage to their 16 year old counterpart. Insurgency, however, feels alot more dymanic in its movement, and its gun use. It's hard to describe, but easy to see ingame.\n\nGuns	- The guns in Insurgency look good, and realistic, dynamic with reflections from their surroundings, and actually use aim down sight technology, which the counter strike team seemed to ignore, dispite it being coined first in GoldenEye, two years before Counter Strike. This isn't a problem- Counter-Strike is (INCOMING ♥♥♥♥♥TORM) more of an arcade shooter (GETS DOWN), at least that is how it appears to me, with quicker battles and rounds, and less player slots. It doesn't have 30-a-side because it doesn't work with that. The game has been designed for no ADS, and thus it doesn't use it. Please don't kill me in my sleep.\n\nThe point in that rambling is that ADS can be a postive or negative depending on your point of view, and the game. If you like ADS, Insurgency has it.\n\nI will address the gun variety in my CS:GO postives later on, however for now, I will say that Insurgency lacks in terms of pistols, submachine guns, and matches the amount of primary guns in CS:GO. Insurgency, however, does include better explosive weapons, with RPGs, satchel charges, etc. CS:GO wasn't really designed for full on rocket grenade spam, so this is less of a postive and more of a feature, however if you prefer your explosives and incendiaries, Insurgency surpasses CS:GO's list of two.\n\nMaps	- Insurgency has bigger maps. Not really a postive, but it is more me. Maps are fairly balanced, compared to CS:GOs rife unbalanced nature (I'm looking at you, de_nuke!), etc. It's not much of a postive, may be for some, but Insurgency tends to have bigger maps. Yeh.\n\nThere's also explosive sounds and visible rocket shooting in the sky during some Insurgency maps. It's not executed greatly, but it's a feature.\n\nGun customization	- What can I say? I like to mod my guns. If it's a grenade launcher, laser sight, or just a ♥♥♥♥ing flashlight, you get a certain number of supply points at the start of each game, and then you spend them to get more mods for that game. It's simple, but expands the gunplay so much that I would say this is a large features between the two.\n\nThe Workshop	- Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't hate CS:GO skins, it's optional to buy it an all, but I'm just sayin', Insurgency has a nice workshop where you can get skins for all the guns. I'm sorry, I had to mention it.\nThe workshop is smaller, as the playerbase is smaller (negative point coming up, choo choo), however at least you can gamble that you won't find ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING AK SKIN ON THE CS:GO WORKSHOP FOR THE 5051858th TIME.\n\nLeaning and crouching and ♥♥♥♥. - I don't have a title for this one. In Insurgency, you can lean to left and right, have a little peek, and you can go prone. Not much to say here, however, its necessary to mention yet again that Counter Strike is not the game for proning and crap, and so it isn't excepted to have it. Insurgency just has this extra feature.\n\nGraphics - It's the final point, as it is least important, in my opinion. Insurgency has better shaders, and its maps have a more dynamic look and feel. Not much to say. Counter Strike: Global Offensive- general points\nI like Counter Strike, so please don't ♥♥♥♥ on me. This part covers the negative points against Insurgency compared to CS:GO.\n\nInsurgency- negatives compared to Counter Strike: Global Offensive	 Less pistol and SMG variety - Insurgency only has one SMG, that's kinda classified as a primary, the UMP. It only has about 5 pistols for both teams, with little diffirence between them. Kinda lacking in this sense.\n\nCounter Strike has competitive, and is a more competitive game- CS:GO is alot more suited towards competitive play, with its smaller numbers of players, and quicker rounds. For this reason it is the better game for matchmaking- I don't believe that Insurgency has ranking at all, besides "PVP Rank", which I am yet to explore.\n\nCS:GO has a bigger community, and "more frequently updated new maps"  - CS:GO is a big game, with alot of players worldwide. Insurgency doesn't have this going for it, however, you can still find a full-ish game really quickly with Insurg. The reason I have "more frequently updated maps" in it, is because you have to pay a fair bit of money to get some coin and 6 new maps for a limited time. It's not great, but people seem to like it, so I guess it does have more frequent updates with new maps.  General summary\nIf you like a competive, albeit minimalist shooter, Counter Strike. If you want more content I'd have to lean towards Insurgency (with the Q and E keys! :D) for its widely scope of gamemodes and co-op play.\n\nOr, you could just get both. Both are good games.","July 15, 2015","true","50.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Not only did I stop playing BF4 I don't see myself going back to any BF or COD or any major developer/publisher FPS franchise for that matter. That includes the upcoming AAA releases. And here's why.\nThey don't get FPSs anymore. They focus their effort on ways to make the game more appealing for general masses and ways to squeeze more $$$ out of players.\nInsurgency is a complete opposite of those traits. Not only is it smooth and responsive it is also unforgiving in the best way. It has  tactical teamplay, guns that have serious punch to them and they feel like destructive devices they are. Dust and sparks are flying, it takes 1-2 bullets to the chest to kill an enemy, there's no mini-map, no HUD and it's unbelivably satisfying.\nDid I forget to tell that since it's release back in 2013 it is still regulary updated and the community keeps growing? If that's not enough I must also add that the modding community is amazing and improves the game vastly in many aspects. Killing even 5 enemies in one life is heart pounding. It is by far the best hardcore FPS avaliable at the moment. If you like this type of games I highly reccomend you give this a try.\nInsurgency like no other FPS deserves to be an E-Sport.\nI've got to thank the YouTuber who goes by the name Matimi0 for making me aware of this gem. In addition to being a very skilled FPS player he's also fun to listen to. If you're still somehow on the fence and hesitate do youself a favor and check his thoughts out.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgduD8PJUE\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6hh-DJ4iyc","January 15, 2015","true","329.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game alright was underrated from the start! I had barely any interest when it first came out but by the time of the summer sale, I regret it soo much. You see, Insurgency is a combination of so many FPS games today such as Counterstrike, Arma, Red Orchestra, Battlefield, even bits of COD too form this hardcore shooter. The game modes offer a variety of fun, yet tense hardcore scenarios ranging from the classic Push mode to the more hardcore Firefight version. The sound quality in this game is amazing! Hearing bullets flying past your head and crashing into the brick wall behind you gives you a very nervous and epic feel to the game that others fail to do. My first taste of the multiplayer was amazing, running towards Point A in Push on Peak to capture it while my teammates fired at the Insurgents in the hills, it felt absolutely immersive and cool. From the PvP multiplayer is when i got into Co-Op.\n\nNow this game mode is seriously AMAZING. The AI somehow overs more intense feelings to the already intense feel in a more realistic yet surprising factor. Lets just say the AI is stupid, but at the same time smart. Yes, they have the same extremely amazing accuracy but that just makes it more frusturating. The thing is, they throw grenade and molotovs that actually AFFECT you. I was in a game where my team was trying to push through a building to capture the point when a bot threw a molotov on top of us, burning us down until half of us died. Did i tell you Co-Op also supports teamplay? As the leader role in one of the Co-Op games, i guided my teammates by placing "Suppress this area" where the enemies were getting us from and telling everyone to stay back, take cover and kill as many of the bots before they overrun us. Now that was amazing.\n\nAs you can see with my 16 hours, i havent made it so far in the game but those hours were worth the $7.49 i got for this game. So what are you waiting for? Buy the game NOW or else the Insurgents will get you.

Insurgency brings that grittyness back into the gameplay that I feel is so vital for an FPS to have. Insurgency makes it a central concept that every shot you fire has true impact whether that's forcing another use of a wave from OpFor or playing your true role as support and laying down a line of suppression for your guys to get through to the other side of the street.\n\nMy Specs: Intel Core i7 4720HQ 8-core 2.6GHz processor, 16GB DDR3 RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX960M 2GB GPU, 1TB HDD Storage, Windows 10 , 1920x1080p\n\nAesthetics: 3/5                 SETTINGS: Max           Avg. FPS:60fps (I have v-sync on to cap my fps. v-sync off I get 138fps)\nIt's no secret that Insurgency isn't using the most next generation of engines for its game. Many of you might actually be quite familiar with the Source Engine from Gary's Mod or Counter Strike:GO, and while the graphics may not be stellar I think that they can definitely be considered fair. On max settings the game looks fantastic enough. Audio, clean a crisp.\n\nUI/HUD: 5/5\nUI is clean and bare, the way an fps should be. To all of those who are unfamiliar with what the HUD looks like, look at BF4 on hardcore. No Hip-fire crosshairs, a map but with no radar giving away positions, and my favorite, you know how many mags you have, but not how many rounds you actually have in those mags. Furthermore, unless you have been paying attention, you will not know when you are running low on your mag and need to reload for a fresh fire fight. Im a fan of this system for the simple fact that the essential information such a HUD map is given, without it being to helpful and giving.\n\nGameplay/Mechanics: 5/5\nIf you are looking to take a breath of fresh air and step away from the conventional arcade Run N' Gun 'em shooter then this game is for you. If you are looking for gameplay that renders every ingame second of time as consequential then this is for you. This is for you if you're tired of expending 65% of your ammo for one kill and you one want 1-2 bullets to get the job done. If you are looking for an FPS that really stresses teamwork and objective; look no further. If you are looking for a fast paced gameplay then continue looking. I encourage you to try it, but do not expect drop em like its hot. Your first 20-40 hrs of gameplay will be getting shot from who knows where because of being unfamiliar with the maps. If you're looking for an experience mirroring COD, CSGO, or BF4 then this is not for you. Gamplay speed in insurgency is best compared to how Arma 3 is in close quarters situation in the King of The Hill gamemode. The mechanics are pretty standard for what you would expect, and yes, you can go prone. Looking through the scope feels very close to looking through a real scope. Grenade physics could be better, but grenades are not OP so it is really not an issue.\n\nMap Design: 4/5\nMap design is very thought out and cleverly implemented. The maps are of good size but at the same time focus the real-time scenario's to inevitably bottleneck at some central point of the map. Typical middle-eastern bazaar style maps. Very fun to play on. With lots of maps its hard to have to repetitive of gameplay. The maps are set up in a way where even if you played the map Verticality 5 times in a row you wouldn't play it the same 5 times. Paired with the fact that there are like 6 or 7 game modes, it's hard to get bored.\n\nCommunity: 3/5\nWhat can I say? You have a handful from every walk of cyberspace. From the ragehards to the guys who are tools because they think they are so "420 MLG BRUH" to the guys who will genuinely support you and make you a better player, you have it all. Community overall is not good or bad. Very fair.\n\nVerdict: 4/5\nDefinitely worth the money; it would be hard for this tactical-shooter to disappoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 14, 2015","true","379.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

While running on the aging Source Engine, the games visuals consistently manage to surprise, especially considering how well it handles some of its more open environments and medium to long range combat without the slightest framerate hitch.\n\nFor those who have managed to read this far, the game offers several games modes. Two for co-op, one of which is a survival/horde mode, three that are similar to Counter Strike's round-based gameplay, and three that have a limited number of respawns in the form of waves, closer to Red Orchestra. 32 player limit, a decent number of maps that offer a lot of different play styles, a unique loadout menu, NO PERKS/KILLSTREAKS (yaaaaaaaaay!!!), and incredibly well done sound effects.\n\nAgain, this game definitely gets my seal of approval, and don't forget to try to convince some others to check it out too!","January 26, 2014","true","20.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Emphasis on realism, tactics, and teamplay.\n\nGraphics:\n\n- Uses a well-modified version of the source engine. Really gotta play game for yourself to appreciate the quality of graphics. Game looks much better since early access, I think. Didn't play it during. And don't look at any old youtube videos for it. Looks better loaded up. I'd say it's almost on par with CS: GO, only this game has better animations and sounds. Much.\n\nBtw, should mention\n\nComparison here - http://i.imgur.com/ZRTIOSo.jpg\n\n- Good number of settings to change in menu.\n\n- Fov slider\n\nPerformance:\n\nSeems well-optimized. Good, constant FPS. Launches quickly. No alt-tab issues. Stable. Loads fast.\n\nPlayed on..\n\nGPU - HD 6950\nCPU - i5 2500K @ stock speeds\nRAM - 8GB's 1600mhz\n\nGame is at about 9GB's downloaded and installed.\n\nSound:\n\nGreat sounds effects and pretty good voice acting. Effects - 8. Voices - 7.5.\n\nContent:\n\n- Good number of gamemodes, good number of varied maps, fair number of weapons and attachments.\n\nGame can be modded, and there are skins for weapons you can download.\n\n- Customizable and accessible loadouts;\n\nA lot of battlefield grade attachments like silencers, compensators, hiders, heavy barrels, laser sights and tac lights, etc. No having to unlock aformentioned attachments either. Every one of them is available to use from the start, and they are balanced. Primary and secondary(or primary and primary) weapons to pick, different explosives(lethal/non-lethal) to pick, different body apparel to pick(heavy vests or light vests, chest rigs for ammo and equipment), gadgets(like night vision goggles).\n\n- WW2 weapons, just to tease\n\n- "DLC's" or as game's dev calls "content updates' are all free, and are still being added. Game originally came with 13 maps, but now has 27.\n\nHmm. Let's look at other games' map no.'s at launch and then with DLC,\n\nCOD Ghosts - 14\nCOD AW - 13\nBF3 - 9\nBF4 - 9\nBFH - 9\n\nAfter buying DLC for most of these games, maybe 29 in total per each of them. See that there ? Only two less maps so far with this game. Why not buy it ? On sale for less than $8..\n\nGameplay:\n\n- Game makes you account for fatigue when shooting and aiming.\n\nStop to shoot after sprinting long or getting hit, and your aim won't be as innacurate or steady. Steadying itself even requires stamina. And is especially unsteady when not in use. Takes about 2 shots from a standard firearm to kill someone, so it's easy to die. Shooting mechanics work well and realistically. Maps range from being CQ and long range.","June 13, 2015","true","82.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShawtgunHobo/recommended/222880/","ShawtgunHobo","ShotgunHobo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShawtgunHobo/","80 products in account","Replaying this game for a short time, I realised what a good game it is, and how well it rivals its more popular Source shooter, CS:GO. This was a game made by a small development team, however it excels over its counterparts in technical and gameplay feats.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is a better game than Counter Strike. This however, as stressed, is my  opinion	, and should only be taken as an invidiuals thoughts, however I will provide reasoning for my opinion and try and back it up as best I can.\nThis review will focus mainly on the postives and negatives between Counter Strike and Insurgency, to illustrate my point.\n\nAt no point in this review will I say that Counter Strike is a bad game. I love it, I think that it's a great competitive shooter, and I have no ill thoughts towards it.\n\nInsurgency- general points\nInsurgency is leaning towards the side of "realistic" (I use this word for lack of a better one, however Insurgency is not particularly a realistic game. It runs off an engine that can't use bullet physics (good work, Valve), but it does well for its resources) I didn't want to list this as a postive or negative, because it is an opinion if you prefer more realistic games or not.\n\nThe community is like CS:GO, people call eachother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ blyat this, allahu arkbar that. It happens times in all shooters, so the community for both CS and Insurgency is parallel.\n\nInsurgency- postives compared to Counter Strike: Global Offensive\nWider range of gamemodes	s- Yes, CS:GO does lack in the gamemodes department, at least in the others than people play. Whilst Insurgency sports manly gamemodes with many diffirent variations of them, CS:GO only (really) has "five" (five is highlighted in this fashion, because Hostage and Defusal aren't really that much of a gameplay changer, however are still gamemodes in their own right.) Insurgency however sports gamemodes with AI survival stuff, nighttime levels, blowing ♥♥♥♥ up, etc. There is a real variety in the gamemodes used in Insurgency.\n\nAnimations and the "gun feel"	- The animations in CS:GO are minimal. Walking, slow walking, firing, etc, aren't dynamic and pay homage to their 16 year old counterpart. Insurgency, however, feels alot more dymanic in its movement, and its gun use. It's hard to describe, but easy to see ingame.\n\nGuns	- The guns in Insurgency look good, and realistic, dynamic with reflections from their surroundings, and actually use aim down sight technology, which the counter strike team seemed to ignore, dispite it being coined first in GoldenEye, two years before Counter Strike. This isn't a problem- Counter-Strike is (INCOMING ♥♥♥♥♥TORM) more of an arcade shooter (GETS DOWN), at least that is how it appears to me, with quicker battles and rounds, and less player slots. It doesn't have 30-a-side because it doesn't work with that. The game has been designed for no ADS, and thus it doesn't use it. Please don't kill me in my sleep.\n\nThe point in that rambling is that ADS can be a postive or negative depending on your point of view, and the game. If you like ADS, Insurgency has it.\n\nI will address the gun variety in my CS:GO postives later on, however for now, I will say that Insurgency lacks in terms of pistols, submachine guns, and matches the amount of primary guns in CS:GO. Insurgency, however, does include better explosive weapons, with RPGs, satchel charges, etc. CS:GO wasn't really designed for full on rocket grenade spam, so this is less of a postive and more of a feature, however if you prefer your explosives and incendiaries, Insurgency surpasses CS:GO's list of two.\n\nMaps	- Insurgency has bigger maps. Not really a postive, but it is more me. Maps are fairly balanced, compared to CS:GOs rife unbalanced nature (I'm looking at you, de_nuke!), etc. It's not much of a postive, may be for some, but Insurgency tends to have bigger maps. Yeh.\n\nThere's also explosive sounds and visible rocket shooting in the sky during some Insurgency maps. It's not executed greatly, but it's a feature.\n\nGun customization	- What can I say? I like to mod my guns. If it's a grenade launcher, laser sight, or just a ♥♥♥♥ing flashlight, you get a certain number of supply points at the start of each game, and then you spend them to get more mods for that game. It's simple, but expands the gunplay so much that I would say this is a large features between the two.\n\nThe Workshop	- Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't hate CS:GO skins, it's optional to buy it an all, but I'm just sayin', Insurgency has a nice workshop where you can get skins for all the guns. I'm sorry, I had to mention it.\nThe workshop is smaller, as the playerbase is smaller (negative point coming up, choo choo), however at least you can gamble that you won't find ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING AK SKIN ON THE CS:GO WORKSHOP FOR THE 5051858th TIME.\n\nLeaning and crouching and ♥♥♥♥. - I don't have a title for this one. In Insurgency, you can lean to left and right, have a little peek, and you can go prone. Not much to say here, however, its necessary to mention yet again that Counter Strike is not the game for proning and crap, and so it isn't excepted to have it. Insurgency just has this extra feature.\n\nGraphics - It's the final point, as it is least important, in my opinion. Insurgency has better shaders, and its maps have a more dynamic look and feel. Not much to say. Counter Strike: Global Offensive- general points\nI like Counter Strike, so please don't ♥♥♥♥ on me. This part covers the negative points against Insurgency compared to CS:GO.\n\nInsurgency- negatives compared to Counter Strike: Global Offensive	 Less pistol and SMG variety - Insurgency only has one SMG, that's kinda classified as a primary, the UMP. It only has about 5 pistols for both teams, with little diffirence between them. Kinda lacking in this sense.\n\nCounter Strike has competitive, and is a more competitive game- CS:GO is alot more suited towards competitive play, with its smaller numbers of players, and quicker rounds. For this reason it is the better game for matchmaking- I don't believe that Insurgency has ranking at all, besides "PVP Rank", which I am yet to explore.\n\nCS:GO has a bigger community, and "more frequently updated new maps"  - CS:GO is a big game, with alot of players worldwide. Insurgency doesn't have this going for it, however, you can still find a full-ish game really quickly with Insurg. The reason I have "more frequently updated maps" in it, is because you have to pay a fair bit of money to get some coin and 6 new maps for a limited time. It's not great, but people seem to like it, so I guess it does have more frequent updates with new maps.  General summary\nIf you like a competive, albeit minimalist shooter, Counter Strike. If you want more content I'd have to lean towards Insurgency (with the Q and E keys! :D) for its widely scope of gamemodes and co-op play.\n\nOr, you could just get both. Both are good games.","July 15, 2015","true","50.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Two for co-op, one of which is a survival/horde mode, three that are similar to Counter Strike's round-based gameplay, and three that have a limited number of respawns in the form of waves, closer to Red Orchestra. 32 player limit, a decent number of maps that offer a lot of different play styles, a unique loadout menu, NO PERKS/KILLSTREAKS (yaaaaaaaaay!!!), and incredibly well done sound effects.\n\nAgain, this game definitely gets my seal of approval, and don't forget to try to convince some others to check it out too!","January 26, 2014","true","20.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are elements of this game that are amazing. The lack of knowledge when first playing will be brutal, but enjoyable. One you understand the flow of the game, Insurgency will blossom into the hardcore FPS experience that Insurgency perfectly captures.\n\nTwo. This game, once played competitively in PUG's and proper teams, will make the entire game different. I'm not even sure if it's better or worse. There's no more suprise or really enjoyment anymore, which I'm sure is in part to how much I've played the game.\n\nThree. As much as I love the series and the dev's free DLC packs, The "competitive" update keeps being pushed back further and further. I'm done waiting for it.\n\n\nThis game is worth a purchase, but getting too involved will kill the spirit of the game.\n\nKnowing all the locations to prefire and wall-bang through is not Insurgency ( In my opinion).\n\nWhat should be a game of suspense and action for me personally has boiled down into CS:GO promod.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardtony/recommended/222880/","thewizardtony","Wizard47","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardtony/","215 products in account","Insurgency is one of the best shooters out there with it's realistic competitive multiplayer that has no crosshair, no ammo indicator (it only shows how many mags are left), and no regenerative health. Co-op is also very fun and challenging, and strongly encourages you not to run and gun, with the AI's ability to damage you quickly. Before starting or while respawning after dealth in a multiplayer or co-op match you can chose your class, customize the optics, type of ammo, attachments, grenades, armor, and other equipment in your loadout. The game limits the amount you're able to have so you have to choose wisely before heading into battle. The game also has night maps, which makes it more difficult to see allowing you to equip night vision or a flashlight that can also help blind enemies. There's a workshop with some nice visual mods, Custom maps, skins, and alternative sfx changes. The game runs fairly smoothly although there is an issue that your anivirus software may mistakingly detect a file in the game as a virus, which has happened to numerous players including me.\n\nPros:\n+Realistic gunplay and mechanics\n+Wide variety of modes, each are really fun (there isn't any modes that are boring, they're all really enjoyable)\n+The co-op is surprisingly challenging too and allows for strategy and planning\n+Runs mostly smoothly\n+Steam Workshop for awesome mods and custom maps like a WW2 conversion pack called Day of Infamy, which basically turns the game into a classic WW2 shooter to a zombies mod to Star Wars gun sfx and much more\n+good balance between weapons and attachments\n\nCons\n- Antivirus issue, easy fix\n\nOverall, Insurgency is one of the best shooters out there and for $15 it's a must buy and worth every penny IMO. The game is also constantly being updated with maps and tweaks to improve the gameplay. I would highly recomend this game for anyone looking for a good military shooter.","February 14","true","47.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Whether you are playing Co-op, or multiplayer. It requires a lot of attention, "game sense", and also some previous first person experiences. Even then, for your first 1-3 hours, you will rack up very few kills. But be patient, and you will pull through. It is amazing value for money, with a ton of gamemodes to choose from, including checkpoint, which is where you move through a map, neutralising enemy forces, capturing points and destroying weapon caches. Yet there are a few gripes I would like to warn you about.\n\n1) The character models. This is not massively annoying, but they seem a little dated. I would like it if they were improved to CSGO standard, or even better.\n\n2)The superhuman AI. The AI in this game are very good. So good infact, that they can see you through a bush, in the middle of the night, without a torch or nightvision. I have been playing some of the survival missions (capture points to respawn allies, try and survive) at night, and have discovered that they are nearly unplayable as you cannot sneak down the edges of the maps, or take down AI from behind with a knife, or be stealthy at all. It is almost as if they have wall hacks.\n\n3. "Phantom Bullets". This is a rather big thing that annoys me greatly. If you are at point blank range, and empty a pistol clip into your opponents body, they will sometimes just shoot you in the face with a machine gun after. It is almost as if you miss all the shots, or they go though the body of your enemy and inflict no damage. I have lost many rounds like this, and is very annoying.\n\nYet there are many great features of this game too.\n\n1) Realism. This is a super realistic game. You die from 1, sometimes 2 shots from an assault rifle, and 1, sometimes 3 shots of a pistol. It is a very tough game, and doesn't hold your hand through it at all.\n\n2) Maps. The maps for this game are amazing. They are detailed, large, different from eachother, and support getting to objectives in multiple different ways. Not only this, but they are beautiful, with snow falling, dust being kicked up, buckled cars lying around. They are truly something to admire\n\n3)Being Immersive. It's an immensly immersive game, which many fans of it will likely point out. It is as close to a real firefight as I want to get, yet it does it well.\n\n4)Suppression. Have you ever seen in a movie when the protagonist is about to look over a piece of cover, when bullets fly over his head and he ducks back down again? This is called suppressing fire, and this game has a very nice suppression engine. Similar to the one in Verdun (another of my favourite games), when bullets fly past you, you flinch a little bit, and your screen goes a bit blurry and grey tinted. It adds realism to the game, and that is the reason why you should save up £11, and buy it. I would reccomend it to any gamer, but if you have no prior FPS experience, then this probably isnt a good starting point.","August 1, 2015","true","75.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Sort of a mix between Battlefield series and Call of Duty series. Looks similar to COD's Hardcore mode - minimal UI (no ammo counter, no health, no map ect), friendly fire is always on, hard to tell friend or foe at a glance. But has lots of players, like Battlefield. There are no killstreaks, only you, your enemy and your objective. And you can only see kill/death ratio when you're dead. Respawn also happens in waves, like BF, but maps are smaller, closer to COD style.\n\nThere's almost no single player mode. There's "tutorial" mode, where the game explains how to play, and there's "solo" mode, which is rather hard (your ally bots are rather stupid).\n\nThere's a "co-op" mode, where a team of real players plays against bots to reach certain objectives, and bots vary in difficulty - from tough to insane.\n\nAnd there's good old multiplayer. Kind of fun, but personally I prefer CS:GO multiplayer. Its much more action-packed and looks better. More vibrant. But thats just a personal preference, Insurgency's multiplayer is more dark, but it grows on you. Its not a masterpiece, but not a complete disaster, either.\n\nOverall, Insurgency is a good game to try if you like multiplayer shooters, geared towards realism.","April 9","true","23.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is alone in its genre of tactical -hardcore - shooter.\nWhich is where it truely shines on its own from an indy developer.\n\nTo start, I would like to mention that this game is worth whatever price you pay for it. If you got it on sale, congrats you got a great game for a good deal!  If you did not buy this game on sale or were looking at buying the game and it's not on sale, you will not be disappointed.\n\nSecondly, this is not an EASY GAME. This may be and indy title, but it is surely not your generic shooter. If it was, it more than likely would not be getting this recommendation.  This game has a harder learning curve than most shooters. You will find yourself shoulder peeking and leaning to find your kills, knowing that with one well placed bullet from a AK-47 you will be waiting for a respawn. This game will keep you on your toes with your heart pounding from round start to round end. This is multiplayer.\n\nWith one of the newer updates, they added a survial mode that you and your friends can fight your way to the top of the leaderboards vs waves of AI. Also insanely hard.\n\nEither mode I found very entertaining.\n\nWonderful game with a good supportive developer.\n\nWorth picking up at any price.\n\nHighly recommend :D\n\nKevin\n\n\n","January 10, 2015","true","49.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maker46/recommended/222880/","Maker46","Maker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maker46/","138 products in account","I have to say, I am enjoying this new title by New World Interactive very much. Insurgency is a breath of fresh air in a genre that has lately become watered down with first person shooter games. Do not pay any attention to the Metacritic score. It is filled largely with biased criticism because it's not like the majority of other big name first person shooter games offered today. The insurgency community on the other hand has given this game a rock solid 8.6 Metacritic score. Of which I completely agree with.\n\nAs one reviewer suggested the phrase 'Counter-Strike', meets 'Arma', meets 'Red Orchestra/Rising Storm' is an accurate discription of this game. Taking the best elements of those titles, Insurgency falls somewhere in the middle. Gameplay is tactical, at times frantic, and not without its heart-pounding moments. Weapon handling is excellent, I can't say enough good about Insurgency's 'Free-Aim' system. I'd like to see this feature in even more first person shooter titles in the future.\n\nAbove all, Insurgency is an extremely tactical teamwork centric shooter, where actual teamwork, and good communications are key. Insurgency has recently gone on sale for $9.99 and even at $15 it is worth every penny. If you are growing tired with the same old same run-n-gun nature that a lot of first person shooter games on the market today offer. Then don't hesitate to give this little indie shooter a try instead. It just may surprise you!","March 29, 2014","true","14.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It's like a modern version of Red Orchestra/Rising Storm, in the way how the game works, and this game works very well. It has good graphics, awesome game sound, and it runs very smoothly. Here I have an Intel core 2 duo @2.66GHz with GTX550Ti and the game runs very well at 1920x1080.\nI got this game since it was in early access, and recently I returned to play again. The game evolved so much in about one year since the alpha/beta days, the developers really take care about the game.\nThe coop mode is a guarantee of several hours of fun, even more if you have a clan or play with friends online. The multiplayer mode has several game modes. Stay focus, keep your eyes and ears attention, play with your team, and you get a very nice experience. It's a tactical, hardcore, realistic, challenging and fun game.\n\nEDIT: The above review is from april 2014.\nNow, december 2015, I just want to append:\nThe game developers did, and still do, a very good job.\nIt's getting better and better and better after every update. New maps, new weapons, AI improvements...   it's an amazing work!\nI still, for sure, recommend this awesome FPS game, I think it's one of the best FPS you can play at this moment.

This game is alone in its genre of tactical -hardcore - shooter.\nWhich is where it truely shines on its own from an indy developer.\n\nTo start, I would like to mention that this game is worth whatever price you pay for it. If you got it on sale, congrats you got a great game for a good deal!  If you did not buy this game on sale or were looking at buying the game and it's not on sale, you will not be disappointed.\n\nSecondly, this is not an EASY GAME. This may be and indy title, but it is surely not your generic shooter. If it was, it more than likely would not be getting this recommendation.  This game has a harder learning curve than most shooters. You will find yourself shoulder peeking and leaning to find your kills, knowing that with one well placed bullet from a AK-47 you will be waiting for a respawn. This game will keep you on your toes with your heart pounding from round start to round end. This is multiplayer.\n\nWith one of the newer updates, they added a survial mode that you and your friends can fight your way to the top of the leaderboards vs waves of AI. Also insanely hard.\n\nEither mode I found very entertaining.\n\nWonderful game with a good supportive developer.\n\nWorth picking up at any price.\n\nHighly recommend :D\n\nKevin\n\n\n","January 10, 2015","true","49.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game has progressed quite well since it left Early Access. The game has seen a multitude of free DLC map updates and additions to an already rock solid base of a game.\n\nThe ambience of the game is fantastic. The sound effects, the maps, the characters, and music all culminate into a perfect blend of FPS goodness.\n\nNWI clearly has taken pride behind their work and has kept forward with it's ideas for it's game to keep it fresh and rewarding. I can't recommend this game enough as it's one of the best purchases on Steam that comes to mind.\n\nUpdated Review: I would say this is perhaps one of the best FPS purchases I've ever made. If you are a FPS fan you need to give this a chance and find out why Insurgency is awesome. The studio behind this game clearly had a vision and has supported this game since launch with A+ content updates.\n\n\nOriginal review: Insurgency is a fantastic source FPS shooter that thrives on realism, teamwork, sensical, and most importantly tactical based gameplay. It's a blast, it looks good, the asking price is a fraction of what most FPS games charge out of the gate, and it's an absolute steal at their 14.99 asking price.\n\nWith a thoughtful system of each side having set open types of players who have a limited option of weapons that can be adjusted with attachments, secondary firearms, accessories, and points that determine what you'll be able to have and not have the game doesn't let everyone run rampant with the same setups. Each person has meaning to their side and there's none of that over the top arcadey FPS stuff here with streaks for assists and kills.\n\nIt's what I've wanted for a long time in a shooter and if you have found enjoyment with Red Ochestra 2 and/or Rising Storm this may be right down your alley.","January 26, 2014","true","107.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is a brutal reality shooter, and if you're used to playing cod, its quite the opposite. I used to play CoD on console and as soon as i switched to this i found that it is a lot more tactical. I used to be able to run freely and get high kill streaks with ease. This game, if you do not play tactically you pay the blood price simple as that.\nIf you like realistic shooters, This game is good for you. There is no mini map, no killcam and no crosshairs or aim assist. When you start, i quite possibly believed it has one of the steepest learning curves of a game, however once you understand the maps it becomes very fun and extremely challenging. It is good value for money.\n\nThe class system is alright, some people love having roles, however, you will always get fools playing as riflemen who are meant to be posted up somewhere useful slaying, but instead lie at the back of the map with a ridiculous 4x scope on an M16, but its all part of the game. It is possible to play agressively, however doing this requires smokes to be succesful. Myself, i enjoy using the UMP on security and the AK74u and AK74 as insurgents.\n\nThere is no level bias, people on the highest PVP tier rank will get the same amount of points to build a class as someone who litterally just started.\n\nOne word of warning: the servers are pretty terrible for the most part.\n\nThis game is great fun and i can see many more hours worth.","January 5, 2015","true","349.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Almost 400 hours in and I can easily see myself putting in another 400.\nDespite being a relatively small, low budget project, Insurgency does many things better than triple A titles such as Battlefield.  The no-scope mechanic is a personal favorite of mine, where getting hip fire kills actually relies on skill instead of luck.  The suppression is insane, and while the graphics aren't top of the line, they are very playable.  The fire effects are simply beatiful.  Sound is immersive, combat is intense and damage is brutal, the grenade mechanics are unmatched (I mean, where else can you pull the pin and leave in the spoon for worry free cooking?), and the overall experience is simply amazing.  I have nothing but good things to say about Insurgency.  And with steam workshop, you can mod it in whatever way you desire, from the comprehensive World War 2 mod Day of Infamy to the classic Allahu Akbar Soundmod.

The gameplay is fantastic! I have played about every fps since Quake2. I appreciate the “slower” pace and more tactical gameplay that Insurgency presents. It does not take much to die, so you move forward with much more care. As others have already mentioned in the reviews, it is definitely a modern day Red Orchestra with a mix of other great shooters we have all played. However, I am quite happy how this game is lacking levels, upgrades, perks, all that other bs where someone that has no life or a poop bucket, tends to be more successful than you. Insurgency allows you to jump in and prove to be worthwhile to your team rather quickly.\n\nThe maps are intricate and well done. The game types are a lot of fun. At the start everyone can choose different classes and then have a few options on how to spend their points. I love how I can add more weapon attachments in place of a sidearm or heavier armor.\n\nI have purchased a lot of games under the 20 dollar mark during Steam sales and this one has proven to be the best so far. So at 13 to 15 dollars give it a try. Be warned though, if you are used to the bf, cod, cs, style, you will have to learn how to play slightly different to be successful. You will not be as durable as you are used to. Be patient though, if you give it a little time you will rewarded with some great gameplay.\n\nSo far the community seems to be rather positive. At least from what I have noticed so far on the servers I have played on. I do appreciate a good gaming community and hope it grows more.","January 25, 2014","true","51.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

If you are looking for a solid old school coop fps, this may be the game for you. No crosshair, no health regen, no kill confirmation, no grindy leveling system, friendly fire on (default). The approach is realistic but it's not a sim. Firing rpg or triggering a c4 explosion will get you killed if you don't use them carefully.\n\nFocusing on the coop part of the game, you will face unforgiving AI that will throw at you frag, smoke nades and will try to flank you. Speaking about the hardest settings, you may argue with me that AI bots seem like aimbotting but it's just what skilled players would do. If you don't pull the trigger first, they will. Maps are pretty intense and require teamwork, patience and tactical approach. No lonewolf rambo would survive much long here. There is also a nice radial menu to communicate with your team vital info without the use of a mic, which is not required but recommended. This game reminds me a bit of the first Ghost Recon. To me this game is already worth full money for only the coop experience, not to mention that it will get steamworks support.\n\nAbout pvp multiplayer i cannot say much since i didn't play it enough, though the couple of games i played felt good to me. There are like 6 different pvp modes to accomodate most of tastes: some single life modes and some with respawns. There is still no pure team deathmatch but it would not fit this game because it relies on objectives you have to accomplish with your team.","March 30, 2014","true","256.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Palerion148/recommended/222880/","Palerion148","Palerion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Palerion148/","33 products in account","Quite frankly, this may be the most fun I've ever had in a shooter.  Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I remember the first time I played split-screen on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.  That game introduced fresh gameplay into the FPS market, and as much as CoD-style gameplay is hated today, it was undeniably fresh and original at the time.  It was an experience unlike any other for me.  Unfortunately, that game's novelty wore off quickly as installment after installment copied and pasted.\n\nInsurgency, like Modern Warfare 2, has caught my attention by introducing FRESH gameplay that I have never experienced before.  It goes in the opposite direction of MW2, though, contrasting the saturated CoD-clone market with slow-paced and weighty combat.\n\nSo, to sum up what makes this game so good in two words:  Innovative and Mechanical.\n\nAllow me to first elaborate on the innovative features that Insurgency has introduced.  First off, the free-aim system.  It's cool.  REALLY cool.  You have no crosshair.  Instead, there is a small deadzone in the center of the screen.  The initial minute movements of your mouse in any direction turn your gun that way, only minimally affecting camera position, and once you have moved your gun far enough to one side of the screen, you begin to turn.  So, instead of hip-firing with a crosshair that guestimates where your shots may land, you do the guestimation yourself.  You move the gun to where it looks like it may be pointing at the enemy, and you pull the trigger.  Not only does this add a feeling of control to hipfire (and really, it's astounding how real this makes the hipfire feel; it feels and looks exactly like what you would do if you panicked in a paintball war.), but it makes movement very fluid and realistic.\n\nNow, that is one innovative feature.  I felt compelled to write a paragraph on it because I have seen nothing like it.  I'll try to be shorter with the rest.  A fluid leaning system using Q and E for left and right respectively.  A sliding system that, unlike call-of-duty sliding, is useful for moving to cover from a sticky situation, but realistically ineffective for rambo-killing.  Bullet penetration systems (armor piercing and higher-caliber ammo will go through certain surfaces that other ammo/calibers will not; you can hit people through walls if your bullet can pierce them.).  Intricate player damage (and I'll touch on this later).  Body armor systems.  Serious depth in attachment choices, and they really affect gameplay.  A silencer in this game is useful for different reasons than most games; your flash is suppressed and it's harder to tell where you're coming from.  No minimap concealment needed, because in this game, you use your senses to spot the enemy.  And seriously, this may be the first game I have ever played where not only is a smoke grenade useful, but often I may prefer it to other grenades, as it allows you to change position and surprise your enemies.\n\nNow, the mechanical side of the game.  Mainly what I'm talking about here is the graphics and audio combined, as odd as it seems, because they are MECHANICAL.  And it's awesome.  Contrary to what most people say, the graphics are amazing simply because they so accurately represent mechanical aspects of the game.  A real suppression system; your vision blurs on the edges, doesn't affect your aim like battlefield.  Just shakes you up and reduces your awareness.  The body damage.  An armored vest being hit results in an impact sound and a smoke puff, while a bullet hitting an unarmored body/body part results in a bloody wound.  Bullets coming overhead are intense, from the whizzing sound, to the relentless sparking fury of M249 shells hitting the wall behind you, to the splintering wood and hail of bullets of an SMG firing at you through the wooden floor you stand on, to the angry, distraught yelling of your soldier as a bullet pierces his vest.\n\nIf you're debating whether or not you should buy it: this game is for people who want a fresh shooter.  People who don't play just to kill everyone.  People who appreciate depth, tactics, and more depth in a shooter.  I'll be playing this for a long time.  Much like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare has absorbed me with deep mechanics that I have never seen, and now love so much,  I am infatuated with this new brand of gameplay.  You don't progress by earning a new gun; rather, you pick up tips as you go, and it will soon feel as though you have "leveled up".  Once you grasp the tactical gameplay, you quickly become both skilled and absorbed.","April 1, 2015","true","82.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This game feels real and its real because you die if you are spotted and you haven't spotted your enemy, just a good shot is enough to kill someone but the precision is not that easy compared to battlefield and the same goes the otherway.The mechanics in this game are good for close combat shooter and game port is simply amazing, i broke my gpu recently and thought i could play a game but this game runs at 50-60fps on 720p at a decent med-high setting on integrated intel hd graphics. The cons in the game are not that big deal, but i felt that they had to be the distance shooting without any sniper where you cant find whether you actually killed an enemy as there is no popup on screen and you can only guess by the blood when the shots are fired on enemy and the respawn takes time as the whole wave is respawed at a time. Overall i would recommend to buy game pack for you and your friend if you want to suffer for abit if you are new to close combat and learn how to play the game that is much closer to realty.","May 30","true","13.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Now with the re implementaion of C4, class restrictions that make no f**king sense whatsoever, game modes that do nothing to promote teamwork, a convuluted UI and a** ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the HUD it's just another run of the mill generic shooter. It's worth the money just to mod the theater files if you're going to host or buy a server, but I no longer find it fun to play. It's beginning to remind me of Battlefield Play4Free where the game has serious issues that need addressed but they're more concerned with leaving it broken just to add more content.\n\nThis from the forums\n\n"They took all the good features from America's army..."\n\nFalse. There is no teamwork. There is no BFT. There is no incapacitation. You can jump but you can't vault. Weapons models are incorrect. Loadouts are completely unrealistic, why can I choose a frag or smoke but not both? No ES2 objects to report. No bleeding or damage system requiring teammates to give you first aid to promote teamwork. I could go on and on about how this has nothing in common with America's Army.\n\nAnother one\n\n"Notice: Teamwork required\nThis is a great tactical shooter. It's not so fun when no one cooperates. Work together!"\n\nExactly my point. If there was any teamwork in this game I'd still be playing with over 945 hours logged regardless of the other issues I have with the game. Teamwork trumps everything else.\n\nThen there is also the matter of certain developers trolling players in public servers. Not only is it quite unprofessional when you do it wearing a bigass tag next to your name saying DEVELOPER but it puts both the game and the rest of the development team in a really bad light. Same thing applies to asking how to correctly implement a feature that is publicly released from the internal beta branch testing and the only reply is "that's not how you do it". That's not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ answer. If it isn't the correct way to do it explain how to do it correctly so you do not need modify the default game theater files to keep clients from crashing when they join your server.\n\nAll in all the game started out awesome. I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoyed playing it every day. Now that's not the case. Playing for more than 5 or 10 minutes seems like a chore instead of an escape. Any criticism of the game is swiftly met with deleted posts or temporary bans and feedback from a large portion of the community seems ignored in favor of making the game more and more noob friendly for players who might buy the game and play maybe 10 to 25 hours before moving on to something else. I don't see the community having any kind of longevity and it's a shame given the remarkable start this game had for a small indie team.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter playing Firefight tonight and seeing the teamwork that's still there (maybe it's just that mode) and the influx of new players I changed this to RECOMMENDED. The game is fun when you have people working together. The game is a hell of a lot of fun then. I had thought that was gone forever but I'll be the first to admit I might have jumped the gun. After all, there's gotta be something to this game or I'd have never racked up this many hours in the first place.","December 27, 2013","true","527.9"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","13","22","2","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adoption/recommended/222880/","Adoption","THIRST OASIS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adoption/","388 products in account","TL;DR = This game is probably one of the best FPS's of 2013-2014. I highly recommend it.\n\nWhen I first played this game, it was back when it was a mod. I enjoyed the mod, but it felt lacking. There was something about the way that it played that removed depth and I think it was that it was the lack of ambience. It just never had the depth in sound that this game does. Sound makes a difference, a huge difference. However, I assure you that this isn't the only gripe with the mod. Anyway, back to this game.\n\nWhen I first loaded the game back when it first came out, it didn't feel any different from the mod. There were game breaking glitches but they have been corrected now. There aren't as many glitches if there are any. It plays smoothly and very well.\n\nThe matchmaking portion of the game works like CoD Ghosts AND TF2. It being a source game, you can opt out of the matchmaking and use the server menu. The matchmaking isn't bad, though. There are a few options you can choose when selecting a server, such as "Do not join full servers". You can also choose which maps you want to filter out. I have yet to have be added into a game with higher than 100 ping, although that could do with my location (East Coast U.S.A.).\n\nThe game plays like the mod, but there are new changes. They've added suppression and dive sliding. You can further customize weapons like add different ammunition types (AP, HP and Tracer rounds). AP rounds do more damage to armored targets and HP does more damage to unarmored targets. There are a few different types of scopes you can add on your gun such as a holographic sight or an acog sight. You can purchase these attachments with supply points that you earn after every round.\n\nAll of the guns handle pretty realisticly and force you to focus on range and accuracy rather than fully automatic fire. On maps like Peak, it is all outside and it forces you to use single fire, but in maps like Ministry where you battle through hallways, you can use automatic fire. When you use automatic fire, your accuracy suffers. It can also be noted that being shot at lowers accuracy due to suppression.\n\nThere are four different game-mode categories. Tactical Operations, Sustained Combat, Adversial Match and Cooperative Vs. AI. In Tactical Operations it focuses on one-life battles. If you die, you must wait until the round ends to respawn. In Sustained Combat, you respawn every 15'ish seconds until your reinforcements run out. In Adversarial Match, you respawn every captured objective. Cooperative Vs. AI plays like Adversarial Match, except it is played against bots. Each of these categories have their own sub-gamemodes that include: Firefight, Flashpoint, Infiltrate, Occupy, Push, Skirmish, Ambush, Strike, Vendetta and Checkpoint.\n\nFirefight is an Adversarial gamemode in which you must capture all of the enemy checkpoints and reinforcements are replenished every objective captured.\n\nFlashpoint is an Adversarial gamemode in which you must overpower the enemy team and destroy their weapon caches which are scattered around the map.\n\nInfiltrate is an Adversarial gamemode in which you must capture the enemy's intelligence and it plays like Capture the Flag.\n\nOccupy is a Sustained Combat gamemode and it plays much like capture the flag.\n\nPush is a Sustained Combat gamemode plays like the mod's original gamemode, it is a Sustained Combat gamemode in which you must capture checkpoints and push back the enemy force.\n\nSkirmish is a Sustained Combat gamemode which plays out like Domination on CoD, you must capture and control all of the enemy's points and destroy their weapon cache. To win, you can also eliminate all of the opposing force.\n\nAmbush is Tactical Operations gamemode in which a team must escort a high valued target to safety. If the high valued target dies, the escorts will lose the match.\n\nStrike is Tactical Operations gamemode where both teams fight to destroy eachothers weapon caches. When a cache blows up, the round ends.\n\nVIP is Tactical Operations gamemode works slightly like Ambush, except in this game mode you must find and capture each of the enemy's control points without letting your leader die.\n\nThe HUD is very immersive and shows you how many magazines you have left and your current fire mode. It also shows you your supply points. It also shows you the captured points and where the points are. If a team member spots an enemy player it will show their location.\n\nWhen you join into a game, you are shown two different squads each with their own different "Loadouts". They're all customizeable and they all play a different role in combat. There are specialists who specialize in SMG's and Carbines and fight at close range and then there are Riflemen who specialize in rifles and fight in medium to far range. Those aren't the only squad loadouts, but I won't go into the others.\n\nIt features a fully 3D voice chat system in which friendlies and enemies can both hear you if you're in the vicinity. It can be pretty intense hearing the enemies at a distance. The sound is also pretty intense. The guns sound really good and they echo around the map so when small skirmishes are happening, you can hear them going on from across the map. In a few maps, you are able to hear background noise such as car horns, people talking, babies crying and it really adds to the effect when you're fighting in a city.\n\nThere (As of this review) are about 12 maps which are different in their own ways. They all require different types of tactical approaches.\n\nAnywho, this concludes my review, I hope that this helps sway your opinion towards buying this game. I wouldn't exactly base your entire opinion off of this review, so make sure you watch videos on the game. I HIGHLY recommend it. It's EXTREMELY fun.\n\nEDIT 2: Changed the review from No to Yes and edited it to say what the TL;DR message says.\nEDIT 3: I have decided to add everything that comes after the TL;DR message","March 3, 2014","true","165.8"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","1"
