I mean, this is a twin-stick shooter right? You're a huge viking with a big gun. You run through each level, shoot all the bad guys, and revel in the blood, guts, and glory. I was looking forward to a lot of dumb action, but it turns out that I got more than I bargained for. I hate using words like "promising" to describe Early Access titles, but there is some merit to this upcoming game.\n\nApparently there's a story that sets everything up, but I never pay attention to that nonsense. Let's just skip ahead to the basics; there are four areas, each area consists of five levels and a boss-fight. After completing the four areas you fight Odin. Each level tends to have a common goal: find the exit. It's up to you and maybe some friends to avoid traps, get past the demonic armies, and do whatever it takes to reach the next level. In many ways, shooting everything that moves isn't the key to surviving Gunnheim.\n\nOften, when we play twin-stick shooters, they're designed around arenas. Going as far back as the days of Robotron and Smash TV, you would go into a room, enemies would fill the screen, and you had to destroy them all. It's a simple concept. However, arena shooters are also very compelling due to the on-screen chaos and the depth that comes from mastering the controls & weapons. Typically, these games are controlled with two sticks, one to move, and one to fire. Gunnheim uses the twin-stick method, but you have to press the right-trigger to fire.\n\nHold up a second, you have to press a button to fire? At first I thought this was an oversight by the developer, but it is in fact a very concious decision. Firing a gun in this game is something you have to think about. Unlike.. say.. Dark Souls, missing a shot probably isn't going to get you killed, but there are consequences . Whether these consequences are good or bad depends on the situation. Gunnheim is all about pacing, and most kills are actually a waste of time. Whenever you fire, the recoil pushes you backwards slightly. With some weapons the effect is much larger. If you're getting pushed back, you're not moving forward. With every shot you sacrifice a centimer of progress, and they can add up. So when you point your gun at an enemy, your first thought might actually be "Do I need to kill it?" The monsters in this game certainly aren't harmless, their numbers are high, and they'll pursue you to Ragnarok and back. But in most cases, you don't need to kill them.\n\nOut-maneuvering adversity is one of the more important elements of this game. Every playable character has an invincible dash move. This takes time to recharge, but it's good for escaping bad situations, moving quickly, or even crossing pits. You can even use the gun's recoil to give your walking speed a little boost. Although there are numerous weapons, they have very limited ammo, and are random drops. You have to play with the mind-set that you won't get much in the way of assistance. Some levels even feature infinitely-spawning enemies to hammer this point home. You can kill a lot of creatures, but if you're not getting any closer to the exit, it's time to figure out a new strategy.\n\nGoing solo is fine in of itself, but this is game that deserves to be played with others. The level of difficulty scales with the number of players, and it can become more difficult than playing alone. Due to the larger number of enemies, you and your friends could become overwhelmed. This is one of those rare cases where having a second gun actually makes things more difficult, because you can't hope to eradicate everything. So again, the best strategy is to know when to shoot, and always focus on making it to the exit. If this means three players have to sacrifice themselves, just so the last person can escape, then that's exactly what it means. While players can be revived quickly and easily, they recover with pixel-health, and the monsters certainly aren't taking a breather. I ran into a situation where a hunter repeatedly shot my partner whenever I revived him. That jerk was camping his corpse! That's totally unfair! But seriously, there's a lot of decision-making that goes into every level of this game. You always have to consider what's best for the team, even if it means leaving them to die.\n\nIn terms of content, Gunnheim is currently on the lean side. As of this writing, there are four playable characters, all with their own weapons & special abilities. However, two of them have to be unlocked by completing the game on the normal and hardcore settings. The levels are very short, although there are a couple of truly rough ones that took me close to an hour. Interestingly enough, the levels are randomized for each area, so there's a possibility that more could be added. Another reason why multiplayer is preferable is because the game becomes more dynamic, depending on the number of players and what characters they use. One of the unlockables uses a sniper rifle, which grants them the best range in the game. It's up to the other players to keep an eye on the sniper and pick off nearby enemies. There are numerous other situations that can crop up, and the temporary weapon-drops can change how things play out as well. So while there isn't a lot of content, there's a good amount of replay-value.\n\nGunnheim is shaping up to be a very solid action game. Admittedly, I was surprised by the design-decisions it employs. Judgng by the art and talk about guns and gore, I expected a straight-up blastathon, not a game where I have to consider possibilities, and put an emphasis on not killing everything in sight. These unique qualities just might help it stand out in the crowd. So if you're looking for something different, consider keeping an eye out for this one.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 15, 2015","true","6.2"," 83 of 100 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","83","100","5","1"

I played for about 4 hours and I was interested the first 10 minutes, then was wondering when more gameplay depth was going to come in to keep it engaging. Heads up, there is nothing more; you've already experienced the entirety the game has to offer in the first 5 minutes. You kite and you run, nothing akin to the badassery of gunplay you'd expect.\n\nThere’s no weapon variety aside from occasional random drops from enemies that you can only use for about 3 seconds. Meaningful variety and shallow randomness are not the same. So on the couple of times that you have to fight instead of just running to end the gunplay becomes monotonous and unfulfilling because all you do is kite around in a circle and there isn't anything to change things up at all.\n\nThe rest of the time you just run to the end of the stage, shooting the occasional enemy that might catch up to you, and dodging through a gap of enemies in front of you so you don’t get boxed in. Your base weapon is woefully inadequate when it comes to dealing with enemies efficiently, and as stated  before the only reprieve that the game will give you is random, short-lived, and underwhelming.\n\nThen there’s enemy variety. There’s basically only three enemies in the game aside from bosses; of course there’s about 5 reskinned and slightly modified versions of the same thing to try and convince you that it makes any difference at all. This game has: generic melee enemy that moves toward you, generic ranged enemy that stands still and shoots at you, and generic big thing that you wait to finish attacking so you can do damage while it’s weak.\n\nThere problem with the game is that it doesn’t seem to be able to pick something that it wants to do and go all the way with it. Do you want to be about speeding through the level to the exit as fast as you can while avoiding damage and obstacles without slowing down too much? Do you want to be about dodging enemies and projectiles in a massive storm of mayhem? Do you want a replayable experience with many different interesting ways to do the same thing? Do you want to be about mowing down hordes of enemies in brutal fashion? It feels like it tries to be everything at once so it really just ends up being nothing of note in anything.\n\nOn top of being monotonous as all hell the game can’t seem to find a coherent vision for what it want’s to be. There’s nothing wrong with trying to merge gameplay themes for a fresh new experience, but that requires that you first understand what makes those types of games fun and how to keep those elements intact.\n\nGame: Here’s my idea.\nPlayer: Sounds cool, now what are you going to do to make it entertaining?\nGame: I don’t understand, what do you mean? Anything should be sufficient regardless of how the gameplay is implemented because the concept sounds cool right?\nPlayer: That’s not how games work.\nGame: Whatever, it still sounds cool.\nPlayer: That’s fine, but I’m already bored which defeats the purpose of your existence.\n\nIn summary, the experience of playing this game is just all around mediocre.

The trailer looks fun (these folks are onto something - love the idea!) and I like games like this so it was going to be an easy win but...\n\nThe game at high resolution is meh, just stretched out graphics.\n\nThe camera angles are terrible.  If in Multiplayer and one of  your party moves far away, the camera stretches out to show almost where everyone is, and doesn't center on you.  BUT you can in fact be off the screen entirely and have NO IDEA where to move because you can't see yourself.\n\nThen this game does the impossible for a PC, makes w,a,s,d extremely hard and annoying to move around with.  With camera angles like this game has, it should be point and go, not w,a,s,d.  It's just a very frustrating combination.  Sure you can change default settings but it just adds to the already long list of "really....."\n\nAlso, F---NG HOLES!  3/4 the challenge in this game is NOT falling in a hole or standing in some mysteriously poisonous water, because of the awkward controls and bizarre camera angles.\n\nThere are exactly 2 classes, 2 more you can 'unlock' which appear to just be upgraded versions of the previous classes.\n\nWhen you do get a 'new gun' you get it for literally what feels like 3-5 seconds (unless you happen to accidentally pick up a new gun which then gets rid of the one you were just using), depending on how frequently you shoot it, which with the enemy waves is basically right away unless you choose the two existing strategies to play this game: 1) run through to the end and ignore basically everything except bosses or 2) slug it out and (if multiplayer) yell at your friends not to run off-screen or alt tab.\n\nGreat concept and it is fun to play with friends (!!), but needs some refining really.  Can't recommend right now, but fun if on 90% off sale or a gift.\n\nShould they fix this stuff: hands down worth it!  They've got a great idea and with some tweaking it would be a great game!","January 1","false","1.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

The only real complaint I have about the game is that there isn’t enough of it yet.

Gunnheim brings all that in oodles and then throws in a hand grenade of co-op action. Gunnheim takes cues from other games in this crowded genre, from Gauntlet, to FORCED. You play across many different levels and environments, using power ups, innate powers and firing non-stop at the hordes of angry enemies trying to chew your face off. After completing so many levels you are greeted by a big nasty boss who more then likely is going to stomp you into dust. While Gunnheim can be enjoyed by itself as a single-player game, it shines most when you take advantage of the up to 4 player Co-op. The game scales its difficulty and challenge based on the number of players, adding even more viking chaos and explosions. The game does have polish for an Early Access title, the graphics, controls, and music are all well done. However,  there is still plenty of work to be done here. Balancing, repeating content, and more gameplay elements are all things that need to be worked on before final release.  It's a fun game and very enjoyable with your friends, just the single-player mode needs a bit more work in my opinion. So get ready, grab your viking hat, your bazooka and get to kick some monster ♥♥♥♥!\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/7lsybgzemU4\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","September 26, 2015","true","1.2"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","1"

Solo play is boring and more than 2 players is equally boring because you practically can't lose due to infinite resuscitations.\n\nI recommend using a controller or gamepad, because using a mouse to aim will greatly disadvantage you. This is because the mouse cursor does not reflect where you are truly aiming, because of the isometric viewpoint. To make things worse, the isometric view point made it so that you couldn't just adjust your aiming to hit things just above or below the cursor, because the true direction of your weapon changed relative to your cursor based on whether you were aiming to the North, South, East, or West. Unfortunately, the developers failed to slightly offset the true aiming direction for mouse-users. The result was a frustrating inability to hit targets, which is vital in such a fast-paced game where you must quickly travel great distances and shoot-on-the-go. Controller users could focus solely on the direction of your character's weapon, without also having to focus on the location of their cursor (which also had a reticle that distracts the player).\n\nDespite the frustration of poor aiming, we had fun making slow progress against the neverending hoards of enemies. We had a lot more fun before we realised that this is basically a 1-track racing game disguised as a twin-stick shooter. Disappointingly, the best strategy was just to make a mad dash for the finish line; healing and resuscitating where necessary.\n\nApart from if a player falls off a cliff, there is very little consequence for death.\n\nThe oppenents are the same speed as you, but you have the ability to 'blink' forwards a short distance, and this has a very short cooldown. Disappointingly, this made running in circles a viable strategy.\n\nThe end boss had some enjoyable mechanics, however, it was very easy to defeat once you worked out the 3 mechanics. These were always repeated in the same order, so there was less need to react but rather to just remember the order of attacks.\n\nFinally, there was a hardcore mode, but it was almost identical to the normal mode except that if you both died you had to go repeat a few levels. We actually found Hardcore mode easier because we already knew all the content and what had to be done.","March 3","false","10.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Its good fun with a friend and a couple of controllers.\n\nGunnheim plays a little different than you would expect, basically you have a primary weapon that is generally not good enough to really beat things down with. It'll get you by but you need the special weapon drops. Those special weapon drops tend to have very low ammo so it adds a surprisingly strategic element to the game when you have to decide when is the best time to pull the trigger - because getting it wrong probably means death.\n\nEnemies are distinctly different and you have to deal with them all a little bit differently which adds a lot to the strategy element. Feedback is pretty good too, response from the gameplay is very readable. The 'arcade'-y feel and old school menu art is awesome.\n\nIt's super simple yet the skill factor really makes it enjoyable. Most of the significant bugs seems nonexistant but there is plenty of room for polish. Almost every part of the game could use another iteration pass. Animations, hitboxes, AI behavior, level design, etc all need some more attention. A few levels are almost completely pointless because you can just run straight through them with basically no danger. Don't expect Gauntlet style quality level design.\n\nOverall I would say 4/5 for fun and its potential to scale up to something way more awesome pretty quick.

I love these type of games and I haven't played a good one until Gunnheim came along, I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys games like this.\n\nThe gameplay is what you expect from a twin stick shooter, but the things that separate this game from other similar ones are what make it unique.  First off is the graphics, just as the dev's listed, it is not pixelated and that to me is very refreshing.  Yes pixels aren't bad, but can get tiring, with Gunnheim however the graphics are very charming, there is a lot of warmth when you play through the various levels.  The other thing is the setting of the game, I don't know why, but the idea of vikings using guns is hilarious and refreshing.  You would never think of a viking wielding a gun, but somehow the dev's made it work.\n\nThe temporary weapon drops add some flavor to the gameplay as you progress through the levels.  That way you're not using the same default gun throughout the whole game.  There are a variety of weapon drops such as plasma rifles, plasma cannons, cannons, buzzsaw shooters, grenade launchers, and the all mighty tactical nuke.  And yes all of these drops are pretty strong, but they don't last forever, there is limited use to them so that you don't blaze through the game with ease.\n\nOverall the game is very playable.  It is a solid top-down twin stick shooter.  Do know that is is still in early access, there are only two playable characters so far and a handful of levels, but the dev's are continually adding and improving the game.  As of now you can beat the game from 45 min - 1 hour, but really though this game is so fun you're gonna keep playing more :D\nThe dev's are very interactive with the players in the forums.

I have never met any dev's as nice as these :)\nSo I am positive that the amount of gameplay hours will definitely increase.\n\nI do hope this review helps, I know it is lengthy, but this game deserves it.","September 14, 2015","true","30.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

RIP headphone users\n-No options menu during gameplay\n-Glitchy occasionally (Example: As you can see in the video, one level started, but 3 of us spawned in a random location and died instantly)\n-Only one character to play of as of right now\n-The AI can be very odd at some points. You can easily walk around the most common enemy in circles and be perfectly safe. At one point, the AI completly stopped in place when all of us died but one player, and didn't resume action until another player was revived\n-Control intructions miss out a few details, such as "Q" being back, in addition to special\n-No indication/selection of your in-game color. This, combined with the fact that names don't show up in the lobby, and that there is currently only the Zerker class available, can lead to a lot of confusion as to who is who, in the lobby, and in game\n\n\nAll in all, not a bad experi.ence for a day one early access. I'm sure all issues/complaints I've addressed will be patched in the future.

That's what Gunnheim requires of you.  Give it both, and you'll have a rewarding experience I am sure.  Give it neither, and you'll walk away disappointed.  I am personally on the fence about this one.  The graphics and design are great.  The controls are tight.  The game is just really hard.  If you're up for a challenge or a big fan of shooters, give it a go for sure.  The game seems solid all around.

I try to only reviews games I think I'll enjoy, thus the lack of negative ratings.\n\n\nDo you like shooting stuff? You do? Good, because Gunnheim is a no-frills twin-stick shooter that dispenses with everything that doesn't involve blowing things to smithereens. Forget long tutorials, meandering stories and character setups, you'll be dropped straight into the action.\n\nA hub splits the game into 4 zones, each containing 7 short levels (played in random order) + a final boss area. The goal is to shoot your way through to the finish line and defeat the game's 4 bosses blocking your way to the final encounter. Progress mid-zone is not saved, which I didn't mind at all because the gameplay is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.\n\nZone 1 is quite the standard affair but things get a lot more interesting after that, not only in terms of environments but in the enemies and the way that they attack and what's required of you to complete the levels. Difficulty is not selectable and the challenge is fairly standard. I had quite a bit of trouble geting past "Are We Lost?" the first time around, but afterwards I finished the game in 1 sitting without too much trouble, after getting the knack of dodging (and not falling into holes). The other thing you may need a few minutes to familiarize yourself with is the aiming. Your character will first turn to face the direction you push the right stick to instead of instantly shooting in that line.\n\nGunnheim mixes cartoony graphics with gorey action into a beautiful blend of pure carnage. For a family-friendly experience, you can turn the blood off. Environments and enemies are fairly low in detail but this contrasts with surprisingly nice light and shadow effects. Blue lasers rebounding everywhere while campfires cast light and shadow onto the rocks is a pretty cool sight to behold!\n\nSpeaking of the weapons, this is my favourite element of Gunnheim. At almost 4 hours in I was still finding new weapons from the random drops. Miniguns, grenade launchers, laser cannons, acid shotguns (!!!) and the others are a real joy to wield and when I picked up what I can only describe as a very BFG, my jaw dropped when I pulled that trigger. That was an A+ moment :)\n\n2 characters are unlocked from the beginning with 2 more as unlockables. I didn't like the male character's default weapon because it slows your movement when you fire, making it harder to dodge bullets. I learned to love the shotgun-packing female character pretty quickly and found her first aid skill to be indespensible in single-player.\n\nI haven't tried the co-op mode, but I can only imagine it would amplify the fun. Most people should find a good deal of replayability here with the addiont of Hardcore and online/local co-op modes.\n\nIf you're looking for a straight-to-the-point twin-stick shooter thats fun to play and has some nice surprises in store, I highly recommend you give Gunnheim a try.\n\n\nGiveaway here (Ends December 24th 2015): https://www.bobmanbob.com\n","December 9, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game is boring and uninspiring, and just overall frustrating to play. I've played both single and multi-player, and neither inspired confidence in this games ability to provide enjoyment.
