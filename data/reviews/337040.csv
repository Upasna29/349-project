If you get a kick out of experimental titles, the $10 entry price is perfectly reasonable and you should probably check this out. If you're looking for something to entertain you for more than a couple of days, I'd give it a miss.\n\n---\n\nDeadnaut's concept has real potential, and the devs nailed the visuals/audio here in my opinion - a wonderful cramped aesthetic combined with atmospheric sounds and visual effects really creates a claustrophobic feeling and oozes tension, whilst allowing the devs to utilise a very minimal graphics set for the primary "gameplay" portion, fleshing it out with the logs you find and the descriptions of the enemies you encounter that you'll analyse between missions.\n\nMost of the "tactical" portion comes in determining how to leverage your squad's innate skills with the available equipment and dealing with whatever negative traits they have. This isn't as much fun as it sounds - I've not found any reason other than people not getting along to want to split your squad up (there doesn't appear to be any other tactical advantage to doing so - the squad that stays together has an innate firepower advantage), so it feels a bit like a forced carryover from Zafehouse that probably could have been left out, or the relationship factors made an optional "bigger challenge" difficulty.\n\nCombat feels a little uninspiring - your guys will exchange fire/blows with the enemy, and whether you've kitted them out properly (in accordance with the intelligence you've collected in previous outings) is going to be the primary determinant of success, meaning if you screwed that portion up, there's no way you're going to recover. I'm yet to make it past the second mission in each set of four though, so I might be missing elements that get introduced later.\n\nExploring was great fun at first, but I was hoping for a bit more variation in what you find on ships - every single "investigate" icon I've clicked on has been a crew corpse - some more descriptive flavour text from your troops on what they see when they enter a room would probably also make it feel less like I'm exploring the same randomly chained set of rooms over and over.\n\nI'd love to see this fleshed out further in a sequel - perhaps with an XCOM style "base" mechanic, where you send Deadnauts off to explore derelicts, research tech, and lose hundreds of "volunteers" in the process, perhaps collecting information that will stop you suffering the same fate as the aliens whose ships you explore.\n\nIn summary - much like Zafehouse, it's a great concept that draws you in, but some of the execution will leave you wishing parts were more fleshed out.","December 9, 2014","false","3.2"," 146 of 168 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","146","168","0","1"

Don't be put off by the real-time aspect of the game, your Deadnauts aren't idiots and will automatically fire at any hostiles they detect. ***\n\nSearching derelict ships from ancient civilizations in deep space is pretty much as deadly as it sounds, however, a well balanced party with the appropriate equipment can brave the dangers and emerge relatively unscathed.  While your first few attempts might result in you getting your party horribly maimed, a little attentiveness and situational awareness will go a long way and allow you to play an entire game with no casualties.  Make your own party and name them after friends and family, and if they die, no worries!  You can clone them!  Just don't get too attached to the clone...\n\nThere will be incredibly tense moments in game that are not arbitrarily forced on you via a streamlined story and can't be replicated every game you play.  Each ship has it's own challenges and enemies that can potentially shorten your life span.  Since enemies, loot, and ship layout changes with each new campaign, there is no reliable way to game the meta and ensure victory each play through.\n\nBetween traditional zombie-like space enemies that want to disembowel you, giant Sentinels (laser turrets!) that can gun down your entire party in a matter of seconds, and artifical intelligence programs known as Watchers that are essentially cyber ninjas patrolling the ship's network you have your work cut out for you.  Running around guns blazing might work in one campaign and get you killed within five minutes in another.\n\nImagine the following scenario : Your hearty crew breach a new room and as they cautiously advance are suddenly swarmed on nearly all sides by almost a dozen enemies.  Fear sets in and bullets fly in every direction, your non-combat oriented Deadnauts not having the best accuracy under the pressure.  Inadvertently, the stray rounds bounced around the room far more than recommended and comprimised the structural integrity of the room you're in.  Life support fails and your crew is mercilessly exposed to the vacuum of space.  You quickly dart towards the door you just entered from, when unexpectedly, your video feed dies, you can't issue orders to your men because your audio feed has been cut, and the door they're attempting to reach has been sealed.  Congratulations, a roaming Watcher just ruined your day because you forgot to install a firewall earlier to counter it.\n\nThe watcher can't maintain the jam for a long period of time, and your audio/visual feed comes back just in time for you to realize the majority of your party is at half life from standing in the destroyed section of the ship.  Your Deadnaut hacker hauls ♥♥♥ to the door, opens it, and everyone throws themselves into the safety of the adjoining room.  Or maybe everyone dies horribly because your hacker got dragged off and flayed earlier.  Unfortunately, it takes 15 seconds to open the sealed door and everybody dies in the mean time.\n\nThat is just a sample of the fun you can expect!\n\nAs far as party composition goes, your crew of five's roles are determined by the type of suit they're wearing, as it will allocate different slots for equipment in weapons, tech, sensors, or protection.  When you complete missions, find blueprints on the ships you're searching, or purchase new ones on the marketplace afterwards, you might have a suit with slots for weapons and tech.  This changes each game, however, and the slots each type of suit has is different every time.\n\nBut just because there is no class system in Deadnaut's does not mean you're going to assign a dumb grunt the role as the group's techie responsible for deactivating turrets or installing firewalls to keep Watchers off your back.  Characters have four stats that correspond with eight abilities, and where an interesting aspect of the game comes into play is character creation.  You can customize your roster of Deadnaut's to fulfill specific roles.\n\nThese aren't going to be Master Chief's with flawless personalities and sparkly clean criminal records, since only the desperate or deranged would seek what usually amounts to a one way trip into deep space aboard alien derelict ships.  If you want a character with extra stats to allocate you're going to have to decide if you want to assign them extra flaws, such as taking stims without being ordered or maybe they periodically steal money from the group.  Is that trade off worth the extra firepower?\n\nAt the end of the day this game offers a lot for $10 and while I probably won't be investing 100s of hours into it, I've enjoyed the short time I've spent and will log more later.  For me it scratches an itch and even reminds me a bit of Firefly, in the way that you have a motley crew, all with different motivations, just trying to make ends meat in the darkest corners of the galaxy.\n\n\nPros :\n\n- A unique game that pulls no punches, you're punished for your mistakes and rewarded for careful planning and positioning.\n\n- The game changes with each campaign, one might have you searching medical ships discovering what went wrong, while others will have you salvaging military warships with active turrets around every corner.\n\n- Good amount of character customization, I was able to reconstruct my family with pretty accurate detail (or, what our futuristic Deadnaut alter egos would be).  Each Deadnaut had their place in my party and if one of them died it made the mission harder.\n\n- Intense atmosphere, the sound is well done and when alarms start going off, you start to panic.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Even after reading the manual it still took trial and error in game to figure out what was happening and how to use abilities in game.  It didn't take very long, but it could be a potential source of frustration.\n\n- While the atmosphere is pretty interesting, the crew logs aren't particularly intense and are repetitive.  Once you've read the log of one ship, you've pretty much read them all.\n\n- Replayability might be questionable for some people.  My first successful campaign completion took 2 hours, and my second one took barely 66 minutes.  That doesn't mean I'm done with the game, however, as each campaign has individual challenges and I've only succeeded on about 2 out of 9 attempts.  Others might finish one campaign and be done though.\n\n- Confusing relationship mechanics.  I couldn't tell why one of my characters with high cohesion (the charisma stat) was hated by everyone else.  Sometimes your characters mesh really well together, and other times they start fighting within minutes of a new campaign, even with the likeable trait.\n\n\nTL;DR = Even if the game doesn't receive substantial updates, this is a game worth trying if you're into strategy games or rogue likes/lites.  Or dying surrounded by friends and family on an alien ship in deep space sounds really fun.","December 9, 2014","true","12.4"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","54","58","0","1"

I have played this game for about 3 hours, and it's been teeth-grindingly frustrating. I am being completely honest when I say I have absolutely never felt this level of animosity towards a game. Here are the biggest problems I can list, if and following that I will lay out in more detail my frustrations to anybody who wants to read that far.\n1: Totally random. It's entirely possible to gear up your team and send them into a 100% impossible mission\n2: Even when you know what you're doing, impossible scenarios will be thrown at you\n3: No mod support. Don't like a feature? Too bad. You're stuck with it. (Devs have said it will come with enough player demand, but I doubt it very seriously just from their phrasing about the work it would take)\n4: Some of the character flaws can make a character impossible to use. In an already ball-busting difficulty curve, do we really need that?\n5: While in pressured suits, you can die of vacuum exposure. Excuse me?\n6: Sentinels. Big evil guns that kill in one hit, can only be hacked once you've seen them, and tend to sit out in the open where you won't see them by any means until it's far too late.\n7: You will be SEVERELY outnumbered and there's a good chance you'll find yourself swarmed by a very large group of armed to the teeth aliens\n8: You'll unlock new weapons before you have armor capable of supporting it. Hope you didn't waste your currency on it too early.\n9: Some of the contextual actions have to be activated from a certain camera angle, or else the menu will disappear.\n10: Replacing squad members is too expensive for this kind of game.\n\nSo right there we have 10 good reasons to dodge this one. The concept kicks butt, no denying. I LOVE the atmosphere. I love the isolation. You, as the character, are the pilot of some nondescrepit kind of 1980s tech powered spaceship, and you control all the action through a series of 3 screens and a viewport. I have really felt the pangs of loneliness just staring at these screens, and overall Screwfly did a fantastic job of setting the backdrop and stage for their game. Truly fantastic. However, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, just like Zafehouse Diaries. I hate that game, simply because it's impossible. Every little thing you do will end in disaster constantly because the gameplay is half-baked and poorly implemented. But we're not discussing that here, we're talking about the poor gameplay in ANOTHER game by the same developer. First up is the gearing. You may either create your own characters, or roll the dice. There are 4 classes, as follows:\nCombat (carries weapons as primary)\nTech (Carries hacking gear as primary)\nField (Carries shield projectors as primary)\nSensor (Carries sensor pingers as primary)\nAll of these have a place in the squad except for Field. Because of the limitations of the armor, if you only have one field unit, you have to play favorites with your soldiers. Sure, you only need to extract 1 Deadnaut from the ship to be successful, but at a whopping 3,000Kn to revive the dead, it's pretty much a death sentence to do that. Now then, for the first 2 1/2 hours, I died in the first ship. Every time. I'd get somewhere close, and then I'd die. But this last mission is what did me in. I went into it as carefully as I could. I got lucky: Melee only enemies in a tight ship with decent integrity. That's the best setup you can get. I even caught the Sentinel on board and was able to disable it safely. But it all broke down as I was pulling the log. Would you know, the gen engine decided to place a teleporter on the bridge. I have 2 options: Either destroy it and safely extract the data, or let it be and face a steady stream of enemies until I can get away. I chose to destroy it, and for some reason that vented the bridge. Now here's where it got fun. Noticing that all of my characters were dying from vacuum (which above... Pressure suits. Explain this immediately.), I instructed them to grab the log and run back out the door. The door is now locked thanks to Watchers, which patrol the ship and look for ways to cause you BIG problems. Either way, the instructions were ignored. All of my signal bars were full, and I should've been able to get out fine, but nope. Nobody was taking orders at all. It wasn't until the first person suffocated that everybody else got in gear, grabbed the log, and another died before the door opened. So even in the most optimistic scenario, I lost 2/5 because of 'random' factors. I feel the need to say that I don't oppose the idea of rougelike games. I enjoy them from time to time. But when I encounter a game that I can sink 3 hours into and STILL not beat the first level, well I consider that to be a failure on the part of the developer. Do not buy this game if you enjoy your sanity. If it's the atmosphere you want, go buy Elegy for a Dead World. Much the same feeling of isolation and lonelyness, much less wanting to put an axe in your computer.","May 20, 2015","false","7.3"," 89 of 115 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","89","115","6","17"

Deadnaut is one of the most atmospheric games in any genre I have played ever. Period. [I've been a gamer since the Amiga, Atari St, and C64 days].\n\nDeadnaut has a gritty aesthetic, this isn't Star Trek with everything looking shiny and somewhat sterile. In fact, Deadnaut feels more "primitive" than being aboard the Nostromo. It sort of looks like the interior of a World War II sub yanked into the future. It feels somewhat claustrophobic and that adds to the tension. Moreover, your sensors aren't exactly Star Trek issue either. As you monitor your squad to their impending doom, the viewscreen - or port to be more accurate - will sometimes experience staic due to radiation levels. As in Alien, squad life signs are monitored and that too is rather panic inducing as you try to get your squad out of harm's way - and there is a LOT of harm lurking in these derelict ships you are exploring.\n\nCharacter creation is deep. You have points to spend on each phase of each crewperson's stats. But, Deadnaut goes beyond mere D&D type stas. You are creating a sort of skeletal bio of each member. Their education earlier in "lie" directly impacts their performance on missions and even more interestingly it impacts how each individual squad member interacts with the rest of the squad. Yiu get a sense that these are truly mercenary type space scavengers and there is no noble quest to fulfill.\n\nThe action is in real time though the pace is not frantic. The sensor representation of the derelicts and your crew are somewhat abstract but rather than that being a distraction, it actually adds to the atmosphere of this gem out of nowhere.\n\nI have played as of this writing only 21 mintes or so. All but one of my squad died and we are talking perma-death here. That said, the game is not unfair as many rogue type games can be. I suppose I would call this a successful (so far) marriage of RTS, RPG, and Rogue like.\n\nIt's fun, dark, grimy, and weird - like my girlfriend but without the Satanic tattoos.\n\nSee you out there sister and brother Deadnauts!!","December 8, 2014","true","0.4"," 90 of 120 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","90","120","0","10"

You're Lieutenant William Gorman!\n\nTaken directly in that context, this game succeeds quite well atmospherically. The console is chunky lo-fi-sci-fi and the viewscreen reminds of the installation map they looked at in the movie. This is a nice way for an indie developer to get away with less compelling graphics in the viewscreen. The game continually reminds you that you're not personally with the squad. Your video, audio, data connections fluctuate and commands sometimes aren't heard.\n\nThe gameplay is quite good in that you have a small squad of highly specialized guys (you can customize them a bunch) and you have to micromanage them carefully to succeed. The game is very challenging but I find I've usually lost due to a moment of carelessness, in classic roguelike fashion.\n\nExcellent replayability. I've won, I've lost many times, and I'm still playing it and having new experiences each time. It's enjoyable to fail, tweak your squad members, and try again.\n\nThe flavor text generation is a nice touch. The ship logs, the overarching story, the alien descriptions, the enemy characteristics, and the lengthy descriptions for all of the above, are quite well done. Though much of it doesn't really matter from a gameplay perspective I still enjoy reading about it.\n\nThe enemies are different each game, sometimes quite substantially. It might be ice zombies, ethereal specters, leaping hordes, etc. Between each of the 4 ships in the campaign, you have a chance to buy equipment. Your purchasing decisions are based largely on how well you have investigated the ships, and how much you have learned about the enemy's strengths and weaknesses. Reading the logs is really quite important, and making decisions based on them will make or break your campaign.\n\nRecommended!","July 11, 2015","true","20.1"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","33","37","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/337040/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account",""Deadnaut" refers to the unfortunate astronauts you command in this real-time squad tactics game, so named because your mission is to hunt through derelict spacecraft full of dead things, and also because their odds of survival are about that of a 2016 GOP presidential hopeful. Each randomly-generated campaign is four missions long, each mission being a crawl through a randomized ship with randomized enemies, layouts, and corpses to loot. Most missions either have you nabbing the ship's log from the bridge or clearing out all hostiles, and scanning the bodies you find earns you Knowledge which you can use to buy new gear between missions or clone dead 'nauts. What sets this particular roguelike tactics game apart, however, is the presentation. You command your squad from the safety of your ship through some 1960s Soviet submarine-looking monitors. The actual action is all wireframe and icons on a fuzzy radar screen, with rough readouts on health and sanity and radio chatter marred by glare. The real draw of this game is basically roleplaying Gorman from Aliens, commanding your troops on lovingly-rendered low-fi hardware and despairing helplessly as they get picked off one by one.\n\nAnd they will get picked off, because there are very few limits on what the RNG will throw at you. For some reason, your Deadnauts and their alien foes have a ridiculous number of stats, including combat skills, sanity modifiers, specific weapon resistances, and more. I say 'for some reason' because despite the enormous depth to the characters, you cannot affect these stats and skills in any way. You have the option of customizing Deadnauts before you start a campaign, but once you begin everything is locked in. There's no training or buffing. Worse than this, however, is the enemy generation. Enemies can be anything from ghosts to mutants to cyborgs (all depicted as plain red dots, mind you) meaning their health, attack patterns, and resistances can be all over the place. But you don't know this going into a mission and you can't re-gear once deployed, so if you picked beam weapons and end up fighting things that resist beams, game over, man, game over. Diversifying your team between different weapon types and shields and such could mitigate this, except that (A) you won't get nearly enough Knowledge to effectively diversify and (B) you won't have the focused firepower to take down super beefy enemies.\n\nThe strangest limitation by far, however, is the lack of combat orders you can give your team. You can move your Deadnauts around as you want, order them to investigate points of interest. You can give hacking specialists orders to open doors or commandeer automated security systems, and you can have defensive units shield others or debuff enemies. But when it comes to actual fighting, and it ALWAYS comes to actual fighting, all you can really do is stand and shoot. You can't even effectively order 'nauts to attack a specific enemy because the game seems to factor in their sight lines, attention span, and sanity to decide if they're going to listen. There are no cover mechanics, no flanking, nothing. I wasn't kidding when I called it a Gorman simulator, because your orders will end up being as effective as his were.\n\nIt's such a strange and ultimately disappointing game, because the foundation for something amazing is all there. The presentation and atmosphere is spot on, and there's a huge variety of situations and systems to plan strategies around. But the game never actually gives you the tools to realize those strategies. Stats are meaningless if you can't do anything with them, and tons of weapon and damage types are actually a liability if you don't know what you'll be fighting next and can't afford to diversify. Even the systems that are really fleshed out have severe drawbacks. Your connection to your Deadnauts can crap out, forcing you to boost audio or video connections to stay in contact. It's a neat touch that does a lot for immersion, but it can also send your Deadnauts into a depressurized room to die en masse because the bad audio connection makes them mishear the order (yes, this happened). I've beaten the campaign once, and I can honestly say it was because I got a lucky combination of gear and easy enemies to use it on. In the final analysis, it's a strategy game where your strategy isn't going to determine whether you win or lose. With so many other great offerings like Invisible, Inc. and Darkest Dungeon, it's impossible to recommend.","August 26, 2015","false","2.5"," 59 of 82 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","59","82","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/annoctatio/recommended/337040/","annoctatio","#Winnator2000","http://steamcommunity.com/id/annoctatio/","136 products in account","Deadnaut provides a lot of creepy atmosphere, fun and replayability.\nWhen I bought Dreadnaut and entered the game, I didn't expect much based on the trailers available. It seemed just like all those top-down squad RTS games, which there are hundreds of. It was only 10 euros, so I decided to jump it and test it out.\n\nI immediately reached out for the character creation. I've always been one for creating my own party/character, since the game experience feels a lot more personal. The character creation has two minor bugs, which I did not realize were bugs until I read the forums for a tutorial on character creation. The bugs:\n\nYou cannot proceed "Early Career" -phase without having at least 1 extra point.\nSelecting flaw Attention Seeker bugs out, so it disappears from the list, making it impossible to deselect.\nOther than that, the character creating didn't seem to be that extensive, but it lets you fleck out certain bits of personality on the character. There are a certain set of different charasteristics you get to choose, if you want to spend a point on them. For example, "He likes combat, he doesn't like ruined rooms, he likes tight corridors" etc.\n\nIt took me nearly 2 hours to flesh out my squad consisting of five Deadnauts. After that, I finally got into the game. And oh boy, here comes the best part...\n\nThe game itself plants you, the "Commander" in the charge of leading your squad through those derelict ships, looking for whatever the mission is. On the way, you collect Knowledge, which is the currency in this game, from bodies, artifacts, killing enemies and simply finding new rooms. After you've finished your mission, which might be "Destroy artifacts", "recover ship's log", "eliminate all resistance" or something along those lines, you simply reach your starting room's Escape Hatch or you use any of those you might've found during your search on the ship. The combat is pretty straightforward. You say where your guys go, your guys (might not) do that, and when they reach there they shoot the baddies IF THEY SEE THEM. You better pack a scanner with you, because those damn Spectres are near invisible. You can also manually target a single enemy, which gives you a great freedom on choosing the most important target first.\n\nNow, why should you call this creepy? Because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ creepy. All those howls, yells, screams and growls make my hairs stand up. They sound extremely authentic. You're a commander behind a radio, giving orders to your squad, when you suddenly hear your squad firing their weapons, and you hear loud, unnatural screech. Your squad starts backing away, but on the comms, a message, "We've lost Johns!". Soon the enemy, whatever the hell it was, lies dead on the ground. Your squad makes your way through the derelict ship, completing their mission and encountering little resistance. However, when you're heading back to the escape hatch, you encounter one last enemy. Again, on the comms arrives a message. "Wait, is that Johns?" as you notice your squad starts rupturing apart like flies.\n\nThis game is minimalistic on the graphical side, although the UI with the scanners, character profiles and information screens are just like you would expect on a high-tech commander's station on a spaceship. The UI isn't that user-friendly, and takes a lot of getting used to. It is confusing at first, but when you learn how to use it, it becomes effective. Replayability on this game is a huge 10/10, since the missions are dynamically generated. The story, the enemies you encounter, the ships you go on, the stuff that happens, it's generated. Aside from the bugs on the character creation, I haven't encountered any major bugs in game. You can import your own character portraits, which is great for more personality.\n\nMy personal score for this game is 8/10, and a place for top 10 games of 2014 on my list.

It has a great feeling of curiosity to it where you want to play more than once to see the different kinds of enemies and the different...things...that happen with some of them.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of top down tactical movement with your Deadnauts firing automatically. You can use certain items during combat such as a rocket launcher or a 'field' that can slow enemies or shield your allies. There's also hacking sub part that fits in pretty well with your signals being interfered with if you just ignore it, but it doesn't feel forced at the same time. There aren't a ton of graphics, but it doesn't feel like it needs them, though the small viewport does take some getting used to!\n\nThere's also a shop after missions where you trade 'knowledge' for equipment. You also get to create your own Deadnauts too which is fun in of itself. Figuring out which perks and flaws you want can take a while and makes the game more interesting. Also custom portraits so you can kill off your friends if you want.\n\nOverall I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-fi and atmosphere and can stand dying. The game definitely has a mildly steep initial learning curve. To me the only real downside is the length of campaigns and really it's not that bad since the way the game works is that you'll want to play it multiple times.\n\nOh and if you do play, keep playing until you go up against the 'disturbed' and 'horror' enemy types.","December 8, 2014","true","9.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

Yet in another campaign you may be contending with the possessed remains of a former crew driven insane by unknown artifacts, behemoths throwing your soldiers around as artifacts obscure your command and control with horrifying visions of death and torture.\n\nDeadnaut's is a game that wants to immerse you in its universe. Your hud looks akin to something from a WW2 submarine simulation and your control over your soldiers is sketchy at the best of times. There are a large amount of things to take into consideration with Deadnaut's and many ways for those under your command to come to harm or die, this may be the one area the game faulters in. It is a real time tactical squad based game, essentially a rogue like.\n\nSo what do you do? You command five "deadnauts" as you scour decaying alien ships from a long gone era. Your objective is typically to figure out what happend to the crew, learn more about this civilization and clear out any hostile remnants, examining the dead crew and reading their logs. Your characters are divided into four seperate roles, a Assaulter, Shielder, Hacker and Scanner. Assaulters carry the big guns and are more hardy, however too much firepower could result in you destroying a section of the ship if not outright blowing up the ship. Shielders can project a powerful shield onto your deadnaut's, as well as allow your men to move through area's of the ship with no air, however they lack on offensive firepower being forced to only use pistols or knives. Hackers can hack into the ships systems, open locked doors, establish firewalls and alter the ships power levels, creating two whole levels of combat between the ship's anti-virus systems and its "crew". Finally the Scanner can scan areas of the ship to locate hidden enemies and for you to plan out your attack.\n\nYour charactes can be customised fully, and have unique, and random, backgrounds and relationships. You may get one crew who are all on good terms with one another, or one that is divided into two groups and hates the other. Character creation is in depth with you assigning points to areas to boost their statistics, you can get more points by applying negative traits to your character.\n\nThe ship itself is dying and decaying, parts of the ship may have no lifesupport and its defence systems are in a varying state of readness. The ship itself has several ways of defending itself. Doors are its first line of defence, simply closing them or keeping them locked can slow you down, the second level of defence are Watcher's, moving programs that will attempt to undo any hacks you've made, so closing doors you've opened for example. The final level of defence are sentinal turrets, extreamly lethal but they can be hacked to your side, until a Watcher reverts the hack.\n\nThe actual enemies themselves also vary, as you would expect from a roguelike. Fast moving aliens, zombified crewmembers, etheral ghosts, plague carriers and much more. Each enemie type has to be respected and observerd to determin their weaknesses. Some may die from a single bullet from a ballistic firearm, others may be impervious to bullets but not to lasers. Some might be hidden to your sight but your scanners can pick them out easily, they may move through walls or drag your men away from you. There are many combinations that will keep you on your toes.\n\nHowever, for all the good I can talk about this game, it does have downsides, like any game good or bad.\n\nDeath can be quick and sudden, and the difficulty can vary from easy to impossible at times. You may enter a room only to see all your men drop dead instantly. The game is also glitchy, some time's you may not be able to select something to examine in game, or log entries will be jumbled or unselectable. Losing control of your soldiers can also be frustrating, having your men decided to run away and get killed because of a misclick or some wierd personality trait that caues them to ignore your orders.\n\nThere is also no real in game tutorial, just some one off tool tips. There is a manual that you can read (and I highly recommend you do) but even that can be hit and miss.\n\nThe game is also heavily RNG dependant. You may never recieve the tools on the market, meaning if the enemies are vulnerable to Beam Cold weapons, yet you may never be able to buy a Beam Cold weapon. Also you may never recieve vital equipment like uprgraded suits.\n\nHowever, at 10$ this is a solid game that is very immersing. There is a lot to do and see, a wide range of tactics to apply and a lot of replayability. It can be frustrating but at the same time your skill can surmount many obsticals.\n\nI only wish the game had more to do, such as a XCOM style game of sending out Deadnaut's to difference areas in space to explore and more of a metagame. Or even just a way to carry over a team from one campaign to another. Nonetheless, this game is fun.","December 9, 2014","true","10.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

I might update it at some point.\n\nAll in all a great roguelike game. Great atmosphere, superb sound design, fitting (if somewhat minimalistic) graphics, creepy enemies and lots of equipment to research and outfit your Deadnauts with. The game does a great job making you feel like a remote mission planner.. you feel very distant and disconnected from the life and death struggle of your Deadnauts on a strange alien ship. Yet, at the same time, you become more and more attached to these sensor blips on your screen after each (usually harrowing) mission.\n\nBut there are also a few things I find lacking. While I do like the challenging difficulty, the game just sometimes grabs you by the b***s and doesn't let go until you're dead. And that can happen in the very first mission, which makes this game rather frustrating for newcomers. If you can't handle RNG and missions going from everything is dandy straight to hell in a matter of seconds, you should stay away from this game. But that goes for any roguelike, really.\n\nAnother complaint I have, is that you can't seem to hire new Deadnauts during a campaign. You can only clone your existing five Deadnauts.. which makes playing the game with randomly generated characters completely unappealing, because you can just create five very good minmaxed Deadnauts since you're stuck with the same guys for the entirety of a campagin anyway. Which makes the game's claim that Deadnauts are expendable (says so in the intro) untrue.\n\nAnother thing I found annoying is that you can't abort a mission. You have to complete the objective, before you can evacuate your Deadnauts from the alien ship.. why? It would be cooler, if you could abandon missions, xcom style. Also, the mission objectives themselves seem to be lacking in variety. In about four hours of playtime and probably 10 - 15 missions I only ever had two objectives: to either find the ship's log or to destroy mysterious artifacts. But maybe I have been only unlucky sofar, since the missions are randomly generated. And the missions themselves (layouts) have been fairly varied.\n\nIt would also be nice, if the game would allow you to carry over researched equipment from one campaign to another. Starting at zero every single time you start a new campaign can become quite tiresome.\n\nDespite those flaws (well, they are flaws only in my opinion ofc.) I still think this is a great atmospheric and in style unique game which deserves a closer look. There is a demo available on Screwflie's Deadnaut page, as far as I am aware.\n\nIn it's current state, I would give this game an HONEST 7/10 (honest as in 5 is average and everything above that is good). A great, but not perfect, game!\n\nUPDATE: It took me about 7.5 hours to complete my first campaign (including character creation, so actual playtime was probably closer to seven hours). Sooner than I expected.. but then again, the game does offer high replay value. Mission objectives have become more varied since I started over, so that's good.\n\nBut I did notice another annoying thing: you perform actions by clicking on ingame popup texts (such as investigate, hack, etc...). The problem is that your Deadnauts can sometimes only interact with those, if you rotate your camera to a different angle.. which can be really infuriating in situations where every second counts. Luckily this bug happened only infrequently. I can still recommend this game to roguelike fans who don't mind the other stuff I have listed.","June 20, 2015","true","15.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

A VERY early review. Literally had two attempts at the first mission, and died both of them. (Should've rolled my own characters, I guess, and not relied on random ones!)\n\nBut so far it's utterly compelling - a very different take on the usual roguelike or Space Hulk-type games. The display screen system is inspired, the graphics are clean and incredibly good, and it's definitely going to get a lot more play going on. I especially like the character generation system and some of the in-game comms (both the character banter and having to tweak the system power to reduce interference). Sound is atmospheric, controls are fairly intuitive, and whilst it's a touch unconventional, it really is a bargain.\n\nI've only scratched the surface of Deadnaut so far, but it's looking to be a corking indie title.

According to the creepy gameplay watcher, I've played 4 1/2 hours so far, and that sounds about right. A full campaign lasts around an hour to an hour and a half, maybe two if you like to take it slow. I just finished my first successful campaign; all others failed on the first ship... within about 5 minutes of breaching the airlock.\n\nSo what is Deadnaut? Basically, it's Space Crusade, except, instead of 7 foot killing machines in power armour, your squad bears a greater resemblance to the crew of the Serenity, or maybe Red Dwarf, depending on the characters you end up with; they're pretty good at what they do, even impressive at times, but they're hardly intimidating. You sit back on the mothership and command your squad through the interfaces that you can see in the screenshots up at the top of this page, pointing out which terminals you want hacked, which doors you want opened, and which -OH HELL WHAT IS THA-JUST SHOOT! KILL IT!!!!- and which centuries-old corpses you want rummaged as you go about completing your objectives. Meanwhile, your crew are chattering away amongst themselves about their stim habits, love of blood-soaked gore rooms, and what kind of card the techie wants for their birthday.\nDo a good job, and next time you'll have the opportunity to die a meaningless death a million light years from home with some slightly swankier gear. Pretty cool, huh?\n\nI only have one complaint about the game, apart from my wails of dismay when my entire team is, yet again, suffocated or torn to shreds by indescribable horrors – within the campaign, you unlock new equipment for your crew... none of that carries over between campaigns. Personally, I'd prefer a persistent meta campaign between the campaigns; develop the crew over a series of missions, replace the losses, say goodbye to the retirees and wish luck to those get attention from the powers back on Earth. I think that would add even greater depth to an already brilliant game, but it is what it is, and what it is is brilliant.\n\nIn my opinion, it's easily a 9/10. (Add that meta campaign in, devs, and I'll give it a 10! :D)","January 18, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The second in their Strategy game repetoire, Deadnauts literally puts you in the pilots seat of a scavenging space vessel with the goal of collecting data and new equipment to outfit your five person crew. In staying true to the complex style of Zafehouse, this game will take a bit of playtime (or a LOT of lengthy literature) to get the hang of. The missions are randomly generated, meaning you'll never hit the same ship twice, and the enemies are widely varied. Your first mission might be aboard a Class 5 Mining Vessel (just spewing out random ship designations) where you'll be testing your wits against the ship A.I. with low life support, and abysmal lighting, making it difficult for your crew to navigate the ship. The only frame of reference you have to your crew is a throwback style radar screen with Fog of War impairing your view of their surroundings. It may be possible to experience everything this game has to offer in your lifetime, but it's not very probable. The replay value for fans of RTS games is immense, and because you have control over nearly every aspect, this is one for the OCD micromanagers among us. Deadnauts is nothing if not complicated, however, and you'll most probably spend more time learning how to play the game than actually enjoying it. There is a quick tutorial overview at the start of your first mission, but after that, you're completely on your own. Your crew will interact with eachother differently, depending on their alliances and feelings towards one another. Overall, Deadnauts is not a game for the casual gamer (or even the casual strategy gamer). If you find games like FTL incredibly easy at their hardest difficulty setting, you'll want to give this game a shot.","December 12, 2014","false","0.8"," 25 of 43 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","25","43","0","2"

I got this game solely on the strength of the dev's previous game, Zafehouse Diaries.\n\nI was disappointed at first. I was expecting Zafehouse Diaries In Space. Instead I got what appeared to be some sort of bad Alien/Rogue/Hacker hybrid.\n\nAfter playing for a while, it began to grow on me. Its damnably hard and unforgiving.... I've never cleared more than 2 missions without losing my crew.\nThe game itself is a real-time, tactical top-down/isometric game with strong elements of team management. You play a controller, safe on board your own ship, while your crew of Deadnauts goes out to explore derelicts. You have absolute control over your crew, but they have their own personalities and agendas which can influence others on the team and mission outcomes. The crew can operate autonomously (and may have too, but I'm not going to spoil that), but they don't seem to do much without your direct input.\n\n\nGraphics are extremely mediocre. You're controlling your team via a radar screen.... enemies are shown as dots, the team is shown as dots, and areas of interest are shown as dots. It makes for an intense, immersive feel, but those who like a bit of eye-candy are going to be disappointed.\nBoth sound and music are OK... muted and muffled, they add to the claustrophobic intensity and are well utilised, but again aren't anything special.\n\nIts hard to say who I'd actually recommend this game for. Its really a niche game... which makes comparison difficult. Think sort of early X-Com meets The Sims meets Dark Souls meets SystemShock... if that sounds appealing, its worth the gamble.","April 25, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Entrophic/recommended/337040/","Entrophic","Ћ Oyeatia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Entrophic/","424 products in account","Man, this game... I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with it right now and I mean that in a very good way. I love it for the atmosphere, the asthetic, the tense moment-to-moment gameplay, the customization for your crew and the unrelenting difficult of the game. At the same time, the unrelenting difficult of the game also makes me hate it. I don't mean hate as in 'despise' it, I mean hate as in me going through a mission carefully and methodically and either making a mistake or getting a bad room and completely wiping after several successful missions. All it takes is one slip up and the entire campaign can be over! This definitely isn't a game for people who don't embrace the 'Losing is fun' mindset that comes with many roguelikes and games such as Dwarf Fortress. I have more speciifc thoughts that I'll list below.\n\nThe atmosphere and aesthetic of this game is fantastic. You, the player, are a character in the game. Specifically, you are the overseer of the Deadnauts, your crew of five you send on missions to derelict ships to discover just what happened on board the ship in question as well as to complete various missions, like recovering data from the ship, restoring power to the ship to initiate a sterilization procedure, destroying mysterious artifacts on board and so on. To this end, you use the games UI to order the Deadnauts about. The UI resembles something you'd see onboard a submarine, with a radar screen with all sorts of switches and knobs and whatnot controlling various functions of your display. It's very 'hard sci-fi' with plenty of retro love thrown in. Perhaps retro isn't the right word. It's along the lines of the type of equipment you'd see on board the Nostromo from Alien, only more primitive. This display is your only window into the world your crew is entering. It gives you all information you need to know in the form of health displays for your crew, a log window and a chat window to show your objectives and your crew's responses to what is happening and the center view screen, which gives you a very light but detailed look into the action with each of your crew members represented by their last name and first initial and the Deadnaut insignia. Here, you move them around and instruct them to interact with the environment-things like opening and closing doors, unlocking doors, investigating objects and bodies, initiating hacks, attacking hostiles and so on.\n\nSince you are not actually with the crew and are instead onboard the Deadnaut ship supervising the mission from afar, there are many ways for the display to fail. It will never fail completely, of course, but there are forms of interference that can and will affect your ability to issue orders to your crew as well as to see just what is happening within the derelict ship. These different types of interference can be something within your control or something out of your control. An example of one within your control is a Flaw that you can take for one of your crew to get more points to customize them that causes the Deadnaut in question to occasionally interfere with the display, causing static to flicker across the screen and some lag to occur between what is actually happening and what your scanner is telling you is happening. As well, for one that is out of your control, certain enemies can interfere with your scanners when they are nearby your crew. This can provide some really tense moments when your display is washed out with static and you are left not knowing just what is happening.\n\nThe customization for the Deadnauts is great. When making a character, you start off at their birth by allocating points to the four stats in game Vigor-physical ability-, Acuity-accuracy and detection ability-, Wits-intelligence and hacking ability-and Grit-mental fortitude and cooperation ability-. You then move onto their education, which has you spending points to pick what kind of education they received. The different typs of education provide training in specfic stats. After that, you move onto their early career and select a flaw to give you more points that you will need to select what kind of training they have received. Again, what kind of training they receive provides training in particular stats that will decide what your character will specialize in. It is absolutely possible to either go with a general 'jack/jill of all trades' type character that will be good at everything for you to fall back on if a specialist dies or run with a full crew of specialists at certain tasks. After the Early Career, you can save the character and use them right away. You can also choose to select their Late Career and their Wisdom, both of which also provide further training and bonuses to the character to make them better at what they do while also forcing you to take more flaws to be able to afford these abilities. Once you have a full crew of five Deadnauts, you are able to jump into the game. If you do not wish to create your own Deadnauts, you also have the ability to just jump right in with Deadnauts created by the game.\n\nSo far, I can't get enough of this game. I have written quite a lot about everything I love about it. I suppose now I'll have to talk about what I dislike about it. While the punishing difficulty is certainly fun and I certainly feel that it is a core aspect of the game and it's 'one more run' type of gameplay, it can also be unfair at times. More often than not, if you end up losing a crew member or getting a wipe, it is your own fault for not being more careful as far as scouting out a room and ensuring that those crew members of yours that are better suited to taking hits for the team and returning them are out in front or rushing into a room and having a defensive turret open fire on your crew and kill them, there are times when the randomly generated nature of the game can rear it's ugly head and remind you that randomly generated levels and such aren't always a good thing. I recall one campaign where I started the mission, opened the first door and before I even stepped through the door, a turret on the otherside of the door with a clear line of sight to the only exit to the inital room of the ship opened fire and killed two of my crew. There was no way to get around it so I ended up quitting and starting a new campaign. Stuff like that hasn't happened a ton for me but it has happened. This is when the game's difficulty goes from 'punishing' to 'unfair'. It doesn't happen often, as I said, but it would be nice if stuff like that could be prevented from happening. If there was another exit to the room then alright, that was my bad for opening the wrong door. With only the one exit and what is basically an instant kill turret aiming at the doorway, though, there isn't much I can do other than quit and start a new game.\n\nDon't let that last bit deter you, though. If you like tough, challenging games, games within the 'rougelike' genre and games that demand that you play them one more time for a better run, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It is a fantastic experience and one I will continue to enjoy. For the price as well, it's hard to beat. If any of this sounds like something you might like, I hope you come to enjoy it soon enough as well.","December 9, 2014","true","3.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

No joke, I bought and finished a campaign in under 2 hours. While the content was good, it was over way too fast?\n\nDO NOT READ PAST HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GAME ELEMENTS TO BE SPOILED---------\n\nA few key bothers I have because the game is so short:\n\n- Crew morale and relationships is a dynamic that slowly deteriorates after each mission. I thought that I would need to worry about this in the long run and try to be very efficient in my mission times before my crew started killing each other. However, the campaign ended before I saw any of that become a factor. A main factor of the game is these derelect spaceships causing crew members to go insane. Isn't that something I should worry about happening to my team as well?\n\n- There's a wide variety of weapon types and similarly defense types. It goes from standard, light, medium, to heavy.\n... I finished the game just as I got my first Heavy items. I was still using tier 2 weapons on the last mission, no problem. Not only that, Because it was my first run though, I just defaulted to run and gun, simple weapon choices and keeping my group together at all times. I expected to eventually be outsmarted or something, but it never happened. If I can just muscle my way through this game, what's the point?\n\n- Crew deaths. you only get 5 crew members in this game. If one dies, you can clone him again for a cost of credits and also a significant hit to his or her stats. It was a terrifying revalation, and I was incredibly worried that deaths late in the game would cost me a victory, but I beat the game shortly after my very first death. This factor would be a lot more terrifying if I actually had to worry about long-term effects of making a mistake and losing a crew member.\n\n- Storyline. Once again, this is probably one of the best elements of the game. Everything they do is kind of perfectly built around the ability to set the mood for this story, but just as I was getting curious about where the plot would go, it ended. "Congrats, you found all the things. Have a gold star." What? There was no closer to this storyline, just me making money, spending that money on better gear, and going on a harder mission thereafter for more money (rinse and repeat.)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll in all, great potential, but a let down in the end. This could've gone so much further and been so much greater. 6.5/10 is my rating, but up until the "Campaign complete" screen it was going on a solid 9/10.\n\nHopefully in the future Screwfly can add a little more meat to the game before sending it out.\n\nFinally, I don't regret paying $8 for this, but if they had filled in the holes, this game could be worth at least $30 in my book. It reminds me of great old strategy games like fallout and dungeon keeper with the creepy setting and unforgiving cost of messing up.","December 9, 2014","true","3.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You'll learn to fear the smallest things, whispers, sensor pings and, god forbid it ever happen, doors sliding open.\n\nDeadnaut's gameplay is simple but perfectly suited to the game itself. I find myself panicing and ordering the wrong soldiers around, in no small part to do with the intetionally low tech interface, in moments of crisis. Stack this up with soldiers getting pulled away by their attackers, breaking under stress or simply ignoring your orders and you've got equal amounts of terror and stress.\n\nDeadnaut is worth every penny.","March 13, 2015","true","7.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Just watch out for those damned sentries... like seriously, scan EVERY ROOM before you enter.\n\n--It should be noted that on release there wasn't much of an in-game tutorial, but they have since updated it so it has an option to view the player manual(the manual was available on launch) at least once on start-up. The manual is very helpful as it goes through some of the more detailed part of the game, as well as breaking down some of the mechanics if you are in to that.\n\nIf you want to try this game, but are for some reason not interested enough to invest the $10, there is a demo that can be found on the website for the game-deadnaut.com. However, the gameplay will be much more challenging than that of the base game, because of a reduced squad size.\n\nPros-\n\n-Very unique UI and aproach to an RTS styled game\n-Incredibly atmospheric and immersive, in a minimalist style that really drove the point home.\n-Just the right balance of difficulty, while very difficult to learn, once you get in the groove of things you will have more success, but not too much.\n-Reasonable length, each campaign is only four missions, which, while leaving you wanting more, makes restarting much less of a loss as far as real time goes, but still grievous enough to make you regret each mistake.\n\nCons-\n\n-The tutorial really leaves a lot to be learned, which some will enjoy, but will deter some players. There is a manual on the game's home page that goes much more in-depth about the mechanics, but it is not mentioned in-game.\n-It feels very brief the first time you finish. I did not know that the campaign was only 4 missions long, and upon completion I immediately had the pang of sorrow I feel each time I complete and FTL run-"But I only just started playing!".\n-Some of the more mundane parts of exploration do get a bit routine after a few runs, primarily investigating corpses and the like, but they are still worth it to gather knowledge.\n\nThe goal in this game is simple, you have four missions to complete, each one introducing a new procedurally generated enemy type somehow related to the theme of that mission. After the first three missions you can us the knowledge (the game's currency obtained through exploration and investigation) you gained to purchase schematics from Earth. To my knowledge these are randomly chosen, but not procedurally generated.\n\nThe first thing you need to learn about this game is its UI, it presents itself as if you really were giving orders to a crew exploring a derelict ship. For starters, all you ever see of your squad is a profile picture (you can import one yourself if you like), and an icon on the main viewer. You start out with limited equipment and no knowledge of any of your enemies, as you fight and study your foes, you learn more about them... in what way they sense your crew, how they damage them, and how they defend themselves will all be learned, in time.\n\nThe only downside I see to this game is that it is only in four mission bursts, and yet at the same time it makes it more bearable. I say this because, as a game in which every decision can take an excellent run to disaster, I worry that if the campaigns ran for too long, each mistake would only become more and more infuriating, and then the game just stops being as fun, but I do feel that the campaign is a touch too short. Perhaps an option to adjust the length of the campaign, with an adjustment to progression for longer campaigns.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this as it is a great game at an incredible price. It offers a very unique outlook on the RTS genre that I would love to see occur more often. I would love to see a bit more built on this game from the devs, a handful of new game modes.\n\nThere is much more I would like to say about this game, but I will leave it to you to discover in an attempt a brevity.","December 11, 2014","true","15.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The interface takes getting used to but I wouldn't change it at this point. You turn dials to boost power, you press buttons that click and you have to look away from the action to access information. It adds a touch of realism and a low-tech science fiction vibe like the first Alien movie.\n\nI am usually terrible at real time games but Deadnaut is fairly generous. The squad will shoot at anything hostile and if guns won't kill something then well, nothing you can order them to do is going to help much. I die a lot in this game but it is because of poor planning and not my crappy reflexes.\n\nBe sure to visit the manual web page and even then, I reccomend starting with a squad of five fighters. Get the hang of the controls, get squashed and then slowly add the other classes. There is no tutorial and it throws you into the deep end but after two hours I felt confident with all the options present.\n","January 2, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game i feel hits its marks faily well when it comes to atmosphere and the "lore" You command a team of "Deadnauts" who's task it is to investigate derelict vessels and then recover the ships log to determine how they ended up abandoned and unresponsive, you do this from your ship which has three screens that you can switch between as if you were acctually sitting infront of them. Now i dont know if you have seen many sci fi horror scenes but this game plays out like the most cliche one i have ever seen...but this is a VEEEEERRRY good thing. The graphics are primarily icons on a screen in a semi 3d space that you make these icons navigate through and deal with obstacles and...what remains of the crew. This backed up with the text communications of your team and you have some very evil imagery. For example on one mission my team entered a room where two of my deadnauts got jumped by aliens and dragged into the corridor leaving my last member fighting off two larger aliens by himself, they were then killed and the screen died with the message "signal lost". that was one of the most horrifying experiences i have had in a game and i enjoyed every minute of it.\n\n","January 5, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stvier/recommended/337040/","stvier","StVier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stvier/","279 products in account","*I have been playing this outside of Steam and thus Steam tracking of the time spent is not accurate.\n\n(Game version: v1.2.3)\nIn a nutshell:\n\nImagine you are the leader of a group of derelict ships scavengers sitting in your command capsule somewhere, and the latest in scanning technology only allows you to see the internal structure of the ship and detect any life forms as blips on the screen. Other than their natural response to shoot at any hostiles they encounter, provided they can detect said hostiles, your crew depends on your radio-transmitted orders to navigate them through the interior of these long-dead ships. You might not be able to see what your crew sees, but you will definitely be able to hear ghost echoes and phantom screams through the radio transmitter.\n\nDeadnaut is a real-time, squad-based tactical (and almost simulation) game which should be played in the dark so as to immerse in, and appreciate the ambience presented by the game setting. Random generation and various dynamic factors  provides replayability, but a relatively short campaign only gives a sense of accomplishment upon completion but would not quite give you the euphoric fist-into-the-air kind of feeling.\n\nGameplay:\n\nA campaign consists of only 4 missions, and each mission might take between 20 minutes to 30 mins to complete depending on how thorough you want to explore the ships. However, players are likely to spend more time on planning and suiting up for the missions. Primary interaction are the usual right-click to move, left-click to interact with doors and computers, and middle-mouse (or Ctrl-left click) to activate personal item like sensors, and to project shields. A large portion of the game is randomly generated, from different hostiles with strengths and weaknesses, to the blueprints of equipment you might come across. If you prefer so, you can start playing with a randomly generated crew of 5, each with their own character traits and flaws, which might or might not sit well with the rest of the team. The class of a character is largely dependent on the equipment, and although character traits predispose them to a certain role, flaws might raise conflict against that very same role (e.g. a combat-centric grunt that does not like combat nor be around dead bodies). Alternatively you can customize your own crew, so as to improve your odds very slightly. Investigating the dead bodies scattered around the ship yields ‘knowledge’ about what had befallen upon the ship’s crew, and ‘knowledge’ acts as a form of currency to acquire new weapons and equipments. The dynamics of all these random factors provides an open field that tests players on their ability to make do with what’s available and adapt the appropriate tactics.\n\nAesthetics:\n\nThe somber color scheme is only fitting for a game of such tense nature but for a game with minimal graphical stimulus, the audio warrants special mention as being very much up to the task of putting you on edge of your chair. Crank up the audio and the random shrieks during radio-silence of space will sends goose bumps up crawling on your skin. The UI is reminiscent of a submarine (or in this case subspace) command chair and is very much simulator-like, with many buttons to click on, switches to flip and several monitors to look at, including heart rate and brain wave monitors of individual squad members. All these features add to the immersion factor by providing background and flavor reading material.\n\nFinal word:\n\nDeadnaut is a very interesting game with a slightly niche market, likely appealing to those who values immersion over graphics. That said, the game contain the essences of game longevity; dynamic randomness and replay value. The short campaign encourages strategic planning with available resources, but does leave one with a desire for more missions. On the other hand, having a long campaign runs into eventual content exhaustion whereby players will have everything available towards the end, and thus causing players to gradually lose interest and shelving the game until their next craving for a game with similar nature. It’s almost like a choice to have your favorite food as a snack everyday versus stuffing yourself to your heart’s content.\n","January 8, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I gave it a go, but in the end I achived nothing.\n\nI had 2 or 3 missions my team didn't even get passed the first room!\n\nThe first thing I noticed is my team always hated each other, which gives you big penalties. I even tried taking perks so that my guys makes friends easy. but after a few minutes and they hated each other anyway. You'd think a team of professional could put aside their dislikes to survive, but I guess your team is just a group of yahoos with no sense of survival. Because the penalties are heavy.\n\nI played arounf 2 dozen missions and failed horribly each and every sigle one of them. Maybe it's just me who sucks at this game and don't understand the basic of it. But no matter what I tried, I only achieved total and utter defeat. Even with a full team of combat oriented crew I had trouble engaging even a single alien (some of them are easy to engage, but I encountered them sparsely). You need to gather a lot of intel before you start to get a faint idea of how to engage the enemy. By then most of the time most of your team is already dead or dying. Even when it says you can simply engage them your team does poorly, most of the time. One of the rare times I got lucky enough to get aliens life forms my team could actually manage, the room with the log, I needed to retried, was protected with a turret. Which your team has NO WAY to defeat (afaik), unless you hack it (but even that is temporary). But guess what, my only teamate that could hack it managed to die, before I spotted it, so ♥♥♥♥ me. This was the only game I even came close to comple the first mission.\n\nAfter half a dozen failed attempts, I realised I really needed more info about the game so I read the game manual. That didn't help one bit. For example, I read about scanning rooms. So I got a guy with high detecting skill and equiped him with a scanner. But for the life of me, I could not figure out how to scan a room. So it was useless.\n\nWhich bring me to another frustrating part of the game... the hacking. Your hacker(s) can only hack what your team visually had contact with. That makes no sense to me. So if there's a turret to hack you need see it and yes the person who's going to need to spot it will more than likely get shot at by it and very likely will die from the encounter (but not always). the one time I managed to hack a turret without anyone dying in the process. I left my hacker on the console in case the nasty thing that reset the ship parameters passed by (because there was no firewall I could set up to avoid that) so the rest of my team could get back.... but my hacker got ambushed by 5 aliens (you know that ones that my whole team have a hard time to handle a single one). So my hacker died horribly and as I predicted it, the turret got reset and the rest of my team was stuck in a room. So much fun!\n\nAn other annoying thing is your team is set randomly, and you can't move you guys around. So you can't organize them. For example, you can get your combat crew on the top of the list and your hacker or whatnot arranged a certain way. Since you die all the time you always need to figure out who what and where all the time and it gets annoying. Just that would've made that game super frustrating to simply annoying to me. Also, you need to take the time to equipe them every single time, you can't give them a default equipment build.\n\nAll that being said, if you somehow like frustration, swearing and the like... this is the game for you. Otherwise stay away from it.\n\nI still thing the game has potential and is an intresting concept, but I did not enjoy playing it.\n\n","November 1, 2015","false","3.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","2"

I might as well explain why I recommend this game.\n\nFirst up is the premise of the game. You play as the commander of a team of Deadnauts who's job is to explore stange and alien ships in varying degrees of decay/destruction, your team are "deadnauts" because they aren't expected to survive. The game is set during a time in which knowledge has become the standard monies of the day and so that is why your errant band of suicidal explorers are doing this . . . for the knowledge . . . which is money . . . anyway, over the course of the game you will seek out new life, and destroy it cause it's trying to eat you, and dead civilisations or at least the friendly aliens are dead . . . cause all the hostile ones are trying to kill you.\n\nNext up we gots us some gameplay. Well the game plays very much like you are sitting at a console and are keeping tabs on your guys through use of the ship's scanners and com systems . . . actually i think that is exactly what you are doing. At times this can be an issue when you lose connection to one or more of your crew members while at other times you may even see something your guys don't and so you can have them investigate. In terms of combat, you will undoutably encounter lots of this as many of the derelict ships are derelict for a good reason and that good reason is hungry after a few thousand years of having already eaten everyone onboard. There are also automated systems like the ever unhelpful 'watcher' and the delightfully ill-placed sentinals . . . I hate sentinals with a passion and every time i encounter one it wipes out my entire team in a matter of seconds because they are always in killzones so i waltz into a room and three people are dead before I even know what killed them.\nCustomization is a thing in the fact that you can create custom team members, even import custom faces for them if you so chose but there are a couple ones there already and you can just stick to random team members for extra challenge but I like the story you can create with a custom crew. Crew members will also react to each other's flaws and traits through dialouge which is the only way you will know if that flaw is currently active because someone will mention it. Team mates will also banter a little, especially after they just saved the life of a team mate ("I better be getting a christmas card for this . . . ") and this makes things all the more interesting.\n\noverall I think this game is actually pretty good but I think the small size of it is a little bit of a flaw because it's campaign will only go for about 4 missions can theoretically only lasts an hour at most but fortunately there is permadeath to up the hours it takes you to win. In my own personal opinion, I am waiting for the "real deal" with this being an experiment and the sequal being a much larger game with far more content and story but even if that isn't the case, this game is more than deserving of it's price tag and has enough content to make the hundreds of replays you will do worth it.\n\nFinal score is 8/10 and an expectation that more will appear eventually","April 2, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I was unable to access any of the custom face pics that are available to auto generated crew, so I quit out of the game and downloaded pics of Jagged Alliance mercs from google. I put all the effort into creating a crew, but they quickly died in the first mission because I didn't have enough mercs good at combat.\n\nSecond attempt at playing, I allow the game to generate the crew for me. There wasn't a single merc generated for me that was good at hacking, so I ignored that aspect of the game altogether. The mercs kept ♥♥♥♥♥ing about each other with repetitive dialogue, and that seemed to affect their stats. However, I quickly realised that the best way to beat this game was to ignore the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and just keep the mercs bunched together, as ultimately it came down to superior firepower being enough to get through the whole FOUR levels of the game! The whole "watcher" interference mechanic was an interesting aspect of the game, but all it did was occasionally distort the screen or leave me unable to issue orders for a few seconds. As I ignored hacking there was no way I could defend against the watchers, but this made no difference to me getting through the game easily.\n\nSome people have compared this game to Jagged Alliance; the reality is this game doesn't come close. There are only four levels, the merc dialogue is repetitive and boring, and the mercs really don't have any personality. All of the ship's crew logs are randomly generated, and ultimately this game has no story to uncover, just get through the four levels until you reach the game over screen. In my second attempt of the game not a single merc was killed, it was simply a case of methodically clearing all four ships of the bad guys by keeping my group together, Not fun at all.","December 19, 2014","false","3.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

But to be honest if you buy Deadnaut out of appreciation of ZD, it's very likely you will find this game kind of disappointing.\n\nThe biggest difference between a real time RPG and a turn-based one is the involvement of reflex and speed. Although Deadnaut doesn't lay much stress on them, this still makes Deadnaut more like a Point&Click game instead of an intriguing board game, which unavoidably weaken the depth of strategy and jeopardize the easiness of scheming. However I'm not against real-time RPG; Deadnaut just did it the wrong way. Squad die out almost instantly in most encounters if outpowered, but the lack of pause feature leaves player little time to arrange plan and issue orders, not to mention carefully analyzing battlefield and monitoring team conditions, especially when your squad members are seperated in different rooms. The simplification in interaction doesn't help either: you just click every clickable button to hack, investigate and unlock and then move to the next room, which makes up the majority of exploration and is in no way fun at all.\n\nIn the end, it is still a strategy game, not a squad tactic FPS. Once again Screwfly shows how to implement a great idea poorly and ultimately deliver a decent but boring roguelike game just like their no longer supported Zafehouse Diaries.","April 6, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

However, game stops being fun long before it's figured out.\n\nMost modern Roguelikes have permanent unlocks to keep players going through failures. Lost a match? No problem, at least your guys now have +5hp and you unlocked a new class. Nothing like that here. You get a 4 mission campaign, and the unlocks are only for that. Win or (far more likely) lose, your next game starts you with nothing.\n\nAt it's core this is a preparation game, you get a very limited write-up of what your crew will be up against and you equip accordingly. In theory. there isn't any equipment to customize during the first mission, and you'll be playing that first mission alot. No guarantees you'll be playing long enough to actually make the decision of whether the pistol or the fireaxe is a better equip.\n\nExploration isn't really rewarding either. Start your game with one hacker and 3 general purpose combat guys. Send 3 guys to sweep a room. One dies to an enemy. One hacker and two combat guys. Send two guys to sweep another room, only to have one guy die instantly to something you can't see. Check a different room and find a hacking console. Find out from console that second guy died from a turret. Hack turret. Send final combat guy into turret room to scavenge. Have turret turn back on because you forgot to keep tabs on the hacking mini-game and lose third combat guy. Hacker gets torm up in the next encounter.
