You only have a small play zone to maneuver, with enemies coming in from the sides & top of your screen making for some intense close combat game play. The responsivness of your ship with the mouse is great giving you minute control over your position & graphically the enemies & weapons fire is easy to distinguish even when there is a lot going on, on-screen.\n\nEach song completed will grant you a random weapons upgrade drop, with a chance of a rare drop. These can be purchased (& upgraded) to increase your firepower of the four weapons slots on your ship & you can even change the angle of fire for each slot to customise your layout further which is cool. This is needed as you progress up the difficulty levels & to kill the random bosses needed to complete the story mode. Scoring is combo based, so the more you can kill in sequence (with less enemies escaping), will grant higher scores but stay nimble as each death will cost you a score penalty. Each kill also drops a bonus '♫' to pickup, granting health, power-ups & score increases so you need to be quick & get them all before they disappear for the best scores.\n\nI found all but the top two difficulty levels relatively easy; each difficulty level unlocks after killing three bosses. This can take some time making the start of the game feel rather dull to grind out the first few bosses, but if you stick with it, it becomes far more enjoyable later. For me, I just got a little tipsy off a few ciders, cranked up the volume & enjoyed some of my favorite tracks which certainly helped make the initial grind pass by much quicker :p .\n\nAlthough your music generates the enemies, you don't really get a sense of any pattern to the beat which would have been nice. For example, sometimes it goes into 'hardcore mode' in parts of songs you wouldn't expect & this seems to increase in frequency the higher the difficulty you go. It's not a big issue though, as you do get the feeling of randomness in the waves so each run feels different.\n\nRegardless of the few shortcomings, if you love your music & your shoot 'em ups it is very easy to waste away a few hours in ♪ Symphony ♪ liberating your music!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","June 7, 2014","true","9.6"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","0"

This addictive and engaging casual shooter uses your music to configure the levels which you play. The game on itself is not very long... the story mode, at least, but as long as you want to just shoot something without complications and good challenge (do not forget the point of having your music integrated in the game), this little jewel will make wonders, so the real life of symphony is as long as big is your music library.\n\nThe mechanical is quite simple. You choose one song, and then, depending of its characteristics it throws to you to beat (and to strike you down mercilessly) one thing or other, and while you shoot and dodge cool lights you must collect inspiration points which raise your marker and at the same time repair your.... spaceship ?\n\nI bought it just for experimenting and i'm far beyond than pleased with it.","December 8, 2013","true","36.5"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

Gameplay is simply not good. Everything is pretty much the same colour and the screen can get very full. Audiosurf's stark contrasts made for gorgeous visuals. This is just a chaotic mess.\n\nYou can unlock and equip a variety of weapons but little information is given about them and the strategy seems to be mostly just holding down the mouse button and moving around.\n\nThere doesn't feel like a lot of gameplay difference in the songs. It seems to go from low intensity to high intensity and back with nothing in between, and often not in places you'd expect.\n\nThe interface is quite clunky, and so badly designed that in some places text actually overlaps. How that is still happening after multiple patches is beyond me, but it certainly doesn't leave a good impression.\n\nIt's not outright awful, and there's some nice ideas in there, but it just hasn't come together.","June 15, 2014","false","3.9"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

The visuals are frequently a confusing mess thanks to lack of contrast and effects overkill, and the deaths this causes are typically more of a frustration than actual punishment.  The play area is regularly overcrowded, with your ship being relatively huge, your hit box fairly large, and the consequences for mistakes being inconsistent (and typically leaving you wishing you'd just died instead with how crippled your weapons can become).\n\nI went in really wanting to enjoy the experience, but in the end I can't recommend this to anybody, especially on the same platform that brings so many people Audiosurf and Beat Hazard, either of which will give you a superior experience at a similar price.","November 27, 2013","false","6.6"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","35","47","0","3"

To those not yet familiarized with this style, it consists of procedurally generated levels, and this procedure utilizes songs chosen by the user to create the levels. If you use the same song, it will always create the same level (if the difficulty chosen is the same, obviously).\n\nThe game is superb. The graphics and level of content in this game will keep you busy for a LOT of time. There is a lot to unlock and do in this game: you beat songs to get items, then you need to collect Kudos and Inspiration to unlock and upgrade these items. There are a lot of unlockables in this game and each song will unlock something;\n\nAn extremely enjoyable gameplay that is relaxing at earlier difficulties, but also can be very challenging at the hardest ones. The leaderboard system is awesome, it takes into consideration every aspect of your performance, including your ship power (the higher the power the less points you get). You can (and should) make ship builds in this game using the weapons and upgrades for optimal performance when beating songs.\n\nControls are straight-forward, you can even put auto-fire on separate weapons in your ship meaning it will fire without the need to press the left mouse button.\n\nThere is a bug which causes the game to crash when analyzing any MP3 songs, I have never seen anyone else with this issue though. All other music file extensions run just fine.\n\nLast but not least, another cool aspect of the game: To unlock difficulties you need to beat "demons" which randomly invade your songs. Those are pretty cool to fight (and challenging, too).\n\nRecommended!\n\n\nMy scores:\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nControls: 10/10\nContent: 10/10\nStory: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\nBugs: -1\n\nOverall: 47/50","January 7, 2014","true","11.2"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

The game's framing device involves an interdimensional demon that consumes music, but this is really just an excuse for me to blow up little Vertex graphics space ships while I listen to Iron Maiden (Not that anyone should need an excuse for that kind of activity).\nAt its heart, Symphony is basically a bullet-hell shooter. The ship is customizable, with four spaces for weapons and numerous different firing patterns to unlock and upgrade to even the playing field. Each song is deconstructed by the game and translated into patterns of enemies and intensity levels based on the changes in tempo and harmony.\nUnfortunately, a number of flaws continually gnaw at me while I play; firstly, several of the enemies can absorb an absolutely obnoxious amount of damage before breaking, meaning that the game's feature to aim weapons in different directions is largely an exercise in frustration. On just medium difficulty, even the fast-moving triangle shaped foes are hard to take down without several direct hits from high-powered weapons. Assuming you do manage to break several foes in a row, enemies swarm the screen in rhythmic patterns, each one in a wave flying in the same path. This means that picking up dropped notes for score means you have to fly into the next enemy in the wave, as it'll take the same path as the one you just shot down. Meanwhile, enemies entering the screen will fire projectiles that can be very hard to distinguish from the pulsing colors of the background.\nThe game allows players to acquire copies of weapons they like and upgrade them for higher power, but then punishes the player for upgrading by penalizing your score while using stronger weapons. Higher difficulty levels allow for stronger weapons and a better score bonus, but the scaling is slanted sharply, with enemies gaining far more strength than the player.\nI'm still issuing a reccomendation, because Symphony still has a lot going for it in the creative department, but there some definite shortcomings that prospective players should be aware of.","August 2, 2015","true","2.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","2"

Honestly, every level feels the same. I can play some insane Techno and it's pretty lame most of the way through. I play something soothing and it's the same deal. This game is overrated in my opinion.\n\nThe vertical scrolling is a let down because your ship will move as fast as your mouse does, you level up and expand your ship, which is a big let down because it's basically just a game to grind with no skill involved, and there are little to no enemies that make the gameplay unique on any situation unless you're fighting a boss!\n\nThis game is not impressive.","April 3, 2015","false","1.1"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","30","47","0","1"

Here's the thing. Some time after installing this game, I noticed that someone had installed a user named "Matt" on my system. I couldn't see this from my own computer, but from another computer on my LAN it was all too apparent. Google ultimately led me to a Steam thread regarding this game identifying the issue in January, 2013. I discovered the hidden user over my Lan in December, 2013. In at least one entire year's time, it had not been fixed and no attempt had been made to inform customers before, during, or after purchase. Since the dev had not been forthcoming with a fix, an explanation, and an apology right there on the store page or the forums over the course of an entire year, I can only presume a. the dev does not really care about his customers or his image, b. the dev has done it intentionally for some unexplained reason, or c. both. In any event, I uninstalled it from my computer and advise you to skip it.\n\nCorrection: The dev finally did post an explanation and an apology in the forums after my complaint in December, but I have to say I agree with user Bloodshed regarding the impact of the dev's error in judgment. I enjoyed playing the game, but I'm still bothered by the way that players have been impacted, and as Bloodshed states (http://steamcommunity.com/app/207750/discussions/0/630799905146964256/) I can imagine a good number of people may never discover the cause of the problem or may have spent money trying to get it resolved. Hopefully, none of those people were taken in by the increasingly popular tech scams out there.\n\nSo there you have it--fun game, but a grievous error in judgment. I will never reinstall this game on my system. Whether you trust the dev or not is entirely up to you. I appreciate the effort that the dev is making, but I'm not sure I enjoyed the game enough to risk restoring trust. How would you feel if you were having family computer time and someone asked you who this Matt was that is on the home network? If the original message(s) regarding this issue hadn't been posted on the Steam forums by other customers and if I hadn't been lucky enough to discover it, I might never have resolved this issue. I can see the potential of this creating a very frustrating experience for average casual gamers.","March 14, 2014","false","13.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","4"

You get infinite lives, anyway!  Plus, it's not like it matters half the time, anyway, because your shots can be upgraded to so overpowered that you kill everything before you even realize it's there, and firing in all directions. It's such that "play" largely involves just collecting powerups with proper timing to keep a chain alive.\n\nSince score is the only thing that determines how well you did, (you can "beat" a song by simply walking away from the keyboard for the full length of the song, no participation required,) then collecting note powerups at the precise timing to keep a chain alive is literally the only thing (besides purposefully underpowering your ship to up a challenge modifier) that exists as a means of judging skill.\n\nI would only recommend it to people who really love their music library, and just want even more excuse to listen to it.","November 1, 2014","false","10.8"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","18","29","2","1"

I really really do.  But I just cannot do it.\n\nStarting with the good things:\n- The game does a very good job creating levels based on the music.  I feel like it's really responding to the beats, tempo changes, and dynamics of a particular song.  It feels like each level was tailored to that song.\n- At lower levels, it's a very good pseudo-bullet-hell game and more enjoyable because it has your own music.\n- The weapon customization and points scaling to the power of your ship gives plenty of challenge and allows for different play styles.\n\nNow the bad things that make me ultimately not want to recommend this game all revolve around its status as a pseudo-bullet-hell game, mostly at the higher difficulties.  Bullet-hell games are supposed to be hard--even infuriating--but they are also fair.  This one is not.  Allow me to explain:\n- Your ship's hitbox is NOT equal to its visual size.  Time and time again I was taking damage from enemies that did not physically touch my ship, but hit an outer corner of the (I assume) rectangle that makes up your hitbox.  When there are 20+ enemies to dodge, it becomes really problematic knowing you have to clear out more space than your ship is big.\n- There seems to be no consistency for damage.  Sometimes I can sandbag 4+ collisions and survive, other times it's a one-hit-KO.  Or I can take 2-3 bullets and survive, other times I'm outright dead.  I tried to pay attention to the enemies that damage me, to see if it was different enemy classes, but as far as I can tell, it's not.  It seems honestlly to be a total crapshoot if a hit will kill or not.\n- The weapons, while varied, lack power on the higher levels.  You basically have to use the "furia" weapons (roughly a 5% drop rate per song) in order to stand a chance on the highest level.  Often I was finding that I literally could not destroy a wave of enemies before they got to the bottom of the screen (and this is without contending with the other 20+ enemies on screen at the time).  You basically have to grind until you get the rare-and-slightly-more-powerful weapons for the hard difficulty to be doable (at least as far as completion is concerned, maybe not survival).\n- Lots of enemies spawn behind you, which is fine as some weapons shoot backwards.  But for some reason, while you can rotate your weapons, you cannot flip them to shoot backwards, so your ship is just naturally weaker firing behind it than in front of it.  This becomes a problem when 1/3 of the enemies spawn at the bottom of the screen (especially the larger ones, which brings me back to the hitbox issue) and your strongest weapons literally cannot hit them.\n\nSo to summarize, I want to like this game, but I do not.  If you're not so obsessed with the shooter aspect, you'll probably love it, and I get that.  But I just cannot recommend it on these grounds.","April 18, 2014","false","6.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Symphony isn't really a music game for the most part. It's more of a mediocre shmup you can play with your music serving as the background noise, with the action on screen's intensity matching that of the music's volume.\n\nFrom the get-go, the game is a terribly frustrating affair. The interface for importing and selection of songs is a mess that requires far too much to get working and not even close to enough sorting options. The game's a frustrating affair before you're even playing it.\n\nOnce you've finally wrangled your music collection together and selected a song, Symphony is a fairly simple top-down shmup seemingly created with the "How To Not Make A Good Shmup" handbook close at hand. The playfield is constantly littered with enemies with very little room to move, and your player ship is entirely too big to work for the fast-paced action this game is trying to provide. The game's visuals are also often a huge problem, offering little to no contrast between the color of playfield (based on the music's intensity) enemy units, and ESPECIALLY enemy bullets. It becomes a chaotic mess that's impossible to discern and frustrating to try and stick with.\n\nSkip it and stick to AudioSurf, where more than the intensity of the music you're listening to matters and it's much easier to not only see what you're doing, but actually be played as well.","May 30, 2014","false","1.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuxtonFael/recommended/207750/","HuxtonFael","Haxton Fale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuxtonFael/","225 products in account","Symphony is a terribly mediocre game.\nSong picker is clearly not the best thing ever, caching your entire library instead of letting you browse through folders, and supporting only filtering by artist or album. The interface is also full of bugs, with Kudos or Inspiration meters either floating off the screen or overlapping with text. And then there are also hover detection issues, with some items not being completely selectable unless you find that specific area where clicking works.\nIn terms of gameplay itself, the game encourages you to move on to the next difficulty level as soon as you unlock it, giving you just enough kudos to upgrade - and then becomes frustratingly hard, with chaotic and overcrowded game area with no place for you to survive, not to mention hitting anything before dying. Not that you would know what killed you - with the default graphic settings, your bullets' and the enemies' bloom mix together creating a lighty mash where nothing is discernible, including bullets headed your way. There's no guide to the enemies eitheryou have to observe them in this weird mix and try to see what they are doing and guess what to do in return before you die. And then there are bosses, which increase the frustration even further, because 1) you can't choose when or where to fight them, so an appearance of one can simply ruin your chance of a decent scire and 2) they are a bit like tougher versions of some of the enemies you see, but much more deadly and much harder to kill, designed to minimize your breathing space as much as possible. That's not nice.\nSymphony seems like a music game, while it's simply a music-based shmup, with no rhytm in the gameplay to speak of (the tempo of the game has very little relation to the actual tempo of the music). Heck, even the starting settings favour SFX over music.\nThe game would be very nice to play every now and then if it didn't force you to progress by making the boss fights unavoidable (the boss is in this song you like to play? Tough luck, you have to either fight him or not play the song at all). It could also be a better music game or a better shooter, instead of trying to be both at the same time, with something more added on, and failing at it.","November 30, 2013","false","5.7"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","32","57","0","3"

Luckily you can repair it via collecting "Music Notes" (dropped points) from enemies one has shot to death after your ship lost part of itself (took damage).\n\nNotice, any audio over 1:30 minutes will do, so for you oddballs out there who feel like playing to audiobooks or whatever else you come up with, have fun.\n\n\n\nIn Depth:\n\nWarning... there are probably spoilers (if you think there can be spoilers for a shoot 'em up that is not a bullet-hell)... they are more of descriptions of how the game works... which is why I think it is good...\n\nAny audio over a minute thirty long can be used to play the game.\n\nOne have 4 guns that are individually rotatable, all of which they can individually be bound to left click to fire, right click to fire, or always (infinite) fire... the game can be really easy on the fingers due to the infinite fire mode.\n\nOne can move ones' ship around the screen with your mouse much like you would a cursor.\n\nEach of those 4 guns and the parts of ones' ship they mount to can be destroyed, as well as the entire ship itself if the center of it gets hit. The ship comes with 4 stock guns. All weapons can be upgraded to level 5 (the higher the level the deadlier of course) based off of points/point goals on songs that you finish playing through.\n\nOnes' ship usually loses parts/gets destroyed when you crash into enemies or on the occasions' they shoot you (or you get to close to certain units and they blow up).  Luckily you can repair it via collecting "Music Notes" (dropped points) from enemies one has shot to death after your ship lost part of itself (took damage).\n\nWhen one dies one respawns seconds later (may feel like forever if your invested in the level) and as one defeat bosses that randomly get attributed to songs one plays. Each boss unlocks part of a sheet of the Symphony of Souls. Each page represents a higher difficulty level to unlock... so yes... one starts off weak, but sit back and enjoy the audio whilst it is easy if you are a Hardcore player, otherwise keep it easy or do as you wish.\n\nThe game comes with pre-stocked music from a handful of genres... but I shall not review it, for everyone has their preferences and it is limited compared the amount of music one loves that one will probably add to it to play.\n\n\n\nThe long opinion filled babble-esque review follows that might have as many "spoilers," if not more, as above:\n\nYou may actually listen to rather than just hear your songs for once since your focusing on playing your song rather than having audio in the background as you focus on something else.\n\nPlaying a game whilst having an excuse to listen to your (favorite) music without having to listen to the games audio... always grand... but there is nothing like playing a shooter that integrates and interacts with your music/audio files that are a minute in a half or longer. The proof the game interacts is the pace of the enemies, color of the background, and the subwoofer weapon...\n\nThis game is unique in that it has 4 weapon slots and one can customize which way the weapons face on the ship, the ships weapons (and ship itself) can be destroyed... but as long as the ship remains intact, one can collect music (drops) from deceased enemies to repair ones' ship. One can also configure any of the weapons to independently of one another fire with the left/right mouse buttons and infintie fire (2 guns on left click, the 3rd on infinite fire, the 4th on right click, sure, all on any of them, all the power to you,  etc.)\n\nOne can upgrade weapons, but if one is not very good at the game, one simply has to play more songs on the lower difficulty levels to get the points required to upgrade weapons. 2 point systems, one is based off the score you received upon finishing a level, and the other is based off reaching set scores for that difficulty for that song... both of which are required to upgrade weapons... the former of the two is only required to unlock weapons... and there is only 1 weapon unlock per song.\n\nEvery song is processed by the game the first time you play the song, in order to generate that level (difficulty is irrelevant). The processing process also decides if a boss will be attributed to that song (thus there will never be a boss on a level you have not played). There is a timer to defeat the boss, if one fails to defeat the boss may move to a different difficulty level in the same song, but will still be attributed to that song.\n\nOne unlocks (parts of) sheet music... the Symphony of Souls... as one does so one unlocks higher difficulties. The bosses get progressively harder to defeat. When one defeats a boss that song is freed (no fighting a boss on that song again).\n\nIs that enough babbling? Now go play the game to Portal's "Still Alive" song(s)... they are free after all... Steam Music... and yes there is a way to download them without having the game installed... it is just a pain for it requires console commands... you might catch that the game is out of Beta on time...

In my book, "an innovation fart" is a failed attempt to take something good and try to change it into something supposedly better, by adding a gimmick or another sort of surprise to the mix. Except on this case, I actually like it! I won't presume to understand throughly the connection between the shooter-gameplay and the music, but it works.\nThe gamplay itself is pretty simple ("Space Invaders" style shooting), yet the intensity of the ingame-action is directly linked to the intensity of the music. The ranking system and the achievements are obviously about music as well. Since you have the game use your own music library, you're going to enjoy the soundtrack too. :P\nFor the bottom line, I say - this is a very cool, spicy and refreshing "Space Invaders" style shooter. If you like that idea, get this game, it's definitely worth it!","September 8, 2013","true","9.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I got this version as part of a bundle sale. Anyways, on to the review.\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I was fascinated by the idea of a musical shooter game because I loved playing Galaga as a kid and I love music games, including AudioSurf, Stepmania, and more recently, Sequence. So I bought this as part of a sale and needless to say, after an hour of playing the game, I was hooked... and then I lost interest. Just read the pros/cons.\n\n+++Pros+++\n+ Great idea for a music game, but there's a catch.\n+ Great visuals, definitely sets the "music" tone.\n+ Neat weapon customization, but, like the first pro, there's a catch.\n\n---Cons---\n- Occasional textual glitches.\n- The weapon customization comes off to be quite dull & limited when you realize how many unlockable weapons there are (I found like eight plus a stronger version of them) and only one unlockable power-up pickup.\n- Towards the end of the game, the difficulty becomes so frustrating that most of the choices of weapons will be omitted and you'll be practically forced to use a few certain weapons, and even those aren't good enough. You'll die and lose points a lot.\n- I don't feel as if the songs I pick really have an effect on the way the game is played. Sure the higher-adrenaline songs have faster/more enemies, but I feel like the beats to the music don't really affect the gameplay. Audiosurf had pickups based off the music beats and Sequence had you hit the arrow keys to the beat of the song.\n- Lots of potential that I feel went wasted, at least for a music game.\n\nDid I like Symphony? At first I did, and even with all those cons, I feel Symphony could be a time-waster game, but it's not worth the $9. I'd buy it on sale for like $2.50. Unfortunately as the game gets on, it gets worse, and those flaws get more and more noticeable.","April 5, 2014","false","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It only displays three songs at once, which wouldn't be an issue if there was a "Select from Windows Explorer" option. Beat Hazard and Audiosurf both have this and it makes life so much easier. On top of that, the controller support in the menus is also rather poor, with the "cursor" frequently going exactly where you DON'T want it to. It honestly feels like a mobile port the UI is so awful. Beat Hazard has a mobile port and the UI for that game isn't even this bad.\n\nThere isn't even a way to search for songs I've found, so have fun scrolling down the list for eternity.\n\nPick this up ONLY if they ever fix the interface.

Even though it is still in beta development, this is an excellent game.\n\nThe gameplay is a modernization of the classic top-down shooter style games. The waves of enemies are uniquely synced to the intensity and beat of the selected audio track. Each song in your library becomes it's own objective in the Symphony of Destruction against the Music of the Universe. Each track unlocks additional weapons and items upon completion and features power-ups and bonuses for you to collect along the way. The bosses are demons that appear at intervals based on total points scored, so if you happen to be playing a song that has an intense beat, it may be more difficult to win.\n\nThere are some design features I would like to see modified in the game. First of all, for the Song Selection I would like to see more filter options. Currently there are only two filters, Album or Artist. If the ID3 tags are correctly applied to the music files, [Artist] actually refers to the song's Composer, which may make it difficult to find the song version you are looking for (i.e. Bob Dylan is the [Artist] who composed "Knocking on Heaven's Door" which was also covered by Guns and Roses, but both versions will appear under [Artist] Bob Dylan). The [Album Artist] is the performer and the predominant means by which many people associate a song (an unfortunate fact for the title track of David Bowie's "The Man Who Sold the World" album which is often mistook as a creation of, Nirvana's, Kurt Cobain). In Pop-Culture, the performer is rarely ever the composer and for some, Paul McCartney and John Lennon might not be recognised as a composing members of The Beatles. Is there a song actually written by Justin Bieber? A filter for [Genre] would also be a nice option; however, I would largely prefer a Search Field that let's me look up a particular [Title]. It takes a long time to sort through lists with the word "The" at the beginning.\n\nAlong with the filter for genre, it may be nice to have an option in the game settings to chose your perferred/favorite genre allowing the game to randomly select one of those songs during title sequences instead of the default looping track. Otherwise, there is a Preview button on the Song Selection screen that allows you to play songs while you continue to browse.\n\nI just recently noticed that the weapons lose sync after defeating a demon. I have to exit the game and come back to fix the problem. What happens is the shots I fire are spawned a good distance away from the ship and they also seem to disappear and jump about the same distace from point to point along their path. This causes an increased number of missed shots that should have been kills. I still like the game, but it's something the developers should take care of.","July 4, 2014","true","29.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, the graphics are indeed beautiful, and the game itself was worth every penny.\nHeck, I should've paid more! Symphony is a casual shooter game, a typical "bullet hell" where you play a tiny ship that has to shoot incoming enemies. However, what makes Symphony so unique and awesome is that, well, its a music game.\n\nSymphony comes with a few pre-installed songs, but you can also simply select a folder on your pc or external drive and let it load all those songs into the game, not to play in the background like most games, no the songs are the actual levels. Each song is unique, which makes the levels so unique too. You'll run into countless different types of enemy waves, and sometimes an occasional "demon" boss fight too. Completing goals by gaining an x amount of points unlocks weapons, some more rare than others. You can upgrade these weapons and apply them to your ship. Ofcourse, the game prevents you from getting too overpowered. If you 1-hit every incoming enemy and easily hit 200.000 points, that wouldn't be fun, right? So if you make your ship stronger, you'll get a fewer amount of points. So the game motivates and sometimes even forces you to take off those uber weapons and push yourself to your limits or you will never reach the next goal. The game stays challenging and I can't grow tired of it.\n\nWhat I also like about this game is that you can easily play it with a friend. Just sit next to eachother behind your desk and take turns in picking songs. Ofcourse if you poured hours in this game you might be a bit more skilled than your bud, so just select an easier difficulty for him and you'll both have the time of your life. Not only is it very fun to play but it is also very fun to watch.\nI've spent quite a while with a few friends getting all hyped up while yelling "No no no kill it! Incoming enemy! It's gonna explode! Get away from there or you'll die! 5000 points to go and 30 seconds left! Yeaaaa"  and so on. Trust me, it gets you all hyped up. Or maybe that's because I play heavy metal songs.. That might be it too.\n\nI don't think I'll ever get tired of this game. It's not a game to play hours and hours after eachother, just a few songs every now and then and it'll be just as enjoyable every time. And if I ever do get tired of it.. Well just get another album and start over again. New songs, new levels, enough said!\n\nTo end this huge post filled with enthousiasm..\nI simply love this game.","May 30, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is crack. It is evil. It is a game I cannot delete, ever. I own it on Gog and now here. Oh, and three more words: "La Villa Strangiato." I figured the game would increase and decrease in color and intensity according to which part of the song it was on...what I *didn't* expect is that it would actually dissect Lifeson's solo in the middle. When he *just* starts becoming more intense and holding those long notes, the game actually increases intensity when he applies vibrato to a single note. In other words, one note will start out mellow, turn red, and become mellow again. Absolutely incredible.\n\nBuy it.

It's certainly a better story than most games of the genre, but it's definitely nothing to write home about.\n\nSymphony turns your music library into the levels you play, by scanning the tracks and basing the level pacing and enemy layouts on the raw audio data. Louder parts in a song cause the level to turn red and speed up. Tempo changes cause the level and enemies to scroll at a faster or slower speed. Time signature affects what enemies spawn and in how many. There's a surprising amout of variety with each and every song you play, meaning that Symphony is more than just shooting things to a custom playlist.\n\nEach completed level nets you points, which allow you to purchase upgrades for your ship. Once your ship is decked out and you've put about 30 minutes in, you'll happily breeze through the levels, although the learning curve tends to rise sharply in the highest difficulties. The bosses, however, can be downright unfair, especially if you haven't chosen the right song, such as when I was confronted with a boss during a run of Blink-182's "All the Small Things" which runs a little over 2 minutes and gives you almost no time to defeat a boss. Aside from that, the bosses boast very overpowered attacks and take up a large portion of the playing field. Thankfully, however, the bosses are few and far between.\n\nSymphony could have easily been a one-trick pony: a shooter that runs on YOUR music. However, the concept is so well-executed that it rarely becomes repetitive, and the game's reliance on your music makes it hard for you to become bored. Pick this game up if you want a dymanic bullet hell shooter or just love listening to music while doing just about anything.","February 9, 2014","true","40.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You might be annoyed by the fact that harder difficulties are initially locked, but once you reach them you're in for the ride of your life. Nods in the achievements and the structure of the light story clearly show that this is a game by music lovers to music lovers.\n\nI've played with classical, electronic, and jazz and have gotten great levels out of all of them, with significant variance in the design (the key features being the speed of enemies affected by the tempo and the number of enemies by the volume).\n\nHonestly I was shocked to check the Steam usage stats and see just how few people play this game on a regular basis. I would wholeheartedly recommend it. I would alse recommend the Extra Credits youtube vid on the game-- it was what got me to buy the game in the first place!\n\nCaveats:\nIf you've already got Beat Hazard or similar, well, the gameplay is somewhat similar (action shooter to music).\n\nThe actual area your ship is in is smaller than it seems, and your hitbox is larger than it feels like it should be. The counterpoint to this is that picking up points repairs your ship, and oftentimes you won't die from one hit. Still, the ship size gets annoying, especially with higher enemy densities and higher difficulty settings.\n\nWeapon drops are seemingly by random chance, though if you have enough music this won't be a major issue until the late game, when Furia (rare) weapons become more important. Level 5 standard weapons will get you through, but it's certainly harder. In my experience this wasn't a huge issue, as Furia weapons dropped often enough, but if you're unlucky...\n\nOverall I give this game a Recommended/10.\n\n","January 15, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It might be alright when you finish the story, but it's rather annoying when you're playing a short song and a guy just pops out of nowhere and says "fite meh"\n\nBosses also get very repetitive, every sheet of music you collect brings along a new type of boss, more annoying than the last.\n\nBut this is definitely such a fun game, so buy it.\n\n","November 12, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Besides modded servers in TF2.\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun and entertaining, but the gameplay could use a load of improvements.\n\nYou can't control the ship's directional shots, you can only rotate the (for lack of a better word) 'cannons' before you start a song.\n\nThe enemies are so ♥♥♥♥ing Over-Powered, and most of the time, they come from behind you, and you can't do ♥♥♥♥, because you can't change the direction your ship's shooting towards, and when dodging enemies from above, I often go downward and ♥♥♥♥ing crash into the ♥♥♥♥ing ships that are below me that I can't ♥♥♥♥ing hit.\nThe game does have Xbox360 controller support (Thankfully!), but not full controller support -- In the menus you have to use your mouse, and even to pause the ♥♥♥♥ing game you have to let go of your controller to press the 'esc' button on your keyboard.\nIn the middle (Usually in the beginning, though) a ♥♥♥♥ing demon will interrupt your 'fun', and challenge you. It gets really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying when I just want to play a ♥♥♥♥ing song and not battle a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss. Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥? Add a ♥♥♥♥ing 'Boss Mode' to the ♥♥♥♥ing game, if you really want to show off those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses.\nIt seems as if all of the enemies have random amounts of health, because when I shoot one enemy 3 ♥♥♥♥ing times, it goes down, but another (Same kind of enemy) only takes 1 or 2 hits.\nThe game is so ♥♥♥♥ing confusing.\nYou can't purchase new weapons, you can only "Unlock" them... And most of the time, the unlocked ones are complete ♥♥♥♥.\nIt only has 'Story-Mode', and lacks a relaxation/free-play mode. (Free-play meaning no ♥♥♥♥ing story, relaxation meaning easier/no enemies and just to enjoy the view.)\nThe songs have to be, at least, 1:30 in order to "Create level."\n\nHowever, the game does look really radical... I'll give it that.\n\nBottom line: The game's only worth $4.99, if that.\n\nMaybe if the game had:\nFULL controller support,\nDirectional controls,\n(Doesn't matter, but it's always better with) Multiplayer,\nEasier enemies/less OPed enemies,\nAnd a ♥♥♥♥ing free-play mode,\nIt'd be worth $8.99,\nBut not how it is right now.\n\nIf you like the look (Or just) this game, try out Beat Hazard, if you don't already have it.\nThe gameplay is better, has Full Controller Support, you can purchase perks, have less OPed enemies, (they do have bosses, but the game warns when one's coming, and it's not a ♥♥♥♥ing demon that starts talking and sounds like a broken record player being voiced by Mel Tillis,) the game is still getting updated, with new DLC on the way, and is just overall more fun.\n\nP.S: Don't EVER use the ♥♥♥♥ing Shotgun, because it sucks more ♥♥♥♥ than a ♥♥♥♥♥ on a busy day.","March 21, 2014","false","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's exaclty what I was looking for; a shoot-em-up with a retro 80/90's feel, with " 3D vector-graphic style" ships and a boatload of neon colours that I can pick up and play, and then drop again when I need to carry on working.\n\nI've been playing games for so long now I really was becoming despondant with a lot of the latest releases, especially big names.  I just wanted something like Rez (Sega Dreamcast) with a modern resolution/sound, nice controls and a shedload of playability.  Here it is.\n\nIt's not sophisticated in its approach, but behind the scenes there is so much going on to ensure that the playability is right up there with the best of them.\n\nThe fact that you can use your own music, it's quick to load and sterling to look at is just the best combination. Who doesn't want to just listen to thier own favourite music whilst destroying random spaceships and defending your music collection?\n\nSeriously, this is the type of game that large companies should take note of.  Well done and thank you for making this game, it puts a smile on my face everytime I play it with an album/track.\n\nA+, Buy it now.  Then buy it for someone else.  Then review it.  Then throw your Xbox/PS4 in the bin and go outside; this game lets you do that.","June 21, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The huge hitbox on your own ship, compounded with the relatively small stage makes it overly difficult to avoid being hit especially at higher difficulty. Some enemies have pretty terrible telegraphing and can turn on a dime and take you by surprise. Some projectiles, most notably the laser spewing squares, can be really hard to see and can cause disheartening OHKOs. The stages can also become a boring slog especially with longer songs that are over 5 minutes. I found that songs lasting from 2-3 minutes to provide a sustained franticness that is somewhat fun, but hampered due to previously mentioned issues.\n\nThe upgrade system is fairly interesting, allowing players to unlock weapons that can be found in every song to customize their ship. However the novelty quickly wears off as you begin to unlock the same weapons constantly. The story that is presented in the game is laughably bad and really had no business being in the game. The highscore tables are painfully empty too, mostly due to the low popularity of the game.\n\nIf you want a better experience with a your own music + shooter combo, try out Beat Hazard instead. It's not a terrific game, and I believe a lot more could be gotten out of the medium, but at least the enjoyment you will get from it will far outlast Symphony.\n","June 3, 2014","false","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(Just kidding, the game only has a look at you're music and turns it into a shooting like Space invaders arcade game). I don't know how the game does it but it actually reads you're music and turns all the music notes into (They look like Space invaders to me!) enemies which you need to kill so the note restores back to it's song (Well, after the song has finished, it goes back to normal anyway). The idea is that this game is all about unlocking new weapons for you're 4 gunner ship (Lazers, shotgun, missiles, you name it and it will be there).\nAfter going through some songs you're bound to see something of what is called the DEMON, which is basically this viruses slave that got into you're music which turned everything bad (No, not a real virus xD Your pretty safe there) and you just need to show him whose boss of the music. Pretty simple? WRONG!\nThe bosses get harder as you defeat one after the other. SPOILER ALERT! -You are given this sheet of music at the beggining of the game which is called the Symphony and it's been taken over by the DEMONS. You're job is to go around all of you're music and Kill each DEMON on SIGHT. After killing a demon, you will have restored some of the symphony of 5 forsaken pages which contain 4-5 DEMONS ON EACH PAGE! Where I am is at the 4th DEMON on Page 3, so hofully it won't be too long before I face the big guy (The ultimate showdown boss fight). -- End Spoiler.\nSo can I recommend this game to you? If you're gamer who loves you're music then this may be yours. If you are more the adventure/action type player... Probably not. But I'm going to recommend it "YES" simply because I had a good time playing it.","March 24, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

What this game does diffrent then beat hazard is fact you can get multiple diffrent variations of guns/rocket launchers and rail guns (so far what I've unlocked) and upgrade them to make them more powerful.

And I'm glad I did—it scratches the same itch as Audiosurf, running your digital music through some algorithm or other to generate levels. But Symphony takes the conceit and whacks a manic shmup into it, and the result is a lot of fun.\n\nThe plot: Seems there's some demonic entity thing which is devouring the souls of the composers in your music collection or something...yeah it's dumb but just go with it, it's an arcade game. You fight off its many minions with the occasional boss fight interspersed, blasting them to smithereens while listening to your music. As the intensity of your music increases, the colors get brighter, enemies move faster and are harder to kill, and your motions become more spasmodic as you try to kill everything while collecting all the powerups.\n\nIt's similar in concept to bullet hell/danmaku/Touhou/what have you, but you will not be threading the needle here. The hitbox consists of your entire ship, and brushing up against enemies or their fire results in losing an outrider section of your craft—as well as the gun mounted on it. However, your craft can easily be repaired by picking up powerups in the form of musical notes. This, coupled with the occasional invincibility powerup, makes ramming enemies a totally legitimate strategy in a pinch.\n\nDifficulty scales up at a controlled enough rate that you're able to maintain a consistent degree of challenge even as your weapons get bigger and badder. Between plays you're given the option to configure and upgrade your craft's weaponry, and it's here where the gameplay is at its most strategic—do you want to focus heavy fire to forward, quickly taking down more powerful enemies? Load up on rapid-fire elements and send glowing hot plasma hurtling in eight directions at once to mop up the weenies? Close-quarter shotgunning? Long-range missile batteries? All are available to you, and all are viable.\n\nSong selection's not the most intuitive thing, and if like me you're more likely to stream music than keep 5 GB of it lying around on your hard drive you may find the selection a bit thin. The plot's whisper-thin—not a bad thing in itself, it only needs to be substantial enough to give you a reason to shoot stuff. But the prime villain keeps popping up to chat about thie insubstantial plot, often while you're in the middle of a level and would rather see what you're doing. But these are fairly minor quibbles, not enough to ruin the experience. Symphony is an enjoyable shooter that's as exciting as the music you pump through it, and at this stage in its life it's a cheap pickup. Have fun with it.","November 22, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. (TL:DR at the bottom)\n\nFirst, let me say, the menus look great, and are easy to work with. There's tons of weapons to add to your ''ship'' as you fight against enemies.\n\nHaving said that: The graphics can sometimes become confusing. You don't always have fully control over everything, as you simply cannot see everything. Dying simply because you didn't see an attack coming might happen to you a lot, but, on the other end, you have unlimited lives. The controller support, which was later added, feels rushed and unnatural, and isn't without bugs.\n\nThe storyline isn't exactly clear. Personally I have no problems with that, IF there was a way to avoid it. I don't want to go all deep on that, because I haven't played through it for 100% yet, and there may still be stuff to come. I'm at 40% now, and I still don't know why someone would want to infect my music library. On the store page I can't find it either.\n\nA bigger issue is when you try to play a few songs. It scans the song you want to play, and lets you. As an example, I've taken the songs ''3:45 - No sleep'' by the Cardigans, a really, really slow song, and Young, by Tulisa, a fast dance track, with lots of variation. The enemies were moving faster and coming in at a much higher rate in the song by The Cardigans (Which is also, looking at Beats per minute, a much, much slower song) than when playing the dance track. This didn't happen on 1 occasion: Loading up another few songs gives the same impression. Other than some detections in beats, used for weapons, the game doesn't really seem to be doing anything with the song, other than playing it.\n\nTL:DR,\nPros:\n- Nice menus\n- Lots of customisations\n- Graphics do look nice and run well on my mediocre system\n\nCons:\n-  Graphics may become confusing\n- Game does not seem to actually be using the library\n-  Controller support feels rushed in and unnatural\n- Plot might/has holes in it\n\nFinal verdict: It's good if you want an arcade shooter. If you want to be interacting with your music library, take a look at Audiosurf instead.","March 20, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Instead of moving your mouse, collecting and avoiding blocks, Symphony is a shoot 'em up. You'll be using your mouse to move your ship around, while shooting from 4 different angles with your guns while the game generates the enemies based on your choice of music.\nIf your music is (reaching an) up-tempo (part) then the field will become red and more enemies will arrive. Shooting down enemies will result in giving you points. These points will place you on a leaderboard when the song is over. Shooting enemies will also give you random, upgradeable weapons and power-ups. These can be applied to your ship, making it stronger but also more difficult. Also, every now and then a boss will pop up and killing these will unlock more difficulties later in the game.\nSuperb game !\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","August 16, 2012","true","16.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most people reading this like both, so the merging of the two sounds like a brilliant idea. It's worked with Audiosurf and Beat Hazard, two very popular and succesful games, and rightfully so. As these two games set a benchmark for people in one way or another, Symphony will no doubt be compared to them, and obviously is not as good as either. What is disappointing is that there's so much that went wrong with Symphony that leaves it a mess of a game in comparrison.\n\nFirst and foremost, the gameplay. Putting aside how badly the music is filtered, the gameplay tries to be Beat Hazard and has all of the effects flashy and bright. It's a nice feature, but when you, the enemies and even the background are all stylised the same way, and trying to distinguish what's going to kill you is increasingly difficult, even on the easiest settings. Another feature that doesn't help is how limited the movement is. In Beat Hazard, you controlled the ship with WASD and the shooting with your mouse. Now all of it is simplified to just the mouse, which controls rather awkwardly. You have four weapons which can be customised in direction and firing modes, and that's it. Accuracy and power have to be balanced, which would work in other games, but for what you're tasked to do it becomes a chore when you end up fighting demons which cower behind walls and take an unfair amount of time to kill off.\n\nThe demons lead me to the story. Why is there a story for this game? Beat Hazard and Audiosurf didn't need an excuse plot, niether does Symphony. Apparently some Shodan wannabe is holding captive the souls of my greatest composers, and I need to collect the Symphony of Souls to defeat it. This is completely forgotten in-game and only re-surfaces on the odd occasion to make you fight a demon, or rather hold down the fire button and hope it doesn't hide behind cover. These sections drag on for too long and just adds another thing to gripe about, as thinking into it makes it even worse. A story should be better the more you think about it, and if they had left it out completely Symphony would've been much better off and perhaps even worth reccomending.\n\nIt's sad, because I wanted to like Symphony. I went into it with high hopes and came out disappointed. Symphony isn't a good game, nor is it terrible, and that's truely the worst thing about it. With nothing original to it, no memorable moments to salvage the mediocrately of the majority of the game, it's simply forgettable. This is a sub-par shmup with no reason to exist except to provide incentive to play Beat Hazard again, and if you jump back into Beat Hazard, you don't think "Wow, this is much better implemented than it was in Symphony", as Symphony is completely forgettable and not worth playing.\n\nFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview","December 25, 2014","false","4.4"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","1"

To those not yet familiarized with this style, it consists of procedurally generated levels, and this procedure utilizes songs chosen by the user to create the levels. If you use the same song, it will always create the same level (if the difficulty chosen is the same, obviously).\n\nThe game is superb. The graphics and level of content in this game will keep you busy for a LOT of time. There is a lot to unlock and do in this game: you beat songs to get items, then you need to collect Kudos and Inspiration to unlock and upgrade these items. There are a lot of unlockables in this game and each song will unlock something;\n\nAn extremely enjoyable gameplay that is relaxing at earlier difficulties, but also can be very challenging at the hardest ones. The leaderboard system is awesome, it takes into consideration every aspect of your performance, including your ship power (the higher the power the less points you get). You can (and should) make ship builds in this game using the weapons and upgrades for optimal performance when beating songs.\n\nControls are straight-forward, you can even put auto-fire on separate weapons in your ship meaning it will fire without the need to press the left mouse button.\n\nThere is a bug which causes the game to crash when analyzing any MP3 songs, I have never seen anyone else with this issue though. All other music file extensions run just fine.\n\nLast but not least, another cool aspect of the game: To unlock difficulties you need to beat "demons" which randomly invade your songs. Those are pretty cool to fight (and challenging, too).\n\nRecommended!","June 14, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Half the time I had no idea what I was doing in the game. Sure the main thing of a shooter is to shoot enemies, but even that needs to have a goal or objective. Symphony gives the story of how your music is being attacked by muisc demons and these mosnter are it's supposed minions. That's the context but I've not actually felt any motivation for shooting them.\n\nThis is an issue with the enemies themselves. They are not very memorable and are boring. They fly by in eradic manners that does not emulate the music at all and never seem to be very fun blowing them up. Sometimes it becomes a chore as they are not very difficult to put down but they have a high amount of health and require many bullets before they are destroyed\n\nMusic being the main selling point of this game, this game seems to use little or none of the muisc itself. Either that or the music annaylse algorithum is borked... I never felt like the game is influenced by music. Rock music has high ammount of muisc, quiet music has slow lesser amount of enemies.... Other than that the variation between songs is non existant.\n\nThe visuals at first was really pretty, I like the crystaline structure as it has a very clean serene feeling to it... unfortunately this gets boring and annoying fast. They never really take anything of the structure to create an environment, the enenmies conisst of boring shape that are repeated with no variations or imagination and the colour can be distracting and annyoing as it blends the bullets and enemies so that it becomes unnoticeable when they are shooting and ramming into you.\n\nThe weapon unlocking systme and progression can only be described with the pace of molasis. It's confusing, makes little sense, and doesn't feel very rewarding to progress. Why, because it unlocks more of the same thing without variations.\n\nBut the bottom line is, Symphony is not a muisc game, it's not visually appealing, and take away the gimmick aspect it's not a very well made game either.","October 13, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The goal of the game is, aside from getting to the end of whatever song you're playing, to shoot as many enemies as you can without getting killed yourself, and pick up points that drop from them. The types of enemies that spawn, as well as their intensity and flight patterns is based on the type of song you're playing, and how calm or intense that song is. Although you have infinite lives, the consequences for dying become steeper as you play on harder difficulty levels. Additionally, enemies also become stronger and more aggressive, leading to Symphony being a much less casual game than one would expect at first glance.\nMy favourite aspect of Symphony is the art style. While simplistic, with most objects being just prisms of light, it is also very remarkable and unique.

Beat Hazard was a little further removed, with enemy spawns seeming to have little correlation to anything, but the weapons, game speed, and visuals all flexing along to the music.\n\nNow we have Symphony, a game that is almost entirely removed from any relevance to the music being played. It's a decent shmup, letting you customize your ship with weapons and powerups unlocked through completing more songs in your library and successive difficulties opening up via occasional boss battles. It just happens to be playing your music in the background.\n\nIt controls well enough and runs nice and smoothly but ironically, I actually have MORE trouble figuring out what keeps blowing me up than I did in Beat Hazard, which is quite a feat.\n\nIt's alright I guess but given that they're all in a similar price range I'd recommend either of the other two before this one.","April 2, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You think you can move around something, but for some reason you still get damaged or even killed by that something.\nEven more annoying is the unlock system: Finish a song and you get a random (mostly weak or useless) weapon. E.g. you can find 10 shotguns (by far one of the worst weapons) and then you maybe find a Megablaster (straight upgrade to your default weapons).\nOh and do you wanna upgrade it?

There were rare instances when the frenetic combat and the pounding beat seemed to synchronize, but more often than not the two bore little similarity to one another.

I wasn't expecting it to have a story, but it does. I give it kudos (haha. Kudos. You know. Point you get in the game. hahaha. ahem.) for having a nice story. The story is about a demon possessing the souls of the composers of your music and you need to defeat them as you you go along while playing. They appear in some songs and you fight them. Each time you beat one, you unlock a little bit of the symphony of souls, unlocking a new difficulty. I like the difficulty names. They are named after the italian words for how loud or soft you would play or sing on an instrument (pianissimo, piano, mezzopiano, mezzoforte, forte, fortissimo).

It's very, very fast paced and can be surprisingly difficult- and very stressful at times. I've never played Touhou or Ikaruga or anything of that nature (and I don't plan on doing so) but it's similar to that, from what I've seen of those games. Even when the mouse sensitivity is at 100%, I found my hand moving all over the mousepad and sometimes sticking to the mousepad when my hands got sweaty, thus straining my wrist.\n\nThere are some good concepts passed around such as an underlying story, unlockable items, a customizable ship, and an interesting difficulty system but ultimately, playing this game is more stressful than liberating. Integration of musical terms, pieces, and historical composers was definitely interesting. Also, the interaction between the software and the music is definitely novel (intriguing), with certain weapons and elements firing in tandem with certain musical elements and pacing of course following sound intensity and tempo.\n\nAnother thing I found interesting was how this game makes you feel like you have little control over the music you own, which  I guess means that the premise of the game (fighting for the liberation of your music) really does work. My music, however, to me is very personal. I bought and own this ♥♥♥♥ and I will declare ownership and mastery over it if I please. My music also felt skinned when in menus which have their own non-mutable soundtrack. The song browser was also inferior to the one in Audiosurf/Audiosurf 2.\n\nIn the end, it just doesn't match Audiosurf and Audiosurf 2, both of which are pleasantly engaging and exhibit an unparalelled experience in this genre.","September 29, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everytime I played a song on this game, I enjoyed myself. (Except when the hardness was too high or the song was slow. But we'll get to that later.) If you want a honest review, here it is.\n\nThe game is fun, a bit repetitive, but fun. I'm going to break this review down into three sections. Gameplay, Story, and Graphics.\n\nGameplay: The game is hard, challenging, and a thrill to play. If you have a mixed music library like I do it will be a great game. However, I do need to mention you have to buy a 1$ DLC to play with Itunes music. But since I got this game in a bundle, it was not a problem to pay a dollar for it. There is an assorted amount of mini-demons just waiting to be attacked, and while easy by themselves. The challenge comes when they attack you on all sides and you cannot hold out. Now while song to song was fun it does get repeatitive. Although it does calibrate your music to each level, the same mini-demons appear and do basically the same patterns in differnet places or number based on the song. Which is my first negative thing to say about the game. The game does shine however when the Demon battles comes every once in a while. These are exciting, especially with Rock music or J-pop playing in the background of an all out battle. All the demons have obvious weaknesses, it's just a challenge of exploiting them. Especially the last boss, who will non-stop shoot and only stays exposed for maybe two seconds. Overall, the game is fun but you need the right music. ANY SONG THAT IS SLOW WILL NOT BE FUN OR CHALLENGING. REMEMBER THIS BEFORE CHOOSING A SONG. One last thing to mention is difficulty. The game as I said before is hard, but becomes easier the more you play. As you upgrade your ship, you'll notice that impossible song you played before was the simpliest thing you need. It just takes time.\n\nStory: Believe it or not this game has a story that I was not aware of at the time I got this game. It's simple. There is a demon, he wants to take over world with the Symphony of Souls. You have to stop him. Even though this story was so simple however, I still found it exciting everytime the main villian takes over your screen and talks to you. With a simple story, I have to say they executed it well by mixing it in fine with the actual game. Could it have been better? Probobly. Was it good for this game? No doubt about it.\n\nGraphics: I don't like to talk about graphics, because really I don't care about graphics. So long as it has good gameplay and story... (Wait? Didn't this game have both? It did didn't it!) The graphics are great, had no problems, no bugs, no glitches, everything ran smoothly.\n\nOverall, it's a good game. Especially for the price I payed. (1.33) I think it does everything it promises and overall is fun.\n\nIf you didn't read the full review here's the jist of it.\n\nPositive\n+Extreme Replayability\n+Challenging\n+Story is Good\n+Graphics are Great\n\nNegative\n-Wish Story Could Be Deeper (Infinite Symphonies? What does that mean?)\n-Overly Repeatitive\n\nI give this game a 7/10. Get it","August 12, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked that you can use your own music to create levels, the online leaderboards give it replay value, and the weapons customization was great (in a way, it reminded me of Tyrian, one of my favorite shooters).  However I still have a few issues that hold me back from giving this a full recommendation.  First, navigating songs is kind of a clunky pain in the butt.  Second, the mouse movements while navigating for songs (or when not playing a level in general) is finicky (to be fair, patches have been released, so EmptyClip is aware of this).  All the same, the good gameplay outweighs the bad menu navigation.  I recommend this for music and shooter lovers.","August 16, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Symphony joins Beat Hazard, Audiosurf and the Polynominal in my growing collection of games that have me fight my own music, and I love it so far. In symphony an unspoken force has taken the world's greatest composers hostage and seeks to conqueor the world through music. You have to stop them by shooting them to hell with neon guns and seizure inducing weapons that will set your screen ablaze. Symphony uses your music to generate an enemy attack pattern that grows more intense as your music intensifies. Your vessel can be armed and upgraded to the teeth with the spoils gained. It's is as awesome as it sounds, but there are some minor gripes. Such as how the enemy attacks are hard to spot and navigating the menu to upgrade your weapons is bit cumbersome.

It plays a bit like Galaga, although you have much more control over how you move your ship. The music you chose changes when the enemies enter the screen and how fast they move, and sometimes alters their firing patterns. It's kinda hard to pick up on when it's happening, though. The effect is far more apparent and noticible on something that focuses on a strong beat rather than other instruments (Teeth by Lady Gaga is a good example of where you can see it easily). Progression is rewarding, as you unlock weapons and items to buy after beating any new song, and then use those to customize your ship. The biggest downside is that, as of right now, it's still somewhat buggy and a CPU hog, but the dev is working with the Steam community daily to put out new betas and fix these problems.\n\nNot the best .mp3 game, but still pretty good.","September 3, 2012","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To start i've found that the game flows with your music much better than the other two. Beat Hazard didn't work the music element very well in my opinion, the screen looked neutrally cluttered on all sections apart from quiet ones, and enemy pattern changes wern't that noticable. In Symphony enemies constantly enter the screen to the beat, the dynamics change the speed and intensity of the enemies and your ship, and the world colour changes from a cool blue to a raging red. I also have to give it credit for having some sort of level progression. While Audiosurf and Beat Hazard were pretty much about picking a song, getting a score and that's that, Symphony has you playing a number of songs to eventually reach a boss battle within that certain artist. On top of this every time you complete a song you unlock a random item or weapon to attach to your ship, and you also have a small chance of unlocking rare and more powerful weapons if you're lucky. These can be upgraded to help you in the higher difficulty levels. Symphony just goes a lot deeper than the other two and is definitely worth a look.","August 28, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It runs smooth on even the oldest of toasters. Most importantly, like other games in its genre offers the potential for seemingly endless replay value by being able to generate new levels based on data analysis from songs you provide. Seems like a pretty good deal, right?\n\nWell, it could have been. A fundamental problem this game has is the levels it generates are not so great. One the mechanics this game has is that it will speed up the flow of enemies as the song intensifies, and slow down as the song resumes normal tempo. The accuracy of this process can be really hit or miss, which can make some songs frustratingly difficult or simply unfun to play through. Sometimes this mainfests itself as a floundering between mid and high intensities when the tempo isn't changing at random intervals, and on slower songs the sensitivity seems to go up and you end up with random spurts of intensity change for seemingly no reason. Enemies often pop in at random off-beat unless you are playing a song with an extremely pronounced beat, but there is often still some fuzz that seems to account for the time it takes the enemies to pile up at the edges of the map.\n\nThis seems to go hand-in-hand with the spawning of the mid-boss enemies that appear throughout the songs. I'm not against the concept of having them in the game since it makes you apply some strategy to survive the song with them around. What does irk me is they often appear at random which throws off the rhythm of killing other things on the map.\n\nBut then, of course, there is the actual boss fights. Nothing is more frustrating than dealing with one of the "demons." They spawn at random after you have made a fair amount of progress into a song, and disrupt both the flow of the course you were running, and also make it impossible to get a high score for that run. I think I would have preferred if they had dedicated or marked tracks that become available after a set amount of runs between demons so you could both ready yourself and play other songs without being disrupted.\n\nOn top of all of those things, your only real sense of fulfillment is the high score bulletin board. However, since nobody seems to actively play or submit scores there, you could spend the entire time you play the game on and off for years and nobody might ever see or challenge your score. Even on popular songs! That kinda blows, but it also gives you a good idea of just how many people stick around to play this game long term.\n\nI could also go into the vague story they tried to bolt on as a form of plot advancement and to make it not seem so grindy, but it feels very forced and that is reflected on the erratic behavior of how demons are fit into the game (see above).\n\nI'd say if you're trying to get into beat games like this for the first time, consider another game like Audiosurf or Beat Hazard. If you have those and just want to experience something akin to Galaga on acid, then this might be a better fit for you. If I could rate this game as "meh" I would, but otherwise I don't think I would recommend this game to anyone.","August 22, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nothing amazing but then again it doesn't promise to be. I've seen people complaining about the song selection interface and I'll admit that sometimes it can be annoying because it refuses to work on occasion but other than that I don't get why they're complaining? Pick a song that you enjoy and then shoot stuff while you listen to it. The subwoofer is actually the best music weapon since it automatically fires to the bass in the song that is currently playing.\nIt's true that in harder difficulties the play area is filled with enemies while also being too small while your ship is too big so you get hit a lot. But I only casually play it anyway which I'm pretty sure is the point considering there's no fluidity since it's a game based on YOUR music.

(At least I have yet to seen it)\n- Graphics are neat, pretty, and simple.\n\nCons:\n- There is only so much to the game before some finds it too repetitive to be entertained from.\n- No unicode support. Be prepared to see lots of rectangles if the name is not in English.\n- You will play so many different songs of your choice, but you get so many similar weapons.\n- NO SEARCH BUTTON for songs. *Evil laughs at people who have millions of songs*\n- While boss battles add an interesting touch to the game, it can be rather distasteful when you're rocking out to a nice song and suddenly this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss comes in and wrecks it all. Still, it's interesting.\n\nI must strongly emphasize that these are all my opinions on Symphony for as long as I have played (3.6hours at point of writing this review). You may agree or disagree, but ultimately, reviews are only there as a suggestion as to whether you may or may not like the game, and to understand how it seems to work from others' point of view.\n\nThere are more cons than pros in this review, and yet it does not mean I dislike it. It fits just right into what I was trying to find, something slack and casual that can keep my hands busy if not real work while I listen to the music. Should you feel the price is not the worth, then do buy it on sale and try it then. For that, I enjoy playing Symphony and I do recommend to you.","June 5, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's something I can play for 10 minutes or an hour. It uses my own music library to create levels in an arcade shooter. There are boss battles seemingly at random that unlock higher tiers of difficulty. Ultimately, there are six levels of difficulty, so you can get a lot of replayability out of each song.\n\nI loaded about 130 songs into it so far and it has no problems handling that size of a library, though I'd say that is relatively small.\n\nYou can unlock various weapon upgrades and rare weapons that are more powerful that are essential for higher difficulty tiers.\n\nThe game is nowhere near as difficulty as most shoot-em-up games, even at the highest difficulty setting, which I like, because it reduces the emphasis on memorizing patterns and finding gaps in enemy movement and fire.\n\nThere's a fair amount of achievements to unlock, if you're into that, and online leaderboards if you make an account with the developer, but I didn't bother with that.","August 21, 2013","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcticfox00/recommended/207750/","arcticfox00","[A&W] Пγx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcticfox00/","1177 products in account","The procedurely-generated music game craze brought with it quite a few different games with a similar theme, but different mechanics. One of the later games to be released, Symphony, is essentially a 2D shooter, but unlike Beat Hazard, the interface and style are much cleaner and based more around wire-frames and softer light effects. There is no ability to rotate your ship, however weapons attached to your ship (which I'll get to in a moment) can be rotated to shoot towards any direction.\n\nI compare this game mostly to Beat Hazard, as there is a sense of progression - you play songs, and upon completing a song unlock a weapon you can add to your ship. There are approximately eight weapons, which can be upgraded several levels to increase their power, and also 'super' variants of these weapons which are more rare unlocks and cost significantly more to upgrade. Upgrades are facilitated by spending points earned by playing songs. Playing songs on higher difficulty, with stronger enemies and an overabundance of them, earns more of these points. There are also two 'weapons' that appear as random drops on the play-field, and they can be upgraded as well.\n\nThis progression adds some time to the game, which for some can be a plus - compared to the more free-form style of Audiosurf. There is a story mode which isn't optional, however at any time you are free to choose which songs you play. After vanquishing the final 'boss' enemy which randomly appears during one of your songs , you can continue to play without that hinderance. Progressing through the story also unlocks difficulty levels.\n\nI admire the attempt to extend play-time through the use of a progression system, where the weapon unlocked by each song  is random, encouraging one to essentially grind through songs to secure desired weapons. The grinding itself should be organic anyway - the point of playing the game is enjoy one's music, is it not?\n\nWhile some aspects of the game are procedurely-generated, it's inevitable that at some point one will have 'seen it all', so to speak, and after that point it becomes a matter of how much one enjoys the mechanics. There are scoreboards for individual songs, although I don't find them to be as populated as Beat Hazard or Audiosurf. One thing I think would be nice would be a scoreboard for overall points accumulated, similar to the one provided in Beat Hazard.\n\nI can't speak towards the longevity of the game since that's based more around personal preferences; I do feel as though it's a finished project, however some DLC (free or not) that adds more weapons and enemy types would certainly extend its lifespan. As it is, you can see I've played around 80 hours (I believe), and I likely won't be picking it up again any time soon. I do enjoy these games, but find myself consistently coming back to Audiosurf (which is more thrilling and random), and rarely Beat Hazard (for the challenge and overall leaderboard).\n\nI would recommend this game for those who like the genre, and perhaps even fans of the 2D shooter field, however to those people I'd recommend Beat Hazard as a more intense experience. This game gets a thumbs up from me, even if it unfortunately has a limited life cycle.","April 24, 2014","true","71.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I’ve played Beat Hazard to death, Gradius, R-Type and other games of the SHMUP genre and I imagined Symphony would be just as awesome, but it didn’t live up to my expectations.\n\nThe gameplay starts with the easiest difficulty and you climb your way up. Within each level you kill ships of various forms that move according to the music. The faster the beat, the faster the enemy ships but the more score you can get. As you defeat bosses and unlock more pieces of the Symphony of Souls, you unlock more enemies as well as additional changes to earn more inspiration and kudos (currencies used to buy ship guns and upgrades).\n\nEach song has one hidden weapon or perk that is revealed once the song is finished. Upon beating the song, one has the opportunity to buy it at that point or later. The player ship has four gun slots that can be customized to the player’s preference. Controls are simple and there is no death (not finishing the song) but one might not get any rewards.  However, thanks to the above SHMUP games I’ve played before, there are some things that I expect that don’t happen or aren’t logical in the game. Others might find some of these quirks desirable and enjoyable but sadly I don’t. Some of these I can work around while others are just plain frustrating.  So personally I wouldn’t recommend it, but if it’s your cup of tea you may enjoy it. Here are the quirks that I don’t like.\n\nOne example is if you play a harder difficulty, you should get more inspiration and kudos. However, the amount of inspiration you get decreases after the third difficulty, and I can only wonder if the hardest difficulty gives you even more  than the third. On the other hand, you do get crazy amount of kudos which, while nice, isn’t needed too much in upgrades. By playing enough songs to get to the fifth difficulty, I accumulated more kudos than I seemed to need, making the harder difficulties only worth it for score and not for resources. Boss unlocks still happen at lower difficulties which makes sense, for those that aren’t good with the genre.\n\nShip parts seem to consist of mainly subwoofers (guns that fire to the beat of the music), shotguns, and the occasional rocket launcher. One unlocks the ability to buy a single gun or perk that appears when a song is beaten. While these guns are better than nothing, the guns I want, double guns, seem to be far and few between. One might assume this isn’t a problem once the ship is loaded the way you want, but unfortunately it is. Given each difficulty, you get a score multiplier, determined by the attack volley total of your guns. As the difficulty increases, the strength of the guns can increase without having the multiplier dip below 1. Because guns can’t be de-leveled, this leads to a perplexing problem. If I play at a higher difficulty and switch down, I’m too strong so I can only equip one or two of the guns. Given the gameplay mechanics, if I get hit in that spot I lose the gun until I can pick up another note, which without guns is very hard to do. With multiple weaker guns, I can take a hit but I can’t de-level. There’s no store either, so I’m left with lots of crappy guns I can buy that I probably don’t want to use, or I end up using only one good gun.\n\nFor now I have the invincibility and bomb perks which make me invincible for a few seconds so I can melee ships (for no musical note) and create an explosion that takes out a good chunk of the screen, respectively. My main issues are the inability to store bombs, and bombs that kill the user. For the first issue, bombs are sometimes dropped when you kill a chain of enemies. The problem is that I might just run into the bomb, because I want the musical note that the enemy dropped. However, the bomb activates as soon as I touch it, so this leads to a waste of a bomb. Worse yet is when the bomb spawns on the spawn point and I hit it once I spawn. Bombs might not even spawn at the most useful times, forcing the player to evade the item if they want to avoid using it, leading to a weird play style of avoiding powerups. Similar issues exist for the invincibility so I wish there was a way to store it, as oppose to littering the screen and avoiding stuff. If nothing else, make the bomb smaller and possibly force the user to stay on it for a second, as opposed to just activating on impact.\n\nFor the second issue, a bomb grants no invincibility. However, there is one type of enemy which explodes on impact. This leads to one’s death if one runs into a bomb while this enemy is close, creating another powerup-related problem. Shots are not destroyed, making it difficult to evade if one doesn’t notice the shot fired just before they die. In rarer cases, I’ve gotten four bombs in a row and getting one would kill me, limiting my motion. Related to this issue is that score does NOT increase unless one picks up notes.  Because of this, at harder difficulties the game turns into running into the crowd just to get notes.\n\nSome of the comments above exist because this game doesn’t follow the norm, and it is indeed a fallacy to assume that games should follow the norm. However, at least give me the ability to downgrade weapons and logically make it so that harder difficulty results in both more kudos AND more inspiration. A weapon store or at least a preview ability to know what I will unlock would be nice. Possibly give me a store too and a smaller ship hit box, but that might be asking too much.\n\nDespite all the ranting and blocks of text, it is a beautiful game with awesome boss fights that show up and create a story about your music. Customizing ships with different guns is an excellent feature that some games might overlook, although it can make the game really easy too. Moving with the beat and shooting enemies is always fun, but can also be annoying in strange ways due to the above. Yet, that’s always not a bad thing.  Perhaps I’m too used to certain things existing in this genre, but that’s how I roll. In all likelihood I’ll get to the last difficulty and stop.\n\nEDIT 1:Another issue I've found is the lack of audio cues for when invinciblity will fade. This leads to the rare, ram into your death scenario which rarely helps considering how there's roughly a five to ten second delay penality for getting a new ship.","April 12, 2014","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the base concept is great there are numerous problems which make the game the 'barely recommended' in my opinion.\nThe concept is that you import you own music into the game and the enemies react to your music. Kind of like Audiosurf where the blocks appear to the beat of the music. The problem is that while in Autiosurf the mechanism work pretty well, in Symphony it's not really. Sure the pace of the enemies grows as the music arrives to a faster part, but other than that nothing and it's somewhat disappointing.\nBut even with the primary feature it could be a fun game, but the greater issue is that the game is really repetitive after 1-2 hours basically and there is very little content to play around.\n-There are few weapons, most of them are puny and you would not use it anyway.\n-You will keep looting the same ♥♥♥♥ from music (same weapons that you have like 50)\n-No ship customization, or choose/build your own ship\n-Only 3 power ups (invincibility, bomb, "power up")\n-Same bosses over and over again\n-Few enemy types who arrive in the same pattern\n-and so on...\nSo you can see that there are problems with the game that overshadow the great concept which this game has.\n\nI would only recommend if you can get it for a low price of 1-2 EUR, because the overall game if Fun for a time, but it fails in some levels of detail and mechanic as explained above.\n\n5/10","March 14, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakemagic/recommended/207750/","cakemagic","cakemagic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakemagic/","121 products in account","Good for casual fun\nThis game is fairly entertaining and good if you want to blow something up while listening to your music. It is really addicting in the beginning, because you'll be playing songs to unlock weapons for your ship and getting points to upgrade them. I really like that you can rotate the weapons around to make them shoot at different angles in the ship customization. The game is pretty easy, since you have infinite lives; so you can't fail. Each death however, does reduce your score and thus earn you less points.\n\nHowever the game does come with many flaws. The first annoyance is that there is no search feature for songs, like in Osu! So if you have a large library of songs, you can't use a search function to find the song you want to play. There is a filter system, but it's not optimal at all.\nAs for actual gameplay, some of the design choices will annoy you, your ship has an amazingly large hitbox and you barely have space to actually manoeuvre around. Enemies will spawn in front and at the side, so sometimes you will have absolutely no room to move at all. Some of the hits can one shot you. There are so many flashy particles on screen that you sometimes can't see the enemies or bullets coming.\nDying is one of the worst feeling ever, not because you lose points, but it feels like an eternity. When you die, you want to jump back right in, but instead you have to wait for quite some while before you respawn. When you respawn, you don't clear the screen of enemies, so if there are a lot of enemies left on screen, you'll end up dying again.\nAs you progress further into the game, it only goes downhill from there. At higher difficulty, more enemies spawn with higher hitpoints, making it frustrating to move around and survive. It does give you more points, but by the time you unlock the final difficulty, you would already have unlocked the normal weapons and upgrades you want. The only motivation for you to play the songs after 7 hours of playtime is to either hope for a rare weapon (which is just a more powerful version of the normal weapons you can unlock) or to progress the 'story' of the game.\n\nOveral I did had some fun with the game, but it comes with many annoyances. If you don't have a lot of music or don't like to listen to music, I wouldn't recommend the game; you need over 100 songs at least to fully enjoy the game. Also if you a hardcore Shoot 'Em Up player (like TouHou), you probably won't enjoy this game either. The game isn't 'challenging', but it is fun to shoot at stuff and get better weapons.\n\nI rate this game 63 out of 100 points.","November 19, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Slayer's "Born of Fire" offers much the same arcade space battle experience as the opening track from Morrowind.\n\nHowever, it is a game with very bright and flashy displays.  Hence, I recommend this game to anyone with small children as a brief diversion from the usual kids' entertainment.\n\nA grand improvement would be to include "source folder" as a filter for searching music.

From the logo, it looked like it was going to be boring as hell and pretentious. But once I installed and got it going, I was pleasently surprised. This game takes a unique concept-scan every single music file on your hard drive (iTunes music is excluded because .AAC files aren't compatible-the only downside), and create a bullet hell game about a horde of demons invading music-your music. Sounds ludicrous enough, but what really makes this game work is that not only each "level" designed like a traditional bullet hell game, but you get to play it as your music's blasting in the background with varying difficulty depending on the song. It's a suprisingly enjoyable, over-the-top (can't believe I'm saying this) blast.","October 27, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Purpose.\nIn audiosurf, you're just collectng blocks for the sake of it. There's no real rhyme or reason as to why you are, you just are.\n\nIn this game, you fight against monsters who use your music against you, taking it away, and making you weaker. The intro struck me because the game throws you straight in front of these two glowing eyes and a glitchy demon voice, explaining how, 'Music is the product of intelligent beings' and how it's his gateway.\n\nYou fight to free parts of "The Symphony of Souls" which was created by the demon, or whatever he is for that manner, and his subordinates, who, coincidentally, are abducted composers. Go figure.\n\nThe weapon system is very cool, the fact that you can choose four different weapons, each working a different way, to fight off the waves.\n\nThe leaderboard system is interesting as well, because, the weaker you are, the higher your base score multiplier.\n\nYou also unlock different difficulty levels as you free parts of the Symphony.\n\nNow for the breakdown:\n\nPros:\nStory\nBuilt in song library\nFleshed out weapon system\nWeapon Customization (Upgrades, Rotration, firing type, etc)\nBosses\n\nCons:\nYou Die, A Lot (Unlimited lives though)\nHaving your own music makes the geme more personal\nLeaderboards don't always recognise songs\nMildly annoying firing effects\n\ntl;dr Veterans and newbies alike will enjoy this game that fuses elements of classic vertical shooters, and rhythm games","October 27, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everytime I played a song on this game, I enjoyed myself. (Except when the hardness was too high or the song was slow. But we'll get to that later.) If you want a honest review, here it is.\n\nThe game is fun, a bit repetitive, but fun. I'm going to break this review down into three sections. Gameplay, Story, and Graphics.\n\nGameplay: The game is hard, challenging, and a thrill to play. If you have a mixed music library like I do it will be a great game. However, I do need to mention you have to buy a 1$ DLC to play with Itunes music. But since I got this game in a bundle, it was not a problem to pay a dollar for it. There is an assorted amount of mini-demons just waiting to be attacked, and while easy by themselves. The challenge comes when they attack you on all sides and you cannot hold out. Now while song to song was fun it does get repeatitive. Although it does calibrate your music to each level, the same mini-demons appear and do basically the same patterns in differnet places or number based on the song. Which is my first negative thing to say about the game. The game does shine however when the Demon battles comes every once in a while. These are exciting, especially with Rock music or J-pop playing in the background of an all out battle. All the demons have obvious weaknesses, it's just a challenge of exploiting them. Especially the last boss, who will non-stop shoot and only stays exposed for maybe two seconds. Overall, the game is fun but you need the right music. ANY SONG THAT IS SLOW WILL NOT BE FUN OR CHALLENGING. REMEMBER THIS BEFORE CHOOSING A SONG. One last thing to mention is difficulty. The game as I said before is hard, but becomes easier the more you play. As you upgrade your ship, you'll notice that impossible song you played before was the simpliest thing you need. It just takes time.\n\nStory: Believe it or not this game has a story that I was not aware of at the time I got this game. It's simple. There is a demon, he wants to take over world with the Symphony of Souls. You have to stop him. Even though this story was so simple however, I still found it exciting everytime the main villian takes over your screen and talks to you. With a simple story, I have to say they executed it well by mixing it in fine with the actual game. Could it have been better? Probobly. Was it good for this game? No doubt about it.\n\nGraphics: I don't like to talk about graphics, because really I don't care about graphics. So long as it has good gameplay and story... (Wait? Didn't this game have both? It did didn't it!) The graphics are great, had no problems, no bugs, no glitches, everything ran smoothly.\n\nOverall, it's a good game. Especially for the price I payed. (1.33) I think it does everything it promises and overall is fun.\n\nIf you didn't read the full review here's the jist of it.\n\nPositive\n+Extreme Replayability\n+Challenging\n+Story is Good\n+Graphics are Great\n\nNegative\n-Wish Story Could Be Deeper (Infinite Symphonies? What does that mean?)\n-Overly Repeatitive\n\nI give this game a 7/10. Get it","August 12, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can get the games to recognise your tracks. And the bosses... oh dear, basic yet frustrating.\n\nThe way the game throws enemies into what is a paultry play area is massively unfair in later stages/difficulties. THe game expects you to pick up points left in the play area by destroyed enemies, but the play area is packed so full of enemies that it makes it so impossible. And this is where the core concept is horribly broken, the game doesn't hold back in the name of making the game playable, it will just keep going whether the player can handle what's already in the area or not.\n\nIf you love shooters and playing with your music, get Beat Hazard without the Ultra addon.

The music recognition system varies up the gameplay a lot - slow and calm songs will make enemies appear in an orderly fashion, fast and complex songs will make enemies appear quickly from all around, putting your hand-eye coordination to the test. The music recognition isn't perfect, but does its job - the gameplay gets more frantic with higher tempo, special enemies appear at fitting moments, and the subwoofer weapon fires stronger the louder a song's bass line is. You can play any song at any difficulty level, unlocking higher difficulty levels over time. This way, the game is easy the first time you pick it up, but can turn into a bullet hell shooter by the end. Plus, it has that "just one more level" effect that makes it addictive - you want to find out how this song is gonna look like, what item that song will get you, etc.\nThe graphics of the game aren't technologically mind-blowing, but look gorgeous and sparkling with colors.\nThe music, of course, is the best there is - your own ;). The few tracks that are included are nothing special and you'll need to add more to unlock more and better weapons.\nPersonally, I sometimes think of this game as an advanced music visualizer, not only displaying pretty shapes, but also allowing you to interact with music. I think of it less as a shooting challenge, and more as a fun way to listen to music.","February 28, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Noob (Nightmare Lyra)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmarelyre/","406 products in account","Symphony is a shoot-em-up space ship type game where you use your music to generate levels. If that sounds like Beat Hazard to you, then yes it does, only this is nowhere near as fun as Beat Hazard.\n\nRight of the bat the game loses points for trying to shoehorn story elements into a game that really don't need it and is happy to interrupt your game at annoying times with unskipable "cutscenes", which is nothing but some glowing eyes popping up on the screen and trying to be intimidating before you get a popup message about "how evil this thing is and it is destroying your music, you need to stop it". Cheesy bad stories like that can have their charm, but in this case it's just unecessary and kinda lame. The tutorial of the game is also mandotory and also very happy to interrupt and annoy you.\n\nI will give them credit for trying a interesting approach to the gameplay, by having your ship set at a fixed angle and the enemies coming in from the side most of the time, making dodging a bigger part of the game than in some other similar games where it is more about downing the enemy before it comes close to you, but all in all not being able to turn your ship becomes more annoying than a fun challenge really quickly. It's not even particularly hard, you have infinite extra lives and you regain health from picking up enemy drops, it's just mildly annoying. The weapons you unlock for beating songs really don't do much to change up gameplay beyond doing more damage or having different ammo either, and after 3 songs, one which included a boss battle, I was already bored.\n\nThe song setlist sorting is also poorly handled. Instead of the system used in Beat Hazard where you load one and one folder and can freely decide which subfolders to use, this game will automatically use ALL subfolders in a selected folder no matter what, so if you have all your music saved in the "My Music" folder but have subfolders in there with song stems, multitracks, demo versions etc. look forward to having to scroll through pages of stems. This is somewhat combated with available filters for albums and songs, but that doesn't help when it comes to WAV files who don't have that info saved in the files. Oh yeah, you also need a arbritary additional login inside of the game for your scores to be uploaded, which is just odd.\n\nI don't think the music gimmick was handled very well either, and I never felt like the music I picked had much to do with how the levels turned out. Seemed to be the same enemies and same lightshow no matter what I picked, and I wish they would have done more to make it feel like the music matters.\n\nAll in all, a mediocre game that I don't know why it exist in a world that already has Beat Hazard, a much better shoot-em-up spaceship game that uses the music gimmick to much better effect. It's ok if you like the genre and see it on a 70% sale, but it's not worth the current asking price IMO.","May 29, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some things that make Symphony stand out.\n\nAt first launch of the game, an "unknown entity" has seized control of your music, and you must liberate your library by defeating 5 bosses. Not only does this game have an arcadey feel like AudioSruf and Beathazard do, but it also incorperates a story, which I think is really cool.\n\nWhen you play a round of one of your songs, you will die, however the song won't end and you'll be able to continue to the end of it (but your score will take a hit). After completing a new song you'll unlock a new weapon, and if you have enough Kudos and Insperation (earned by completing more songs), you can buy it and be able to equip it on your ship. So having a large music library is an advantage. Your ship can hold 4 weapons in any configuration you desire. You can even change the angle these weapons can fire, and the firing mode (fully automatic, semi-automatic, manually etc.), so there is a TON of varation to be experimented with.\n\nThis game supports all the formats you need (.MP3, OGG, FLAC, .WAV, and .AIFF are officially supported). Symphony will not play any song that is less than 1:30 minutes long, but there is no maximum cap.\n\nI love AudioSruf and Beathazard, but IMO this game has a lot more going for it, and I highly recommened it.\n\nFor Linux players, this is a good working port.

The music recognition system varies up the gameplay a lot - slow and calm songs will make enemies appear in an orderly fashion, fast and complex songs will make enemies appear quickly from all around, putting your hand-eye coordination to the test. The music recognition isn't perfect, but does its job - the gameplay gets more frantic with higher tempo, special enemies appear at fitting moments, and the subwoofer weapon fires stronger the louder a song's bass line is. You can play any song at any difficulty level, unlocking higher difficulty levels over time. This way, the game is easy the first time you pick it up, but can turn into a bullet hell shooter by the end. Plus, it has that "just one more level" effect that makes it addictive - you want to find out how this song is gonna look like, what item that song will get you, etc.\nThe graphics of the game aren't technologically mind-blowing, but look gorgeous and sparkling with colors.\nThe music, of course, is the best there is - your own ;). The few tracks that are included are nothing special and you'll need to add more to unlock more and better weapons.\nPersonally, I sometimes think of this game as an advanced music visualizer, not only displaying pretty shapes, but also allowing you to interact with music. I think of it less as a shooting challenge, and more as a fun way to listen to music.","February 28, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some things that make Symphony stand out.\n\nAt first launch of the game, an "unknown entity" has seized control of your music, and you must liberate your library by defeating 5 bosses. Not only does this game have an arcadey feel like AudioSruf and Beathazard do, but it also incorperates a story, which I think is really cool.\n\nWhen you play a round of one of your songs, you will die, however the song won't end and you'll be able to continue to the end of it (but your score will take a hit). After completing a new song you'll unlock a new weapon, and if you have enough Kudos and Insperation (earned by completing more songs), you can buy it and be able to equip it on your ship. So having a large music library is an advantage. Your ship can hold 4 weapons in any configuration you desire. You can even change the angle these weapons can fire, and the firing mode (fully automatic, semi-automatic, manually etc.), so there is a TON of varation to be experimented with.\n\nThis game supports all the formats you need (.MP3, OGG, FLAC, .WAV, and .AIFF are officially supported). Symphony will not play any song that is less than 1:30 minutes long, but there is no maximum cap.\n\nI love AudioSruf and Beathazard, but IMO this game has a lot more going for it, and I highly recommened it.\n\nFor Linux players, this is a good working port.

You can customize your spaceship with up to 4 weapons, which can be automated and oriented in different directions. Nothing very new for now,\n\nThe originality is somewhere else: the music makes the level. Before starting a level, you have to choose a music in the list: the rhythm and the length of the music will be the main parameters of the level you will play, in addition to the chosen difficulty. The enemies will appear according to the rhythm of the music (typically, there will be more enemies or they will be faster during the chorus). The length of the level will be the one of the song. The music also define the objectives of the level (different amount of points, rewarded by some medals).\n\nThe best of this concept : you can synchronise your musical files, like your favorite playlist for example, which makes the game more interesting. Indeed, you know your songs, you like them, you know when the best part will come, the funniest moments when all the enemies will appear : you experience differently the game and your song at the same time, and this is awesome. The more levels and objectives you achieve, the more weapons and improvements you will have, allowing to put up the difficulty.\n\nSymphony is a pretty easy game, fun, quick to play, perfect to relax.","July 12, 2015","true","36.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It runs smooth on even the oldest of toasters. Most importantly, like other games in its genre offers the potential for seemingly endless replay value by being able to generate new levels based on data analysis from songs you provide. Seems like a pretty good deal, right?\n\nWell, it could have been. A fundamental problem this game has is the levels it generates are not so great. One the mechanics this game has is that it will speed up the flow of enemies as the song intensifies, and slow down as the song resumes normal tempo. The accuracy of this process can be really hit or miss, which can make some songs frustratingly difficult or simply unfun to play through. Sometimes this mainfests itself as a floundering between mid and high intensities when the tempo isn't changing at random intervals, and on slower songs the sensitivity seems to go up and you end up with random spurts of intensity change for seemingly no reason. Enemies often pop in at random off-beat unless you are playing a song with an extremely pronounced beat, but there is often still some fuzz that seems to account for the time it takes the enemies to pile up at the edges of the map.\n\nThis seems to go hand-in-hand with the spawning of the mid-boss enemies that appear throughout the songs. I'm not against the concept of having them in the game since it makes you apply some strategy to survive the song with them around. What does irk me is they often appear at random which throws off the rhythm of killing other things on the map.\n\nBut then, of course, there is the actual boss fights. Nothing is more frustrating than dealing with one of the "demons." They spawn at random after you have made a fair amount of progress into a song, and disrupt both the flow of the course you were running, and also make it impossible to get a high score for that run. I think I would have preferred if they had dedicated or marked tracks that become available after a set amount of runs between demons so you could both ready yourself and play other songs without being disrupted.\n\nOn top of all of those things, your only real sense of fulfillment is the high score bulletin board. However, since nobody seems to actively play or submit scores there, you could spend the entire time you play the game on and off for years and nobody might ever see or challenge your score. Even on popular songs! That kinda blows, but it also gives you a good idea of just how many people stick around to play this game long term.\n\nI could also go into the vague story they tried to bolt on as a form of plot advancement and to make it not seem so grindy, but it feels very forced and that is reflected on the erratic behavior of how demons are fit into the game (see above).\n\nI'd say if you're trying to get into beat games like this for the first time, consider another game like Audiosurf or Beat Hazard. If you have those and just want to experience something akin to Galaga on acid, then this might be a better fit for you. If I could rate this game as "meh" I would, but otherwise I don't think I would recommend this game to anyone.","August 22, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In other words, not too easy, not too hard, not too broken, and not too groundbreaking.\n\nHowever, the only aspect of the game I expected Symphony to be unique for failed to be so. Whichever music I used, the gameplay felt exactly the same. I could not tell if there were any differences when I switch songs, even if that was from sub-100 bpm oldies to a 200+bpm techno. If there were any differences at all, it was way too subtle for me to notice.\n\nAlso, if your song data contains non-Latin characters, you'll be reading a lot of square boxes as non-Latin characters are not supported. So, for all you weaboos who insist on using native characters for song titles and file names, forget playing this game with your anime music.","September 7, 2015","false","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are several difficulty levels which help keep the game from becoming frustrating but the game's story kept me wanting to complete it for no other reason than so that I would not be pestered by the game's random boss fights. The game's goofy story is really more of an encumbrance to this game but it is still quite fun to play in between times. It would be more fun if one could change the game's somber, sad menu music (ironic for a game based on your music files) but the game's neon-saturated graphics are beautiful and impressive and the game runs well with no major bugs and few minor ones.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulia/recommended/207750/","soulia","Full Retard Onii-chan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulia/","124 products in account","I really wanted to like Symphony just like I do all my other beat matching games, but it doesn't make the grade for me.\n\nSymphony is a beautiful game, for what it is. It runs smooth on even the oldest of toasters. Most importantly, like other games in its genre offers the potential for seemingly endless replay value by being able to generate new levels based on data analysis from songs you provide. Seems like a pretty good deal, right?\n\nWell, it could have been. A fundamental problem this game has is the levels it generates are not so great. One the mechanics this game has is that it will speed up the flow of enemies as the song intensifies, and slow down as the song resumes normal tempo. The accuracy of this process can be really hit or miss, which can make some songs frustratingly difficult or simply unfun to play through. Sometimes this mainfests itself as a floundering between mid and high intensities when the tempo isn't changing at random intervals, and on slower songs the sensitivity seems to go up and you end up with random spurts of intensity change for seemingly no reason. Enemies often pop in at random off-beat unless you are playing a song with an extremely pronounced beat, but there is often still some fuzz that seems to account for the time it takes the enemies to pile up at the edges of the map.\n\nThis seems to go hand-in-hand with the spawning of the mid-boss enemies that appear throughout the songs. I'm not against the concept of having them in the game since it makes you apply some strategy to survive the song with them around. What does irk me is they often appear at random which throws off the rhythm of killing other things on the map.\n\nBut then, of course, there is the actual boss fights. Nothing is more frustrating than dealing with one of the "demons." They spawn at random after you have made a fair amount of progress into a song, and disrupt both the flow of the course you were running, and also make it impossible to get a high score for that run. I think I would have preferred if they had dedicated or marked tracks that become available after a set amount of runs between demons so you could both ready yourself and play other songs without being disrupted.\n\nOn top of all of those things, your only real sense of fulfillment is the high score bulletin board. However, since nobody seems to actively play or submit scores there, you could spend the entire time you play the game on and off for years and nobody might ever see or challenge your score. Even on popular songs! That kinda blows, but it also gives you a good idea of just how many people stick around to play this game long term.\n\nI could also go into the vague story they tried to bolt on as a form of plot advancement and to make it not seem so grindy, but it feels very forced and that is reflected on the erratic behavior of how demons are fit into the game (see above).\n\nI'd say if you're trying to get into beat games like this for the first time, consider another game like Audiosurf or Beat Hazard. If you have those and just want to experience something akin to Galaga on acid, then this might be a better fit for you. If I could rate this game as "meh" I would, but otherwise I don't think I would recommend this game to anyone.","August 22, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The little "story" thing is there, and isn't great, but overall the gameplay is solid, basic bullet hell, and you can customize your "ship" or whatever the game wants to think it is to suit your playstyle.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game to play every now and then, and since the soundtrack is your own personal music library, you should like the music that you'll be hearing. However, unlike Audiosurf and BeatHazard, the speed of the music really doesn't seem to factor into the difficulty as much, and as such the game doesn't really feel as synched to your music as the other titles I mentioned.","August 9, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everytime I tell myself: "Just one more song." But then I am like: Oh this song is nice too, I want to play this one as well! This game is really hard to quit once you start it, since it's so much fun.\n\nNext to music, I also love bullet hell games, and this is kind of like those, so it's great. The harder levels are pretty intense, but that makes the challenge and mastering how to get better in such levels all the more fun, and when you just want to relaxedly play through your favourite songs, that's always an option too, and is very enjoyable as well to do. You will earn points at any rate to get upgrades for your ship, and unlock a new item for each new song you play regardless of the difficulty.\n\nThe visual are really nice too, it's kind of like fireworks, sparks and colors on a dark background, it looks really pleasing to the eye.

This game is a very decent game for all ages.  You are able to have the music on your computer used for the game, which is both a blessing and a curse.  The aggressiveness of the game depends on the music you choose to play with.  Nice slow classical music will not give you that much of a challenge, classic rock (CCR, Rolling Stones, Journey, etc..) will will pick things up a bit, Metal/Thrash (Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer, etc..) will have you question your choice of music and Death Metal (Cradle of Filth, Nile, Six Feet Under, etc..) will be very difficult.  The best music to play with (my opinion) would be Power Metal (Anubis Gate, HammerFall, ManOwaR, etc..).  Tempo changes alter the gameplay, so music that does that will give you a little rest between the faster/harder sections.\n\nAll in all, I find this game worthy to be in your library.","December 24, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
