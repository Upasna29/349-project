"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anovadea/recommended/293900/","Anovadea","Anovadea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anovadea/","849 products in account","To call this a marginally more forgiving Super Hexagon on Rails would be a useful lie.\n\nPivvot in Voyage mode is like a forgiving but insistant teacher. The Voyage is a set of phases, alternating between a training phase (composed of 4 new obstacles) and a random phase with 4 obstacles you've seen before. If you die on a phase, you respawn at the start of the phase, like the game's saying, "Ok, try again". This means that if you're in a training phase and don't know how to get past an obstace you're stuck until you learn how to get past it, or you get through thanks to pure dumb luck. However, each obstacle has its trick to get past it, and if you learn the tricks, the game is simply employing that trick in time.\n\nThe upshot of this is that you will finish a Voyage at least once if you stick with it.\n\nAs for other modes, they're a lot less forgiving. Endless simply throws obstacles at you until you die, but it throws them at you in the same order as the training phases in the voyage mode.\n\nBeserk lives up to its name, and is a real challenge. As is Looper.\n\nThe only downside is that there doesn't appear to be an option to quit out of a voyage. Yes, you can choose to return to the main menu, but if you haven't finished Voyage, choosing Voyage from the main menu will bring you back to the phase you're stuck on. As I'm trying to get through Expert without a death, I'd really like the option to restart the Voyage from scratch. As for newbies, the option would potentially be helpful as well, so that they can play through parts that they're comfortable in before they return to the difficult part. As it turns out, you can select the scary "Reset Voyage Progress" in the "Data Options" part of Settings, but it's a non-intuitive (and scary) place to go when you just want to restart the voyage from the start. Restarting a voyage when you've not completed the existing one should not be that scary.\n\nOverall, if you like twitch obstacle-dodging games, it's a really nice one with a nice on-rails twist. The only thing it lacks is a less involved way to reset voyage progress. 9.5/10","July 28, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a great soundtrack, graphics are cool and stylistic while keeping simplicity. Performance is obviously good since it is a 2D game. The gameplay can be quite challenging and rage inducing. Prepare to die a lot. It's a pretty good time killer though.

I just played the first part of the game, and I already feel it's worth the money, and not to mention time. Gameplay is simple (just move right and left), but cunningly difficult at the same time. There are a ton of obstacles, and the first mode introduces them to you in a really good fashion.\n\nAdd to the fact the game has a great audiovisual design. Backgrounds switch color well, and it just looks good on the eyes. Soundtrack is also quality stuff, alternating with the mood of the game.\n\nI've really just played for 15 mins or so yet, but consider that within this short period of time I can say with confidence Pivvot is a great game. Especially for twitch gamers and those who love hardcore stuff in general.

It feels like the game decides whether you make it or don't, and that really sucks the fun out of it.

The only funny thing is looper and I got bored of it because it gets also very monotonous. I thought there be a ton more different obstacles than just two dozen or so.\n"Don't mistake simplicity for a lack of challenge"? The challenge lies in the controls because every button push sends the circle flying a thousand miles an hour. Of course there's the option to decrease sensitivity. Too bad you need fast movements to get past some obstacles... If only it was possible to control with the real mouse, not the mouse buttons?!\n"Truly sadistic"? Indeed, after one hour I already have the feeling the song from the trailer comes straight from hell.\n"Tests your ability to make quick impulsive decisions"? There are only 30 or so obstacle types. Once you got them down, you're set. And they're even spaced far apart. So there really is no impulsive decision on a more dynamic board than I would have expected.Overall, I can see why some people really like the game, but I would not recommend it.

With this game possessing obstacles and game modes that demand twitchy reflexes, you can inevitably be so close to your goal, when suddenly you hit the wrong direction and ruin your great run. However, when you do reach your goal, your heart might just be racing in your chest from a surge of adrenaline and maybe nerves.\n\nWhile Pivvot might give these feelings to players, some might find that there is little to be had once you unlock and play all of the modes at least once. There are 8 modes, with the 2 voyage modes (Normal and Expert) suggested to be the main modes, displaying a sort of progession in difficulty as more obstacles are introduced in waves. It is a good progression, as you must successfully dodge each obstacle a set number of times before you continue, and are then incorporated into the regular waves.\n\nOutside of these two modes, there are endless modes for both voyages, just to see how long you can last, displaying the obstacles in order of how they appear, and also Random Endless modes, throwing obstacles at you as the game pleases. The further you get in these modes, the faster the speed gets as well, increasing difficulty as well. These modes do not really add all that much to the variety of the game, because once you understand the patterns for avoiding said obstacles, it simply becomes an endurance test.\n\nPivvot also contains 2 other modes, Berserk and Looper. Berserk is a crazy avoidance mode that is very fast at the start, and presents scattered obstacles around that require your best abilities to get through. I find that this mode may not be for everyone who gets this game, because players might not be able to get very far, possibly only a couple of seconds, causing frustration. Looper, on the other hand, is a rather fresh mode compared to the others, looking for how many rotations you can do before you get hit. All of the other modes focus on getting through obstacles to continue on the track, but Looper changes focus by having obstacles float by you, with nothing in your path on the actual track. The better you do at Looper, the higher the difficulty becomes, and the obstacles and points you get.\n\nOverall, this game is certainly enjoyable, but I give a very tentative recommendation. The music that this game has is rather cool and enjoyable, and allows for tension to ease a little bit, but this game is not for everyone, and it may not keep a player's for more than a couple minutes at a time, and should be played in short bursts due to the potential of feeling stressed because of the twitchy gameplay. I'm not sure if it is even worth the $5 price tag, as half of the modes are lackluster variations of the 2 voyage modes. If you seriously consider giving this shot, it would be good to wait for a sale, or possibly get lucky with acquiring a coupon.","September 13, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Voyage is where you're supposed to start (It's possible to start on Looper, however), and go from there. The first time I played, I had no idea what I was doing until I had died 3 times on the first obstacle, so there could use to be an in-game guide, though steam guides can typically cover a fair bit of what is needed.\n\nSo, without further ado, I guess I'll list the Pros and Cons of the game, along with a verdict...\nPROS:\n- Simple, yet (kinda) unique gameplay.\n- Easy to grasp, difficult to master.\n- More dependant on thinking how to get around an obstacle than fast reactions.\n- Decent Replayability\n- Low Price\n- Decent Soundtrack (The Berserk theme is pretty epic)\n- 4 Different gamemodes for people who enjoy different styles.\n\nCONS:\n- Berserk mode is just constantly moving back and forth - little strategy involved.\n- No in-game tutorial available.\n- Can be extremely frusturating at times (Anyone who watches youtube videos would consider this a pro, though)\n- Looper mode is boring.\n\nAll in all, I've enjoyed the time that I have played this game, and will probably continue to play it from time to time. But now that I have all of the achievements, and have had the game proclaim me as a "Pivvot God" (Yes, it did that, survive 2 minutes in Berserk mode), I will definitely not be playing it daily like I used to.","February 20, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's not much content to speak of, but there is a decent variety of game modes to check out. Every mode is centered around dodging obstacles and staying alive for as long as you can, but each of them have slightly different objectives.\n\nThe Voyage mode(s) focus on reaching the end of a series of increasingly difficult obstacles. There's checkpoints along the way, but you're encouraged to reach the end without dying once, which will net you 2 of the game's 8 achievements (if you can manage the daunting Expert Voyage without dying of frustration). The Endless modes task you with staying alive for as long as possible while random combinations of hurdles are thrown at you at breakneck speeds.\n\nThere's one other game mode here that wasn't included in the iOS version of this game, which is called 'Looper', which is all about making complete loops while dodging projectiles that spawn in at frighteningly high intervals. It's undeniably the most difficult mode in the game, but still very addicting nonetheless.\n\nIf you enjoyed Super Hexagon ( or arcade score-attack games in general), Pivvot is an essential purchase. It's incredibly compelling, and very hard to put down once you start playing. There's also local co-op, which is nice.","August 29, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
