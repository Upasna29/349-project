When I first saw this game on steam I thought that it would be a game in a similar vein to Illusion Software's titles, based around the neat-ish concept of Cindrella. I thought it was kind of cool something like this could actually show up on steam (on the front page), as it gives it a greater feel of legitimacy, and I couldn't resist the low price. I saw the R12 rating and done some research, obviously finding about the so called "R18" version of the game, I installed the unoffical patch immediately before playing. See Paragraph 4 for differences.\n\nI jumped into the game kind of expecting a different sort of experience to the one I got. I was expecting something light weight, and relaxing that didn't require a huge brain or time commitment and was perhaps mildy sexually stimulating. After Playing The First set of Dungeon's (basically the tutorial), It was clear it wasn't that, I expected some crazy over exaggerated japanese story to kick off (around the actually decent gameplay), with some explicit content in it.\n\nThe Game reminded me of Atlus' (excellent) Catherine for a bit, with the block puzzles and general themes. Sadly the similarities stop there. This game basically has no story content outside of the openining cutscene. After finishing the first set of Dungeons, I moved onto the second, only to be dissapointed. I only really went as far as I did due to nostalgia for how good that game was. The sad thing is the puzzles in this game are actually half competent. Someone has clearly put a bunch of work into making them, but the game needs some substance to hold it together, and it has none.\n\nThe Whole "R18", "Adult Game" thing is simply ridiculous, and truthfully a scam, as well as a marketing ploy. There is one file difference between the two verisons (file can be found via many steam community guides). And the fact they they are charging 3 times the price for that version is ludicrous. Even in the R18 verison the adult content is extremely light. I switched back to the R12 verison for tetsing purposes. The only additions in the R18 version are more sexy costumes to buy, the ability to remove her skirt (seriously no where near nude), Also a breast size slider (You can scale a polygon), and lastly the inclusion of Torture Traps. The last one is the most meaningful addition as it adds various traps you can interact with around the levels, which cause cindrella pain, They are generally very simple animations, definitely nothing to get *excited* over. I am not a fan of censorship, but this is hardly even that. The traps feel like they were part of the original game, the rest feels stupid and tacked on. There is no real reason why the R18 verison of the game couldn't have be put on steam, other than the fact it was being marketed as a game for adults, and probably so the developers could trick you into paying for their version.\n\nThe Gameplay itself is sadly ok. Nothing special but with an ok story and/or adult content elements (actually just and, there would really be no point in a remove all clothes button) this could be ok. It is a little buggy, jumping and movement could be a lot tighter, but it is sort of fun and somewhat challenging. If there was any reward for grinding through these levels at all (even if it was just a borderline bad story), then it might actually be worth completeing. And for some people it might still be worth completing. It is not a bad game by any means.\n\nThe final verdict is this game lacks substance in almost everyway. There is no story, it has slightly buggy gameplay, and the whole "censored" thing is stupid. This game is very middle of the road, but regardless an interesting addition to my steam library and not a purchase I regret (Priced any higher I would have felt ripped off, but then I probably wouldn't have bought it). It's just a real shame the developer decided it wanted to market this game to pervets instead of gamers, with just a little susbstance, I would actaully go as far to say it's alright.\n\nReccomended Yes or No is hard, I am going to say not reccomended, simply due to scam that is the R18 version which I did not pay for.\nOverall 5/10.","November 19, 2015","false","2.5"," 198 of 232 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","198","232","10","2"

For a puzzle game it's a neat concept and plays out well, if you can ignore the fact there is no solid credible story in the middle. You basically launch the game, get put deep in the story from start and then grind your way through puzzles until you reach the ending. Then the story ties up.\n\nSeveral questions I have seen so far on the community hub are questions such as: "Is there nekkidness, does she strip? and does she-". Let's just put it this way, the bondage from this game has been removed but you still see her jigglyness. In the other version you can control her bust size and remove her skirt to get her into a more skimpy dress. Well with changing her into a more skimpy dress you can do it in this version too, you have to accumulate money from completing levels which in turn gives you XP and Money. (The level means you get more HP meaning you can survive more traps in the puzzles). I personally really did enjoy the 'eye candy' and it helped me complete the game har-har.\n\nPushing all the fantasy stuff aside, the game requires you to make it through each levels of the castle and make it to the door to move onto the next level. I found the game to be a very fun and challenging experience, especially when getting to higher levels - Although some levels could be 'cheesed' by standing next to the block of the door to escape. There are around 20 levels I believe from memory and it took me 4 hours to complete the game start to finish. Please do check the video out though as I have difficulties explaining a lot of things.\n\nThe only negatives I found is after a while the dungeon still uses the same textures and layouts meaning the areas can look a bit bland.\n\nIt took me 4 hours to complete the game - some levels at the end getting more challenging. Some levels you can kind of 'cheat' though.\n\nI would recommend this to most people wanting an enjoyable puzzle game for a very fair price. I would also recommend it to people who enjoy jiggly things. XD\n\nI would avoid this game if you get easily frustrated or just want pure porn only.\nI hope you appreciate this review and if there is anything I need to add or any questions, feel free to ask :) Thank you!","November 16, 2015","true","3.7"," 144 of 229 people (63%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","63","144","229","22","5"

So, I'll simply leave a positive and let you decide from reviews.\n\n------\n\nThis isn't your average Cinderella story. There really isn't much of a story itself for this game. Which I guess is because this game was originally an H-game. The removal of some of that material I belive didn't effect the game at all. So, if you aren't interested in that type of thing then this is the version for you. If you like those type of things I'd advise buying the R18 addition and forget about the Steam version unless you want to further support the devoloper and want Steam achievements. Despite all the hate on this game there is no nudity and honestly not dirty content at all.\n\nNow I previously talked about the story for this game. Its short. Its simple. Its sweet. Yes, I really do wish there was more of a story in this game. Reguardless, I still liked it. Puzzles are also fairly simple and aren't all that hard to complete. You can pretty much finish the game in 3-4 hours unless you want to grind some money for the few outfits this game offers.\n\nPros:\nSilly game overall.\nI actually liked the Soundtrack.\nDifferent art style.\nAchievements.\n\n\nCons:\nVery short story.\nCamera Controls.\nJumping seemed wonky. (Or it could have just been me)\n\n\n------\n\nI notice theres been a lot of hate going on around in the reviews due to the nature this game originally came from. If I see any rude comments I will delete them. I would rather see contructive feedback and questions.","November 17, 2015","true","4.1"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","40","56","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaptorCore7/recommended/408000/","RaptorCore7","Lysis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaptorCore7/","85 products in account","Fantastically quirky short puzzle game. I haven't completed it yet, but I've been longing to play the game since played the demo a few days before the release date.\nThe game is simplistic, I will not deny that. I also won't deny there are some rather janky mechanics due to the Unity engine allowing you to have a 'cheap' and unintended solution to a level. There is also some jank in the hitboxes of the swinging axes which can be pretty frustrating if you're not thinking and just going by appearance. The levels are rather open ended, so you can solve them multiple different ways.\nAs many have said before, the game and its story are pretty short, but is novel and unexpected compared to the look of the game. The levels for the most part look the same and you'll probably end up well accustomed to the textures of walls and blocks, and the model of Cinderella herself (which looks alright in my opinion)\nThere are a couple of customisation options in this version, not as many as the R-18 version you can purchase, but honestly, for such a game I wouldn't really worry too much about not having a skirt disable feature or jiggle physics slider- if this is something that you can't live without then I guess you should get the R-18 one, but this is basically the same game.\nSo the game is what it is. For a £3-4 game, you can't really say you're not getting what you're paying for. The game works, and works well enough to be an enjoyable experience for anyone who isn't frustrated at puzzle games yet and wishes to sit there pondering the  next course of action!","November 16, 2015","true","3.6"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","31","43","2","1"

Don't let the name fool you: You wouldn't want to gift this game to your 7 year old cousin.\n\nGameplay:You control Cinderella who tries to escape a dungeon she'd been thrown to. Along the way you can save your two mean sisters and a stepmother, or you can leave them to rot and possibly die of starvation.  They were mean to you, okay?  They deserve it.   Most stages have multiple ways to get to the goal.\nYou can push blocks, jump over them or even destroy them with your Falcon Kick, though you have limited jumps and kicks per level.You can expand you limit by earning experience (that you earn by completing levels) and leveling up.\n\nGraphics: Simple and neat. Not much to say about them since you're pushing the same blocks in the same dungeon over and over again, but I found them nice to look at, for what they are.\n\nSound: Again, I don't have much to say. The only sounds you will hear are the same music that plays in all stages, moanings of Cinderella when she loses health or kicks blocks, and her footsteps. Music sounds kind of sinister and is very fitting to a dungeon. Even though it plays on loop, my fluffy ears are still in one piece. Cinderella's grunts of pain are your typical japanese  "Ouch! I broke my fingernail"  grunts, and her footsteps sound like... well, normal footsteps.\nI'm kinda dragging the subject here, let's move on...\n\nControls: You use WASD to control Cinderella, Space to jump, LMB to kick, RMB to pan the camera, Mouse Wheel to zoom in/out. It works. You can zoom out to plan your moves, and zoom in to pass the platforming moments.\n\nConclusion:If you're a big fan of puzzle games and you're looking for a challenge, don't buy this game. If you're looking for a way to stress out after a long day, then give it a shot. I finished the whole game in 2.3 hrs so don't expect a 100 hours long epic adventure though.","November 23, 2015","true","2.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","0"

You get to be a princess and solve puzzels and stuff (just puzzels. Not much stuff). But the game is simple, and simple is good. You're a princes being held captive by an evil king, and rather than playing the character of a knight who goes to rescue her, you play as the princess trying to escape.\n\nYes. The puzzels are fun, but I think the brilliance behind this game isn't so much in the gameplay, but in the concept and story. In this game, Cinderella is a sweet princess who is horribly treated, and on top of that, has the worst luck when she gets thrown in a dungeon for seeing something she shouldn't have. They make you feel very sorry for her. And I think what's great about the fact that you control her character, rather than playing as a hero trying to save her, is that you really feel like you are helping her escape. Like she has literally no friends in the world, no heros, no allies, but you. It doesn't feel like your playing as her, and that you as a player are the important one, but it feels like you are helping this character escape her horrible life. You, as a player, are the one force in the world who can bring justice to this cruel world the princess inhabits\n\nSure, there could possibly be some far better puzzel games out there where you play as a dot trying to get passed cubes. But I don't care to see a dot succeed. I must help the princess escape! I'm her only hope!\n\nMost likely none of this crosses your mind when you play the game, but I believe everyone feels it in the back of their minds. I know this was very in depth for a simple puzzel game, but I believe it's all true, and just want to give credit where credit is due. So please buy this game.

The puzzle are decently challenging, and the use of a limit resource system for jumps and hits keeps the element of strategy in place. The consistency is a bit weird though, with the over dramatic censors and that one 2D sprite for the godmother while everyone else is their 3D Model.\n\nThe game could definitely use a bit of graphic face lifting and some changes to movement controls, as it feels things can fall out of place quite easily.\n\nThis game is relatively cheap and a decently fun puzzle game. There's also jiggly anime ♥♥♥♥ and booty in it, which gives it 2 of the final 3.5 stars.","November 21, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You push around blocks and break blocks to get through to the door.  There are swinging axes and shooting discs which will hurt.  That's everything.  For the most part it's easy, but the puzzles get a little unclear for some levels.  A great thing is there appears to be more than one way to solve a good number of these levels.  The R18 version has miscellaneous torture obstacles around which are easy to avoid if you know they're there, and easy to escape, but it does drain your health gradually.\n\nOver all, nothing is too challenging platforming wise, except for a few sections where axes swing with the path your traveling.\n\nStory: It's a nice story that really made me think.  There's two different endings, and the true ending makes a statement, if you're into that.  It's like old games where there's not that much story, but it's a really small game so I felt it fit.\n\nThe downsides.  It's not cute.  This is a game for sadists.  It's got bondage, abuse, and molestation throughout.  More so in the R18 version.\n\nIt's an easy achievement game though, so there's that.","January 5","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

R12 is a puzzle game starring Cinderella herself!  Through a series of unfortunate events, Cinderella finds herself prisoner, and must escape many dungeons, as well as free other prisoners, though the later objective is optional.  The story is very basic, and you're almost immediately thrust into the gameplay from the get go.  The goal of the game is to make your way out of each dungeon by finding a door.  While this would be simple, your task is made much harder due to the fact that you are limited to a certain number of jumps and kicks.  You can move blocks, to jump to places you need to go, or kick and destroy them if they're hindering your progress.  The earlier levels can be completed rather quickly, but the farther you make your way through the game, it becomes surprisingly difficult.  That said, I'm sure some people will be able to solve these puzzles more quickly than others, as there seem to be multiple ways to do so, and some will make you slap your forehead for not thinking of the answer sooner.  Also, while the environmental graphics are very basic, almost subpar, the character designs  look good.  Nothing to write home about, but I liked the artistic style, which kind of reminded me of RWBY.  At the end of the day, this is a somewhat challenging puzzle game with a almost non existent story that you'll spend 1 - 5 hours on depending on your skill level, but it's still an ok game.  Do I recommend it?  If you can pick it up for a couple of dollars, why not?  Oh but word to the wise, if you are using a game controller (ps4 controller in my case), you may experience out of control camera spinning when you first start the game.  To solve this problem, simply disconnect your controller, and use the keyboard!","January 9","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bioarmored/recommended/408000/","bioarmored","Ecchi Gotei Heka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bioarmored/","109 products in account","This game is a puzzle-based game with a tinge of eroge, well more on the bondage and torture part. However, due to Steam regulations, the one here is the R12 version, not the R18. There's not much difference between the two, except the R18 have the secret chamber, where you can torture Cinderella for your viewing pleasure (and I DO mean pleasure), and additional costumes.\n\nGameplay wise, its a basic puzzle solving game. Move blocks here and there to create a pathway to reach your goal. At certain points (end of sub-level), you will get a bonus objective of rescuing your step-relatives from being tortured, but the catch is that you will be tortured in their place. Don't worry, you can escape from it. You can change the camera angle and view perspective to see where is the goal of the map. This is really much needed, as sometimes it may be obscured by obstacle.\n\nAs for the difficulty, its pretty inconsistent. Some maps are pretty straight forward, while some require some retries to solve it. However, I cannot help but being shocked about a certain map, where all you need to do to reach a goal is a curve jump. Yes, you heard me correctly, a curve jump. No block moving, no obstacle dodging, no block demolishing, nothing else. Just a curve jump. It's a fast way for grinding money though. There was that one map though, where you actually need to get hit by the obstacle to reach the secondary objective. That was pretty interesting to me.\n\nEverytime you solve a map, you will get money and experience. The higher level you are, the more chances you are provided with jumping and kicking. They are not limited, they are finite, and once you run out of them, poor Cinderella can't even jump at all, or even kick. Kind of a hinderance, but at the same time its a challenge to use them wisely. You can spend money on just costumes. So poor Cinderella can be dressed as a gothic dominatrix, bunny girl, Santa girl etc. Nothing much here but fanservice .\n\nSince it's an eroge game, there are a lot of boob juggling physics and pantsu shots, since camera angle can be changed, as they are required to solve a map. Upskirts will be pretty common, heck sometimes I do that for fun. The biggest perk of this game is that, it's really cheap. It cost as much as a cheap lunch. It's not a very pricey game.\n\nOverall, a short and cheap puzzle game which can be solved in a matter of hours. If you want some fun doing puzzles (and enjoy the T & A at the same time), go ahead, give this game a shot, since it's really cheap, there's nothing much to lose. Mind you this is the censored version. For the uncensored one, please check the Steam community forums for this game.","December 27, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the low price, you're paying for...Maybe two or three hours of puzzles, with some eye candy. The story is sparse, the puzzles range from absurdly easy to mildly challenging, and hey, if you're into damsels in bondage...Well, there ya go. Easy to patch in the R18 version, though don't expect hardcore pornography, you're only getting a few extra costumes and minor suggestive content. The end might be a letdown, depending on your actions. In the end, if you're going to get it, don't get it if you're here for "Teh Bewbz and S3X", because you'll be disappointed.

Not the game that I've seen floating around Steam somewhere, the Tommy Wiseau film. How The Room is so bad it's good? That's this game. I eagerly bought this game after seeing it in a Youtube video. My thoughts after the video was that this game seems so bad it's enjoyable. I was completely right.\n\nOh my god, where do I start to describe this? The first thing I should mention is that if there are any clearly much better games you have been thinking about getting, get them first. This is a game that you should only get if your library is already pretty much full with every game you want. If you're kind of bored of your 10,000th hour of Fallout 4 and don't mind spending five bucks on some stupid thing for a few hours, if just to wallow in it's campiness.\n\nOne of the first things you notice in the gameplay is the absolutely ridiculous jiggle physics. They're like Jell-o. Her ♥♥♥♥ bounce wildly at the slightest movement. It's too ludicrous to be sexy, but that's what makes it hilarious. Also, when EVERY female character (all four or five of them, but there's maybe seven characters total) dresses in ridiculously revealing outfits with the same jiggle physics, that just adds to the humor factor.\n\nThe story, I can infer was originally in Japanese then translated into English, has good 'ol Engrish. It's dumb and you've probably seen plenty of examples of Engrish already, it's always good for a cheap, unintentional laugh. The story, from what I could piece together, fit the engrish pretty well in the fact that it's bad but unintentionally funny, too. The best way I could describe it is that it's like a bad creepypasta.\n\nThe gameplay, I can't tell if it's genius or lazy. One thing I noticed was that I would often get distracted by fairly large areas of the level, that turned out to be completely useless. Sometimes this seems to be the result of lazy copy/pasting, sometimes this seems intentional. There's a level where it looks like you're supposed to use blocks to fill in gaps to allow a tall pillar to be pushed around the square bit in the center, but you're actually just supposed to move it in the hole a little to the right. It's the opposite approach of Portal, where very little serves no purpose. When I figured out that puzzle, I felt a similar level of satisfaction as when I solved Portal's puzzles for the first time. Then there's late-game puzzles where you can solve the puzzle by falling into the door. Things like that make me feel like the earlier puzzles were a case of accidental genius.\n\nIf you've been wondering about the R12 part of the title, it's a rating. It means for people 12 years or older. Basically the T rating we use in The United States. There is an R18 version you can easily find with a Google search. The only differences are that there are bondage versions of some outfits and a room filled with fetish-y torture devices and knights in armor that awkwardly dry hump you in a few positions. Don't bother unless you're morbidly curious.\n\nTL:DR Get it if you like the film The Room and have nothing more interesting in the Steam store to play. Prepare to have a good time laughing and cringing at it.","January 29","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bioarmored/recommended/408000/","bioarmored","Ecchi Gotei Heka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bioarmored/","109 products in account","This game is a puzzle-based game with a tinge of eroge, well more on the bondage and torture part. However, due to Steam regulations, the one here is the R12 version, not the R18. There's not much difference between the two, except the R18 have the secret chamber, where you can torture Cinderella for your viewing pleasure (and I DO mean pleasure), and additional costumes.\n\nGameplay wise, its a basic puzzle solving game. Move blocks here and there to create a pathway to reach your goal. At certain points (end of sub-level), you will get a bonus objective of rescuing your step-relatives from being tortured, but the catch is that you will be tortured in their place. Don't worry, you can escape from it. You can change the camera angle and view perspective to see where is the goal of the map. This is really much needed, as sometimes it may be obscured by obstacle.\n\nAs for the difficulty, its pretty inconsistent. Some maps are pretty straight forward, while some require some retries to solve it. However, I cannot help but being shocked about a certain map, where all you need to do to reach a goal is a curve jump. Yes, you heard me correctly, a curve jump. No block moving, no obstacle dodging, no block demolishing, nothing else. Just a curve jump. It's a fast way for grinding money though. There was that one map though, where you actually need to get hit by the obstacle to reach the secondary objective. That was pretty interesting to me.\n\nEverytime you solve a map, you will get money and experience. The higher level you are, the more chances you are provided with jumping and kicking. They are not limited, they are finite, and once you run out of them, poor Cinderella can't even jump at all, or even kick. Kind of a hinderance, but at the same time its a challenge to use them wisely. You can spend money on just costumes. So poor Cinderella can be dressed as a gothic dominatrix, bunny girl, Santa girl etc. Nothing much here but fanservice .\n\nSince it's an eroge game, there are a lot of boob juggling physics and pantsu shots, since camera angle can be changed, as they are required to solve a map. Upskirts will be pretty common, heck sometimes I do that for fun. The biggest perk of this game is that, it's really cheap. It cost as much as a cheap lunch. It's not a very pricey game.\n\nOverall, a short and cheap puzzle game which can be solved in a matter of hours. If you want some fun doing puzzles (and enjoy the T & A at the same time), go ahead, give this game a shot, since it's really cheap, there's nothing much to lose. Mind you this is the censored version. For the uncensored one, please check the Steam community forums for this game.","December 27, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

R12 is a clever, kinky and interesting twist on the Cinderella storybook. Her Prince Charming is not as charming as you might think!  Cinderella must climb, kick, push, pull and intelligently make use of her limited resources to complete each puzzling conundrum within the prince's dungeon.\n\nStory:\nOnce upon a time, there was a girl named Cinderella. She was very beautiful and she was kind to all.\nHowever, her stepmother didn't like her one little bit and treated her as a slave.\n\nOne day a letter with an invitation arrived. The letter explained that a ball was to be held at the palace and the Prince would choose a girl to become his wife.\n\nShe made every effort to get rid of all troubles to go to the ball.\n\nShe was on her way to the ball, when she witnessed the Prince killing his father, the King, in order to usurp the throne.\nThe Prince quickly claimed that Cinderella had killed the King andCinderella was arrested and locked in the deepest, darkest part of the dungeon...\nCan she escape from the dungeon?\nWill Cinderella have a happy ending?\nOnly by solving and navigating the dungeons deadly traps with help from her fairy god mother, will she ever see the light of day again...\n\n\nGameplay:\nCinderella Escape! is a 3D Action Puzzle Game.\nEach puzzle requires use of the 3 main actions to solve the Puzzle and reach the exit.\n\nCinderella Escape makes good use of RPG elements such as the level up system to allow for the player to increase the amount of jumps and kicks required to complete the dungeon floor.\n\nGold can be earned in different stages of the game and used to purchase kinky costumes and extra content in a similar way to Blade Kitten.\n\nThe puzzles vary from easy to mindbendingly hard while still being fair and completable in your first run through the stage. The game made me think twice before solving it, as one wrong move could send poor Cinderella into a pit of spikes...\n\nThe R18+ Patch, which is not available on steam only adds some removed kinky content, but it is not required at all to enjoy the game.  In fact, I'd recommend not installing the R18 patch, as it doesnt add anything beyond asthetic changes.\n\n\nArt style and models:\nThe art is in an anime-esque style that is well done and is reasonably suited to a game like this.\nThe main character is beautifully colored, animated, textured and has a hand drawn look.\nThe cutscenes are well animated with very few major problems across the board.\n\nThe only complaint I've got with the game is that the translation is not as gorgeous as the art that accompanies it.\nThe script is full of translation errors and some characters feel like their speech isnt as fluid as other anime based games.\n\n\nConclusion:\nCinderella Escape! R12 is an entertaining game full of kinky looking fairytale figures, a twist on the original story and unique puzzle concepts.\n\nDespite being nowhere near the end, I'd imagine this fairytale does not have a happy ending...\nBut thats what appeals about these fairytale games, sometimes, things are not what they seem.\n\nI'd highly recommend this version to anyone who does not mind a little bit of kinky imagery and a few translation issues.\nAll up this is a interesting game that is made better by its most recent controller patch.\n\nScore:\n10/10","December 27, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I figured that it wasn't your typical point and click escape game, which it isn't. The major difference between this and most escape games (besides the obvious S&M theme) is that this is more of a puzzler game.\n\nYou move about in real-time in stages that are grouped to similar builds and have to first find the exit of each stage and then figure out how to get there. There can be multiple ways of accomplishing stages if you are clever.\n\nThe character also has a linear level progression giving you more amounts of jumps (to elevate or cross) and kicks (to destroy blocks) that you can do as well as building HP to take damage from traps.\n\nI'm pretty neutral about this game. It took me a little over 3 hours to get through. Ultimately I gave a thumbs up for the bewbs.","February 10","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
