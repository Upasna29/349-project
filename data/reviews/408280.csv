Quality artwork.  Great story.  It's short but what a journey.\n\nThis is a point-n-click style game.  A few puzzles, not very many and not very difficult.  And a few "battles" as well.  Awesome graphics.  There are voices but it is a nonesense language just for background effect, but it does portray the emotional state of the characters well.  (Reminds me of an exercise in drama school where we had to do a scene and the only words we could say were "Mary had a little lamb".  IT's amazing how much you can portray by voice inflection and stuff like that)\n\nYou help the main character become a reluctant hero.  He just wants to sleep instead of doing his job.  You have to literally drag  him with the mouse to the edge of the screen in order for him to move on.  He complains all the way through the game.  He has to deliver a message scroll to a hero in order to save the land from impending destruction.  Along the way he meets other characters that become involved in the story.   I won't spoil anything for you, but there is a neat thing they do in the game after you reach the "end" of the story they do a flashback and show what happened earlier but from another character's point of view.  It gives a different twist to the story.  Very nice storytelling.\n\nOne of the main puzzles is to create a path across a chasm by choosing small pieces that will fit together.  Then there are the battles.  You have to battle by choosing from a few options, like damage opponent or heal or defend, but they are not written that way.  They have phrases that are specific to the characters.   There are some battles where you have to do more strategy that just attack and defend.  There's also an option to increase attack or increase health.  So spend some time alternating between those and healing and then once your attack is high enough you can go for the kill.  Though you don't actually "kill" anyone.  It's more like you defeat them, they give in to your demand.\n\nThere's lots of humor in this story.  Sometimes it even breaks the fourth wall and talks to you, the player.  I love that kind of stuff.  Oh, and the game is kid-friendly.  I dont' think there's anything that will offend anyone.  It's really a game for all ages.  It's not neccesarily aimed at kids but it's not aimed at adults only.\n\nGraphics are cute, charming, kind of like stained glass or woodcuts or mosaics artwork.\n\nTotal playtime: about an hour or so.  There are a few hidden things if you want all the achievements, so you might have to replay some sections.\n\ntl;dr version:\n\ngreat story\ngreat art\npoint-n-click gameplay\nsome puzzles (easy to medium)\nvoices but not in a real language (like the schoolteacher in the old Charlie Brown and Snoopy movies)\n1 hour playtime","November 2, 2015","true","3.4"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","43","46","2","2"

Wait that's not entirely right. Message Quest is a game where you laugh at while helping the ridiculous characters in the game and solve puzzles in order to eventually fight the Big Bad namely laziness and fear!\n\nThis game has cute art and funny little characters. It combines several different types of tasks, from jigsaw puzzling & wave forming, mock RPG fights, to tetrising. Explore this world while helping characters achieve their true potential. Just beware, because not all may be as it seems.\n\nSound: Quite funny, but appropriate. The music is rather soothing, and the voice acting is ridiculous... but funny.\n\nGraphics: Everything is made to look like stained glass, which is an interesting route for a game to take. Quite different and cute, the art is nicely done. Very unique in this case.\n\nStory: Quite ridiculous. Actually made me laugh out loud a few times while playing. The characters have such weird motivations and interactions, but they tend to be amusing though they are ridiculous.\n\nOverall: 7/10 - For an hour of fun, try to get a copy of this, it's definitely worth playing at least once. The price tag isn't too bad for what it is and you'll likely get a good laugh out of the game at least once. It was in a few Greenlight bundles and if it ever comes up in a new one, snag it.

For some reason, so called 'gamers' are the same.  If it's not 'epic' and open world it's not worth playing.  Don't get me wrong, I love open world games as the 800+ hours on skyrim (and even more on PS verson) will tell you, but I appreciate all games.  They just have to be good for what they are.  This is a game for anyone who is a true gamer.\nIt is a very short game.  I had to play it twice just to get the card drops.  So why would I recommend it?  Put simply, for what it is it is brilliant.\nThe artwork fits the game like a glove.  The story, albeit short, is captivating with enough humor sprinkled in to make you chuckle.  The music fits as well.  Enough puzzles to keep it from being a visual novel, but nothing taxing on the brain.  (If you want hard puzzles play The Talos Principle Road to Gehenna and get all the stars and silver sigils.)\nBut most of all, it was 90 minutes (one playthrough) with a smile on my face,  I just simply enjoyed it.  Most games I play, even though I enjoy, I know that it is a one and done.  Glad I played it, but I'll move on.  This game will be put in the scapbook as I will definitely replay it from time to time just to put that 90 minute smile on my face (especially as a break from playing dark souls and setting a record for seeing the words 'You have died' pop up).\nIf you are like me, and appreciate well crafted games that are pure enjoyment, DO NOT PASS UP ON THIS GAME!  I can't wait to see what the devs do next.\nCheers!\n\n","October 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The art design, the writing and the music is just great. The combat is something I have never experienced before. And to be honest, for the ridiculously low price of £1.99, I think this may just be the best game I have ever bought/played for that price (at full price). The length of the game is around 90 mins long, but as with many other games, the short length is perfect for a game like this. If it was 2 or 3 hours long, my ADD would kick in and I would just forget about it after an hour in, leaving it to linger within my over-filled games library.\n\nSo, surely there must be something bad with the game, right? Well, I do have one personal complaint but it is pretty minor. I might aswel show you the good ol' fashioned way by listing both pros and cons.\n\nPROS:+ Very low price\n+ Perfect game length\n+ Cute story, feels like you are watching a play of somekind. The game is very self aware (Knows there is a player, etc.)\n+ Interesting artstyle\n+ Combat is really interesting. I have never (personally) seen or experienced anything like it.\n\nCONS:+ Audio options are pretty bad. For example: Only "Music" & "Sound Effects" can be edited. Now, the problem for me was that I wanted to hear the voice acting (I guess you can call it that lol) but the SFX when you click on a speachbubble was killing me. I think it was the sound of glass being shattered, it killed my ears.\n\nThat's about it. If you want to sit down for an hour or so and play a cute and interesting game. Please give it a shot.\nOh, and please, for the love of GabeN, don't be "That Guy" and request a refund because playtime is under 2 hours.\nTime to farm for trading cards :P\n\n9/10 (Would be 10/10 if more audio options were available)\nGood job, devs!","October 24, 2015","true","4.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

For the rest of us, there are more engaging games available on Steam for the same price.\n\nFull Review: Message Quest is certainly a cute way to pass the better part of an hour, and all the bright colours and light humour make that hour a pleasant one. Yet my personal feeling is that this game should have been marketed to children, rather than being released as a purchasable game for adults on Steam.\n\nNow don't get me wrong - there isn't anything wrong with short games at all (Limbo, anyone?). But there's a difference between a game which is short because it was developed to be so, and a game which is short because you're flying through every challenge without blinking. If you're able to read this review, then chances are you'll also find Message Quest's simple little puzzles a little too simple to be satisfied with. For example: a recurring objective throughout the game is to "dust off" dirty panes of glass, revealing what's underneath. To dust, you click three times.\n\nObjective complete!\n\nAnd that's why I feel the developers have really missed a trick here. The simple and colourful selection of puzzles, along with the bright, cheerful art style and the overarching "moral of the story" message, would go down really well with children. It's just a shame that they aren't really Steam's target audience! However if you're reading this as a parent of school-age children, then Message Quest will be a great addition to your Steam library. Note: Message Quest does require a basic-to-fair level of reading ability, so either make sure you're on hand to help if your little gamer gets stuck on a difficult word, or turn it into a family activity and read along with them as they play. :)","April 26","true","6.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The design is simply adorable and the soundtrack very pleasant. I had a really great time reading the funny dialogues, solving the puzzles and discovering an unusual turn-based combat system.

But still, could be a good introduction into this genre of games for your child. Dragging mechanism can be annoying though. Sometimes it requires to put a thing in a very precise spot and there is no hint about that. I liked the fighting mechanism. Also it was nice to present a story via chainsaw puzzles (again that beautiful stained glass..). In overall, this game has some rough edges (say comparing to Tiny Bang Story) and it is so very short.

I would keep playing if there were more translations in languages I can understand, just to see the world from another point of view. ♥ Everyone who have enjoyed reading The Little Prince (or watched the 2015 movie) can only fall in love with the designs behind this game. It sings the beauty of RPG adventures with most honest and childlike tunes.\n\nGameplay wise, Message Quest is not just a cute simplistic point and click. There are mini classic puzzle games, turn based fights and basic roleplay elements. Just don't expect something big or long.\n\nI could not just play and not come back to give appreciation. Besides, it would be too lovely to see other game creators made games inspired by Message Quest, so here (warning, small spoilers) :\n\n- The way the character fight,\n- the graphics,\n- the BO and its freely given Steam soundtrack,\n- the faint humor that seems to hesitate between dark and burlesque,\n- the little bits of the simplistic spoken language (I don't know if it's made from a real language or not)\n- the reference to Esperanto,\n- and the dialog system making the player decide of what every character says, showing the player how something someone say can be interpreted differently and heard a conversation in a lighter or darker direction, but also saying that there can be more than one reason for a happening, and that, well, no one is perfect (not even the narrator),\n...All of these elements made my heat sing and long to hug every characters and broke a piece of my usual misanthropy.\nEnd of spoilers.\n\nThe only negative point I can find is that I found the plot weak, and with too many unexplained things by the time it ends. But that may just be a wrong impression due to the devs not being native French or English speakers : which may have let to so some sentences in the Prologue / Epilogue not being turned in the way that game sense and cause for the events of the game.\n\nIf it was possible, I'd wish for two things :\n1.

It was short (could probably be played in one sitting), but very sweet. The game has a distinct, stained-glass style with vibrant colors and characters brimming with personality. Feste, the lazy but lovable main protagonist, is so adorable it makes your teeth ache. I particularly liked the way the dialogue of the game was presented: not only the way the narrator constantly breaks the 4th wall, but also the hands-on approach of clicking the dialogue bubbles to continue the story. One of my favorites things about the gamw was the fact that you literally get to choose what each character says in order to create a more personalized approach to the overall story. Your choices don't have any real impact as the story is linear, but it's a fun experience to be able to choose what each character says, and how the story unfolds dialogue-wise. You end up feeling very involved in the story itself. I also really enjoyed the unique "battle" system, which is unlike anything you've probably tried before (for instance, Feste wields a mighty "Puppydog eyes" attack). The game will definitely make you laugh. The puzzles in the game are somewhat simple, but never boring.\nOverall, it's a great game for adults who enjoy a heartwarming tale, but it would also be perfect to play along with your kids.","January 6","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The engine has several very simple puzzle mechanics (a couple of puzzles to assemble, and a menu-driven battle mechanic) that could be re-used to good effect to make more games, though the puzzle mechanics are so simple a sequel would be best targeted towards children.\n\nThe story was strange, and not in a good way. Much of the English felt tritely written, probably a translation issue using a non-native speaker, and this added to the sense of the bizarre. It almost felt like a poorly translated fairy tale. The voiceovers (SIMS-type speech with a Russian flavor) were good.\n\nOther reviewers have pointed out that some screens became a click-fest, as the interface did not give good feedback as to whether an item needed to be clicked or dragged. All puzzles were solved on a single screeen; no inventory to take between screens; everything is on rails. A hint button in the upper right flashed the interactive object(s) needed to complete the scenes. Dialogue trees do not have any real choices, and you play both parts in the dialogue. All these point towards the engine being best used for a children's game.\n\nWorth the $2.99 asking price for a view at the engine and a reasonably enjoyable play experience. Pass on this if spending $2.99 means sacrificing another game you want.","December 12, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played the game along with my daughter, and we had a good time following the humourous tale.  The art style suits the story very well.  The puzzles are incredibly simple, but challenge isn't really the point.  As an introductory game to play with a child, the game is great, but there isn't really enough content or story to sustain interest for long otherwise.  Fortunately, the game is brief, and the presentation is charming.  The ending doesn't really pay off, but my expectations weren't high in that regard.  Message Quest is worth a playthrough under the right circumstances.","May 16","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
