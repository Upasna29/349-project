I played all the way up to wings of the goddess. So when this came out, and it was on sale, I decided to give it a try again. To say things had changed was an understatement.\n\nWhat was once a game you couldn't even TRY to solo before, and took hours and hours to get anything you wanted, within a week I was playing how I wanted. With the addition of Trust magic, an easily accessible magic that makes it so you can summon up to three NPCs, leveling has never been easier.  Level caps on a lot of the content has been removed as well, so with any high level character you can do most of the previous content without the help of others (Not that you have to do it like that).\n\nWith the addition of the field support manuals (which help you level as well), A new sub menu to quests (That also help you level!) and the ability to teleport between home points for a small fee, the game is worth picking up again. Not a perfect MMO, but it's a classic as far as they go.","January 20, 2014","true","778.4"," 127 of 130 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","127","130","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mases/recommended/230330/","mases","Mases","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mases/","165 products in account","Final Fantasy XI is a very enjoyable and content-filled game, with a bit of a steep learning curve. Due to the game being out for such a long amount of time there is an insane amount of content to experience and to play through, and all of this can be exteremly overwhelming to a new player, especially if they don't know what they are getting into beforehand. Some of the more recent updates and patches make it easier for new players to advance and get caught up, but you will definitely need to put in a very large amount of hours to really even begin to scratch the surface of what this game has to offer. I'd reccomend reading guides as you play so that you are better able to understand what you are doing as you play, and what you should be working toward.\n\nGameplay wise I found the game to be extremely enjoyable, the battle system is a bit slow to start out but becomes more intricate and interesting as you advance with the introduction of skill chains and its very party-centric battle system. That is one of the main features of this game, the almost necesarry party interaction that is required to advance. This was particularly true early on in the game's life-cycle, but it has become considerably easier to solo with the introduction of some new jobs, the tuning of enemy strength, and especially the recent trust system that has come about. The trust system is basically the ability to build a party with three npc party members, making it much more accessible for new players to advance, and making it more possible for players to solo in general.\n\nOne of the interesting mechanics that I most enjoyed in this game is the job system that it has in place. Similar to Final Fantasy III or V, you are able to assign your character to a job/class and change that job as many times as you'd like. This allows a player to experience everything that the game has to offer on one character rather than having to make alternate character to play with.\n\nCommunity wise the game may seem a little bit dead or slow if you're just starting out, as most players spend their time in the end game zones, so the starting cities and anywhere else may be a bit empty compared to other MMOs. In my experience it wasn't too noticeable however, there were still people running around Bastok (one of the starting cities) and plenty of people sitting outside of the auction house at any given time. I would reccomend looking into the more active servers before playing though, doing a google search for Final Fantasy XI server population would probably help you make a decision if you're looking for activity. However, I'd personally reccomend trying to find a linkshell or a group of people to play with before starting the game, and then joining a server where they are to get the most out of the game. This game, like many MMOs, is a lot more fun to play with other people, and it is a lot easier to make friends as a beginner outside of the game than it is in-game due to how far most older players have progressed.\n\nOverall I'd recommend the game despiting it looking a bit dated, the gameplay is extrememly enjoyable and the community is pretty great and mature as well.","September 4, 2014","true","104.3"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","45","47","0","0"

You name it I've tried it but I usually can't stand to stick around past the 2 week mark. This game is a game that has broken that cycle. There is so much content and so much to do that if you are a new player.. you have LOADS of fun ahead. It plays alot like the SNES Final Fantasy when it comes to the combat but with more timing involved. I've been playing this for 26 days now and my current main class is only 56 and the cap is 99! There is 22 Classes in all but only 6 basic classes availible from the start Warrior, White Mage, Red Mage, Black Mage, Monk, Thief. Your best bet when first starting out is to ask around your starting town for a friendly linkshell. That's what I did. Fair warning however. If you don't like working with others you are not going to like this game. This game is very team effort focused and it works well that way. Overall, it's my favorite MMO and now my personal favorite Final Fantasy. If you want someone that's different from all the WOW clones out today give it a try! I'm Tokitaki on Odin if you decide to play!","November 26, 2013","true","242.6"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","48","57","0","12"

The game play is archaic at best.  That's not saying it's bad, but compared to more recent MMO's it's quite different.  It is fun to acquire new classes (22 in total!!!) just to see how they play and with the new Alter egos, released in 2014, you can now level in the game solo and quite easily.\n\nAlter egos are basically companions that fight with/for you and make playing solo a breeze.  You can join groups in group play and tackle on bosses and harder enemies.  It's highly recommended that you join Linkshell, which are guilds, in order to advance at higher levels.  The community is quite good and people are very friendly and willing to help you out.  There's been 5 expansion packs and a handful of addons released for this game.  Many people still play it and it's far from dead.\n\nYou will have to jump through quite a bit of hoops just to get this game up and running though.  You'll have to activate the game on Square Enix's home page Playonline and that does take quite a while.  You'll have to also update the game a few times too through THEIR service and not through Steam.  Needless to say you probably won't be playing the game on the 1st day you activate it.\n\nThe graphics are old and the game play is different.  Though you CAN use a controller to play the game, but the game is still enjoyable with a mild learning curve.  It's not like WoW and like games with combat.  In FFXI it's more of a turn based game.  After you win a battle you won't just acquire loot either.  You'll have to pick locks and/or use combinations on locks in order to open them to get loot.  You can fail this and get nothing.\n\nFun game and worth a try.  You can grab the COMPLETE version of this game with all expansions, addons and DLC usually for $20 and the 1st month is free.  Recommended for die hard old school Final Fantasy players.","February 6, 2015","true","84.8"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","29","32","2","0"

But if you don't have the same feelings of nostalgia as I do, you might find yourself beyond frustrated with the game and quit within your first month.\n\nIf you have time to invest and love Final Fantasy (and don't have a significant other because this game may cause you to get a divorce) and you want to try one of the greatest MMORPGs of all time, this game is worth every penny.","January 18","true","136.9"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","22","22","5","0"

Sure, I played it after I played XIV 1.0 but I enjoyed both a lot. XI has a lot of content, but not a large playerbase since the launch of XIV: ARR. The issue with that is that most of this game is meant to be played with as a group, and so you may get pretty screwed unless you can find some good friends to come in with you. If you enjoyed XII then you will enjoy XI's combat as it's pretty similar.\n\nThe game is also heavily built upon adventure and discovery. Boss monsters in the world spawn rarely but give good loot upon kill. Areas are large with sweeping landscapes filled with horrid monsters and a few dungeons as well. All of these bring out the best in the game. You don't have maps of areas from the getgo either, you have to buy them in game when you find a vendor that'll give em to you, so having a web atlus open can help.\n\nHowever, in the end, the grind in this game can be horrid if you just can't stand people or grinding. You will have to group up with people in what are called "Book Burn Parties" to get through most of the game now and in to a point where you can enjoy the new content. Honestly though they're a blast. People are a pleasure to talk to and after you get use to what they're doing it's easy to fall in line and contribute to the grind.","November 27, 2013","true","1.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

Ima just try to make it short (Maybe it will be long) and simple. Btw my main character name is "Ghostmonkey", for those who want to add me.\n\nThe Pros:\n-The game does indeed have a good amount of players, if you know which server to join.\nAsura is the one for non-japanese players and most populated.\nSo don't be discouraged to buy the game if you are concerned about the game being dead.\n\n-Another note is how friendly the community is. I started in my first 2 and a half minutes and already approached by a veteran.\nThey will help you with anything you are confused about and will even go as far as to buy you some good starter gear.\n\n-The game is dated but still looks pretty good by 2002 standards\n\n-Nice outfits and weapons to use. Every outfit is a unique design. No stupid replicated, reused stock with different colors.\n\n-The game can be challenging but really well balanced for a MMORPG.\n\n-It's not P2W and no cash shop items as far as I'm concerned.\n\n-There can be special events where you get cool exclusive gear\n\n-Teamwork is where it counts for the most part and it can be VERY rewarding when you accomplish your goals in the game\n\n\nNow, the Cons:\n-The game can be REALLY confusing at first and a lot to take in for your first time. It's highly recommended to do a lot of research before buying the game.\n\n-Since the game is pretty old, it does have a few bugs and issues. Like how it's capped at 30FPS (there is a fix for that but you would have to do research on your own), or how it only utilizes one core out of your CPU.\n\n-Learning terms and macro's can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ or typing in commands or trying to learn shortcuts for certain commands can be really confusing at first.\n\n-Once you choose a server, you're stuck with it. You can change it but you would have to pay. You'd have to pay to make more characters as well. So if you ♥♥♥♥ up on your main and want to redo it or make another, then you better cough up some dough. It's not a lot but it can rack up if you have a ton of characters.\n\n-It's a P2P game. Pay monthly to play. It's about $11 USD or something like that. Not bad imo. Considering it's a fantasic game.\n\n-The controls can be very awkward to use. So it's highly recommended to use a controller. This game was designed to be used with a PS2 controller to begin with. KB&M just isn't as good imo.\n\nThe conclusion:\nOverall, yes the game is challenging, in many different ways.\nIt has a very very steep learning curve but it pays off and it's very rewarding.\nThe soundtrack is good, the gameplay is addicting (once you get used to it) and the story..\nI gotta say, when I play most MMO's, the story is usually boring and never pulls me in.\nBut this is probably the 2nd MMO to pull me in the story of the game.\n\nGive it a try and with enough research, you should get the game up and running with no issue in a couple of hours. I just feel the game is like a huge adventure even with some issues I came across and learning through the game. It was all an experience and it's a fun adventure when it's with friends or random people you meet. Buy the game and hope you have fun as much as I did.","May 2","true","304.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

With four copies bought over the lifetime of the game, I've found myself flat out rage-quitting each time I tried to play. With a lack of friendly players, welcoming new-player-experience, and punishing penalties for death and failures, this game is nearly impossible for new players to get involved.\n\nSure it's an older game, and I don't blame veterans for sticking where they are, some fabled city that I've only heard through NPC rumor and the occasional slip of a rare player's tongue, but overall the existing areas new players will see are devoid of player contact. Hell, I saw absolutely zero players in the capital city of Windurst for most of my tenure in my most recent attempt to play.\n\nCombat is slow, but I appreciate the chance to plan and the focus on timing abilities with casting times between incoming attacks. The problem is that the game's combat is (more or less) balanced for party play and there's almost no way to really set up a party in "modern day" Final Fantasy XI since nobody's around.  Level up to 10, die, level down. The frustration from this cycle was maddening enough that I just couldn't continue.\n\nWhile I was frustrated about the balancing of the game, I really wished that I could have spent some time on the story. There's a lot going on, albeit buried in text, that could easily keep your attention for a long time, but the game just seems to want to hide it from you. You get a mission or quest to do something, but the instructions are vague, requiring an outside resource to explain each step. You want some work so you can afford to buy slightly better equipment from NPCs since the auction house is laughably expensive, but NPCs don't look like they actually have a job for you to do.\n\n"Frustrating" is the only word I can use to describe this game. I want to love it, but the complexities of it, the age of it, the progression of it's core playerbase, and the difficulty it's account management system uses all makes this impossible to recommend except to existing players.\n","November 26, 2013","false","16.7"," 101 of 199 people (51%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","51","101","199","7","16"

There is no chasing around exlamation points and question marks. you have to read quests and use clues to figure out what to do.\n\nThis did used to be an incredibly challenging game that required a group after level 10. thanks to the introduction of "trust magic" that allows you to summon npc party members ,that you've earned the trust of, you can have a pretty solid group on your own.\n\nThe social game seems a bit dead. I have been playing for 2 days now and talked to a single other player. I have seen about 150 other players so far but no chat activity. I imagine they all stay within their linkshell (guild) chat.\n\nI am very partial to ffxi because of strong emotional attachments from when i played it in 2002, but if you are up for a game that requires you to talk to all the npc's and figure things out this is a good one. The account set up is a nightmare and the graphics and controls are dated but this is a very solid rpg that still has some years left in it.","January 13","true","0.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

When I last played this game it was not a game for people with a life, friends, or daily needs.  This game played like a job. There were "rules" established by a bunch of no-lifers, and if you didn't abide by them, and play this game 24/7 then you wouldn't have a good time playing this game. The gameplay was extremely slow and there was little room for going your own path without having a bunch of neckbeards sending harassing /tells at you for being a noob and a loser... or worse.\n\nI don't know why anyone would still pay for this game, or even play this game. Heck,Elder Scrolls Online realized their game was pretty bad, and went free, whereas FFXI is in total denial.\n\nTried to get back in it to keep in touch with some folks but it was empty and just as boring. The graphics are beyond outdated. There are other MMORPGs out there that play better, look better, and some are free.","October 24, 2015","false","0.5"," 10 of 34 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","10","34","0","0"

It's still going over 11 years after it was introduced, but the things that made this game great back in 2005 - its community, both ingame and otherwise - have stagnated. It still suffers from a graphics system that was optimized for PlayStation 2, and perhaps the biggest pain to more-casual gamers, is that this game has more grind in it than a Starbucks Coffee Shop. There is almost NOTHING that can be done solo in this game, so you end up waiting for HOURS ON END for people to help you with a quest, or for a xp party. Can I recommend this game? Unfortunately NO, I CAN'T.","April 25, 2014","false","11.2"," 28 of 107 people (26%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","26","28","107","3","0"

The grouping, however, did not stand up to the test of time and the servers aren't nearly what they used to be. square has mad up for this by making the game more soloable (and co-opable), and from what I understand the endgame content is still going strong. i'm hoping that, now that you can solo those previsouly hard-to-group levels, this time I can finally break past level 40 and get to that ♥♥♥♥","April 5","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played steadily with the odd short break from December 2003 until May 2010.  I then came back to the game in December of 2013 and was plesantly surprised that they got rid of everything I hated about it, namely the long hours of grind for very little reward.  The game seemed to award the luckiest players not the ones that devoted the most time to it or those that developed their skills.  This all changed in the December 2013 comeback and I played steadily until Labour Day 2014 when I quit to enjoy other pursuits having easily accomplished more in those months than I did in the previous 7 years.  I returned in May of 2015 and have been playing steadily ever since.  The MMO aspect is very enthralling and there are enough storylines and things to do to keep you occupied for the next 20 years if you like.  However this game is based on technology from 2002 and no longer looks like the amazing graphics system it once was.  The thing I like now is you can accomplish many things solo or with small numbers of people making the organizational aspect of things far less annoying.  If you're like me and quit playing this a long time ago, you will love coming back and it won't take you long to be caught up to speed.  You can literally spend all your free time on here, I know I do, having fun.  The monthly cost is the thing that's going to keep most people away and the fact that Square Enix has said they are pretty much through with releasing any major updates to this game.  Even though I technically "finished" it in November of 2015, there is always something else to do and the only breaks I'll be taking from this is when I find something else to occupy my free time.\n","March 31","true","44.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
