I played it when I was younger, but then ended up stopping my account when my PC decided to go out in a blaze of glory.   It took me ten years to get back into it, but to be quite honest, it's still got that same magical spark.\n\nEven with its twenty-first expansion on the horizon, people still play this.  I have a couple characters, but at the same time, it can be really just kind of depressing choosing to roll up a new character, and finding that you're the only person in the starting zone.   To be honest, there's not really a lot of players on the lower-end of things any more- most of your players are essentially those who have still got their high-level characters and are chruning through higher-level content as it comes out.  There are still a handful of players in the lower levels, but to be quite honest, if you like soloing, this is the class for you.  The mercenary system is a godsend for those mobs you can't handle on your own, but you'll still run into quests that you just can't handle on your own. For example, the newbie weapon for Wood Elf Druids requires you to break the throne room of the castle in Camp Crushbone, and even with a merc, it's not really something that you'll be able to accomplish on your own until you get to a level where you can easily find things that outclass the reward.\n\nThe graphics are really dated- there are games with much better graphics out there right now, but at the same time, they're not as hard to run on non-top of the line computers any more.   If you're not running a graphically-intensive computer with a three-hundred dollar card in it, no worries- this runs fine on my laptop.\n\nGameplay is still solid, even after all these years, but at the same time, it's not really changed that much.  The addition of the tutorial is always a plus, but to tell you the truth, it makes for a better way into the game instead of just being dropped into a newbie zone with nothing to do.  You can easily grind up to 13 or 14 here, if you accomplish all the missions, and you can find some decent equipment, too.\n\nTo be honest, though, it's free to play, and you can't go wrong with a game that won't tax an older machine.  If you enjoy a trip back to the days of groups looking to hit up the Halls of Honor or the Plane of Disease, download this game- just be ready to do a bunch of soloing.  If you used to play, all you really need is your sense of nostalgia and for your memories to come flooding back once you hit up your old favorite zones and hear that old, familiar music.","October 24, 2014","true","89.3"," 65 of 70 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","65","70","0","1"

I started playing with The Ruins of Kunark release. Oh my, the magical world of EQ. Never before and never since has there been such an amazing game.  I played all the way until Sullon Zek PVP server merged into Zek and guild Pandemonium had the server on lockdown. But, long before, this game was pure magic.\n\nI went on to beta test WOW, and EQ2 and played those games quite a bit... but EQ was still pure gold. Trouble was the game engine and graphics had fallen so far behind. Eq2 was fun, great in fact, but a different game. And so for all these years having playing every MMO from Vanguard to Age of Conan to Aion to Tera to FF XiV and even Archeage...\n\nEQ the original, will always have my heart and soul.  I wasn't terribly sad to hear EQNext was shuttered by Daybreak... because the idiotic SOE Devs had done it again... simply created a whole new game.  None of the original EQ fans ever wanted a different game. We wanted oue beloved EQ, simple as it was... only with a new game engine and better graphics.  Heck, all the expansions are there... all we ever wanted was a company with the vision to simply update and reboot the ORIGINAL in a more optimized way.\n\nPerhaps Daybreak will decide to do that one day. I'm sure it would cost a lot less than the cash wasted on "recreated" a "new vision" with "ground-breaking technology" which is... not fun, and no one from the fanbase EVER asked for or wanted.\n\nAnd if they don't... they do not understand what makes an MMO "great."  WOW only dominated EQ... because it had the same kind of magical world and endgame... with upgraded graphics.  A remake of EQ would have dominated WOW and every clone ever since... because it was simply...

Well, sort of. It predates most of the MMO market by a few years, especially a certain other exceptionally popular game anyone remotely familiar with the genre will instantly know. In its heyday, it was one of the most popular MMOs, with about 100,000 subscribers, give or take. The epic scale of the raids still hasn't been replicated to this day.\nBut has it aged well? Sure.\nEverQuest has always been about change. Sure, you can't have a dynamic influence on the world in most cases, but the game has always been changing. Where once you couldn't do anything without a group unless you were a specific class, now nearly everyone is capable of soloing for experience.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is still old and looks old, but there's a wonderful charm to it that other games really haven't come close to replicating.\nOh, and it's HUGE. In the old days, it used to be said that it took six hours to run from one end of the map to the other on foot. Well, the game has gotten bigger since then, to the point that they've added a number of hub zones to make travel easier. The down side to this truly epic size is that very few zones are consistently occupied by players.\nThere's also a bit of a disjointed aesthetic to the game. While many older zones and models have been updated over time, just as many have not. While Freeport and the surrounding Commonlands have received overhauls to the point it's almost a joke in the community, Qeynos and the Karanas are mostly unchanged from the time of launch, barring a few new quests that make you visit there.\nNow, let's talk about the sound. It's dated, sure, but that little factor hasn't stopped people from loving music before. And EverQuest has some real goldies. Kelethin, the sea approach to Freeport, Rivervale...great music that will stick in your mind forever. It's unfortunate that some of this music, such as the Rivervale theme, are in places you'd never normally visit, but sometimes it's worth it just to hear it.\nIt's not all rose colored glasses, though: The UI is cluttered beyond belief, to the point you'll be glad you can alter it to your liking. The previously mentioned disjointed graphics can also be rather jarring when you compare newer cash shop aesthetic outfits with older, standard armor. Everything works, but unlike most MMOs these days that are like receiving a new toy with karate chop action, EverQuest is like receiving one of those totally awesome playsets...with the words "Some Assembly Required" etched on the front.\nBut if you ask me, it's worth it.","March 20, 2014","true","631.2"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","54","58","0","5"

Most EQ vets I know either laugh at you or wince with pain when you tell them you want to start a new character on a new account. Grinding from 1 to 90+ solo is an extremely daunting task even as the best solo class in the game, necro. Sony tried to make the grind a little more solo friendly with the addition of mercs and more forgiving solo zones, but as free to play, you can only use tier 1 or 2 mercs, which are not that great. You are also limited to 250 AAs max as free to play which is extremely limiting when you do get to that point in the game.\n\nThe world is big.

It's the first world that I had become fully immersed in, and I think that all the games I've bought and played over the years since have been in a way seeking to get the same sort of feeling that Everquest had provided for me. I still have the fondest memories of my days as a young Dwarf, finding adventure and misadventure in and around the Butcherblock Mountains; being chased by Corflunk and Zarchoomi; being blasted to bits by a brownie in the Lesser Faydark, and enlisting other low-level guildmates to run interference while I make a naked corpse run to get my stuff back; camping Crushbone forever, so that I can get as many belts as I can to turn in to Canloe Nusback for the faction boost. I remember drowning while trying to find a certain island with mermaids on it in the Ocean of Tears. I remember being beaten to death by farmers in East Karana while trying to seek refuge from a lion that was chasing me.\n\nThese days, I'm not much for the MMO experience -- I'm not wild about forced socializing -- so I like to look for games that provide the sort of open, persistent world full of possibilities to explore and adventure, which EQ provides so well. Graphically, I can't say the game has aged too well, although it doesn't look too bad for a 15-year-old game. The best thing is, though, it's still alive! It's still worth playing. The world of Norrath is so incredibly huge, and now that there are elements put into place that makes the game easily soloable, it's worth it to get out there and explore. And, hey, bring a friend along for even more fun.","December 6, 2014","true","21.7"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","29","31","2","0"

That being said, I am extreamly reluctant to recommend it if you haven't played it before. It is 15 years old, which means that the graphics are horrible, the gameplay is kinda clunky, and it has many bugs (though they are mosly animation bugs, nothing game-breaking). This game is also very complicated. It has a lot of features that you would never know about unless you have been playing for a long time. The best comparison I can make for this game is to Daggerfall. Old, clunky, not very nice to look at, but if you can look past all of that, you will find a great game with a rich world. If you dig deep, there is some very interesting lore. Every old ruin, or named mob has some back story (you just might have to ask google what that story is LOL). In short, it is an amazing game, but you probably wont like it if you have not played it before. Also, don't get the steam version, it likes to mess with your options to make the game unplayable on newer machines.

No other MMORPG comes even close to the amount of content and features as Everquest does with over 18 huge expansions. Everquest sets the Standard for this genre of games.  (Only Elder Scrolls series even comes close)\n\nGameplay has considerably changed over the years, EQ is no longer as strict in many aspects such as corpse recovery is no longer needed and powerful, customizable mercenaries are available to enhance game play, greatly reducing the need for groups or organizing guild raids.  You can solo your Epic Quests at level 80 now with a Mercenary on a Paid Account with a dual-boxed team, no problem!  You can even upgrade or create a character at level 85 character, fully complete with raid gear and platinum coin for a very reasonable fee, to explore the high-end content.\n\nEven with the lower server populations after 10+ years in existence, there still is way too much to do in this game, living up to its name of Everquest.  The number of vast zones, huge dungeons, hidden lore and equipment, enormous cities, it is simply overwhelming.  Character depth with 100 experience levels, hundreds, or even thousands of spells and skills, and group mechanics so perfectly complex as one must really master their character classes to achieve end-game experience levels, especially when dual boxing solo, which brings entirely new challenges to the game.","September 13, 2014","true","144.1"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

I've played several mmos over the years but the 3 which ive spent the most time in were Runescape (1 year), WoW (2-3 years), and Everquest 2 (2006-today) which is my current favorite. I had always heard stories about Everquest's difficulty and coupled with the expectations of an ugly game with clunky controls that is outdated in every manner, I was left with the impression that this game would not be for me.\n\nLogging into Everquest for the first time I instantly note that the textures look nice despite the low polygon count. Character creation was vast in terms of race/class choice but limited in hair/face models. It offers you an optional tutorial which I suggest you take because I caught on quickly thanks to its guidance. This is the only MMO that I have ever played which forces you to actually read NPC dialogue as you need to respond or click key words to choose dialogue options. Additionally there is no quest helper, but you are given enough details on the quest in your log. Many problems I have with older MMO's is that theyve become a cakewalk. Im the type of player who enjoys the journey more than endgame itself and Everquest is no cakewalk. Granted that its much easier than stories I hear from 1999 but I found myself struggling and needing the help of a mercernary even in the tutorial. The thrill of finding a new item or defeating that one enemy which stumped you several times in the past is there from below level 10 and on. Another problem I have with many older mmos such as Everquest 2 is that it can sometimes be a ghost town, but much to my surprise Everquest 1 is still filled with players. In the tutorial I remember joining several groups and having to wait my turn for a boss to spawn for a quest. The Ui is fully customizable as well where every window allows you to change opacity and shape in addition to font size.\n\nThere are several aspects of the game which add additional challenge which I appreciated, one being that you're not automatically given new abilities every time you level but you need to find an NPC vendor in order to learn a new ability. In addition to this you can only use a handfull of abilities at a time causing you to change your loadout depending on which enemy you face. As a paladin I would have to choose which spells I werent planning to use and replace them with spells which were effective against the undead, because without them I would have been toast. When you die your body is left behind holding a portion of your experience, finding it will return this experience to you. Long gone are the days of loosing everything on your character which im half thankful for, but part of me would like to experience this challenge. Probably the most rewarding challenge that ive met so far has been going into a large zone and having absolutely no map, getting lost and having to use my compas in order to find my way out without dieing. In these situations you can always google zonemaps, but I prefer to use the games cartography tool which allows me to create my own map. You can do this by running along roads and borders of the map to create lines or leaving notes in various areas informing you of locations. Crafting is also challenging as well, even at low levels you're required to create several other items used in the process of crafting the item you originally needed. Everquest 2 requires you to play a minigame while crafting and farm random ingredients from nodes (for example blueberries from a blackberry bush). You never know what you will get and I'm glad to say that I prefer crafting in EQ1. Materials fall from enemies, and theres no minigame with crafting.\n\nCurrently I am level 27 and I was left with such a strong impression that I felt the need to share my experience. EQ1 is a game filled with personality, which I find charming and sometimes comical. Little touches such as comical loading bars which are basically inside jokes to the likes of; "warning, half elves are now 49.9% elf", "Polishing Erudite forheads" ect. When choosing an enemy, theres no way to know their strength by looking at them, pressing C to consider will give you a readout of their relative strength which ranges from "this can be risky" to "what would you like your tombstone to say?" I probably enjoyed these little touches more than I should, but sadly as a long time player of EQ2, these touches were missing.\n\nMy experience with other players has been mostly positive. I've made a few friends and joined a guild right out of tutorial which is filled with friendly players who are more than willing to help me out with my noob questions. Players in zones will ask you to trade buffs with them which I found helpful. My only negative interaction with another player was when I had my zone camped by a higher level player when I was trying to complete a quest but this has only happened one time.\n\nWhile EQ1 is still challenging to a new player, I have found a few areas of handholding which you may or may not appreciate such as getting a letter in your inbox every time you level up which tells you where you should go. I will probably appreciate this at a higher level though. I also with death consequence was a bit more harsh because I find myself not caring enough to walk the distance to gain the exp i dropped. I am only level 27 though so I cant speak for this in later parts of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Everquest is a game which I choose not to see as outdated by nearly 20 years, but a game which has been refined for much longer than anything else on the market. Its a welcoming experience for new and old players alike. I am currently a free player and outside of the occasional popup advertisement, I do not feel limited in terms of bagspace or character options, however I do hear higher quality spells and armor are restricted to paying members later on in the game.\n\nEnjoy!","March 28","true","95.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"

I will leave you with my review.\n\nReleased in 1999 Everquest is a hugely influential MMO, Influencing the genre even to this day. I am not as naive as to say that Everquest Started the MMO craze. I can say however that it most definitely helped get it off the ground. The game is still going strong with around 20 expansions to date. I have got to say if you want that classic feel in an mmo come on back to Everquest. Its still here, and still strong!\n\nI may prefer Everquest 2 more, but I think its great that the game is still open for those hard core Everquest 1 fans, and new people interested in the game alike.\n\n\nEDIT: My previous review I just noticed looked as if I typed it drunk. so I completely replaced it with this review.","October 27, 2013","true","5.2"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","39","57","0","0"

They give you tons of free expansions. I think you can go to level 90ish for free now. Nowadays you're able to solo if you don't want to team by using NPC "hirelings" of various classes called "mercenaries". They are definitely worth their value. Good amount of races and classes to choose from. Cool spells. Cool iconic monsters. They even have "dailies" that are worth a nice amount of XP and give decent loot. Everquest has a very oldschool feeling and sometimes I still log in to remember the old music and sounds and areas of the world that still hold my interest today. You will never run out of things to do in this game. For a game made in 1999, it's actually still what I compare other MMORPGs to. If it had a clear built in voice chat it would have every feature I've ever wanted in an MMORPG. I can't think of any flaws really, it's just "old" but that doesn't mean that it's automatically bad just because a lot of time has passed. The developers really cared about tailoring the game to make people happy because of all of the things I've seen added over the years.\n\nI give this game a thumbs up because it still makes me happy when I think about the old times. If you understand that it was made in 1999 and you still want to play, it's definitely one of the best MMORPGs out there from it's time. It's amazing that they still keep the servers going for us.","May 10, 2015","true","445.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","3"

They have made these a lot easier since you can recruit a merc and powerlevel yourself up to around 60ish without much sweat, but after that it is the old everquest grind(since this is where grinding was born imo ).\n\nI play the sony official download, since you can launch multiple sessions and multibox to make some of the mundane dailies easier.\n\nIf you played this 10 years ago and want to hop back in, its still a thriving community and lots of daily players at all times of day.

Despite the hours steam says I have, that's maybe 1/300th of what I have.

It's made gaining aa's irrelevant, and made leveling non-existant.

The game is massive in content. The players are extremely loyal and helpful too.  Factor about Everquest that is apart from many many modern mmo's is that EQ was built/designed around the round table of -in my own words ~grouping with players to advance. Sense 99 there are thousands of tales from players including myself of reminiscing the 'glory days' of eq.\nBottom Line- FTP is a honest and fair deal if you decide to pay-Subscriptions and content is also very generous and affordable\nCountless roads to venture in the world\nEQ Unique AA system for classes sinks every mmo's 'talent choices' for classes.","December 9, 2013","true","14.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

For it's time (I'd say circa 1999 - 2004) EverQuest was the greatest gaming experience to be had, and as one of the lucky players who was fortunate enough to play during this time period I can say beyond a reasonable doubt that EverQuest was the greatest gaming experience I have ever had.\n\nFor what it was, EverQuest was simply an epic adventure that nothing since its time has been fully able to live up to what it presented. It utilized online game play before any other really massive games (save Ultima Online if so it can be considered) could offer for the time. The beauty of this game, however, really was drawn for it's difficulty, its immersion, and its community - and unfortunately, the EverQuest of today does not do these properties justice.\n\nThere was a stark fear that entered me the day I played this for the first time. For one, it was expensive, it required a subscription, and I was not used to such things as a 13 year old - but with enough allowance and perseverance I made this game happen and it changed me personally on many levels as a result.\n\nTo date, no other game has been able to offer the same feelings that this game truly did as an adolescent, and I feel that this game really places the bar at which I judge other MMO's and RPGs. It was fixed to first person, quests needed to be obtained through dialog, death was unforgiving, your possessions remained on your corpse, experience loss was a veary real fear, getting lost was a very real fear, other players were judged on their merit as individuals, and I could go on about every finite detail that made this game very revolutionary for its time.\n\nThe EverQuest of today has been very watered down and filled with so many cash shop items and meaningless expansions to fuel the gear treadmill that I am deeply saddened. However, I do understand the stipulations behind keeping a game like this alive in a world of gaming where the "lesser" MMO's must really nickle and dime it's players to keep afloat, and for that reason I can never return to this magical place that shaped my childhood and outlook on gaming.\n\nDespite this, however, I keep this game and its developers in high regard for the opportunities it offered for me at the time. For many of us, the rose-colored glasses weigh heavy on tired eyes, but like your first love - this isn't something we can ever forget.\n\nFor a real opportunity at the game in its hay-day Project 1999 (www.project1999.org) may be something to experience - but part of the magic that made EQ something awesome really did stem from its technological superiority of the time, and this may take away from the experience you may otherwise have.\n\nI will stop waxing nostalgic at this point and leave your judgement to its rest, but as an old EQ player I will forever stand by this game as an unparalleled experience that....sadly....really can never be experienced again.","December 22, 2014","true","164.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It will be oddly heart breaking.\n\nOver 5,000 hours played on one character alone.  The community has changed substantially over the years and the charm many of us felt for EQ on initial release has long since fizzled.  The "awe" and "excitement" has waned over the years and the wonder of exploration has died a slow, painful death.  PVP is a joke (even moreso than initially).  Old players fondly remember the earlier involvement of GMs with events in the Plains of Karana and remember the first time being run over by trains in Karnor's Castle.  It's hard to place a finger on it, but this game simply is NOT the same.  Having said that, I still put over 300 hours into this game after being away for several years, so there is still an odd draw to the game.  Nevertheless, this game is not ideal for the new player and I only recommend this to veterans who wish to jump on from time to time.  Your old characters are still there, so that IS something.","January 31, 2015","true","311.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brujoloco/recommended/205710/","brujoloco","Brujoloco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brujoloco/","492 products in account","What can I say? I started back in late 2001 and was there to witness the good old days of EQ. Then Luclin came and the world as I knew it changed. But I experienced the sudden shift in paradigms, the loss of inocence, the dawn of a new era.\n\nThere was no WOW back in the day, Meridian 59/UO were practically the only other contenders in the MMO segment.\n\nSo I decided to make Norrath my home, invited friends over and decided to just go around exploring what the world had to offer ... and believe it or not, even today there is still stuff I don´t know much about, and only two years ago ended up finishing my Beastlords´s epic XD\n\nI mean, what drives me here? Is it the nostalgia? The remembrance? The Friends?\n\nWell , EQ is perhaps one of those few mmo´s that have managed to keep me coming back to it for WELL OVER A DECADE, and that surprises me. I left (to my chagrin today, knowing what I know now) EQ1 back in 2003/2004 when EQ2 launched ...\n\nMan how I regret that decision. After that I started a road of complete homelessness in the Virtual World of MMO´s , jumping the ship to EQ2/CoH/CoV/TR/MO/MU-O/Vanguard/LOTRO/WAR and many many other MMO´s that just kept filling me with hope of finding a nice quiet place to settle.\n\nIt was then I realized there simply has been ONE and ONE home alone for me, with all its flaws, odd mechanics, drug-induced vision storyline of twisted roundabouts and myriad quirks and customs : EVERQUEST 1\n\nYou see, it is my personal belief that we as gamers sometimes fall upon the LURE of the NEW, the supposedly new&fresh/exciting STUFF someone will make and instead of enjoying it begin a futile search for the NEXT BIG THING of NOTHINGNESS that will fill a strange hollow void in our souls, almost as if we were waiting for Godot to arrive to start having fun and be all right.\n\nBut it is a lie, a subtle lie of epic proportions that meshes with our current middle age crisis/existentialist angst/suppressed teen anger/isolation and alienation that the modern world forces upon us.\n\nYou see, home, the virtual home is a chimera of our own mind and looking for it constantly only shows how much we miss it.\n\nLike a weird quest to return to the womb, a virtual one, this has been my experience. There will ALWAYS be a new flashy MMO, filled with wonder, with promises of awesome pvp/pve, with new flaunted combat systems, with amazing rendered spells, with gorgeous buxom beauties of pixelated proportions so fine you will barely notice the missing seams in the avatarrs .. But it´s a lie.\n\nWhat you are looking for, what I have been looking for is that permanently looped Nursery that was found in The Dancers at the End of Time, whhose technology was applied to the already dying universe to loop it in time perfectly for millenia of everliving the good old moment of the eternal now (blame Michael Moorcock for that not me)\n\nAnd where is it found? That permanently looped in time place that is my virtual home?\n\nHERE, in this game that has maddened me to no end, that always makes lousy design decisions yet continues to be underneath all that filth the good old Everquest.\n\nAnd no friend, this is no madman rambling, there are thousands of us, still trying to live in that perfectly looped anomaly outside the universe.\n\nThere is P99 (recently recognized by Daybreak) and many other private/public shards of EQ that alongside official "Live" servers try to perpetuate this strange world of wonders and mysteries.\n\nI am not writing this to try to convince you to play the game or to hate it, only to show you a small door to my own path, which might be the same as yours.\n\nYes, modern MMO´s have a TON of Quality of Life enhancements, but this has made them as tasty as Fast Food, greasy delicious fast food, that you love to consume , but EQ? EQ is the awful porridge your poor parents forced you to eat because the war was in its apex and all you could eat was that sludge made from a mix of unknown victuals as your family and fellow refugees huddled close together by the slowly consuming candle as thunder and perhaps incoming shells sounds  reverberated in the sky.\n\nYou see, even today, when you eat that porridge, you ... REMEMBER.\n\nAnd that alone friend, is what made you what you are today.\n\nThus Everquest. Forever.\n\nYes, I highly enjoy this game, no, the hours in steam dont reflect my true use of the account, I have many more lost in the true logs of the servers.\n\nYes it is an old game, but honestly, it is the only home I have ever known and the others have been just weird foreign towns that don´t know how to make that dreadfully delicious bland porridge of sadness that for some twisted reason make me happy.\n\nMan I love this game, will always return to it, and will always play on the TLP servers when given the chance.\n\nAlso no other game has this trinity/support classes so well defined as EQ. No other game has an Enchanter Class nor a Necromancer class like the one EQ has to offer.\n\nThey don´t really, for some reason as time passes Modern Games tend to dilute and break these classic archetypes of gaming turning them into something they are not.\n\nAnyway it is time for my medication, and I think the Ward already noticed I am not in my room\n\nLove you all guys, remember me, I will remember all of you, my fellow players of Everquest, you have given me for years the best gaming moments of my life and hope that this will be so in the future too.\n\nHugs to you all!\n\no/","May 10, 2015","true","060.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't say much about the normal servers as I didn't play them much. However the TLP (Time Locked Progression) servers, specifically Ragefire (since I played there).\n\nAbsolute trash....garbage to the max....People are botting and macroing EVERYWHERE.

However the higher levels, you will find these guys perma-camping epic drops, high value loot drops, the dragons, etc....\n\nEverquest sadly has turned to crap since back in the good ole days...reputation doesnt matter here anymore, due to 3 reasons lol 1.) GMs dont do anything anyways 2.) The people that are screwing their reputation up, do it along side there 20 bot army and all their friends doing it so they dont really care or need to care/worry 3.)

This was THE blueprint for spawning new MMORPG's to date. No other game comes close to the experiences I've had with the adventures, friends, and epic quests. This game has an extremely high replay and nostalgic value. However, if you've played before and looking to get back in, prepare yourself for a complete makeover because that is exactly what Sony did. It's not the worst, but I would say it's confusing for people who is use to play EQ back in 1999 and on. And need I dare say it? It's not the same game I use to play before Sony decided to milk the crap out of EQ with needless, countless expansions. I would review my take on Project 1999 but unfortunately, I never got the chance to play it nor acquire EQ Titanium (an accumulation of EQ expansions plus original).\n\nI could go on and on taking a teary trip down memory lane about EQ but more importantly I am proud to say that EQ is/was the cherry on top of all MMORPG sundaes.","September 21, 2014","true","55.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are plenty of zones to explore, as well as plenty of mobs to hack to pieces. The graphics designers did a stunning job on the scenery and the architecture, but in terms of character creation, there isn't much variation that makes your character 'unique'. Whether it be the combat music that makes you want to hack up some beasts, or the environmental sounds adding to the overall gamers captivation, the dynamic soundtrack will get you in the mood for anything.\n\nHave you ever talked to your family, eaten, slept, or bathed?

Some expansions were great, some were good, and some could have been better - but the entire trip has been well worth it for me :)\n\nThe game has a much more challenging risk vs. reward system than never MMOs, which is probably also why the community "matters" more - you can easily ruin your characters name on your play-server, if you act like a total jerk to others... and that will come back and haunt you when you find yourself barred from the guilds that can bring your character forward progression-wise.\n\nWith the recent additions of new Progression servers (where you start with the original game enabled only, and then "unlock" expansions in the original order, as time passes) - there has never been a better time for new, as well as old, players to experience EverQuest and all it has to offer :)","February 12, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I started EQ up back in 1999 and it was much different over the years of course the game has changed sadly not for the better.\n\nThe community of the game has gone to complete ♥♥♥♥ and the company has changed their rules to make it okay for other players to basically harass you.  Kill stealing is a thing because whoever does the most damage gets the exp and loot.  Training (The act of grabbing a bunch of monsters and leading them onto another player with the intent to kill them) is extreamly prevalent on their new progression server.  Do not go into the game alone most people box more than one character and go out of their way to screw you.\n\nI cannot recommend the live version of Everquest anymore.

I have logged more hours in this game than ALL my others game I have ever played combined.... easily, that being said: It was what started all the present day MMORPGs. I will always love this game and will always have amazing memories of playing with my brother and many friends, some now passed away.\n\nI cannot reccomend this game the way it currently is now-a-days. The game is a faded shadow of its former glory. To call this a "free to play" game is laughable. I have 3 accounts, maxxed out characters slots, nearly all lvl 100. Back when this game was a game that you HAD to pay for, it was simply great! Now with the "free to play" BS that this crappy new company uses, its basically "pay to play or you get penalized". What I mean by this is simple: If you do not pay the monthly fee, then all that hard earned equipment you are wearing will no longer take affect on you and be basically just a visual item you are wearing. Its pretty damn sad. Spend hours and hours and hours getting the equipment you have, the game "Free to Play", but you are penalized if you try to play the game like this. "Free to play" my @$$.\n\nThis is NOT NOT NOT NOT a free to play game. Calling it such is a straight out lie. I want to reccomend this game, VERY badly. It has so many wonderful memories from the past... but in the current state, there is just no way in hell I can, and still sleep at night.\n\nGraphics are dated\nSounds are dated\nUI is dated\nControls are dated\nMore expansions than I have fingers and toes\n\nYou should look elsewhere for a "free" MMORPG.","August 26, 2015","false","4.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

And this saying I would not recommend this game for new players currently. ( hopefully they fix some things )\n\nEverquest was an amazing game, magnificant large worlds, facinating creatures and entrapping stories and quests. Everquest would catch you from the begining to see where would you end up next and what would you be doing, the possibilities were endless.\n\nHere is the kicker, Everquest WAS an amazing game, nothing can even come close to the detail of the story but they fail at catching and keeping new players. The MAJOR problems with everquest is the graphics, UI (default), complicated nature of the game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ TUTORIAL (who wants to start an epic journey in a smelly cavern with outdated looking everything? And to top it all to deal with the complicated nature of the game they just add these very annoying pop ups and the UI is overlapping so before you can do anything you are bombarded by a ugly UI), and very very loud menu music.... All of this turns away so many new players and causing an un even population of veterain players on many servers. So you want to get started in an epic journey with a party and your alone youre in the largest world you can immagine and its just empty. They need to Update the UI and make it friendly to new players, update the tutorial to make it not a depressing hole in the ground, and update the graphics to get people to not feel like they are playng something that has been outdated.","August 20, 2015","false","205.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I played maybe five minutes after an hour or so of downloads and it was not worth the 8.6 gigabytes that it used on my computer. The fact that this game has 18 expansions and a sequel are astonishing to say the least. The hud is too intrusive and the controls are clunky and impossible to make comfortable, it seems like it was made in a weekend. The character customization is ridiculously limited with maybe five classes unlocked for the free basic game. "The MMO that started it all" is true in the sense that it seems like it was an alpha that no one had the time to play test. It had potential but the controls are embarassing and dysfunctional, I can see why it was a free to play game. I recommend no one ever play this game because it is not worth your time.","September 13, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 11 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","11","2","0"

MMOs where the game was about exploring new locations, the lore, and slow steady progression. MMOs today are just hubs littered with thousands of mind numbing quests to level 1-Max in a month, grouping not required. MMOs today are about getting to end game and raiding endlessly. EQ had its fair share of raiding, but when I think of EverQuest that is not the part that I think of. My initial character that took a long time to level up (probably a year to get max level) and slowly progressed from zone to zone and the different people I met along the way that I grouped with is what I remember most. No other MMO has had a similar experience since because they just go by too fast and too easy to get people to the end game, and with instance queues (usually multi-server) there just isn't any sense of server community in current MMOs.\n\nAt the end game EQ was similar to what we know today in MMOs, nothing that special, with the primary difference being competition over spawns since there were no instances. This was fun and not fun at the same time. It formed different guild rivalries if we stole a spawn or they did, but sometimes you would have to change plans due to not being at the right place at the right time. The more proactive your guild was in monitoring spawns and mobilizing quickly and efficiently the greater chance that your guild would be the strongest on the server. It was a different mechanic than current MMO raids, but ultimately that isn't where EverQuest shined to me.\n\nThe EQ lore is what kept me playing. The locations and the story lines were there, but you had to find them, they weren't laid out for you with giant exclamation points. EQ has some of the best zones in any MMO I've played and I would recommend playing it today just to get a chance to experience certain zones and dungeons, but again this game will be hard to pick up at this point with its age.\n\nThere are still people that play the game, but they're all at end game raiding. I would recommend this game still today as a single player experience to just experience some of the zones and game lore, but it would be hard to recommend it to play end game with all the catching up that would be required.\n\nA new EverQuest comes out in 2015 (probably) called EverQuest Next so be on the lookout for that one, it looks to be doing some really great things in the MMORPG genre.","June 21, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What can I say about EQ, except that over the 8000+ hours I put into the game during my active period (LoY through TSS expansions on the Vazaelle and Maelin Starpyre servers), I started with nothing, rose to worldwide top of raiding, made lifelong friends, loved, lost, and forever emblazoned in my memory unforgettable experiences which I remember with picture perfection almost a decade later. This game never ceases to invoke a special warm feeling in my heart, that I just can't really get from anything else.\n\nPerhaps the best things about EQ simply the player community, and the enormous world -- especially now that there are 20+ expansions for the game. There's always something awesome to see, whether for the first time or once more for old times' sake. Today's iteration features changes that allow you to revisit a lot of the old world, and new content, by yourself with the help of things like mercenary NPCs, so it's fairly painless to get back into the game, weather for nostalgia or just a change of pace from today's MMOs. You might even run into some people who started at launch in 1999 and are still playing to this day They sure don't make them like this game anymore.","February 15, 2014","true","63.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What can I say about EQ, except that over the 8000+ hours I put into the game during my active period (LoY through TSS expansions on the Vazaelle and Maelin Starpyre servers), I started with nothing, rose to worldwide top of raiding, made lifelong friends, loved, lost, and forever emblazoned in my memory unforgettable experiences which I remember with picture perfection almost a decade later. This game never ceases to invoke a special warm feeling in my heart, that I just can't really get from anything else.\n\nPerhaps the best things about EQ simply the player community, and the enormous world -- especially now that there are 20+ expansions for the game. There's always something awesome to see, whether for the first time or once more for old times' sake. Today's iteration features changes that allow you to revisit a lot of the old world, and new content, by yourself with the help of things like mercenary NPCs, so it's fairly painless to get back into the game, weather for nostalgia or just a change of pace from today's MMOs. You might even run into some people who started at launch in 1999 and are still playing to this day They sure don't make them like this game anymore.","February 15, 2014","true","63.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

MMOs where the game was about exploring new locations, the lore, and slow steady progression. MMOs today are just hubs littered with thousands of mind numbing quests to level 1-Max in a month, grouping not required. MMOs today are about getting to end game and raiding endlessly. EQ had its fair share of raiding, but when I think of EverQuest that is not the part that I think of. My initial character that took a long time to level up (probably a year to get max level) and slowly progressed from zone to zone and the different people I met along the way that I grouped with is what I remember most. No other MMO has had a similar experience since because they just go by too fast and too easy to get people to the end game, and with instance queues (usually multi-server) there just isn't any sense of server community in current MMOs.\n\nAt the end game EQ was similar to what we know today in MMOs, nothing that special, with the primary difference being competition over spawns since there were no instances. This was fun and not fun at the same time. It formed different guild rivalries if we stole a spawn or they did, but sometimes you would have to change plans due to not being at the right place at the right time. The more proactive your guild was in monitoring spawns and mobilizing quickly and efficiently the greater chance that your guild would be the strongest on the server. It was a different mechanic than current MMO raids, but ultimately that isn't where EverQuest shined to me.\n\nThe EQ lore is what kept me playing. The locations and the story lines were there, but you had to find them, they weren't laid out for you with giant exclamation points. EQ has some of the best zones in any MMO I've played and I would recommend playing it today just to get a chance to experience certain zones and dungeons, but again this game will be hard to pick up at this point with its age.\n\nThere are still people that play the game, but they're all at end game raiding. I would recommend this game still today as a single player experience to just experience some of the zones and game lore, but it would be hard to recommend it to play end game with all the catching up that would be required.\n\nA new EverQuest comes out in 2015 (probably) called EverQuest Next so be on the lookout for that one, it looks to be doing some really great things in the MMORPG genre.","June 21, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Grouping options aren't too bad on the new server Vox but good luck on older servers where the population mainly consists of veteran players.\n\nI asked a noob question, "Where can I find higher level swords and bows?" Out of 300 people in general chat, not a single one answered. I was in a guild with like 20 to 30 people on and not a single person answered in guild chat. Did someone know? Of course they knew.. This game is supposed to be an MMO. But help from other players is almost non-existent at times. I spent days trying to find some cool people to group with to no avail. I tried the Everquest forums, in game on multiple servers. Nothing..\n\nIs the game a great game? Yes! It really is! But without being able to find helpful and cool players, I've hung my hat up\n\n10/10 (March 23, 2016)\n\nWelp guys, I'm back. I've been trying to find a good MMO to play and EverQuest has always come to my mind. I decided to reinstall it and give it another go. Almost a year has passed since I wrote my review.\n\nThey've made a new time locked progression server since I've been gone. I tried Vox out and discovered a whole mess of new people roaming around.

I can't say it offers anything in particular no other game does. and the community is a bit isolationist by nature.\n\nBut, there are good people playing the game too. and it is basically a good game. plus it really does have alot of content.\n\nI DO NOT reccomend this game for someone who hasn't played it before. it's just going to be a rediculous learning curve for little reward. BUT if you already familar with the game even a little it's worth messing around on.\n\ntry the Phinny time lock progression server.","June 4","true","68.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
