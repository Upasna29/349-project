It may be a little overmuch at first, but the effect is totally cusomizable, or you can just turn it off entirely.\n- The story (although rather buried) is interesting. Not groundbreaking or absolutely stunning, but interesting...which is more than I can say for a lot of recent games.\n- There are a lot of "borrowed assests" in this game. While I'd normally take umbrage to swiping sprites from older, better games, they're here as homage, and are used with minor changes that make them more than xerox copies.\n- Secrets. False walls, floors, and hidden areas on the world map are fun to find, accidentally or not. The NPCs will point you in the direction of a lot of them, but hopefully you'll find some on your own, too.\n\nCons:\n- The music is short loops that restart every time you enter a new area (which is frequently). I love chiptunes, but I had to turn it down to keep my head from exploding.\n- There's nothing to it. I'm now just shy of 2 hours into the game. I have seen the entire world map, cleared all the major dungeons, and have collected 3 of the 5 pieces of the King's Heart (i.e. "The Big End Item"). I'm already tired of backtracking...\n- It's not "open world". Although you're immediately free to roam anywhere on the world map, you can't do anything (save talk to a few cryptic NPCs) until you get some items. The items must be acquired in a specific order, too. It's a bummer walking to the ends of the Earth just to have to walk all the way back because you can't double jump yet.\n- No fighting allowed. This game is strictly a platformer. You walk, you jump, you listen to villagers. You don't fight, you don't cast magic, and you dodge anything that looks like it might bite you. Not very fun.\n- It's expensive. Even with the 10% discount, this game just doesn't have that meaty cash-to-fun ratio I love as a PC gamer. Twelve bucks got me maybe 3-4 hours of game, and that's just not a very good value.\n\nAll in all, if I had to compare this game to something, it'd be a piece of Fruit Stripe gum. A blast from the past that isn't bad but doesn't quite taste right, and gets stale far too soon.","October 1, 2014","false","3.6"," 316 of 434 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","316","434","10","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morsk/recommended/310700/","morsk","Morsk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morsk/","60 products in account","It's a platformer. There's no combat. Some enemies are tricky to dodge, and the "boss" rooms have bullet hell obsticles. But mostly it's platforming and exploring. The exploring feels like a mix of Zelda II and a Metroidvania, but without combat.\n\nYou probably want to know if it's worth the full price. If you like achievements and go for 100%, there's a good amount of stuff. There are optional areas with challenging jumps. There are 128 gems hidden throughout the world. Just "looking out for them" will get you around 100. Getting the full 128 takes a lot of exploring, and probably took me 10 hours of actual play. I stretched it to ~16 by doing replays for the "big" achievements, but I was stretching on purpose because I like replays. You can 100% in one playthrough.\n\nWithout achievements, just playing to finish once, is probably 4-6 hours. It's lovely, has a variety of art and music, and a cool story. The themes (dreams, sense of self, etc.) are done beautifully, and avoided being pretentious. It probably helps that the game is written by a single dev, and is heartfelt. Whether to pay full price just to play through once would be very subjective. It's a better deal than a movie, or a pizza. But perhaps not compared to other games.\n\nOh, the aesthetic. The CRT is great. It goes far beyond simple scanline effects seen in NES emulators and SweetFX. There's blurring, and little types of fuzziness and flickering that I don't know the right words for. They should seriously license this out to other pixel games. There's nothing else like it.\n\nedit: Btw, my playtime on this game looks crazy high because I was experimenting pulling map data out of it, to make guides. And once it was open, I tended to leave it open for the music. I like it, but 60+ hours is not something you should expect to get out of it, heh.","October 4, 2014","true","70.2"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","45","46","0","0"

You really feel like you are playing a ROM from that era.\n- Platforming is done well and sufficiently challenging.\n- Overworld map let's you choose where you want to go in a non-linear fashion.\n- Plenty of save points so you never have to backtrack very far.\n- CRT filter is configurable and able to be turned off.\n\nCons\n- There's really no game play beyond the platforming. I felt like it could have used a bit more to do and variety like combat and puzzles and so forth.\n- Although the overworld is open and you can do it any order there are many areas are blocked off until you get a certain items resulting in a lot of backtracking.\n- The $12.99 asking price is (subjectively) a bit high for what you're getting.\n\nIf you really love retro platformers Super Win the Game does it well with its own unique twists of overworld map and non-linearity. Just don't expect more than straight up platforming. While it may look visually like a near clone of Zelda II the dungeon portions actually play more like Super Mario Brothers.","March 22, 2015","true","2.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","2"

Basically, it is 8bit exploration done right. You are cast into an open world and tasked to restore order to a hollow land with a hollow king. You explore landscape and (ancient) ruins, grabbing items, upgrades and hints along the way to save the lands.\n\nWhat really separates S.W.T.G. from other titles is the near flawless design. The world is big, with a lot of places to explore but at the same time the dev managed to make it compact, not overwhelming you with tons of near identical screens. You are never really lost because every area is designed in a very distinct way. Platforming, while tricky in some parts, is never really hardcore and should be no problem even for beginners. And while sticking to overused themes like fire, ice, water and desert may not be super-creative it just works perfectly here thanks to the areas being connected in a sensible way. And there is an option to fast travel too!\n\nAnother aspect that I cannot praise enough is the way that exploration stays fresh til the very end of the game. Not only are there a lot of items that allow you to visit new areas, most of these new places are actually accessed in various ways from locations you have already been to. In fact, "backtracking" in this game doesn't feel as much of a drag as it usually does, because the way items open up already known areas is quite exciting and entertaining. An example would be the starting dungeon, it seems like it is just a couple of rooms at first - when in fact it is actually quite expansive with many secrets and rooms behind areas that seemed inaccessible (and I really mean inaccessible as in: you would never go there unless you realize that certain items allow access.). Exploration feels very rewarding in this game, because if you think you can do something - chances are pretty good you can and the Dev hid something for you there to congratulate you for exploring the world and trying things - and even if it is just one out of the 128 gems you will feel satisfaction that you found it.\n\nThen there is the whole "cryptic 8-bit hints"-stuff, the game manages to pull off guiding but not really handholding you. It is quite fun to figure it all out and I love the simple but effective world-building. Ancient beings that used to travel the stars guide you on your quest to restore peace and we haven't even talked about the whole dreamscape-stuff. I guess the dreamscape-sequences are "meta" or something, but they strike some really dark tones at times that were quite intriguing making S.W.T.G. not only an excerise in platforming and figuring the game out but also makes it a title that could have an actual message. It's all a bit vague, cryptic and mysterious but it only adds to my fascination with this game.\n\nTechnically, the game looks a bit bland (I honestly prefer the CGA-visuals of the original, but that might be due to me playing more CGA games than NES games back in the day) - sticking to what I believe are actual NES color-palettes. However, once you turn of the incredibly awesome CRT-emulation it almost looks like you are playing an actual NES on a shabby old TV set, quite awesome really. The attention to detail is amazing, and you even get to tweak all the details within an extensive options-menu. So, S.W.T.G. might just be worth it if you are a retro-fan interested in "visual degradation".\n\nThe only issue I had with the game was the fact that finding the last gems you might have missed is a bit of a pain, since there is no way of knowing wether you got everything from an area or not. Though, this is nitpicking and not relevant for the completion of the actual game.\n\nSo, let me finish by saying this: Super Win the Game is a little masterpiece. Managing to pull off feeling very "NES" while being extremely playable and keeping things fresh till the end. Highly recommended!","October 4, 2014","true","5.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","4"

It reminds me so much of Zelda II from back in the day, which is a game I loved despite its flaws.\n\nThis game takes out all the frustrating aspects of Zelda II while maintaining a lot of the aesthetic and the tone.  But more than that, there's a lot of other legitimate retro references in here.  This feels less like a homage and more like a lost game from that era -- a good one.\n\nI can't recommend it enough.  There are frequent checkpoints, and so the parts that would otherwise be frustrating are things that you can practice to your heart's content.  It thus has a great amount of challenge in parts without being annoying about it at any time.\n\nThe items and unlocks are good, and the feeling of exploration is tangible.  There are several methods of fast travel that you can make use of as you progress, and that makes backtracking not a thing anymore.\n\nMy sole complaint, and really this is just a matter of what the game is, is that there isn't any direct combat.   This is all about platforming, pure and simple.  There are enemies, sure, but you just avoid them.  To be honest, that works just fine and the game is great even so.  GET THIS GAME.  But what I'd love to see is a sequel that takes all the great stuff from this game, then adds in Zelda II or Castlevania style combat.  That would just be absolutely killer and take this over the top from being something I really really like to being something I desperately love.","July 27, 2015","true","4.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

It follows the same basic formula of platforming (there is no combat at all), exploration, and puzzle solving. Similar to the original, the look is retro, only this time around the inspiration is more from the 8-bit console era. In fact, the majority of the aesthetics are pretty blatantly, err, "borrowed", from Zelda II. While this might seem a bit shameful (and I suppose it is in some ways), it touches me smack dab in my happy nostalgic gaming place. This is pretty much a perfect game for someone like me who still looks fondly on those old days of gaming and wishes there were more games in that vein. The gameplay consists of exploring a top-down overworld map, and then exploring several side-scrolling locations (towns, caves, dungeons, etc) to solve secrets and collect the items needed to win the game. There is not a lot of hand holding, and there are lots of secrets, so you do have to pay close attention (or be very thorough exploring) to finish the game, which is something I really enjoyed. The bulk of the game involves platforming and solving platforming-related puzzles. The difficulty is mostly reasonable throughout, with just a handful of really tough spots, so it's a decent balance. Although it can be quite challenging at points, checkpoints are plentiful and there is no penalty for dying, so it's not too frustrating overall. I would not recommend it if you don't like platformers at all, or don't have a good controller, though. But otherwise, I think it is an excellent game for those who like old-school and/or challenging platformers.","February 8","true","7.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","5"

In the day and age where literally every "pixel indie game" is generic, boring and uninspiring, it's a shocker to see a game that actually feels like it's something that would have been released a few decades ago. Super Win the Game is the sequel to You Have to Win the Game as stated, and boy does it deliver. The game takes a lot of inspiration from age old classics such as Super Mario Bros 2, Zelda 2, and much more. What really delivers in this game is a lot of backtracking, which was a key essential in adventure games back in the day. Some paths are inaccesible until you find certain powerups or items to advance or get jewels. The game overall would be quite short without the backtracking, but it's this exact key concept that retro games back then used to expand playtime on cartridges with rather small storage space, which is why the game feels exactly like an NES game. But of course, it's not just that. The additional options and features of having the old "CRT TV Monitor" with adjustable visual settings, along with the optional "reverb" for the chiptune styled music completes the experience and makes you feel like this game was actually made ages ago and not in 2014.\n\nTL;DR Nostalgia and NES freaks, this one is for you!","October 13, 2014","true","1.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It is not a terribly long game, clocking in at around 4 hours for me which includes time trying to find some of the hidden stuff in the game.   A 100% playthrough would take a little longer, but I could also see the game being speedran in under an hour if you knew exactly what to do.\n\nGameplay is pretty good, controls are simple and solid.  One button for jump, one button for interacting with stuff and you are good to go.  You have fairly good control over your character, so the platforming never feels cheap or unfair.   There is no attack button of any kind in this game, so don't expect any real boss fights.\n\nGame contains the type of power ups you'd expect from a metroidvania.  Double jump, wall jump, swimming, lava proof upgrades.  You basically need to explore the world to find 6 pieces of the King's Heart.   They are not hidden in obvious places, you may accidentally find them, but if you get stuck there is a fortune teller NPC at town who can guide you to where to look or go next at any point in the game.  There are no heart containers or HP, one hit and you are dead, but checkpoints are very frequent to the point where death never really hurts.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the game, but given it's length you may want to consider if it's priced in a place to justify about 4 hours for a playthrough (I was gifted it for free by a friend).  If you are an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥, you will probably get a fair amount more time out of it as there is a lot of hidden stuff and fake walls hiding secrets etc.","October 2, 2014","true","4.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"

Of course there is the very comprehensive crt effects, sounds etc., that have been used to make one of the most faithful retro gaming experiences out there, but to me it shows most in the level/world design. If judging this game by the screenshots and gameplay videos, one could be excused for thinking it's just a series of bland, linear dungeons scattered about an overworld, but nothing could be further from the truth. Words that spring to mind when describing the level design are "interwoven", "deep", "deliberate" and "meticulous". Everything in this game is interconnected, everything has a purpose, and not a tile is out of place. Exploration in this game is an absolute pleasure, and while the overworld seems at times a little bit small, the various intersecting layers underneath it make up for it. The lack of combat is also refreshing, provided you can appreciate a game for what it is, not by what it is not.\nThat being said, I think the world map is again let down a little for its complete lack of action - without combat, there is no real reason for random encounters, and besides randomness goes very much against the precision grain of this game anyway. Something feels missing in the world map to make it a little more engaging, but I don't know what it is...\nOverall though, if you enjoy hardcore platforming and extremely tight level design, or just love retro aesthetics this is the game for you. 8.5/10","October 6, 2014","true","12.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It felt so different in your memory... Well, Super Win The Game feels the exact opposite of that. In fact, SWTG is what old childhood games should have been in the first place. Don't know what I am talking about? Try its freeware prequel "You Have To Win The Game", that is, if you grew up playing games on an old CGA-monitor. Put it simply, it is PURE AWESOMENESS.\n\nPros\nLevel Design: this is probably what most reviewers will overlook, since the best level designs are the ones you don't even notice. The levels are just so complex and fun to explore, with its different themes and multiple secrets. And speaking of secrets, oh my, you will be served. I literally discover one every single time I load the game.\n\nMechanics / Physics: Also an overlooked aspect for the same reason mentioned above. It just feels good to play. And the more items you collect, the freer you become. Again, try YHTWTG if you want to know how it feels beforehand, it's the same home-made self-developed pro-level NERD engine.\n\nTelevision Emulation: This one just completes the whole retro experience. It also has more options to experiment with than its predecessor. Although I recommend the default settings, which are the best in my opinion. Oh, if only we could apply it to other retro games on Steam...\n\nCons\nThe music: It can become really annoying and repetitive. Especially for the fact that more than half of the tracks just don't fit the area you are in. The best example would be the ice area. In most old games, the area is expressed musically by a certain mystery and some high-pitched "icy" notes. Think SMB3's ice level map or even Zeliard for PC gamers. On the other hand, the main tune (let's call it the "black and white" track) is really good and fits the mystery and loneliness of the whole game. The waterways, lair and lava area tunes also fit adequately. The rest just soon gets on your nerves. So it's up to you to keep the music on or not.\nLength: I guess a speed-run could be done in less than two hour, though the first time you play, you will go back and forth, get lost, try to figure out what to do next, etc. I guess it took me about 7 hours of "normal" gameplay to beat. Then you can go back and look for all the secrets you missed the first time. Still, the downside of having an amazing game like this is that you will always want more of it.\n\nOther observations\nWeird messages/poems (black and white sequences): This one, well, I'm not sure what to think of it. Perhaps they are some kind of riddles I haven't figured out yet. The other possibility is that they are just the author's personal poetic thoughts, which add even more artistic value and mystery to the game.\nInteraction: By this one, I mean that I feel there could have been more interactions with non-playable characters populating the cities and such. I guess the author wanted the player to feel a certain loneliness, but some Zelda-like sub-quests for example would have been fun.\nSecrets: As I mentioned in the pros, there are secrets everywhere. The thing is, if you are a bit of a perfectionist and want to collect all the gems and items, you will end up wasting a lot of your time scrutinizing each screen (i.e. stick to walls and jump like an idiot) in hope of finding new invisible secret passages.\n\nAs you can probably see by the length of this review, I have just had A BLAST playing this game. I am now just wishing for some DLC of sort that could add quests, items, heck even an entire new level with some good chiptune music. A retro boxed version would be awesome too. Anyway, It is a MUST-BUY for all you nostalgic gamers, especially of the 8-bit generation.\n\np.s. There is now a DRM-free version that include a Steam key on the author's website for those who feel somewhat uncomfortable with the "Steam-way".","November 2, 2014","true","22.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You are going to be exploring a large top-down overworld, you are going to scour side-scrolling dungeons, you are going to consult a myriad of townspeople, and you are going to find pieces of heart (not for you, however-- they're for the King).\n\nI always found Zelda 2's combat to be somewhat frustrating, so for Super Win the Game to NOT feature combat was, honestly, a sigh of relief. That makes it purely about exploration, about finding secrets in the overworld map, about trying to jump to impossible places, and all of the fun that Metroidvanias (and Zelda games) inspire.\n\nThe visuals are a little plain but the CRT shaders are awesome, pretty perfectly implemented. You can turn them off but I just don't think it's the same experience if you do that.\n\nEvery region has its own Metroid mini-map which is great, although I wish the mini-map had more indicators than just gems (checkpoint and keys on the map would have been nice as you discovered them). I like that you can buy a skeleton key if you don't feel like hunting down all the keys (which is probably hard to say because that is a pretty important part of the exploration). Fast travel probably could have been a bit better but it's servicable.\n\nUltimately the important thing is the price: It's just 8 bucks, and very cheap at sales time. This is a good cheap Metroidvania that does honor to the NES classics and evokes some of those old feelings in an organic and genuine way.","July 16, 2015","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I played You Have to Win The Game and enjoyed it immensely, partially because of the atmospheric CGA graphics, partially because I just thought it was good. I think there was more of the author's heart in it. It got to the point, showed you what was needed without showing you explicitly. There was no fluff.\nThis game... the CRT simulation (particularly the long ghosting) made me personally nauseous, to the extent that I had to turn it off (and then the game looked bad). This was unfortunate because the less-strong CRT simulation in YHTWTG was fantastic. The music was unatmospheric. I turned that off. What I was left with was a bunch of running around, doing nothing, talking to people who said nothing, really. It was boring. Worse, it was overpriced too.\nI expected better. I get the feeling the developer didn't really get any honest feedback with playtesting. Because ho-lee, this isn't worth $15. Though I was happy to pay to support the developer for his efforts in You Have To Win The Game.\nEventually I worked out which settings controlled the ghosting effect but getting into technical details that early in the game took the shine off it right away.","December 1, 2014","false","0.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It's a mixture of a few games like Zelda 2 for the NES, I wanna be the Guy and Mutant Mudds Deluxe. It's definitely still a unique experience and you will notice pretty quickly that the dev put a lot of effort into it.\n\nYou have an overworld map and enter several dungeons. You also have the ability to kinda "fast travel" since there is an underground map in which you can access doors to previously visited levels, if unlocked.\n\nThe only thing which I have to critisize is the pricing. 13 bucks is just a lot for this kind of game. Of course, it's an indie devoloper and all, but considering the content, the pricing simply just seems way too high. I'd suggest a pricing of 9 bucks or so. If I were you, I'd definitely wait for a sale. It's worth the wait. I bought this game on day one since I've been looking forward to this for a long time now.\n\nI havn't been disappointed but yet I wasn't surprised as well. I think it would be kind of unfair to rate this game as "generic 8bit-style platformer", but yeah. It's not MUCH more than that.\n\nHowever, I'll still recommend this game as it combines some very interesting gameplay elements into one game and it's fairly new so the dev still has some time to add new stuff.","October 1, 2014","true","2.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The game keeps with the retro feel so well that it even emulates a CRT television view, and allows you to tweak almost every aspect of it. The game itself it very well made and is quite fun. It follows a proper metroidvania styled progression for various abilities. A disappointing aspect is that you cannot damage the enemies, but it is acceptable as most of the time you can avoid them. Several of the platformer aspects are ridiculous, requiring perfect jumps and precision to get through, however they are quite possible. The soundtrack is quite good, not great but suits the game.

Its a game that looks like another popular Nintendo game, but it plays different. There is no attacking, only platforming. One hit and you're dead only to spawn at the last checkpoint bell.\n\nWhat's super about the game is that its in color and geared more toward the original Nintendo nostalgia rather than the Amiga nostalgia. With the old Nintendo naming conventions, "Super" was always relegated to those of the sixteen-bit console rather than the eight-bit. The game plays the same with more frills. You'll still explore and find new abilities like the double jump and wall cling, that let you get further.\n\nI enjoyed the predecessor, but SYHTWTG feels bland and generic as its name. The only thing fresh now is a color of paint, overhead maps and towns that offer hints and other frills like buying keys, loaning keys and buying skeleton keys. The keys are a tough sale for me, because you can find them out in the open and every door you unlock leads to either another door or something you need later in the game. You can find keys, but the skeleton key is your best value since all doors can open.\n\nThe game's currency is jewels. I would say diamonds, but since they have color they're jewels. You're told there's 128 in all and there are fortune tellers in town that let you know how many you've collected, how many deaths you've had, how much debt you've been in and where your next goal is located. Some might think being told where to go next is a cheat, but in an open world game where you need to return several times to previous locations is a welcome treat for anyone stuck. Its optional to speak with the teller.\n\nYour objective is to obtain six pieces of a king's heart. By pieces the game shows entire hearts rather than fragments. There's no sense of direction since the game is open world. You can invade any palace with your only restrictions being keys and abilities. There are a few palaces and a few dungeons here and there that look taken from a more popular game from the 80s.\n\nThis is a game about traversal, exploration and restriction. You will find things that let you turn hollow blocks into solids of specific colors. Gain the ability to swim through poison swamps, lava and sewage. Under water you have a high swim jump and a double jump to go along with it.\n\nWhile there is an over world map to get from place to place, the game also has a backdoor area that connects the first town and several key dungeons. You still need to find the dungeons before you can unlock the doors. Its a quick way to get back and forth instead of walking in the over world map, then crossing every bridge, going through every cave to find the dungeon you need.\n\nAt the end of a dungeon, once you have found whatever item you were there for, there is a book that puts you in a dream land. This is a surreal dreamland with a monochromatic look where you can jump on invisible platforms, wall climb invisible walls. It feels closer to the previous game and maybe that's why its here, to bridge that gap between the basic graphics and the full color.\n\nThere are a few towns and settlements, each has the same shops selling or loaning keys and fortune teller. The towns are for hints. You can find a few castles and a few quests, such as get me this item that gives you an ability. Then when you bring it to them they give you a jewel and let you keep the item.\n\nEverything feels so basic and maybe it did in the previous game too. The enemies are basic. Bats fly left and right, crabs, snakes and scorpions and snakes move left and right. There are spikes and death traps everywhere. It feels like the bare minimum of effort went into the game. Perhaps to make it feel as old school as possible. It still feels engaging, fun and challenging.\n\nI have had a few issues such as spawning on a checkpoint bell only to get killed again and again by a nearby enemy. Walking left when I died, only to spawn walking left and plunge into lava. Things like that. There's little to no wait between spawns. One good thing about the spawns is if you died getting something, you still have it. Which makes it a spawn rather than a restart.\n\nFor extra frills there are speed run challenge maps. Going into one of these rooms via a town map strips you of all abilities. You can regain abilities in the challenges as you find them again in the maps. I gave one a try, but it seemed to loop. I tried for eight minutes to find my way out, but I failed. There is no way to get back to the town where you originated, instead you need to exit out of the game and hope that alleviates the problem.\n\nThere is also a portal that will take you to an alternate land that feels like a bunch of small challenge dungeons. Go into each dungeon and find an icon to unlock the bridge in the map that leads to the next dungeon. It feels like stapled on content rather than part of the game, even if its still in the game and you keep all your abilities.\n\nThe sprites and look could be a lot better. You are a green elf sprite without arms. At a higher price, this would be tougher to recommend and even now I'm on the fence about it. For everything bad I've said about the game, its still tough to put down. Its easy with tough moments. Its a game we've all played before and it does it simple, but well.","January 27","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The sequel, Super Win the Game, goes a step further and boldly explores two new frontiers: the NES era, and a price tag. Is it worth the full price? Perhaps not, but you should still consider buying it anyway to show the developer your support for his labor of love. And that's not something I say very often!\n\nFirst of all, the CRT screen simulator. Wow. It's so perfect, I honestly feel like half of the price tag was for the CRT simuation alone. It's got everything: the tri-color pixels, the motion blur, the scan lines, the bulbous shape... and you can adjust the sharpness, tint, color saturation, overscan, and more, and basically tweak it to look like any old CRT monitor you might remember seeing in real life. The CRT screen in You Have to Win the Game was nothing in comparison. It's amazing and I seriously want to see this implemented in more retro-styled games.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the biggest addition is the Zelda II overworld which links levels together. Unfortunately, unlike Zelda II, are no random encounters, EXP grinding, or secret powerups to hunt for, so the whole world seems a bit empty to trudge through at times. However, the overworld does manage to thoughtfully explore some old ideas like challenge caves, secret caches and surprise interconnected areas. But in the end, it does end up feeling like the world is just a bit too small and devoid of content. I wish there was a moment like in Zelda II where you sail to East Hyrule and discover that the map is twice as big as you thought.\n\nThe music is all your standard flat NES chiptunes, and there's nothing too special about the soundtrack save for two or three showstopper tunes. The best music in the game, "The Razor's Edge," is in the trailer. It might not sound like much there, but it takes on a completely different meaning when it plays in the hardest levels in the game, and it's been stuck in my head all week.\n\nThe story was probably the only real negative for me. In this game, the great king of the land was possessed by an evil wizard and you have to restore him to the throne by collecting pieces of his heart, while a mysterious race of creatures from another world keep watch and guide you. But for some strange reason, instead of filling the game with fascinating spoilers that tell a compelling narrative (like who the Arcadians are, who you are, what was up with the world from the first game, etc...) the designer instead opted to fill it with angsty, incoherent livejournal posts. I'm getting real tired of this trend of indie developers who fill the story with stuff that's so deeply personal that nobody else is expected to understand it, and then they don't tie it in to the game's story or give the player the means to find the answers on their own through gameplay. At best, it's mildly thought-provoking, but at worst, it's really annoying that there are just no clear answers to be found.\n\nBut these complaints were all easy enough for me to ignore. There's something great about the game in the way the music, the sprites, the interconnected level design, and the CRT screen all come together and really make you feel like you're back in your childhood living room playing Nintendo on a Saturday morning. For me it even managed to conjure some vibes of mystery and curiosity that even Shovel Knight couldn't. This game gets nostalgia, and I'm happy to support it.\n\n(Achievement hunters: It's an easy 100% in less than 10 hours, though you might need a walkthrough to find the last few gems)","June 16, 2015","true","8.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What does it add for the things it lacks?\n\nOptionally, it can be experienced in CRT mode. CRT mode is everything bad about playing on old style TVs. Fuzzy moire hexagonal screen pixels, color bleeding, curved screen distortion, invisible overscan and rounded off image corners, motion blur/phosphor burn, reflections on the CRT frame. Even rolling screen, RF interference, and static make an appearance. But it's nostalgic... I think this might well be the only Linux game that has "action safe" and "title safe" design (google it). CRT mode is also tunable to better match the old TV players used when they had no other choice. Personally, I found CRT mode to be worth 15 seconds of enjoyment, then I switched it off. But, that's just my personal preference. Turning off CRT mode does not result in 'modern' graphics. Without the CRT mode, this game is about gameplay only.\n\nIt also ads some sort of quasi-bonus, playable dream segments. Same gameplay but confusing transdimensional level design and dialog I cannot make any sense of. The author admits that the dream segments are about something deeply personal. With that, I expect few would understand. This is OK, the dream segments don't require the player do do anything except progress through them and the author hasn't decided to leave the gaming industry or threaten to (like some others have after their deeply personal game designing went uninterpreted).\n\nAll sorts of game mechanics make up the game. Double-jumping, wall clinging, wall jumping, invisible structures, switch-on platforms, etc... Each one needs to be earned. Each new ability opens more areas to explore and more places to discover when revisiting. And to make 100% completion, full expert use of each mechanic will be required.\n\nThere are no map spoilers. Get out your oldskol grid paper and start making checklists if you want to do a 100% completion of the game. Once again, this seems a deliberate feature to invoke nostalgia.\n\nSpeedruns are also added to the mix. Complete with online leader boards.\n\nFinally, death is instant but not costly. Everything kills the player without HP, shield, or mercy. The player cannot eliminate enemies at all, only earn better methods to avoid them. In contrast, pretty much every door is a retry point.\n\nIn short, I you like(d) NES games, or have never tried NES games, SWTG is for you.","December 20, 2015","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game does everything the first game did only better. It has WAY more atmosphere because of the awesome, mysterious dialogue throughout. The Zelda 2-esque world map gave me nostalgia like you wouldn't believe. In a big way, this is sort of like a pure platformer, non-violent version of Zelda 2. The way you need to travel throughout the world and gain items and clues to progress is very similar.\n\nThis is, in essence, sort of a Metroidvania. The difference being, as I said before, there is no combat. This is a pure exploration platformer. You explore the world, find items and clues, and you platform to victory. The platforming is great, the exploration is great, and the clues are very fair overall. I had a few frustrating moments, but coming back to the game with a fresh mind always solved any problems I had.\n\nIf you love oldschool platforming, you will love this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/310700/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Metroidvania is a fan coined genre for the type of games that mix Metroid and Castlevania style gameplay. In those types of games, one must traverse through a dark/alien/foreign land and acquire power-ups to progress. Sections of the game may be skipped through skillful techniques, but most everyone should be able to see the end with enough fortitude and prowess.\n\nSuper Win the Game is a sequel to You Have to Win the Game. While it shares the same protagonist and general gameplay, the differences are immediately apparent upon starting. Not only is there a more in-depth tutorial, but the game has music. Along with that, more power-ups are placed in the world that grant access to different areas based on certain themes (lava, water, double-jump, etc).\n\nThe original game was a very simple idea. If one practiced enough, they could finish the game in under 10 minutes. Super Win the Game feels exactly like Super Metroid did to it's predecessor. Everything is bigger, more colorful and full of more detail. The level design is large, but not overly so. Progression is not limited to a linear path, even if the game will subtlely guide you to the correct area should you get lost.\n\nThat feature is easily the best part about Super Win the Game's accessibility. Older puzzle platformers would often leave the player high and dry. In a time of desperation, you would just quit the game or end up buying a strategy guide. Super Win the Game allows you to interact with a scant few NPCs, but each provides a hint that will further progression through the game world.\n\nThe level design also quickly allows you to figure out whether or not you are capable of getting past any specific sections. If you are lacking the red aura, you cannot enter lava. Instead of getting 4 screens into the next section, the game immediately throws a lava room at you to warn about the lack of upgrade.\n\nEvery item you acquire is automatic. The one options at your disposal are jump and talk. You press Up to enter doors, but the game keeps everything simple. You will never run into a section that has you firing off rounds or stomping on enemies to finish a section.\n\nEnemies are pretty much obstacles. While they shoot out projectiles and obscure paths, you never need to kill any of them. You actually can't kill any of them, which makes this platformer unique. Now everything is based around avoidance and how quick you can react to a changing situation.\n\nIt makes Super Win the Game have tense moments in what would otherwise be a rather empty world. Sadly, not all that glitters is gold. Since the enemies are basically window dressing, it can be quite hard to truly call them stand out. The level design is also basically the same through-out the adventure.\n\nEach area is made of very similar tiles, just with swapped color palettes. The very final level is wholly it's own, but getting lost is an easy feat in Super Win the Game. I know this was made with the mindset of a classic SNES adventure, but even just a bit more variety would be welcome.\n\nI also feel like the dream sequences break the flow of the game. They do not last long, but they aren't really necessary to the experience. Conquering the final "boss" doesn't have a meaningful conclusion and the game mostly throws out psuedo-psychological questions. I am all for exploring deeper themes in games, but only if those themes end up being fleshed out or relevant.\n\nEven with those flaws, Super Win the Game is a great little indie title. Developed by two people, this game is leagues ahead of most of it's contemporaries. That is evokes a charm of the "golden era" of platformers is just icing on the cake. I'd say get this if you have a longing for yesteryear or just want a solid platformer to play.\n\n8/10","March 11, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Personally, I think it delivers.\n\nGameplay wise the game is an extension on the original, with a greater variety of areas to explore, as well as a new overworld map for travelling between areas. There is also a more structured attempt at a storyline this time around. I think this game was a little easier than the first, although there are still some very challenging areas that will take multiple attempts to progress through.\n\nThe game retains the MetroidVania style item-collecting and backtracking through previously visited areas with new abilities in order to collect missed stuff and reach more new areas. The game itself is not too long (although much longer than the original), so it never felt boring having to go back to areas too much, I finished it in about 5 hours although I think it could be done much faster than this if you know the path to take, and like the first game this could lend itself well to speedrunning.\n\nGraphically, the game is a near-perfect homage to the NES era of home consoles, the visual design has not-too-subtle hints of Zelda II (not to mention the overworld map and the layout of towns and dungeons are clear references to this game). The game looks lovely on it's own, but I have to commend the developer for their CRT TV simulation which is even better than it was in the first game, and really adds to that retro feel.\n\nI have to highlight the music in the game as well, which is just wonderful, anyone who likes retro game music or chiptunes in general will absolutely love this soundtrack.\n\nOverall I highly reccomend this game, and would urge anyone that had fun with 'You Have To Win The Game' to check it out!","January 13","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is almost too open; it's hard to get a sense of where you should go next (and when you're done with an area), and I don't feel invested in any particular area when I can walk across practically the entire world map uninterrupted. If I can just walk into whatever dungeon I want, it doesn't feel like there's much separating the different areas from one another. The map looks big, but there's actually relatively few explorable areas. (The desert, while hardly the only example, is illustrative here: there are basically just three areas in the entire desert, despite it taking up quite a few tiles on the map. There are no enemies to fight and no challenges to encounter between the desert town and the desert ruins, which makes me question why the desert is there at all. Pretty much every area in the game is like this to a greater or lesser degree.)\n\nThe game is mostly pretty easy, though there are a couple rooms with a challenge level that's way out of scope compared to everything around them. There's no combat; there are enemies who can kill you, but you can't affect them in any way, so they're really just mobile obstacles rather than true enemies. This isn't necessarily the worst thing ever (I can respect a game with no fighting), but the fact that there aren't really very many of these enemies just intensifies the lack of feeling of challenge or opposition. There really isn't much standing in the way of anything you want to do; there are mobility upgrades you need before you can explore everywhere, but since you can just walk from one area to the next with basically nothing in your way, there's no struggle to get back to an area once you've picked up the relevant item. The entire game just seemed to lay itself at my feet, which made me question why I was bothering in the first place.\n\nTo give credit where it is due, I found the control scheme to be intuitive and reliable. The game's simple enough that it would be downright embarrassing for it to not have a simple control scheme, but I still felt like the controls were responsive, and I never really felt the need to blame the controls for any screw-ups I may have made. I played with an Xbox 360 controller, and it worked perfectly from the get-go.\n\nThe game's most unique feature is the graphical CRT simulation. The game does a good job of making itself look like you're playing it on an old TV, right down to a little reflection visible at the edge of the screen. Whether this is actually a good thing is debatable; I admit that it pushed a nostalgia button or two, but in general, I don't find myself pining for the days of old unreliable CRTs. The CRT simulation is cute, but it's ultimately nothing more than a gimmick, and I wouldn't count it as a selling point for the game.\n\nThe music is forgettable and fairly annoying. I respect chiptunes when they've got strong melodies, but that isn't the case with this game. It's tinny and artificial for the sake of being tinny and artificial, and the melodies aren't interesting enough to make up for the low technical quality. (Several areas also have songs that really don't seem to have anything to do with the mood of the area in question, which doesn't do the game any favors.)\n\nOverall, I just never felt challenged playing this game. Without challenge, there's no real sense of accomplishment, so the whole thing was ultimately disappointing. I admit that I just beat the game without getting 100% of the gems, but I wasn't sufficiently invested in the game to really want to spend the time getting 100% completion. There's no real feeling of progression, even as you travel from area to area and pick up upgrade after upgrade. I understand that the game isn't asking for a lot of money, but you really aren't getting a lot of game in return for your investment.","July 27, 2015","false","3.6"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/310700/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Super Win The Game is an adventure-platformer, with an overworld map linking together multiple short levels and some bigger dungeons.\n\nLittle bells are found very frequently, they are checkpoints and prevent the difficult platforming from being frustrating. The difficulty is not extreme, everything is manageable without being easy either.\n\nHowever, what is frustrating is the backtracking and the adventuring. The player can unlock new abilities (survive underwater, survive in lava) which permit access to new parts of the levels. So the player has to go back to each previously completed dungeon, and try to find out where such a restricted area was located, then explore a few new rooms, then backtrack to another dungeon in search for other areas. In a similar manner, there are different entrances to dungeons (main entrance or doors from a HUB), but these entrances are not even located at the same place. In consequence, all the dungeons are confusing and the game is hard to navigate. What would have been better is one huge castle with teleporters, like Castlevania, with a map that is easy to read and finding the areas that have not been accessed yet is not a pain. Another level design mistake is to have areas important for the progression be hard to find, almost like a secret (I am talking about the Swim ability in the desert).\n\nThe different abilities to unlock include double-jump and wall-jump. Those are great, the character is a joy to control as he reacts instantly to the touch of a button. Way better than any Mario and his inertia. Win The Game really has the best platforming feel I have ever experienced, thanks to the excellent controls.\n\nThe graphics are mostly hideous, especially the caves. Thankfully, the engine with (customisable) CRT effects is great and gives a nice touch to the game that the graphics could not achieve alone. The music is so repetitive it becomes annoying, not enough tracks.\n\nThe story was not appealing to me, in the end it is almost as if there was no story but it does not matter as I wanted to play a good platformer and that's what I got.... When I was not being annoyed by having to walk back and forth to uncover newly unlocked areas. So in conclusion, I liked the engine and platforming of this game, but I hated the adventuring and the graphics. So I recommend more You Have To Win The Game, the previous free game from the same developper. This game.... could have been so much better, Oh, I really liked the extra speedrun dungeons because they are self-contained and do not require to switch from level to level. Their only issue is that it is not possible to exit a level without completing it.\n\nSo yeah.... it plays super well but moving around killed my fun. Thumbs down because I cannot recommend it blindly. I wish there was a "neutral" button instead.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=622827878","February 12","false","10.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This game is definitely a must have if you are into deathless runs, speedruns, races with pals, or just for some pure nostalgia. One minor issue I have with the game, however, is that you can't really attack anything, so some unfair traps are to be expected. Despite limited combat and a few mean areas, the difficulty remains fair and simple, one of the hallmarks of a great NES game.\n\nOverall, this game is highly recommended if you're looking for a nostalgia bomb or trying to find ways to challenge yourself even further.

I recommend this, and the first game to anyone liking sidescrolling action and who loved osme of the old nes action side scrollers. there is no combat, which makes it even more nostalgic for some older nes players. the first game didn't have the overworld element, but the action and gameplay  is as good.","June 12, 2015","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the end, however, it's a cheap excuse to rake in excess money, for minimal effort. This is a $0.99 game if not Free To Play, being charged for at a ridiculous price. I've had more fun hanging out on public transit, paying my bills and doing the dishes than playing this dreck.","October 2, 2014","false","3.1"," 8 of 35 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","8","35","0","1"

While I must admit that I was dissapointed that it wasn't free like the first one was, I am happy to say that it was well worth the money. The controls feel spot on, and make most of the deaths feel like your fault (sometimes you respawn in such a way to fall right onto passing enemies, but it's far and few in between when it does happen). Respawning is very quick and the music keeps right on playing, which by the way is very good in it's own right. I'd buy the sound track if it had one.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, it's not insanely hard to beat, which is good. There are several power ups to find along the way and 6 hearts to find to unlock the final dungeon, which are a bit cryptic to find, but luckily there's an npc in one of the first towns that can lead you to them. It has several fake walls that are about 50/50 in terms of secrecy. Some you can kinda tell are fake or can be passed through, but others catch you off guard. It has some invisible blocks, but none placed in such a way to prevent you from jumping over chasms.\n\nI didn't 100% the game, cause going gem hunting isn't my cup of tea but if it's yours then there's a secret world map full of challenge courses for you to test your skill in.\n\nAll in all, a very good game. No real complaints to be had with it. Well worth its full price.","December 19, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"More is less" has never been truer than in this case. YHTWTG was full of mystery and essential, without useless  frills, just like the games that it tried to reinterpret. Super Win the Game adds boredom to the formula. The "story", the "shops", the people, the villages, the short looped music and the world map don't add anything to the game in terms of gameplay. While YHTWTG was a perfect recreation of the early PC games I can't say the same for SWTG; it's inspired by the NES era this time, but the game doesn't feel like a NES game at all. I'm still recommending the game though, why? Firstly, to support the developer who did an amazing job with YHTWGT and from whom I would like to see other products. Secondly, because SWTG is not a bad old school game by any means, it's just less inspired than its predecessor.","June 21, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
