It is a cheap port for hit and run money of a great franchise with no effort of restoring or respecting the originals whatsoever\n\nTake my advice and do not ruin this wonderful experience by playing this crippled version and do yourself the favor of playing the pc original\n\nIt trully is a magical journey, but this is like the trailer highlights, minus the core world escense and natural magic of Atlantis, the way its artists created it to be enjoyed","June 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 63 of 69 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","63","69","0","0"

I bought this expecting not to use the CDs anymore.

Although I never figured out the puzzles then, I was able to now. There are some things that were changed in the version I bought than the one that was on the disk. There were less sequences and some of the puzzles solved itself. The icons on which you clicked to engage the item was a target and it was like playing google street view. But In summary it was a very satisfying game and closed one more chapter in my childhood. I would recemmend it if it wasn't too short ( Beat it 3 hours.). But it was a good game indeed. My favorite thing about this game was the soundtrack. 10/10 would listen.","June 2, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It didn't...\nThe game has a nice storyline and the animation in between is interesting too. The video-quality is pretty good for a game that old. Besides that, the game lacks difficulty. There are basically no puzzles (or they solve themselves) which takes away the most interesting part for me. I've read in other reviews that the game has been altered a lot compared to the original game, so I guess it once was a good game, but now it's not anymore. Disappointed...","May 11","false","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
