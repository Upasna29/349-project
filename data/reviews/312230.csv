"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/recommended/312230/","FreakOramaXD","FreakOrama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/","737 products in account","Spirits of Xanadu is one horror game, out of few, that I like and enjoy playing, because it focuses on atmosphere, music, story, and narration with nice voice acting, but aside from all that, it's good horror game in my eyes because it uses the atmosphere and its environment to inject fear in you.\n\nHow this game does it's thrills is, again, it's great atmosphere, and how the enemies that want to kill you are all in their place, doing their own thing, and will attack you because they saw you, not because they know exactly where you are, and they won't magically appear in front or behind you to cheaply scare and kill you, like most other horror games do.\n\nAnother great thrilling aspect about the game that makes me fearful of it, is how they do illusions by letting you see these space ghosts from time to time while exploring the ship. They magically appear and disappear, but in a slow seamless way, and these ghosts are not trying to scare you in the since of a quick spook, but more in the way that they're watching you, and you see them doing they're own thing rather than to stupidly scare you, it's what I'd like to call a cool scare.\n\nThe game looks great by the way, yea it's just simple plain colors with simple structures from the looks of it, but with nice lighting, great affects, and 'not' crappy models with a great amount of them, it all combines together to make great scenes to look at. I also want to give extra credit to the team for making small quality details like books with readable titles and good quality pictures on them, and having me think that the environment I was in feel like it was lived in before, just from look at rooms and finding nice notes.\n\nSpeaking of notes, the game is filled with just enough story content like notes and voice recorders, that it kept me interested in that story throughout my duration of playing the game. Some these notes were mostly interesting to read, but some are part of, what I feel, the environment as a means of making the world/ship believable, which was kind of cool. The voice recorders are awesome, with great voice acting, and ones that are unique with how everyone has their own thoughts and personalities, but they all share the same despair and downfall. So the story, in all angles, is great.\n\nGoing to gameplay, you start off with a laser gun with unlimited ammo, so scavenging for resources of any kind is not necessity, which I'm kind of happy about, but I'm not against having them if done correctly in a game like amnesia. The gun play in the game is decent but a bit jittery when zooming, although I haven't found myself zooming much, firing from the hip was more optimal. You have to look for items to collect, and usually place them in other areas or machines, fix broken machinery, and maybe find some clues to open locked optional doors for added content like a different gun.\n\nWhat I like about the whole experience that the game throws you into the game with no hand holding of any kind mostly, as in no tutorials, no objective markers, nothing, you have to figure it out with the notes in the game or audio log, or just plain figuring it out. That can be viewed as a negative also, but for me It's an alright thing to put in (or not to put in) as the stuff you have to do is not insanely hard, it's manageable.\n\nOverall I had a great experience playing Spirits Of Xanadu, I'd even compare to Alien Isolation, obviously not in graphical power, technicalities, or gameplay elements, but in story, atmosphere, and voice acting, all of them being low level nice qualities, but a worthy comparison to note. The asking price can be argued upon, as the game isn't long, but it is a great experience, for me I'd say 10$ is its sweet spot, but I'm not against the original price.\n\nShameless link[ksalue.com] to original post.","March 26, 2015","true","2.5"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","43","49","3","0"

There is a vessel that has gone silent for some reason. You are sent to the vessel to assess the situation and then fix anything that needs to be fixed to assure that the vessel will return to earth properly. The difference is that in Dead Space, this is just some explanation for getting you on board the ship full of aliens so that you can start shooting aliens. Sometimes a guy on a radio tells you to fix something and you press A to fix it. But in Xanadu, you actually have to like… figure out how to disable the rogue turret outside the engine room, then disable it, then break into the engine room and look at the engine to figure out why it’s not working, which is partly obvious (replace fuses, unjam the cogs, etc), but it also means performing some quasi-Myst-like gameplay where you fiddle around with knobs and switches and buttons until something interesting starts to happen.\n\nThere are also audio logs and text notes you can find, as well as computers you can log onto to read emails and such, which fulfills the part of the mission where you’re trying to investigate what happened. But the weird thing is… and this is coming from a guy who nearly always HATES audio logs and note pages… I actually am really enjoying finding them and reading/listening to them?\n\nThey are actually really well written (and the VO is not bad at all), and there is an interesting element of the story that adds an interesting quirk to a lot of the messages. But I also like that the logs and stuff you find aren’t just exposition dumps. You also find the sorts of notes and things that people would actually write down. You might find the recipe for an omelet, or a scrap of paper on which someone has simply scribbled down the Konami code (ha ha). One of the audio logs was made by one of the crew, who got really drunk and basically just drunk dialed his voice recorder. I literally laughed when he starts talking about his girlfriend’s hair for some reason and about how it looks “very Roman… like the hair a Roman would have”. The sort of weird, incomprehensible babbling your drunk friend would actually say.\n\nThe most obvious sign this is an adventure game though? I've never played a shooter where I had to get out a pen and paper to SOLVE ONE OF ITS PUZZLES. But you will have to do that at least once here. Don't be scared, though. The puzzle quality is very good. Just remember to be very thorough.\n\nUsing my own scale below, I give Spirits of Xanadu a hearty 7!\n\nI WANT MORE GAMES LIKE THIS.\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.\n4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.","December 29, 2015","true","5.0"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","39","45","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirnameless/recommended/312230/","sirnameless","TheBraveSirRobin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirnameless/","266 products in account","Spirits of Xanadu is an atmospheric first person adventure game with simplistic combat and graphics, light puzzle and exploration aspects and a well-told, interesting story.\nIt is set during an alternate version of the 1980's on an unresponsive research vessel, the Xanadu, which is in orbit around a planet far from Earth, and, playing in the shoes of a one-man recovery team, you are instructed to return the ship the and all of it's research material back to Earth to it's corporate owners even at the cost of the well-being of the crew. You start the game on a small recovery vessel making it's final docking approach on the Xanadu, and once aboard it you have nothing more than a flashlight, a laser pistol and your wits to complete your task (although technically you could never pick up those two items and complete the game in complete darkness without shooting anything).\n\nThere is no hand-holding or tutorials or explicit guidance given. Period. The puzzles are simple, the map is small, there are only be a few weapons to collect and a handful of enemy types to fight, but discovering what happened to the Xanadu and completing your mission entirely through your own actions makes the whole experience feel surprisingly rewarding.\n\nThe atmosphere of this game is something to behold in and of itself, though, and it's carefully crafted by a combination of the impeccable presentation of the mystery of the Xanadu and the game world's incredible immersiveness. You discover the details what happened to the Xanadu primarily through tape recordings made by it's three former inhabitants which are scattered around the ship, hidden but put in logical places. There's even poems and notes that you can find that add even more intrigue and flavor to the narrative but the recordings truly are unforgettable. These personal accounts of the crew's self-destruction and are believable, well-written, and incredibly well voice acted, and playing through the game subtly becomes more and more tense as you learn about the what caused this cryptic tragedy and realize that, soon, you too will suffer their fate. The tone of this game's atmosphere is pitch perfect for me: unsettling and bleak but not outright terrifying or unbelievable or depressing (in other words, it's almost completely devoid of any melodrama).\n\nAnd, going hand in hand with the presentation of the story, no detail of the interior of the Xanadu is out of place besides the occasional easter egg. The interactivity of the enviroment, while oddly limited in some ways, is, overall, realistic and and the limitations prevent it from being distracting or superfluous (this is not a Visceral Cleanup Detail rip-off). It feels like you're exploring a real space ship suited for interstellar travel and research, and, while I'm on this topic, I will mention that thorough exploration is necessary for experiencing everything all this game has to offer, but its small scale prevents any serious tedium in this endeavor.\n\nThe only real problem with the immersion of the game is that the design of the enemies and how you fight them is not nearly as interactive as the enviroment they inhabit. Each one attacks you in their own, singular, boring way, and you just have to shoot them to kill them (except for the security drones which you can shut off if you can sneak up behind them). One enemy type, which I call kamikaze robots, are especially frustrating to deal with because their one attack pattern is to run up to you and destroy themselves and you with a fatal explosion. It's nearly impossible to stop them before they get within arms reach since they have plenty of health with no weakpoints, they run faster than you, and most areas of the ship are quite confined and free of obstructions to juke them with. A seperate but related issue in the immersion is that some of the enemies (including the aformentioned kamikaze robots) are somehow capable of respawning on a derelict ship in space for no reason and the debris from potentially infinite encounters with these respawning enemies causes performance degradation over a playthrough.\n\nAll in all, this is a great indie game that can engage you with it's enigmatic and disconcerting atmosphere and make you think. Even if it's light on the play-time and mechanical depth, it can be just enough to make a lasting impression on those that play it.\n\nEDIT: Added much, much, much more detail.","July 12, 2015","true","4.5"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

The look of this game is simple, yet functional. What this game has going for it however is a strong atmosphere, great writing and a huge attention to detail. This is not only a game that rewards your curiousity and attentive exploration, it demands it!\n\nIf you're unattentive, you might start the game without a flashlight. Or you might overlook that you can repair a fuse and turn on the lights and play the whole game in a dark ship, only with your flashlight. Or you might miss a new weapon. Or you might overlook the myriad of hidden clues, notes, scribblings and hints.\n\nIn fact that's what happened to me. My first playthrough was quite short (around 3 hours) and I thought I found almost everything. Imagine my surprise when I found out I only got about one third of the story (and a bad ending)!\n\nI probably don't have to mention that this game has been inspired by System Shock; that's pretty clear from the trailer and the description. I can just reassure you that this is not a low-cost remake of SS, this is an interesting and original take on the "investigate a spaceship that stopped communicating" theme (of which there is not enough if you ask me :). Just be prepared to work hard for a complete understanding of what really happened and a chance of changing the ship's fate (and yours).","March 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","0"

But it is, if you define horror as a feeling of unease.\n\n(Medical/scientific/research) space vessel Xanadu is being stranded far away in deep space. There's no feedback from its crew in months. Now, the Earth command sends you to find Xanadu, discover it secrets and return it home.\n\nWhat you're about to discover is desolate and claustrophobic ship that will tell you its story of madness, sickness and betrayal via torn out pages, scattered documents and audiologs. You'll encounter murderous machines that will try to stop you from finding a way to return Xanadu home. You'll be able to finish the mission in several ways and only your choices will bring you peace... or eternal damnation.\n\nSpirits of Xanadu high selling points is excellent retro feel and story that truly fits the game atmosphere, genre and overall feeling that you get playing. Game aesthetics are creme de la creme of 80's minimalism, and the fact developing team even added so called Peaceful mode that lets you solve mysteries without being attacked (unless you attack first) makes this game a good choice for players not wanting to fight, but only to think.\n\nSpirits of Xanadu is often compared to other games, but I'll say it reminded me greatly of movies such as Alien and Event Horizon. I wouldn't dare to compare Xanadu to Sevastopol (Alien Isolation), but I would call it scary in its own way, the way you'll learn to love.\n\nSpirits of Xanadu's puzzles are logical and balanced, so they'll give you a natural feeling of progress while you solve 'em.\n\nThis is top horror indie title, one of the few that I'll play again and again... until I get all the logs, pages, endings and secrets. And I think that means a lot.\n\n***\nIf you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews","April 2, 2015","true","3.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","2"

We all have that itch, because for some reason not many devs tackle this genre. I enjoyed my playthrough and there's even three different endings that require some work and a lot of exploring and decision-making on your own.\nWhat I liked is that you truly have some freedom of choice here. You board the Xanadu, you find out what's going on, and then you decide how to apply that knowledge. You'll get rewarded with one of the respective outcomes. You have to do all the exploring and thinking yourself, so it has that nice early 90s feel to it.\n\nHowever, for the price I expected more depth and complexity. The combat is rather bland and generic, I think I saw some of these guns and models in other Unity games before. This is somewhat of a mood-killer. (EDIT: saw it in "King of the Wood" which was made by the same devs. So disregard that.)\n\nI hope the devs keep working together.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebassclef/recommended/312230/","thebassclef","Detective Philip Marlowe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebassclef/","217 products in account","This might just be one of my favorite games.\n\nNow don't be fooled, this isn't a shooter, at least not really. It has shooting in it, yes, but that's not the focus and there are a limited number of enemies which will never respawn. The map is also fairly small but very easy to navigate once you've been through once or twice (and get the lights on) I'd say this is far more of a puzzle game with an incredible atmosphere. The majority of the gameplay revolves around puzzle solving while occasionally shooting robots. The puzles for the most part aren't all that difficult, with the exception of one which leads you to one of the three endings. The minimalist style might be a bit offputting depending on your sensibilites but I personaly thought it looked pretty nice. (again, after I got the lights on, Before then it COULD be a bit difficult to figure out what you're doing or where you're going)\n\nNow, onto the thing the game get's REALLY right: atmosphere. This game scares the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of me, but not because of cheap and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumpscares. From the very second you step out of your little pod you are instilled with a deep sense of dread and a feeling of "something ain't right here..." There are a handful of scares but you could go through the game and completely miss all of them because there isn't some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ musical sting to startle you and in most cases when they happened I spent a second asking myself "Did I actually see that?" and that is what I love so much about this game, it's smart with its scares and baths the entire experience in a rich atmosphere that stuck with me even after I turned the game off.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is incredible as well, at least for the most part. I personally thought the voice actor they had for Solomon Agnew stole the show and the other two voice actors they had weren't quite on par with his performance. Not to imply they were bad, quite the contrary, they just weren't quite as good and it was pretty noticeable to me.\n\nThe game however is pretty short (maybe 1.5-2 hours if you're quick about things, 3 if you take your time a bit) and despite being very replayable I don't know if that's really worth the $10 it's being sold for. Additionally the game doesn't seem to be optimized very well. I'm not playing on a very poweful machine but I can generally get away with playing most modern indies on mid to lower settings, but Spirits of Xanadu had very frequent framerate drops and even on the absolute lowest settings I was barely pushing 20 fps most of the time so if you're running on a budget machine keep that in mind. The default controls are pretty wacky as well so before you start the game I'd highly recommend going through and changing everything to your liking, as well as lowering the mouse sensitivity. Speaking of the mouselook, perhaps it's just me but the mouselook didn't feel very great in this game. I can't quite nail down what it is but now matter how much I fiddled with the sensitivity and whatnot it just never felt quite right.\n\nAll that said though, if you're looking for an atmospheric horror game with a super solid story then Spirits of Xanadu is gonna be exactly what you're looking for. Seriously, please please please play this game and give these guys your money, they really deserve it.\n\nUPDATE: So sometime before I wrote this review an update was rolled out that was at least partially focused on optimization and the game runs like a dream on my computer now. There are also a few things I wanted to mention but left out of my inital review because at the time of writing I hadn't actually played the game in some time and was just going off about a dozen or so YouTube videos. 1. You can choose between a female and male character. It literally doesn't do anything other than change the grunts you make when you're injured but it's a neat little addition nonetheless.\n2. There are 4 different difficulties, one of which being a peaceful mode that makes it so the enemies won't attack you unless you shoot first. I particularly like that one for repeat playthroughs because for me the second (and subsequent) run through the game was a "Lets find the things I missed the first time!" kind of run and it's nice to not have to worry about the bots going after you.\n3. The endings. I mentioned that there was more than one ending but I didn't go any deeper than that and I thought I should. There's your standard good and bad ending (Although they won't be exactly what you think, at least not right off the bat) and there is also a really neat ambiguous and kinda trippy ending that I really like but is a massive pain to actually achieve (there are walkthroughs for those of us who simply don't have the time/brain power to figure it all out) Those endings are part of what provide the game wiht so much replayability.\n4. The characters. What kind of reviewer am I to mention voice actors without mentioning characters? Well it's simple, I'm not a professional. Anyway, There are three main characters in the game; Solomon Agnew, Lucy Zhao, and Cornell Johns. You never meet any of them throughout the game but in listening to the various audiologs in the game you really get a sense as to who each of these people were. I felt like I really knew these chracters as people which makes it all the more hearbreaking as you piece everything together and learn of their fates and that really is a testament to the strength of the writing and voice acting.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely need to mention is that the mouselook is fine. The issues I was experiencing I think were directly related to the low framerates I was getting and had absolutely nothing to do with the game itself. After the optimization update it feels great.","January 11","true","6.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","1"

However, between some dated graphics, clunky UI, and some design choices that did not survive the test of time, I just didn't get the experience I was looking for.\n\nSo, I am happy that Spirits of Xanadu scratches that particular itch.  It is a moody FPS adventure set in an alternate timeline where humans were a space-faring race in the early 1980s.  SS2 has been distilled down to its essence.  The control scheme is simple enough that a ham-handed gamer like myself can't mess up too badly when I inevitably wander into a room patrolled by the ship's hostile defense system.\n\nPerformance has been a bit of an issue for me.  My main gaming computer is a laptop, which doesn't help.  However, the developers have thoughtfully included video options that are accessible from within the in-game menu.  I am able to experiment with different graphic settings without being forced to restart the program.\n\nI would say that if you are like me, and you're looking for a more streamlined experience than System Shock or Alien: Isolation offered, you would probably be happy with this budget-friendly nugget of panic and claustrophobia.","March 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","22","31","0","1"

But that's just the starting point for your adventures on the "Xanadu".\nI really liked this game. It may not be the longest or most spectacular one ever, but what it sets out to do it does well and competently. And I would rather have a game within a confined space that's well made than one with an open world that feels empty and lifeless. At times this reminded me of Amnesia, at other times of Duke Nukem 3D. The theme appeals to me and if you get it on sale (at full price some might feel short-changed because of the length of the game) you can't go wrong - I've spent more money and time on movies that weren't half as much fun or intriguing.\n\nThe Good\nVery atmospheric, good mix between sci-fi, mystery and horror.\nLots of things to do, the main story may be straight forward, but there are multiple layers to be found and you can interact with a suprisingly large number of environmental objects.\nNot only because of that the game is a lot of fun which mixes nicely with the suspense you feel in other parts and the combat elements.\nThe graphic may not look spectacular, but it fits the theme perfectly. You feel like you are in a sterile, hostile environment with dangers all around you.\nThe sound is another strong point of the game, a little clank here, a rumbling in the vent there...well done\nNo bugs, the only one I encountered was gone after exiting and restarting the game. Although this is something that should be standard, we all know there are loads of games on steam that are a different in that regard. It feels nice to play a finished product, a polished game.\nThe Average\nThe combat is a bit bare bones, you can get three different weapons, there are four different types of opponents... but it doesn't need to be any different or more varied. This isn't a shooter in space, you can beat the game by sneaking, too, if you want to.\nThe respawning mechanic puts you in a certain place on the ship which makes exploring and achieving some objectives a bit tedious from time to time.\nAs for the bad, as far as I'm concerned I found nothing negative to say about it. You realize the devs put a lot of thought and love for detail into it and it shows. Of course, you can speedrun it and finish the story in a very short amount of time - and you might feel disappointed then saying "Wait, that was it?"

Inspired by the likes of System Shock, Deus Ex and Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is Spirits of Xanadu.\n\nSet in an alternate 1980s, at the farthest edge of the explored universe, the research ship Xanadu lies in orbit of an unknown planet. With communications down and no word from the crew in several months, a lone operative is sent in to revive the dead ship and bring her back to Earth.\n\nAs that solo explorer, your job is to find out what went wrong aboard the now-abandoned ship while working out how to restore her systems and return the ship home. Along the way, you’ll discover there’s more to this story than just a technical hitch and through audio logs, memos and hidden pages of a book, you’ll begin to unravel the mystery behind the missing crew.\n\nIf I’m completely honest, my expectations going into this game were low. Let’s face it, the sci-fi horror genre has seen it’s fair share of clangers over the last few years and I feared Spirits of Xanadu might follow that same path. How wrong I was.\n\nThe developers cite System Shock as one their main influences, but Xanadu screams of that games “spiritual successor” Bioshock in terms of quality immersive storytelling set in an eerie atmosphere, much like the corridors of Rapture, the dark and gloomy decks of this spaceship will get under your skin. Spirits of Xanadu boosts the game far above your run of the mill sci-fi horror indie games, it adds a level of depth and substance to the game that you wouldn’t expect.\n\nThrough the clues you find, you begin to unravel the stories of three of the crew members on their last days aboard the ship. You learn that each of them has their own tales to tell and they all intertwine into an in-depth and well thought out story which works perfectly with this genre.\n\nThe game-play itself is complimented considerably by this storytelling quality, hats off to the developers for making such an interactive environment, it really displays the passion for their craft. The environment has a plethora of things to explore, from simply being able to open any desk draw or access a computer terminal to a fully functional in-game arcade machine loaded with a zombie shooter, you can even smoke yourself to the point of death. The game is quite dark in it’s approach sometimes but the level of realism is superb.\n\nThe game offers full controller support using the standard FPS configuration, though if you’re more of a keyboard and mouse gamer you’ll get the same familiarity from the WASD control scheme. To aid you on your mission you’ll have find a couple of different weapons along the way, essentially a pistol, a shotgun and a machine gun, all very useful against the laser-wielding robots which now populate the ship.\n\nAs you work your way through the vessel you’ll find a number of interactive terminals which allow you to save your mission progress as well as display the ships CCTV system. The seamless transaction from aiming your firearm to using the terminal is impressive to say the least, there is no load time, no delay whatsoever, it is literally as it would be in the real-world, walk up and point and click. You’ll also come across a number of wall-mounted maps, very useful during the early stages but as you work your way through the story is very easy to learn the layout of the ship.\n\nIn a similar vein to many newer FPS games, searching for health is not an issue here, your life force is regenerative so fleeing from combat when everything starts turning red and you hear your own heartbeat is probably a good move for survival, anyone who has played a Call Of Duty game in the last decade will know what to expect from that.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the overall mission is to restore the ships systems and head for home. This concept is split into a number of different scenarios, each with their own unique puzzle to solve. One, for example, requires you to restart the engines, in order for you to do this you must reload a number of energy cells and locate hazards stuck in the machinery. It’s a reasonably simple task but one that could be made a lot easier if you fixed and reset the lighting system on-board. Most of the objectives work like this, while not necessarily having dependencies on each other for the most part there are advantages to doing things in a certain order.\n\nThe one and only place that this game is truly let down is in the visuals, many will find the style a little primitive and this can take away from the immersion of the experience. Please don’t let this put you off though because it’s only a minor setback for the most part. For the majority of the game you’re required to use a flashlight, which limits what you can see around you, it’s this gloomy atmosphere that keeps you hooked. The story and game-play far out-way the slight deficiencies in the graphical presentation helping Spirits of Xanadu prove that the polished Unreal engine isn’t always required to make a superb game.\n\nAs you progress through the game the audio compliments and enhances this eerie environment. Through weird electric noises coming from a distant robot to quiet creaks that give the impression that this ship has seen better days, it adds suspense to an already spooky atmosphere and helps create the perfect world for the story.\n\nSpirits of Xanadu is simply a credit to it’s development team, it’s a must-have for anyone who enjoys a Ridley Scott sci-fi flick or has fond memories of playing System Shock.  Despite the games overall presentation being a little primitive in places, the superb story, easy to master game-play and mass quantities of lore through exploration make this a game worthy of your time and money.","April 8, 2015","true","7.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Spirits of Xanadu does an amazing job of creating the dread and suspense that we all love. Using subtle noises to make you paranoid. Gears grinding of nearby killer robots. The creaking of metal and hum of the engine. This, and more compliments the atmosphere and story of Xanadu. While the games graphics are not top of the line. The developer uses darkness to its advantage. Using your own sight to trick you and scare the living hell out of you at times. The combat in Spirits of Xanadu is a hit and miss sometimes. While stealth can play an active element and gun fights will occur. The amount enemies respawn becomes slightly cumbersome and annoying at times. However once you get the best weapons, they might as well not even exist. There is never a fine middle ground in combat. However the gameplay, story, and design of the game makes up for this in oodles.\nTo sum, any fan of horror, System Shock 2, or science fiction will be more then pleased with this title.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/2SBaD-uNpVo\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","April 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

One very good point is that the game doesn't babysit you, if you want the solution to something that's going on you have to search, look for a tip, think and figure it out by yourself.\n\nThe FPS part is very simple, not much depth, just a few guns, the basic for you to survive, shoot to kill and don't let them get you (though a "stealth" approach is possible to deal with some enemies). There are also different difficulty levels to satisfy your playstyle.\n\nBut what this game really excells at is it's atmosphere, the mystery, the experiences you'll have, whether you understand them or not. The plot isn't given to you, you have to find out about it, imagine what happened, how it happened and why. All in all,  Spirits of Xanadu is a short but very solid experience. well worth playing.\n\nPS: Did I mention there's a zombie shooting mini-game?","February 13","true","10.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

The gameplay mechanics are varied but with limited depth:  light exploration, light combat/stealth, light puzzling.  Similarly, the visual aesthetic (and, some might argue, the graphical fidelity) is minimalist; yet smooth and responsive.  The real focus in Spirits of Xanadu is the high quality narrative and its beautiful integration with the simple but immersive game world, aided by strong writing and voice work.\n\nThat said, I don't know that I can recommend paying for the game at its full price given the extreme briefness of the experience -- even including the multiple replays required to see all the endings.  It's also worth noting that on almost all difficulty levels you will likely face at least a few frustrating/unfair 'deaths'... though at least a couple of these are tied to the narrative.  When on sale, however, the System Shock 2 nostalgia evoked here alone is well worth the (sale) price to me.\n\nI'm hoping these developers continue in the vein of Spirits of Xanadu, preferably with larger/deeper game worlds.","July 6, 2015","true","5.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Finally! Some dev had the balls to say. "You want help? I ain't giving you any." I am sick and tired of handholding gameplay and the super heavy scripted sequences that we see in the likes of the so called AAA games. I want to be able to screw up and screw up I did. There was no "There there dear, you'll be okay. Let me give you the right way to do this." Nope. It simply lets you do things the stupid way. And that's your fault.\n\n+ Fantastic Atmosphere: This is the big selling point for me. I'm not going to go ahead and ruin anything but I will say that I have never had an urge to solve a mystery as strong as this before. That and it's ceepy as all hell.\n\n+ Scary but not jumpscary:  Typically I don't find games scary or even disturbing, creepy is about as far as anything ever gets for me. This is just a quirk of mine. As far as I can tell there are no scripted jumpscares (Except the ones you make yourself from poking your head around corners)\n\n+ Lore Galore: It starts slow but after you pick up a few audio logs you'll be all good. The people you hear about have depth, feelings and change over time. Who would have thought that would be possible? Again this is a case of Indie games having excellent writing that far more than exceeds that of more well known dev houses. My regards to the writer.\n\n+PCMR friendly: Decent options menu. Need I say more? It's a unity game so you also have the launcher available to you if something was missing.  (Which it's not so you should be fine.)\n\nIn all honesty I don't have anything much bad to say about the game, but it wouldn't ne a balenced/full review if I didn't:\n- Varitey\nThe enemy varity is limited. This being said they are distict and not merely upgrades over the next. Each enemy will give you a different challenge. Avoid the blue guys. That scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me the first time.\n\n- Graphics? Meh? Okay I'll go with that.\nGraphics aren't amazing. But for the love of everything that is holy do not let that stop you. It's simplistic yes but it's clean. That should be good enough.\n\nIf you have made it this far you actually about my opinion to some extent. So I have a few more points to discuss:\n\nThe game has a very disctint System shock 2 vibe to it. This is delibrate as far as I can infer from the dev's reddit thread. Personally I love it. Some may not like this. I can't imagine why. but alas some people do exsist\n\nI'm very much a story/lore driven gamer and this game can cater towards those who want to avoid combat alltogether with a peaceful mode. I would say that save Peaceful mode for a second or third playthrough. Yes this game bares multiple palythroughs.\n\nOkay, so I'm going to have to explain this thoughly. Handholding can also be a positive. This game is a giant puzzle now for me this is fine. I don't want a walkthrough, some people don't like it when a game will not let them progress because they lack the ability/determination/intellect to pass an area. For those stuck I'd suggest leaving that area and exploring the entire ship first. You won't finish the game without doing so. Also the puzzles are not in any particular order and actually cause the story to have meaning. This is from the games background/introduction.\n\nI reccomend this game to the highest extent possible! I ended up playing this for much longer during my session that I orignally planned and this game just sucked me right in.\n\nThat's all folks!","March 27, 2015","true","2.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

The music combined perfectly with the simple menu design made me confident that the developer put thought into the details. I've always been a sucker for that in video games.\n\nIt feels silly to say this but this game is an experience. It can be short if you try to rush to the end but that's not the best way to enjoy it. The film Solaris came to mind while I was investigating the Xanadu. It's a slow burn but it scratched an itch for atmospheric horror that very few other games have.

It's a neat little first-person adventure/shooter, with a psychological premise, more than a blood and guts free-for-all.\n\nThis little gem popped up in my discovery queue after I had been playing Cradle for a while. It was on sale so I thought, why not? It seemed to have a similar type of theme and story so I gave it a go. I'm not good with things like jumpscare or torture so I was relieved to find this game did psychological horror perfectly without the need for such gimmicks. From beginning to end you feel incredibly uneasy, jumpy even. Every corner, every hallway makes you look behind you and every so often, you'll find yourself asking if what just flickered in your sight, too brief to catch, was ineed real.\n\nOne of the most intriguing concepts of the entire game are the little 'events' that trigger from time to time. Without giving anything away, it catches your attention every time and keeps you alert and if nothing else, nervous.\n\nThe story is extremely well written in it's simplicity and gives you just enough about each character to visualize their personalities while still letting your own mind shape the bigger picture. There isn't a lot of story 'visible', it's all hidden in the bits and pieces of the logs left behind by each of the crew. The story unfolds itself only if you seek it out actively, rather than force it upon you. This to me is much more rewarding.\n\nThe controls are rather straightforward, if a bit awkward at first with a controller. However once you get started it's smooth and responsive.\n\nIt's a short game, 4-6 hours if you take your time, but it's a GOOD 4-6 hours and worth an extra playthrough if you're looking for the multiple endings. Not all games have to be long to be memorable.\n\nThis look of the game really does fall in with the 80's sci-fi vibe they were going for and the simplistic visuals actually drew me in more than pushed me away. No graphic glitches to be seen and let's just say trying to line up that basketball shot is nearly as difficult in game as it is in real life. The space, despite it's simplicity feels in scale and there's a ton of small things to investigate. From the old boomboxes that play actual music, to a toaster you can interact and even donuts and soda you can snack on in passing, it's clear the Devs were looking at the little things that bring you into a scene.\n\nOne of the most memorable things to me was seeing the signage on the ship written in both chinese characters and in English, and how that detail emphasizes more about the crew aboard the ship. A lot of care went into crafting the small universe.\n\nIt's worth picking up for sure if you have the chance and like a sci-fi story that doesn't hand you all the details on a plate.","January 23","true","6.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is true what others say about the graphics -- even though they are somewhat oldschool and there's not really any textures to make it look terribly realistic, it doesn't detract from the gameplay.\n\nVery interesting storyline, multiple ending possibilities.\n\nI know it was a pretty good game when I want to go back and re-play it to try out all the endings (and get all the achievements), which I did here.\n\nThey did a great job of pulling you into the story and really immersing you in their environment. None of the puzzles were so hard that I had to stop and look up how to complete them, which really keeps you "in" the game. It was freaky, intruiging, and somewhat challenging. There's not much more I look for in a game, other than length.\n\nRegarding length, this one will probably only take you a few hours if you play through just the one time and don't care about achievements. But for the price, I thought it was quite worth it.","May 7","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The atmosphere although not very scary, is very reminiscant of all the old sci-fi first person games I used to play.\n\nThe game is quite easy to play as it's a normal first person adventure game, the parts that are difficult are the shooting parts. The mouse tracking is incredibly finicky and needs to be changed within the options to make it easier to actually shoot enemies if you're spotted. Sadly the respawns are a bit weird as you end up in the brig everytime you "die".\n\nAnyway, all in all Spirits of Xanadu is a game worth playing, it might be short and the puzzles might be difficult, but please play it!","June 14, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

While the game is fairly short (~4 hrs on my first playthrough), there are 3 different endings to add a little replayablility.\n\nThe story will keep you interested and looking for more clues as to what happened to the ship\crew as you try to sneak around security 'bots' to progress which will keep you on edge. There are no cheesy jump scares or pointless puzzles, it's straight forward and engaging!\n\nThere is no "hand-holding", you will need to use a little bit of your brain to figure out where to go and what to do (this is made easier with maps and clues placed around the ship).\n\nThe gfx are mediocre; but this was created mainly by one guy, and anyone who enjoys gaming knows that while gfx can make a good game better, they don't always make a good game on their own. If you can look past that minor flaw then it will be much more enjoyable IMO.\n\nIf you like sci-fi games with immersive stories, and a small touch of dread\horror, this is a must buy!\n\n8.5\10","March 22","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And despite the game's length, it's also home to a surprising number of other sci-fi game and movie references.\n\nAs mentioned, there is no real RPG-like progression, and even though you have a weapon, it's almost more of a tool for solving problems (in the form of enemies).\n\nThe writing is surprisingly competent, as are the puzzles. Even more surprising is the quality of the audio log voiceovers. They're at least on par with SS2, if perhaps even a bit better than some of SS2's voice actors.\n\nGraphics aren't exactly impressive, as you can see from the screenshots, but they get the job done and at the very least don't hurt your eyes. I think there could've been improvement on making more obvious what items can be interacted with though, which would've helped with some puzzles.\n\nAs a warning, this game does contain some moderate atmospheric tension. At times you'll experience some environmental surprises that keep you on edge, but there are no cheap jump-scares, unless perhaps you run around a corner too fast and run into an enemy.","February 7","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatdamath/recommended/312230/","whatdamath","WhatDaMath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatdamath/","297 products in account","Having bought this game with no prior knowledge of what it was all about, I had no expectations when I started to play it.\nAnd without exaggeration, I'd have to say that it blew my mind.\n\nIn essense, Spirits of Xanadu is a mystery thriller adventure with first person perspective and occasional first person fight, that can become a hindrance if you play the game on a very difficult mode. The gameplay revolves around your investigation of a mysterious spaceship called Xanadu, communication with which was lost months prior.\n\nYour job is to locate the survivors, but more importantly, to locate its cargo. What happened to the crew and what can happen to you is for you to discover and is actually entirely optional.\n\nAnd I guess that's what makes this game really brilliant - it's a free roaming game, set in a single large level where you can pretty much do whatever you desire, including going into the ship recreation area and just playing the "game within the game" zombie shooter that is just sitting there.\n\nAnd although graphically, this game is not particularly exciting, I found it to be very beautiful, for the setting it's going for and to be honest, the grahics are not paricularly important for this genre of games. Music and sound, including the sound track, are brilliant, and there are tons of voiced dialogues.\n\nBut the most important part is of course the gameplay and this is where Spirits of Xanadu takes the cake - it is just really really good. The attention to detail, the little secrets and achievements and of course multiple endings, all make this game a must play in my book. Don't be deceived into thinking that this is a run of the mill horror game though. As not only is this game very unique, but I'd also have to say that's it not horror. I'd called it a space opera thriller with mystery elements.\n\nHowever I should mention at least one negative aspect because no game is perfect and in this case it's the length. I was able to finish my first run in about 3.5 hours and really, wanted more. As a matter of fact, I did the second run to find another ending in the same sitting. But having seen the game for sale at 5$ very recently, I'd have to say this would be an incredible purchase if you decided to go with it.\n\nIf you're still not sure, check out my playthrough here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYq2569l-dg","February 18","true","11.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is well realized, but eventually it revealed itself to be a small game, "cute" I would say, and I did not like its narration too much.\n\nYou find yourself approaching a big spaceship (Dead Space style...) and have to retrieve what it's left there and understand what happened. There are some enemies in the game, but it is not an action game. It is more like an exploration / walking simulator and it is definitely not centered on horror elements (well, if you are afraid of the dark, it may be a horror game for you :). As with every walking simulator, you'll know the story only if you find enough audio logs and paper notes scattered around the ship.\n\nAs I said, at first it looked like a big map, but shortly after you learn the scheme of the ship and don't need to look at a map anymore and realize that the level is quite small (the game lasted only a few hours and I did everything).\n\nI got it in a bundle for something like 1 dollar. I had it in my wishlist for a long time, I got exactly what I expected. It is still a nice little game, nothing too bad, nothing too good.","March 5","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My time with the game was well-spent even if it was a bit short overall.  In the game you play as the stalwart, lone space technician who docks with the Xanadu in order to fix its systems, find out what happened to the crew and bring that sucker back to Earth.\n\nThose looking for high-tech, top-tier graphics won't get 'em here, but the old school flavor and visual design does lend Xanadu some atmosphere and weirdness that is unique.  They won't push your PC to the max, yet they look good and are perfectly dim n' grungy with dynamic lightning and some vibrant color hues shaking things up.  Where Xanadu shines even brighter is in the sound department.  You'll frequently find yourself looking over your shoulder to find out the source of various robotic chirps, whirrs and buzzes.  My dog would bark at the computer as I performed various actions which is a pretty good sign.  She normally could give a ruff less if I'm playing a game.\n\nThe meat of Xanadu lies within its gameplay.  You're free to explore the ship at your pace, opening drawers, activing utilities, fixing broken ship systems, reading files, collecting audio logs, etc.  There is no voice acting from your character so it's up to the audio logs to provide you with important details and they get the job done admirably with solid writing and above-par narration from the cast.  You can literally beat this game quickly or take your time with it (which is what I chose to do) and there's not much in terms of waypoints, guidance or hand-holding.  The way you feel like you are the trigger and catalyst for everything that happens in the game is immersive and welcome in this day and age.  You have a vague sense of what to do but the HOW is on your shoulders.\n\nRoughly 75% of the gameplay revolves around finding as much info as you can find and getting the ship in flying shape while the remaining 25% revolves around combat.  There are only a few guns to find and if you don't take the time to thoroughly explore you're probably going to miss at least one on your first playthrough.  You'll face opposition in the form of different robots controlled by the ship's defense AI and even on the hard difficulty setting they put up a decent fight.  Your character isn't Herculean and a few successive beatings will kill you, so you need to take careful aim and adopt the ol' shoot first/ask questions later strategy.  The shooting is completely serviceable but not top-tier FPS; charmingly adding to the tension of trying to survive.  Even if you die you don't lose any progress and save stations are scattered generously enough around the Xanadu that you will never lose giant chunks of playtime.  Some of these things make Xanadu a tad on the easy side, even if you bother bumping up the difficulty.  And once you clear the ship of hostiles (at least on hard, not sure about ironman), it stays clear.  So, it's a true possibility that you will eventually destroy every enemy in the game.  You can play the game on a "peaceful" setting with no combat occuring unless you willingly harass the robotic guards, but this didn't seem very enticing to me as part of the fun was worrying about getting cut down by violent robo-security while rummaging through desk drawers.\n\nAs everyone probably knows, there are multiple endings to be found in the game and I was able to uncover them all without resorting to a walkthrough.  You don't really even need to start the game over to get them all, but I took on a second playthrough anyway just to experience the action a second time.  While the Xanadu itself is a rather small setting, it's totally possible to get lost a few times and for a fairly short horror game (the norm mostly these days), there's a surprising amount to find, see and do in the time you spend with it.  I recommend a deliberate pace and taking your time, because it did feel rewarding gathering most of the achievements in this game (I'm at 84% right now).  Overall, Xanadu was alot of fun to play and I'm completely happy with the money spent on this one.  It's not perfect but it does more than enough to please horror fans that have seen/done most everything in the genre like myself.\n\nPros:\n\n-Dark, intriguing storyline unfolds in a captivating minimalism\n-Great setting recalls classic horror/sci-fi film and games from the past\n-Excllent sound design with well-done voiceovers\n-Gameplay is devoid of hand-holding which allows you to experience the game at your own pace\n-Atmospheric graphics are not high end but get the job done\n-Fun Steam achievements worth spending time to gather\n-Multiple endings\n-Combat is fun and satisfying\n\nCons:\n\n-Despite its general enjoyability and replay value, Xanadu is fairly short\n-Sometimes the graphics are a little too blocky\n-Controls are solid but not overly tight leading to a few uncessary deaths\n-You can get all of the endings without effectively starting the game over\n-Only a scant few weapon choices (a secret gun or two would have been fun to find)\n\n\nFinal score:  8/10\n\nVerdict:  Xanadu would make a good double-header with other offbeat FPS horror adventures like Betrayer.  It's a different ball of wax than something like Betrayer with its own very unique flavor.  I've been pretty hooked on working and playing through Deadcore when I started Xanadu but as soon as I started this game I had to put Deadcore down for the time being.  Spirits of Xanadu sucked me in and I immediately had to dedicate my free gaming time over the last two days consistently to Spirits of Xanadu and only it once I got started and I totally enjoyed the experience!","November 8, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

I guess they're scared if they don't throw a jump scare at you every fifteen minutes the player would be dissatisfied with the lack of ♥♥♥♥ in their pants and quit the game. Spirits of Xanadu isn't afraid to trust that players have an attention span greater than that of a goldfish, and as a result, is one of the greatest horror games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.\n\nThe year is 1983, and you're an engineer hired to make some repairs and check on the crewmembers of the titular ship, Xanadu. Within minutes of stepping aboard the craft, it's evident that something is amiss. Robots patrol the hallways eager to aerate you with laser blasts, as you trudge from room to room, discovering pages from books, audiologs, and even the occasional weapon. Xanadu is a shooter after all, and you'll be able to find three different weapons scattered around the ship, some harder to reach than others. You'll want to find a replacement for you starter laser pistol as soon as possible because frankly, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥e. The shooting itself isn't great either, and aiming down the sights makes the controls disgustingly floaty, so I'd advise sticking with hip fire as much as possible.\n\nThere's four enemies you'll encounter as you navigate the xanadu, some easier tod eal with than others. There's your basic sentry bot that patrols the ship's corridors and rooms that can be dispatched with your guns or by shutting it down with the panel located on its back. These guys are fairly basic, but in numbers can be somewhat challenging. Then you have small flying robots that zap you with burst of electricity, and stationary turrets whose shields have to be deactivated before you are able to blow them up. Finally there's these self-destructing robots that will run up to you and wreck your ♥♥♥♥.These guys can feel a bit cheap at times, as the time it takes to kill one of these guys seems to be greater than how long it takes for them to blow you up. Luckily, dying in this game doesn't really have any negative effects, as you're just transported to the brig of the ship, where you'll have to trudge back to whatever area you werein where you died. Once you kill an enemy, they're gone for good, so by the end of the game the ship is empty as can be, which emphasizes the lonely atmosphere of the game.\n\nSpeaking of atmosphere, Spirits of Xanadu oozes it out of every orifice, and it's only bolstered by the audio logs left by the crew of the ship, which are the main medium for the story to be delivered. These are both written and acted out incredibly well, and some are downright chilling. I found myself stopping in shock as these logs detailed what the crew experienced, which are reflected in your own experiences. You'll also find pages of a book scattered throughout the ship that hold parallels to what has happened on the ship, and are a nice touch. I really don't want to go too deep into the story, as it really is the strongest aspect of the game. Seriously, if you're a sucker for atmoshperic space horror, this game is outstanding.\n\nVisually, the game is simple, but it gets the job done. There's some nice lighting found throughout the ship which adds to the look of the game, but it's still not really anything to write home about. The sound design however is, pardon the space pun, stellar (save for the weapon sounds). The creaks of the Xanadu and the hum of the robots in nearby rooms had me constantly checking behind me, and cautiously approaching each new room.\n\nThis game is chock full of secrets and mentions, from secret rooms and hidden weapons, to Kubrick and other classic films and pop culture referenced. These for the most part are insanely well hidden, and really require you to take your time, poring over every nook and cranny of the ship if you want to find everything. This game overs no tips or hints, and aside fromt eh general objectives you're given at the start of the game, it's up to you to figure out what to do and how to do it. Your basic objectives are to restore power to the ship and plot a course back to Earth, but you may just find other alternatives based on what you uncover. I love that they are really hands off with the player in this game, and it means every piece of information you discover through the aforementioned audio logs and pages, as well as the occasional email you'll read all hold another piece of the story and clues as to what to do and how to find secret areas. There's no big arrow at the top of the screen pointing you to the next objective, so whenever you finally accomplish your goals, it feels like just that, an accomplishment.\n\nThe game offers three different endings, all of which are great in their own right, and none are really objectively better than the others. The game is short, too just over an hour or so long depending on how thorough you are with your explorations, so I was eager to hop right back in and find out what else there was to discover after I had beaten the game the first time.\n\nThe game is obviously not without faults, like I said, the shooting is underwhelming and the enemies can feel a bit cheap at times. And while I like the lack of directions given to the player, you can find yourself scratching your head wondering where to go next. Luckily, Xanadu is not a particularly large ship, and with the aid of maps spread throughout the game, you'll learn your way around the ship pretty quickly, which is good, because there's a lot of backtracking to be done here.\n\nIf the combat really doesn't do anything for you, you can play the game on peaceful mode, where the robots won't attack you, but that really gets rid of a lot of the tension that comes along with fighting the rustbuckets.\n\nThe game offers a concentrated dose of excellent storytelling and atmosphere, all based in a very interesting setting. For fans of creepy games or even just fans of great narratives, this game is a great way to spend a dark night alone.","January 23","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was on an important mission, but communications have gone silent. You're sent to see what happened, make repairs, and have orders to bring the ship back if possible. Of course a mystery awaits when you arrive. I won't go much farther than that as it's a game best experienced without too much description.\n\nI consider Spirits of Xanadu to be an excellent game, with a good mix of first person action, exploration, stealth, mystery, and light puzzles. The story and method of exposition is excellent. There's just enough to clue you into what's happening and keep you moving forward, and the writing and performance (via audiologs) is effective in allowing you to see clearly. (I'm sometimes frustrated by games where the writing tries to trick and confuse the player w/ the unreliable narrator thing, and Xanadu does not do that - it lays out the story for you to discover without the intentional misdirection that some games use.) I got stuck at one point and had to seek out a hint, but it's probably something I should've figured out myself if I'd been more careful w/ my exploration.\n\nAnother thing I like: the environments have a good degree of interactivity which helps make the world feel real and lived in. I enjoy games that reward exploring, and there are quite a few little "extras" that are not central to the game, but exist to help make the place feel real.\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game. Quite an achievement for a small team - and I understand there was one developer doing the coding.","February 16","true","9.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Might be considered a 'walking simulator' by many gamers, as the minimal FPS combat feels tacked on as an afterthought and death has no real consequences.  However, a really fascinating story unravels as you explore the game world and piece together what happened to the ship's inhabitants.\n\nThere are a few intuitive puzzles to solve, but the majority of the gameplay boils down to simple exploration.  While not a 'horror' game in its own right, it can be downright creepy and unsettling.

Once you receive your orders upon boarding the ship at the start of the game you are free to explore at your leisure. Your only obstacle are robots and turrets scattered throughout  the ship who will knock you unconscious but never kill you. You have a few weapons to combat the never ending(and annyoing respawning) robots, but once you retrieve the machine gun they pose no threat. The shooting is super satisfying and i would play a FPS in this world with these graphics.\n\nSpeaking of graphics, Spirits of Xandu doesn't look like a modern game, rather a game from the early to mid 2000's but damn it runs and looks great. I actually had reservations but let me just say screenshots do not do the engine any service.\n\nLuckily, (almost)everything(even why you are not killed) is explained in audio, written pages, or emails placed throughout the ship providing the background of the characters and the story of what happened upon their mission. Again as in Kubrick films you will not be given the full blown 1+1=2, your imagination and sometimes what is not know or seen is the best story. You will however, Deus EX style, be given a choice which will have consequences on the ending where you be provided a short movie.\n\nSpirits of Xandu is very limited in gameplay as my first play though took 2-3 hours as i looked for every message(counter for collectibles) but its the experience i enjoyed as well as the story. There are so many things i want to discuss but each would be spoiler as i saw things that are easily missed or maybe no one has ever seen or heard. A must play for adventure gamers and fans of Kubrick movies as you will not be disappointed.\n\nRecommend playing in the dark with headphones.\n\nPositives\nSolid space exploration game\nGood voice acting and writing\nA couple jump scares\nSo many little hidden moments, trippy\nSped run 2nd time in under 15 minutes(to see alt. ending)\n\nNegatives\nSpawning is annoying and doesn't make sense for the story, location\nEasy to miss solutions to puzzles\nGame breaking bug at the end\nStory is not original but still good","September 19, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDSO/recommended/312230/","LDSO","LDSO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDSO/","557 products in account","Spirits of Xanadu is a game I can give only a marginal recommendation to, along with a few reservations.\n\nThe game is rather short, and at its original $15 I feel it wasn't worth the asking price back then. Spirits of Xanadu can be completed in about 2 hours if you rush through it. I took my time, and still completed it in 5 hours. Since the price has now been reduced to $10, I feel this is a bit more reasonable for what you get. (Even the additional endings can't justify the price, as they don't add a lot of replay value. Since you can reload your last save and experience all three in one sitting. I'd recommend picking up Xanadu on sale, which is what I did.)\n\nIt borrows heavily from the System Shock series in terms of plot and gameplay, but the RPG elements in Xanadu are very light in comparison. There is no resource management: with the player's character regenerating health, and weapons having unlimited ammunition. It also borrows from a variety of other science-fiction stories, such as Solaris, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Sphere, Sunshine, Star Trek: Voyager, and more. If a mashup of several cult science-fiction games and films is something you'd like to experience, then Spirits of Xanadu has it covered.\n\nPros:\nIntriguing mashup of various cult science-fiction stories, peppered with its own unique additions and symbolism.\nDespite the simplistic visuals, it has a tense atmosphere that will keep you wanting to explore.\nGood voice acting in the logs.\nCons:\nSome glitches and annoyances. For example, if you have a gamepad plugged in, it will override keyboard and mouse input. I couldn't find any command line parameter or option to disable the gamepad, unless I unplugged it. The game should allow you to freely alternate between both types of input.\n\nI also experienced a bug where, at one point, crouching would cause the screen to turn black and prevent you from continuing. (Somehow fell outside of the level?)\n\nAnd forcing a different type of Anti-Aliasing (SSAA for instance) than the FXAA option in-game, can result in the visuals becoming completely messed up and the game unplayable. (In my case, anyway.)\n\nPoor performance. I may only have a modest setup by today's standards. AMD Phenom II 1100T, Radeon 6870, 4GB memory, Windows 10, using latest updates and drivers, not overclocked.\n\nBut there's no reason why - despite having all settings at maximum and using the game's built-in FXAA - I should be dropping just below 30 FPS at times in 1080p. The visuals do not justify the performance I'm getting. And I know I'm not the only one seeing poor performance. The game will also start to stutter on occasion, with a reload seeming to fix that. (Suggesting a memory leak, perhaps.)\nOverall, it's worth a go. But, again, I'd advise waiting until it goes on sale before purchasing. Many will not find the length of Spirits of Xanadu worth the asking price, even at the reduced $10.","December 18, 2015","true","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

My computer is a bit old, but still quite capable and above the listed minimum specs.  I can run action games from the last couple of years at high framerates, but I can't get a minimalist game like this to run well without dropping the settings all the way down.\n\nOne of the devs reached out to me about some of my issues and worked to see if there was anything going on with my system.  He was very gracious to lend some assistance and keep me posted about the update on 9-22-15.\n\nThankfully, that update helped a fair bit, but it still is worth mentioning that I only get a decent framerate when I turn off almost all other graphical settings.  We think Windows 10 might be partially to blame.  It seems like when something goes wrong it's either Microsoft or Obama's fault, so I think Mr Prez is off the hook this time.\n\nI had some issues with the controller at first.  On my display, you cannot easily navigate menus with the gamepad, since the selection highlight color is light blue and normal menu items are white, making it very tough to tell them apart.  At first I didn't even think the menu was highlighting.  Also, it took some fidgeting to get the controller sensitivity to work just right, but once I had it set it was fine.  It's one of those games that's honestly better with a keyboard but I like to use controllers on my bigscreen TV.\n\nAs for the game itself, what I've played so far has actually been worth the struggle.  It's a super creepy atmosphere and I love the retro-80s sci-fi aesthetic.  In a strange sort of way it feels a bit like Gone Home in space, in the sense that the art direction and set design are very indicative of a specific time frame.  It's just that the 1980s of Xanadu is mostly fiction.  Creepy fiction.\n\nI'm playing it in normal action mode, so there's some combat elements.  Mostly this consists of me repeatedly getting killed because a) the framerate dips and b) I suck. There's a non-combat mode for those less obstinate than me.  The story and setting are thus far the strongest elements, so losing the combat isn't a huge thing.  But even if it's wonky, it's still fun to blast the little robots to bits.\n\nSo recommended?  Yes, if you're willing to make the bet that it runs for you.  Of course, there's no way to know if you'll have trouble like I did, but at least you should know that the devs are paying attention and interested in the helping.  And that goes a long way to leave a good impression, too.\n\nOh, and don't forget to check that briefcase.","September 10, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

It caught me completely off guard. It's weird, but in a good way. A way that I like. At first glance it looks like a low polygon sci-fi generci shooter, but believe me it's more than that. It's hard to talk about the game and not spoil anything. I'll try my best to avoid spoilers.\n\nThere descent amount of video options here – resolution, fullscreen, V-sync, shadows, film grain, FXAA, SSAO, depth of field, bloom and motion blur. For some odd reason when everything is on high, my framerate drops to 30 and I exceed the system requirements. So I had turn off V-sync and SSAO. But maybe the problem is in my PC, I don't know. No matter if you put everything on high it won't make the game pretty. It have this simplistic art style and I love it. This is a design choice. Also the keys are rebindable and you can find a ton of different options in the options menu like Field of View, Difficulty, sound volume and so on. Overall you can find a lot of settings.\n\nThe year is 1983 and you are send to the research ship Xanadu. She calmly stay around the orbit of a mysterious planet. From a few months her crew hasn't send a single messege. Now alone you have find what happened on the ship. Piece by piece you will put together the story by finding audio logs and pieces paper. Usually I don't searching for both in other games. However in this case I don't know why, but I don't have a problem with that. Keep in mind that this is the only way to understand what happen. The great writting help a lot too. The story begs for more than one playthrough. It have three distinct endings with different requirments to see them and there are a lot of things to find, events to be interpreted. I saw some weird things and make me curious and I wanted to know more, what the dev try to tell with all this symbolism. I like when a game or movie crawls under my skin like that. For me this is smart storytelling.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. When you arive on Xanandu, you immediately find a lazer gun. So it's part shooter. But the other part is more interesting for me – scavenging hunt. The game is not all about shooting. It's more about adventuring and finding what happen. There three weapons in total – pistol, shotgun and SMG. The shooting is just fine. I complete the game only with the lazer gun, because I didn't find the other two and it's not necessary. They certainly would make my life easier. Like I said it's about the story. There is even a optional “Peacfull” mode. If you don't like shooting robots, you can enable it and just explore the ship, solve puzzles and find what happen. This is such a cool idea.\n\nPuzzles are not hard and most of them have common sense. Get something, put it there or remove this. Simple puzzles. Some are kinda obscure and I complete them by accident. Others are obvious, like find a code for a lock door, but where is it, it's the difficult part. There a lot of hidden stuff.\n\nThe enemies here are all different type of robots. Some are flying and shoot electricity, other shoot lazers, third suicide by exploding near you and finaly a turret with shield. I think it's enough variety, considering the length of the game.\n\nExcept sound of your gun, the robots you encounter and a little ambient sound, most the time there isn't something else to hear. They are great. This is not a horror game, but it  defenently have a creepy atmosphere. Still, you are on a space ship with missing crew, aggressive robots and weird things happening around you. There is almost no music, which is a great idea.\n\nThe only voice acting you will hear is from the recordings and it's really good. The actors do a great job to let you know how they feel – sad, desperate, drunk and so on.\n\nThe level design is good. The ship is not a huge and you will familiarize quickly with Xanadu. All room are distinct. There are crew quarters, laboratory, bridge, offices and so on. You have to walk around the ship to piece together the story. The ship is interactive. You can open cabinets, lockers and so on to search for clues. You can even eat, drink and smoke. It's not necessery, unless you want the achievment for that. It's a neet little thing. Also there are mini-games. I found only one, a simple kill all zombies. One of the coolest things here is no hand holding. Not even where to save your game. You arrive on the ship and you are free to go wherever you want. The only way to know where you are are is a map on the walls. It shows your current location. As a whole the ships feel like it came out from 80's sci-fi movies and it's awesome\n\nRarely i've been invested in a game or a movie like this. As i mentioned in the beginning at first glance it's doesn't seems to be anything special. The game don't have high production value, but it doesn't have to. I feel the graphics are a design choice. Don't write off the game. The shooting is solid, but it's not the center of the game. It's the story. When you find out what happen, you can see it's not entirly original, but the way unfolds, what you see, the symbolism is what caught my attention. It's well crafted story. The only thing people might not like is the lenght. I beat it in 2 hours, because i wonder around the ship exploring. Some reach the end in just an hour. But the game begs to be played again and that's why i think the lenght is perfect. I even found something, a secret, that can ease my second playthrough. One final thing. People are saying if System Shock and Deus Ex are making a baby and Kubrick shooting it, this will be the result – Spirits Wideshut 1983 Space Odessy. Actually this is my interpretation of the words. The say it have a System Shock and Deus Ex vibe with a pinch of Kubrick. Go now and buy the game. I highly recommend it.","February 21","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The concept sounded good, some good reviews also helped sway my decision to purchase the game, however I think my mistake was probably playing Alien Isolation before playing this game.\n\nBoth these games have a very similar storyline, both set in space and on an abandoned space station where strange things have happened (we'll say no more to avoid spoiling it for anyone}, and of course we go in by ourselves to find out whats been going on. On paper the story is sound but in practise the Spirits of Xanadu left me feeling like I was back in the 1990s. The visual style can be forgiven somewhat, as I was fairly prepared for that after seeing the video on the store page. What I didn't expect to find is a virtually non-existant learning curve when it comes dealing with the kamikaze style robots onboard who immediately start shooting at you almost as soon as you set foot on the station. You have a weapon of course too which comes in pretty damn handy straight away, not like in Alien Isolation where you picked up weapons over time, but at least in that game you didn't have quite a much to deal with from the start, and you were very capable of sneaking past the enemy and avoiding any combat.\n\nIn Spirits of Xanadu however it was almost a regular occurrance, and one that is immediately so frustrating that for me anyway I decided it was too much too soon, and gave up. It seemed like gaming had taken a gigantic step backwards in terms of playability.\n\nI can appreciate that combat in games like these is a necessary requirement, but when there is very little (or not at all in this case) learning curve to ease you into a particularly simple and dare I say it 'old style' of shooting game, reminiscent of playing Doom many years ago, just with plainer graphics and simpler but just as deadlier A.I.\n\nYes I am over 40 and have played many games of this kind before, but frankly this game needs a lot more work to become a more enjoyable gaming experience.","March 3","false","0.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","2"

You're pretty much free to play the game either way. As the sort fo person who hates Adventure games and crawling over every inch of a level just to find an item I really appreciate the open design.\n\nIf you play this like a shooter you will probably get the bad ending and, if you can't get into the atmosphere, you won't have much fun. The game has the steady pace and mystery of Alien, and once you've killed all the robot enemies the ship will become very quiet.\n\nThere are two things I didn't like: the length and overuse of the shellshock effect. The game felt so short it was like getting a teaspoon of a new flavor of icecream and then being told to go home because the shop is closing forever. It actually upset me a little bit. Sure, you can extend the length by hunting down all the pages and masks and nonsense but that's boring and annoying when your only companion is the shellshock effect.\n\nWhat do I mean by shellshock effect? I mean that flash followed by an approximation of the character's ears ringing. The screen flashes and your ears ring far, far too often for the effect to remain anything but aggravating. Plus I played shooters through the CoD era so I've experienced the shellshock effect so much it's become a painful cliche. I thought it would stop after a while but I never seemed to reach a point when I was safe from it. Part of the reason I'm accepting the bad ending and leaving the others for YouTube is simply so I don't have to put up with anymore shellshock.\n\nGood.
