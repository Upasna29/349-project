Currently this has no online community, for a game without a singleplayer mode its a real deathblow.  I hope that a community grows in the future.\nPlease watch my video for a more indepth review/firstlook.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/uvmKw1QVDjI","December 23, 2015","false","2.0"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","32","57","3","8"

I like how you have many spells to switch between during combat (plus bow & sword). The only problem is lack of community, because the game is new. If you want to play, add me. This game won't grow if people won't give it a chance.","February 23","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Extremely nice and unique combat system (much like DF1) with a very balanced set of skills and abilities. Such a shame that it has such a minute player base as this game has a lot of potential.","December 24, 2015","true","4.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

Only one problem, it's hard to find another player to fight against. I definantly recommend picking it up though, as it is incredibly cheap and the player base should increase once word gets around.","February 1","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Then when I do get into the game and go to lobby there is Nobody on it.. Really nothing exciting to do by yourself except get bored and jump off the cliff and exit the game.\nWill adjust my review when this game is worked on more and there is actually players.","February 10","false","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
