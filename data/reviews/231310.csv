And since mirrormoon is randomly generated (at least i think so, otherwise the leveldesign just sucks) there is no thought and structure put into the progression of game. making it feel soulless and empty, mirrormoon's artistic vision is beautiful though, but the progression and gameplay is kind of like fumbling in the dark to find marbles and once you got them all you throw them out on the floor to do the same thing again. now that might sound like some kind of avant garde flashmob act, but is it fun? not to me at least.","May 24, 2014","false","5.8"," 162 of 196 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","162","196","0","1"

Puzzles are procedurally generated and run the range of obvious and simple to clever and surprising. And sometimes even after the anamoly is solved there will still be things to do and discover on the planet, revealing easter eggs and other surprises. Once an anomaly is solved you get the right to name the star, as players explore the galaxy and solve anomalies the galaxy fills up with the unique signatures of various astronauts. This is a starkly beautiful game, evocative of the Italian underground indie freeware classic Noctis. The visual themes call back to Kubrick and Tarkovsky's work.

I found myself rushing through the puzzles, jumping from planet to planet, trying desperately to figure things out, and usually with a negative result. But after awhile, I realized that Mirrormoon isn't about fast paced puzzle completion and bare bones "what you see is what you get" narrative. It's about discovery and exploration. Its subtlety and sublime beauty is what makes it great. The moment I let myself slowly get pulled into the massive scope of Mirrormoon is the moment things started making sense, and I began to truly appreciate what the game was trying to accomplish.","November 27, 2013","true","5.7"," 96 of 108 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","96","108","0","4"

Sadly, the puzzles are annoying and unpleasant. A lot of randomly walking around with no idea what to do, and frustrating mechanics.\n\nFor example, you can't look around, you can only move using WSAD. There's a moon in the sky you can look at to figure out what's going on, the "MirrorMoon." Since you can't actually look upwards at the sky, you have to wander around until the curvature of the planet aligns you properly just to see this thing, and then try to memorize where to go before you blindly wander off looking for what to do next. A small task that should take 2 seconds becomes a huge chore. The whole time I was like "WHY CAN'T I JUST LOOK UP!?!"...\n\nI tried to get further in this game and give it a chance, but I couldn't handle it for longer than an hour.","December 15, 2014","false","1.0"," 96 of 117 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","96","117","5","0"

I like the visuals and the music, and the "mystery" concept is also quite intriguing, but it is so incredibly frustrating and tedious to navigate through the game.\n\nWhile on a planet, I spend most of my time wandering around aimlessly on an almost empty surface. Often there's a big "map" in the sky in the form of a moon, but I can't look up at it, I can't look around me, and I can barely see a few feet in front of me.\n\nWhile in space, there is a 3d map of the galaxy, but I can only scroll through the available destinations in a really tedious and error-prone way. There is a somewhat obtuse coordinate system for the planets (mystery!), which I wouldn't really mind, but there's no way to input coordinates or do anything other than scroll through the map.\n\nThe manual basically says that you have to cooperate with other players to find the end of the game, but from my experience, what they meant to say is that one person will stumble on it by accident and will maybe tell the others on the forum.\n\nAll in all, I'm trying to like this game, but it's just too frustrating.","October 14, 2014","false","17.4"," 92 of 115 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","92","115","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbszine/recommended/231310/","sbszine","sbszine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbszine/","492 products in account","An overlooked / underrated gem that is almost completely inaccessible. The game is split into a side A and a side B, and the theme is Rendezvous with Rama style sci-fi sense of wonder. Side A is a fascinating first person puzzle that is a joy to solve, but only lasts for 30-45 minutes. Side B starts with you having to figure out how to fly your spaceship: the control panel itself is an unlabelled puzzle, and there is no tutorial. Once you solve that, a huge procedurally generated star cluster opens up. Each star has its own puzzle, and the goal is to solve a meta-puzzle that will reveal the location of the 'anomaly star'.\n\nThe procedurally genrated puzzles of side B aren't as good as side A, and they are generally small subsets of the big side A puzzle. Solving them becomes rote very quickly. So side B feels less like a puzzle game and more like a walking simulator, where the puzzles are an excuse to see the sights of all of the game's different stars. If your idea of fun is playing SpaceChem for an hour followed by 9 or 10 hours of Proteus and Dear Esther, this is exactly your thing.\n\nThe soundtrack is worth mentioning too. It's brooding, static-laden ambient that suits the game perfectly.","December 26, 2015","true","6.2"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","45","46","0","0"

I've seen reviews raving about the "gorgeous worlds" but simple polygon-based graphics, despite the uniqueness, doesn't equal gorgeous. You'll be looking for various structures, but since you can't really look around very well, and have to keep referencing the "mirrormoon" minimap in the sky, it's a hassle to find stuff, such that you'll pick a direction and hope it's the right way, but end up circumnavigating the entire globe and have to look at the minimap again.\n\nAnd the controls are entirely obtuse. Navigating to other planets, well, good luck figuring that out, and even when you do, be preparing to spend five minutes trying to select a new location.  All in all, you'll be wasting a lot of time just trying to do the most basic things. That's not my idea of fun. I don't need a lot of handholding necessarily, but I do need a game that is at least intuitive and sensible.

When you organicaly stumble upon the mechanics of the game, and by extension the solution of the puzzle, after being lost and confused.\nIf that first level was a free demo I would recommend it to everyone I know.\n\nAfter that level you're thrown into your ship and have to figure out how it works. You assume it's by trial and error, but there's so many bloody buttons and functions that you're never sure you're doing it right. There is absolutely 0 player feedback or explanation about what you're doing. I don't mean that in the sense of "Why am I exploring these planets, what's the story here?" I mean more in the sense of "Okay, that turned everything blue for a while....is that good? Bad?" If the developers were trying to achieve a sense of being in an alien craft and having to figure out how to make it go, then they succeeded I guess. But that is a huge barrier of entry to anyone who wants to see the rest of the game. I imagine most might only keep at it so as to justify the $10 they just spent on this.\n\nAt times though it feels like the game is obtuse purely for the sake of being obtuse in it's design choices, like the controls. You can't look arround, or at least not on the Y axis, and you're X axis movement is restricted to WASD, like an old DOS game. Until you figure out how the mouse comes into play it can feel very off putting. Mix that with the monochromatic landscapes, the bright garish colors, and a soundtrack that sounds like Risk of Rain slowed to a crawl and this game made me feel dizzy and even sick at times, someting I can't say a game has ever done to me.\n\nWorst of all there's no drive to solve the obtuse puzzles of the game. You get one flash of a very vague story at the start and then are plopped into the game with little else to motivate you beyond "Solve the puzzle". And since all the worlds you land on have randomly generated puzzles they're often times never as complex as a handcrafted puzzle like the first level was. Of course you'll never see any of these puzzles if you can't figure out how to get your ship to work. You could look up the answer like I did, but that both defeats the purpose and leaves you with nothing to do but go to planet after boring planet.\n\nSo, final verdict? Even if everything I've described here sounds like your cup of tea I'd still recommend looking up gameplay so to better understand what you're getting yourself into. Like I said the first level is amazing, but not worth $9.99 they're asking for. This game is clearly targeted at an extremely niche set of gamers, who should still wait for this to be at least %50 before even thinking of purchasing. There's not enough enjoyable content, or good gameplay experiences in this to justify $9.99.","July 20, 2015","false","0.7"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","44","53","0","1"

It's fun to figure out the ship controls and learn to manipulate the moon artifacts, but once you do the game's pretty much over. The game just doesn't keep up that sense of discovery for very long.\n\nYou'd probably get more out of any hardcore space sim, or hell, any classic first-person or text-based adventure game like Myst or Zork.

I wanted more from it, so the experience was ultimately unsatisfying. it does a great job of making you feel lost in the immensity space - and just plain lost - and the exercise of figuring out the ship's controls was interesting. the controls themselves, though, felt a bit awkward and limiting, both on board the ship and while on a planet's surface (e.g. a game about space and star mapping, but I cannot look up at the sky when standing on a planet surface? please!) this detracted from the puzzle solving aspect. not that the puzzle aspect was that great. from what I could tell, the game has a pool of puzzle components (tools you gather, alien artifacts, astronomical effects, etc.) which interact with each other in various ways, and each planet is a quasi random arrangement of these components. once you solve a planet's arrangement you are rewarded with the opportunity to name the planet/star system. although the game is about puzzle solving for the sake of puzzle solving, and exploring for the sake of exploring, there is a loose "final" goal of identifying, reaching and solving a specific planet (the Anomaly). maybe I got (un)lucky and was able to accomplish this goal fairly quickly, affecting my impression of the game. I only explored about a dozen planets (0% of the galaxy generated for me) when I reached the Anomaly. of those that I did explore, many had trivial solutions, or seemed unsolvable. too few were in the "happy medium" between these extremes, with worthy, interesting puzzles.\n\nthe graphics are minimalistic, eerie and in tune with the openness and emptiness of space, but quickly repetitive, each planet just a barren polygonal ball of some color, with a sun and a some "random" landscape features and puzzle artifacts. something as simple as varying textures would have made the experience more appealing. between this visual barrenness and the disappointing puzzle generation, there really isn't much to entice me to return to this universe. maybe those unsolvable planets are actually solvable, and I'm sure there are alien artifacts and puzzle elements I haven't seen yet, but it just doesn't feel enough is there to put up with the long blind search through space. ultimately I expected something like the game Antichamber but in space, with planets and space wonders instead of rooms to solve. it didnt live up to that, although I admire the concept behind this game.\n\n(contrary to what I wrote above, I did give the game another try, this time on multiplayer, but the first thing I run into is the game forcing me to play the tutorial again. really? forget it)","November 13, 2014","false","11.0"," 40 of 52 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","40","52","3","0"

I made it through Side A (basically the tutorial) and visited a few stars in Side B (the main game). If I had written the review at that point it would have been a fairly negative one. The next day I decided to have another go at it before writing a bad review. My intent was to only play an hour or so... I ended up spending basically the whole day and logged about eight more hours on it, lol. Needless to say, MirrorMoon had really grown on me and I had slowly fallen in love with this game.\n\nI think my initial negative reaction was because I was expecting something more of a puzzle game along the lines of Kairo, which MirrorMoon is not. The A Side of the game is definitely a puzzle and there are some nice "ah-ha" moments when you first figure out how to do something. The game doesn't do much hand-holding and you're thrown into this mysterious world without even a clue as to what you are even doing. The "tutorial" part is only some very brief tips about the basic controls of the game (as in what keys do what). You are left to try to understand everything on your own and it works hugely to the advantage of this title. A huge part of the enjoyment of this game is the mystery of it all. A side note here: if you look an any guides about this game before playing you'll be doing yourself a terrible disservice.\n\nIn Side B you are left to explore the universe and I think the "puzzle" part of the game mostly ends here. Every star you visit will be a variation on the puzzles you've solved on Side A. Some take a few minutes to solve and sometimes the exit it literately right in front of you. You should already know how to solve them though and it becomes simply a matter of doing it. At first I found this tedious and repetitive... then I realized I was looking at this all the wrong way. If you approach each star as a problem to be solved I don't think you're going to enjoy it very much. The better approach is to look at each world as something to explore and experience. Just relax and enjoy the atmosphere (this game tons of it). Once I started looking at it from this point of view I found the game to be quite enjoyable.\n\nThe good: Simple but nice looking graphics, wonderful soundtrack, very atmospheric and mysterious universe to explore.\n\nThe bad: Not much variation on the look of the planets or the puzzles to be solved.\n\nThe ugly: I've had a few crashes. It's always just as I arrive at a star and the game closes without warning. Not a huge issue but it's annoying since it always starts me  back at the star I started from instead of the one I just arrived at. It doesn't happen very often and I'm on the Linux version so it may not affect everyone.","July 19, 2014","true","19.4"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

I had about the same feeling with this game as I did with the later stages of Fez (which might be familiar to more pepole), when the game becomes more meta-gamey and disorienting. In MirrorMoon, you as the player never really know what to do (or even how to do it) but it's this 'enigmatic' quality that in the end kept me looking for the eventual solution (solution for what?).\n\nSo, even though the game might be obscure, frustrating and boring at times, it at least never ceases to be beautiful. Most importantly, special discoveries you make have a unique quality to them and the sometimes tedious parts before really let you know that it was you - and only you - that found out about this.\n\nFor a lengthy interview on design decisions, this is recommended: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/10/16/the-blind-night-discovering-mirrormoon-ep/","December 11, 2013","true","6.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Quiet emptiness? What about all that?\nTo many people the above might be very negative points, but I feel they together paint an interesting narrative.\n\nThis game doesn’t hold your hand. It refuses to stand in the same room as you. Doesn’t even look in your general direction. Remember that one puzzle near the end of Myst where you were in a cart and had to find your way out by choosing which way to go at every intersection? A different sound effect was played at every intersection, but without some serious trial-and-error there was no way to know that the sound that played corresponded with the direction you were supposed to go in. To solve it without help, not only did you have to somehow connect the sound effect to the direction, but you had to somehow sort out *which* sound effect corresponded to *which* direction. This game is a lot like that puzzle, only the answer isn’t published anywhere and you sure as hell can’t ask your dad for help.\n\nI’ve landed on unnamed planets where there is nothing to do at all, the only thing present is the gate to get back on the ship. There are also planets where there are things to see, but no real puzzle to be solved. When there is a puzzle to be solved, it’s back to trial-and-error, but at least you have your prior experiences to go on this time. This game is slowly paced and doesn’t spoonfeed you—sometimes you find some neat stuff on a planet, but sometimes there is nothing. I mean, even that “nothing” planet gets you closer to your goal of “find that anomaly somewhere in the universe” but that isn’t what most people are accustomed to in a game.\n\nThe minimal sound effects/soundtrack is great, and I find the game itself quite relaxing. The only annoying bit is the “in media res”-type beginning. Just like when you needed help with that Myst puzzle, I suggest you look for help on Steam with guides/forums, as well as looking through youtube videos (or I guess you could just brute force it until something sticks, like those who mapped out that entire puzzle by hand, but that too could take a while). Once you’ve grasped the first tutorial planet, you should have an idea on how the game is played and what you should be looking for.","December 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","31","44","2","1"

I thought it would be so fun but, oh, how mistaken I was... It's so annoying and frustrating. You will be walking on a surface of a celestial body in first person, where you can't look up nor down, just forward and to the sides, also you can't see very far too. It's pretty much like the Spore's worlds, but worse because it is empty and in a very smaller scale. There's no tutorial nor explanation of what you have to do. That means you will first be worried if your mouse is working correctly, since you can't look up and down, then you may think that it may be an issue with your gamepad, if it is plugged in. But then you will understand that this is just an annoying limitation for some reason.\nWithout knowing where to go or what to do, you will, eventually, discover that the celestial body up there is actually a map and by "upgrading" your, err, "gravitational gun" you can drag it around, which will also be a pain since you can't look up you will have to align yourself with it.\n\nThere's a map and a kind of travel machine that is really, really weird and a pain to use it properly. You will find yourself flipping switches without knowing what you may be doing, as always...\n\nIn sum, you will be aimless walking on a empty surface doing stuff that you are not sure what nor why.\n\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone, not even for its art.","January 20, 2015","false","1.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","2"

After reading my own thoughts on the game, I realized they were mostly negative. I will say that the game did keep me playing for 10 hours (enough for me to finish it and all achievements), and I don't regret purchasing it for $10. The game is unique, atmospheric and in a way, meditative, but in the end, there's just not that much there. It feels like the designer confused artsiness with actual content and gameplay depth.\n\nI purchased Mirrormoon expecting a puzzle game, but there are really only two puzzles (three, if you count finding the "anomaly", which is the endgame condition). The first is the "Side A" section of the game, and although it is very enjoyable, it only lasts about 30 minutes. The second is figuring out the ship's controls, which again, is a short, one-time puzzle. The rest of the game--"Side B"--has you exploring a procedurally-generated galaxy, with planets similar to the one from Side A. The thing is, they all use just a subset of Side A mechanics without building on them at all, so you're really just going through the motions over and over. You'll never encounter a more interesting puzzle than the first, or even one you don't know how to solve already.\n\nWeak as the puzzles are, I think it's clear the game is really intended to be about exploration. In many ways, the game does this well. When you start Side B, you are put into the current "Season," which is a finite, procedurally-generated galaxy shared with other players. When you're the first to solve a star, you get to name it, and all future players will see that name. In your search for the "anomaly" (vaguely hinted at in the starting text for Side B), you may even find that others have helpfully labeled important stars. The game captures the feel of deep space very well. But again, the downfall of the game is, you've seen nearly everything in Side A. The planets vary in color scheme and in the 3-4 structures strewn across the surface, but that's basically it. You can spend an hour hopping from planet to planet, and the payoff is... you see a handful of colored posts on one of them, or a lone chair. The most interesting find you can make would be one of the observatory planets, but those are rare and don't justifly the effort needed to find one.\n\nI guess after all that, the question is why I was willing to keep playing for 10 hours. I did find exploration somewhat meditative, and I suppose I did enjoy being the first to visit a planet, naming it and in a sense claiming ownership of it. More than anything, I suppose it was stubbornness and desire to see the ending. I was probably entertained for about 2 of those hours, relaxed for 3-4 of them, and frustrated, annoyed, or bored for the rest of the time.","March 20","false","10.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

However, I cannot say that it's perfect or spectacular without a lot of bias. This game happens to have just about everything I love in a game, so of course I really, REALLY like it, but it is not without faults.\nThe reason why I like this game so much probably has to do with my favorite attributes to have in a video game. They would be: exploration, puzzles, atmosphere, huge size (why I like games that use procedural generation so much, which this game has) and space.\nSo, what's good about this game:\n-Very atmospheric. This game is so relaxing and calm, while also keeping that mysterious air. The 'artifacts' are all interesting to look at, and the isolated feeling this game brings is just niiiiice.\n-Quite a bit of exploration. Each planet is unique, with lots of different artifacts to find.\n-Interesting puzzle mechanics. I've never seen a game with mechanics quite like this one.\n-Nice aesthetic. The colorful minimalist style is just really enjoyable to look at.\n-Basically infinite puzzles to solve.\n-The search for the 'Anomaly' as it's called, is really nice incentive. The very existence of the Anomaly gives this game a lot more purpose than it would have had otherwise.\n\nWhat's not so good\n-Not friendly to people just starting out; not much explanation is given as to what to do. The mechanics and stuff aren't too confusing, and one could figure out what to do by going on the Mirrormoon EP forum on Steam, but this is still quite a problem.\n-If exploration isn't your thing, you probably won't like this game much, unless you really enjoy the puzzles. The main appeal of this game is split between the exploration/atmosphere (I'm lumping the two together) and the puzzles.\n-The puzzles are a strange mix of confusingly abstract, and too straightforward. The tutorial puzzle and the anomaly both show just how amazing the puzzles in this game can be (and there are multiple anomalies, so don't worry about there only being two really good puzzles), but then the rest of the puzzles are kind of simple. I tend to be really good at puzzle games, so I encounter this problem to some extent in most puzzle games, but this one feels like it would be a little on the easy side even to someone who wasn't good at puzzlers. Maybe that's a good thing(?) but honestly, trying to say it's a good thing, when it is clearly a turn off for those looking for a mind bending puzzle experience, would be outright lying,\n-I have heard of people despising the art style. Not going to lie, I think this is a stupid argument, because if you hate the art style THAT much, then you can see from the screen shots that the game won't be for you, but I can agree the art style is somewhat hit or miss. Most people I know like it, and think it looks pretty nice, but there are definitely those that hate it.\n\nSo, of course, I recommend this game. However, I have to point out flaws to be fair.\n\nP.S. I've heard this game called 'pretentious' and 'a walking simulator' before, a few times. I think both comments are completely off base, as this game isn't pretentious at all, and calling it a walking simulator totally ignores the puzzles, you know, the main point of the game.","October 6, 2014","true","13.3"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","16","24","2","0"

Every planet has a puzzle but, to be honest, they're completely optional. Being the first person to solve a randomly-generated puzzle will let you name the planet, but otherwise there is no real reward. If you wanted to, you could just land on a planet, look around, and then take off and go somewhere else.\n\nThat might sound boring to some, but I love it.

It is a world to be immersed in. Unfortunately, rather a great deal of it is boring, simply walking around desolate planets with hardly anything on. And I don't see that it does anything that hasn't been done before. See, for example, Increpare's game 'Cities of Day and Night', available for free from his website. As for the creators of this game (an interview with them can be read at: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/10/16/the-blind-night-discovering-mirrormoon-ep/), I don't think they're as clever as they would like to think they are. For instance, getting rid of the ability to look up and down is not an innovation, but a nuisance, since as a result one can only see the 'mirror moon' - effectively a map used to help solve puzzles - from very particular angles, which makes solving puzzles difficult, and often ends up in rather tediously walking about in the hope of coming across something. Furthermore, the loading times of levels can be a matter of minutes - and since lots of the moons/planets have so little on them, one wonders why one has bothered. Still further, there isn't really an 'end' to the game, and so any feeling of progression is missing. The game does at least bring up the question of why one would want to explore space if it was so boring.\n\nA far better explorational puzzle-solving game is 'Kairo', which is also far better on story (though it's told in an extremely oblique manner). What value this game essentially has is in showing people that, after a while, less is no longer more.","September 20, 2014","false","6.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Just something as simple as getting to name your own planet feels oddly satisfying after drifting around for some time.

Messing around in the spacecraft is good too, so try that as well. It makes space feel simultaneously agoraphobic and claustrophobic.\n\nFor better or worse, this is a game that tries to give its player something that they could not have looked for.

I understand how many people find it annoying or think it's not a real game, but artsy-farty rubbish, but that's not what I feel it is.\nFirst of all, the graphics are amazingly different from any other graphics I've seen in any other game. They're neither hi-fi like most 3D-games nowadays nor lo-fi like, for example, antichamber. They remind me of a game site called Venus Patrol and I've always loved their design. The music reminds me of early islandic electro band mûm. The athmosphere alone is fantastic and alienating, maybe like the first Metroid game, but in a different, more subtle way.\n\nNow, the game itself made me feel like a lab monkey that was submitted to a complex intelligence test. Where am I? What is all this? What shall I do. There is no reference to anything that could help me solve any of these questions, and, as a curious little labrat, I start pressing levers, turning knobs until Ifind myself on the surface of something, wielding something and advancing towards something.\n\nIf you need action and easy clues, the game is definitely not for you.

Although there is no doubt that I will be playing more.\n\nFrom what I have gathered so far:\nMirrorMoon, a position of which one is in a place, on a moon, in-between a scaled size map which is actually another physical moon than can be moved over the coinciding sun. This causes a quick swift darkness to ensue. It also changes the contents, now things which were originally not there in the day, where there in the night. There are ancient like artifacts, all with there own unique design, that coordinate together as components of a larger puzzle. Many people discuss them as if they are left over from some ancient civilizations, but i think they are something else. Maybe, they are universe anomalies. Things that exist in places where they shouldn't. They are mistakes of the universe's natural laws in action. Buildings incomprehensibly positioned, unquestionably structured in contradiction to the natural laws that govern atomic interactions. You see, the game is called MirrorMoon, and no reflection is perfect.\n\nThis game is peculiar. Its a game that, when being played (in that present moment) is awe-inspiring servitude to our ancient-deep driven quest for discovery. It plays on an instinctual quality of our species. It dazzles our eyes, to provoke our attention. Then it immerses you further into itself, so that you would be forever lost in the ambiguous quest to know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. I like the idea that, in this game, you give yourself direction. From that action, determination builds and it rolls upon itself.\n\nWith all this in mind, you should be patient. You don't run into a dark room in which you know nothing about. One step at a time, one button at a time, and soon the room will be totally seen, even in the darkness.\n\nThere is still much to do...I'll probably update this review as I go on.

In fact, you can get a gravity gun and move the moon in the sky, in essence moving the moon you're on. You're trying to build a bridge between the two moons, so you can meet yourself (I guess); paradoxes be damned.\n\nIn gameplay terms, the game consists of two major puzzles (beginning and end) with space navigation in between to find the correct planet to end the game. The game has "seasons" where a blank starmap is commenced and gamers "name" stars in an effort to help each other find the end planet. However in reality the navigation map is not very useful as it is quite huge and translating observations to the map is not easy, you'll end up mostly randomly hopping planets with the hope that you stumble upon the correct one.

MirrorMoon EP is all about discovery, and you’ll soon find that space is terribly confusing. No explanation is given for your convoluted space craft, leaving you to flip switches randomly until you make your way to an uncharted planet. Each planet has a secret hidden amongst the eerie, alien structures. Once you’ve discovered the secret using an array of environment-altering tools, you get to name the planet, claiming it as your own. Anyone else who comes across your planet will only know it by the name you gave it. While I’m content simply traversing the universe pioneering new worlds, there is a discovery that ends the game. Because the universe is random, you could beat the game within an hour, but you certainly wouldn’t have seen it all. The MirrorMoon universe is magnificently huge. Perhaps too huge. It can be obnoxious to wait fifteen minutes for your ship to make its way to the next destination. The controls could also use some work. I found a joystick to be best for walking on a planet’s surface, but controlling the ship must be done with a mouse and keyboard.

However, after looking at this game for merely a week, i decided to take it and i can tell you this: MirrorMoon EP is confusing, lonely, and can sometimes feel empty. Though, as these may seem like the games downfall, they soon become lost in MirrorMoon's sense of vast exploration, chilling atmosphere, and the many amazing sights you will see along your travels. At times the game pits you on empty planets and the so called 'puzzle' you are required to accomplish leaves you feeling pointless [Yes, this does feel like a lazy develop meant by the team]. Nevertheless, MM does a great job of making these some what lazy planets as not being forced onto the player, and after spending the 2 or so minutes on the planet, you simply move onto the next; knowing you'll find a greater puzzle and sight. To sum it up, MM takes you to a vast galaxy that holds many wonders to see and explore. The puzzles were not my focus of this game and at times i even forgot this was meant to be a puzzle game so if this part of the game interests you, i would not recommend it. Although, if you are looking for a highly atmospheric exploration game, with a lot to offer, then MirrorMoon EP is your thing.","February 12, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And that pretty much sums it up. You start off on a planet and you know how to move with WASD and thats all the game tells you. You can't move your viewpoint with the mouse and you can't strafe. Why? because "exploration" There is no tutorial except people say that there is one.  You have 2 points of view on a planet and on your ship. When on your ship there is a floppy drive with a A side and a B side apparently the A side is the tutorial and the B side is the main game. How do you know this? well you need to look it up. Its fun to find your own way through things but not when you need to discover everything yourself.\n","March 14","false","0.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

That aside, I found that the exploring the first planet was a treat in itself: the contrast of colors, good use of tone, and the music was very atmospheric. I'd encourage you to play with headphones.\n\nIn the end I still have much more to try with this game (given they don't tell you much).

I love indie games. I love space. I love puzzles. This is a really strange and uniqe game. I love it. :) Ok the best explaination for this game is well you have a spaceship that you use to find moons and planets. Once on the said moon or planet you have a type of tool i wouldnt call it a gun cause it doesnt shoot bullets or what have you. You need to explore and discover different parts of the moon my picking up attachments for your "gun" this will allow you to manipulate the moon and activate beacons and to solve bassically the puzzles. Its a story that builds on itself as you complete the different moons. this is deffidently unique and i recommed those who like puzzles and being challenged to pick this game up. Its not your average game so if it doesnt look cool or interesting dont bother with it. i like it cause well im different and like to be challenged from time to time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Danielthedemon/recommended/231310/","Danielthedemon","Daniel the Demon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Danielthedemon/","265 products in account","Oh, MirrorMoon EP. Well, let me first start off that this game isn't for everyone. I recieved the game through a HumbleBundle purchase and seemed like a cool concept to try out. Started this game at 6 a.m. and completed it 100% 7.6 hours later. I was confused as hell what to do in the game in the begginning, until I researched video's and discussions about the general gist of the game and decided, "Here goes nothing."\n\nI was able to start the panel first try and popped in the Side A  floppy diisk which ported me into a planet that seems to be the "Tutorial Mission". Takes you roughly 10 minutes to complete and realize that it is a puzzle game without any instructors, freeing your imagination. Once completing the "Tutorial Mission", the floppy disk turns over to Side B giving you the general content of the game. You must travel in light speed from Star to Star and discover unnamed ones that you can call it whatever you wish.  The core concept is to find planets with constellations in the sky that give you a map to where the "End game" level is.\n\nWhen playing on the online part of the game, you actually work with everyone in that "Season" to discover stars and locate the "End Game" star. Very simplistic game that does not explain itself nor should it have to. If you want a game that tells you everything on what to do and what the plot/concept/end result is, then you have no creatvity nor want to explore. After all, this is a Space Exploration Puzzle Game.\n\nIn my opinion. I would rate it:\n8/10 for Creativity\n9/10  for Simplistic (No Man Sky) feel Graphics and Atmostphere.\n6/10 for Online Content and Story\n\nOverall, a solid 7 or 8 in my book. Doesnt hurt to purchase the bundle now and recieve 7 games for 6 bucks (about 80 cents a game people!) to try this bad boy out. Other than that, I would wait for sales and the price to go down to below 5 bucks.","April 12, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are only a handful of mechanics involved in the puzzles, but dozens of combinations, meaning that every planet(moon?)fall is a scramble of wits to ascertain that locations own unique set of rules.\nIn summary: MirrorMoon is a bit different to nearly everything else and is well worth getting when it is cheap.","February 3, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Upon entering the game I had no idea what anything was, what anything did, where I was, what I was doing, or why I could magically control a moon in the sky which was at the same time the moon I was also standing on (and I still don't know lol). It's unsettling in a really good way.\n\nI guess it might be somewhat of a puzzle and exploration game, but it quietly walks past most of the "hallmarks" of those categories and it might be more apt to describe it as an experience game, simply put. People who want some kind of clear focus and interaction might not find what they're looking for here. It's been compared to the game Antichamber (although I've never played it) and Dream to some extent, and those connections make sense in certain ways.\n\nPlaying this game reminds me a lot of the feeling of listening to some 15 minute long ambient drone music, enjoying the subtle patterns and tones. Or of the feeling of watching a film, such as the Koyaanisqatsi trilogy, where the mind gets lost in the images/music and moves outside of itself. There isn't a definite purpose to the game, it's open ended and mysterious and technically never-ending via the seasons system. I feel like maybe all of that somehow mirrors some essential truth about real life. Either way, it's a real keeper.","February 4, 2014","true","17.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Mirror Moon is an abstract game with all the implictations of that abstraction. There are no instructions and results of randomly clicking around the interface do very little to help you understand how the game is actually experienced. Tie that to a control scheme that is unfriendly to mouse users and this game is difficult to recommend. There is no means of looking up or down; this is extremely frustrating when trying to determine your location.\n\nThe game indicates that other planets are named by other players which makes this by definition an ♥♥♥♥♥♥me. No game that calls itself "single-player" should require a new player to seek out videos, forums, or other player assistance just to learn how to play it.\n\nAfter more than two hours of play and the game is still obtuse and inscrutable, it becomes nothing more than an exercise in frustration.

The only drawback is that the puzzle dynamics have to be similar from planet to planet because it's a huge galaxy that's full of an almost endless amount of places to visit.   That makes the game very much worth the money because you will get a lot of gameplay out of it. I found the puzzles got addictive and they do throw you a curveball once and a while. It's also great to play when working on something else in the background because you can run it in a window if you want. I always appreciate that. What is cool, is the fact that if you play it in online mode, you and other people and naming stars in the same galaxy.  Anyways, I'd definitely recommend it for your collection even if you're looking for a normal adventure game because of the fact that this has almost infinite replay value.

From the very start of the game, there's already horrible assumptions that would only make sense in very limited player contexts.  For example, the cockpit the player starts out in has controls all over the screen, but the player is arbitrarily limited to only what is red for the purpose of an implied tutorial.  The game doesn't actually clarify that the player is supposed to mess with the red things, or that the color is of particular importance beyond aesthetic.  It just assumes players will care more about color than complexity or function and immediately mess with the red thing.  I'm not exaggerating this point.  I literally wondered if the game was not working because nothing I clicked or tried to drag did anything until I happened to click on the red thing.

WASD moves your character, but the big issue is you can't look around with your mouse. Instead, your mouse controls a giant moon in the sky that functions like a map to find things. You can only see this moon from certain points on the planet you are on and only facing in certain directions, so you basically have to give it a shot in the dark to find anything.\n\nThere is nothing more frustrating in a game than knowing what you are supposed to do, but not being able to do it because the design of the game sucks.\n\nThis method of exploration ruins what is probably an otherwise really cool experience.\n\nI once went back and played Turok on the N64, only to find the controls feel really, really dated by now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/231310/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","This game isn't for everyone. It isn't even for the majority... It's for a small dedicated group of people.\n\nI have a problem with procedurally generated. games.  Occasionally the random variables all conspire to put a wall across the exit corridor, or make a 6-way symmetric equation solvable only by hours of trial and error...  Sometimes you just don't know if you're being dense, or the game's given you an impossible level.  When you play a human-crafted game, you know it's solvable.  Not so with random games.   Mirrormoon doesn't seem to have this problem because the 'randomness' is tightly controlled.   It works like this: "If thing A is here, then puzzle B must need to be solved", and vice versa.   Because every 'planet' is self-contained, the randomness is between planets...\n\nSo, it becomes clear that every sphere is basically a collection of the same puzzles, in slightly different configurations: You just randomly stumble about, trying to use the "mirror moon" as a map and do the exact same four or five 'puzzles', over and over again.  Oh, the colours changed, and the placement of the puzzles changes.\n\nSo, why did I finish it?  Because a) i'm a completist, b) I was playing a mature season, so winning was a lot easier, thanks to other players, and c) I figured out how to navigate about 1/10th of a second before uninstalling it.\n\n\nYou will enjoy this game if:\n* You like games which tell you literally NOTHING, and let you figure it out for yourself.\n* You like games which don't have an actual purpose, i.e. goal / FMV cutscenes etc...\n* You like games which don't reward you with an attaboy, your reward is wholly inside yourself: That feeling of satisfaction you get when you see something new and think "Hey, I found that!".\n*  You like games which frustrate the absolute bejesus out of you for hours or days on end, and then *click* You get that five seconds of clarity, which wipes away those five days where you've been quiet, pensive, irritated at the world, and gone and written a sharply negative review on Steam: You go back to steam, change your review, and dive back into the 'game', and find that your clarity has paid off.\n* You like games which give you clues which may  (or may not) actually lead anywhere.\n* You like games which just shows you stuff, and it's up to you to decide if it's a clue, or just procedurally generated fluff.\n\n\nSo, this is still a negative review, so what follows are SPOILERS.. Only read below if you are stuck and just want to know some clues:\n\nThe cockpit is  laid out pretty logically.  Power and fuel on the left, lights at the bottom right, rotation and translation at the right.\nThat casette tape at the bottom..  is just a selection between the tutorial and the main game. Once you've done Side A, flip it to Side B and leave it\nWhat you're trying to do is..  get to a particular 'star' in the galaxy. You are in a so-called space ship, you use the button by the casette tape to 'beam up and down' to a planet's surface\nYou use the map to...  wander around the galaxy trying to find your way to that star\nThe 8-track cassette thing is  some kind of 'power diverter'. Put it into the right-hand slot, and pull the breaker to its right to warp to the currently highlighted star.  In the left-hand-slot, you use it to beam down\nThe map is....  Bloody hard to use, it's so zoomed in, it's practically a hindrance.  You can 'free-look' around the cockpit with RMB, but that's just disorienting too.\nThe general flow of the game is...   Wander around totally randomly, doing each 'planet'.. You can spend hours and hours doing this for NO purpose.  Eventually you will find an 'observatory' (where eventually can be up to several days of continuous play if you're unlucky! (this is what I hate most).\nSo after wandering around aimlessly... when you find the observatory planet (one which has the usual puzzles plus one more building), you get some nonsense about constellations. Ignore them, pointless. Just look for the 'ringed' star. That's where you're going.  Around it there'll be a named star.  Find the closest, and then beam up to search for it in your map.  It may take hours and hours of painful searching to find it.  Warp to that star, and then go back to the 'aimless wandering' step..\nAnd then?..  just keep doing that.. eventually you should be, by random chance, in the vicinity of the goal star/planet.  Make sure you spend many many hours of the aimless wandering.. This game is predicated on you wasting absolutely ♥♥♥♥loads of time.\nThere's no way of going faster?  In theory, you could use triangulation. pick three named stars which form a triangle around the destination star on an observatory planet, print the screen and get a ruler to calculate the distance of the circled star from them. get their coordinates in the cockpit, then use Scilab to calculate the vector composition of the three position deltas, weighted for distance .  You should end up with a vector   Next, use Excel to make a calculation, and then plug in star values.    B4ll4che.  Pointless, and ultimately unrewarding, so don't bother..\nShould I play this game?  Only if you've got nothing better to do!\n\nOn the surface of planets\n*I find my way around by...  By and large, just walking until you find something.. Get into the habit of walking forwards, and tapping left every few seconds.. That'll make a spherical spiral search pattern. Tedium++\n*What's the moon for? ...  You can use it as a map. You show up on it too as an arrow when it's in front of the sun, or you can use it as a gravitational 'magnet' to suck buildings out of the ground\n*What's the buildings for?..   Some contain bits for your gun which let you manipulate the moon, or shoot markers.  Some act as switches for other buildings when you walk through them.  Some are just tourist attractions, or in-jokes to other Steam games\n*What's the triangle marker things whizzing by?  They help you find your way between buildings.  *Follow them forwards, or backwards.  When they reach where they're going they often make a building appear.\n* There's nothing on this planet!  There probably is, it's just that its one of those awful procedurally generated ones where the map is pointless, and the exit is somewhere on the far side from the moon, and it's not in occlusion, so the moon's not acting as a map.  They bug me to hell.  Spiral search your way out\n* All I found was an exit, but there's 'atmospheric stuff'..  It's possible that you missed the 'moon mover' bit for your gun. Move the moon, and some buildings might appear when the sun goes away or comes back.\n* What's the marker attachment for the gun for?  It lets you 'press a button' for one of the puzzles.  Also can potentially help with the map when there's no eclipse.\n* I can not find my way off this planet at all  press Escape.. Move on.  It's not worth it.\n* How do I know it's an observatory?  I've found that mostly the stars are blue, rather than white.  Also, you'll see random lines connecting some of the stars.  These are constellations (in the game).  The star you're looking for is ringed\n* and then...?  Well, this is where it gets annoying.  The constellations are /sort of/ picked out if you press the slidey latch button at the bottom right of the screen.  If you take some notes on the surface of the planet, you can /sort of/ find them again and then use the consellation stars to find yours.  [/spolier]\n* All the stars are XXX/##  You're S.O.L It's a new season, so no help from other players.  Good luck","June 26, 2015","false","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

From what I can tell, the game is designed to be an open-ended experience to have from time to time, instead of accomplishing it in any definite or predictable way.\n\nIf you're up for that sort of thing, then you might have a great time here. I really enjoyed the visual aesthetics of MMEP as someone who likes rather minimalistic art from time to time.\n\nI'd definitely say part of the experience is figuring out how the hell to do anything in the game, however. Feel free to take that as either a challenge or a warning.\n\nI can easily see why some would be annoyed, and although there are a couple of Community Guides already there's definitely a part of me which is intimidated by the concept of an exploration game which forces you to understand a skeuomorphic user interface for both the ship and environment. Thing is, outside of procedurally-generated planetary exploration that's basically the point of the game to me, so I can't really be that upset about it.\n\nI'd recommend it for an experience unlike most others, especially the ship's interface with all of its buttons and gizmos, but the game definitely defies what I consider conventional game design so if you're looking for that you're out of luck, I'm afraid.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it, especially at its current price point (during a Humble Store sale) of 2 bucks.","July 8, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

(I got this from an external source. I have not used the feature myself, since the game on its own is difficult to figure out.)\n\nThe graphics are nice and simple, though really, they don't do much for the quality of the game.\n\nThe soundwork is futuristic and pleasant to the ears.\n\nThe controls are absolutely atrocious. The pointing thing moves extremely slow, and in most of the cases, the game gets minimized when i move the mouse too far and click (I have 2 screens, which might be the problem)\n\nThe fact, that you can't really look down is confusing and annoying because you have to constantly look down, which goes really heavy on the eyes.\n\nAll in all: I'm sure, this game is good for people who got a lot of time on their hands / People who really like exploring simple landscapes, but not for people who are big fans of games with actual player interaction\n","December 3, 2013","false","3.9"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","3"

Do not expect any context or guidance, because you pretty much have to figure everything out for yourself as far as goals and progression concerned. That being said, exploration seems to be the heart of the experience. Taking in the variations of each planet and trying to see what you can do on each one is a highly atmospheric experience if you can keep yourself in-game for long enough. I'd relate it to Proteus in that way. There is a general sense of wonder across every environment, aided by the dichotomous light and dark color schemes and minimalist soundtrack. It's a somewhat eerie atmosphere at times. Definitely worth the $2 on sale. $10? Not so sure.

After that it enters into a randomly generated boring star cluster with its own extremely obtuse  puzzles, no explanations or basic context, an insanely complex non intuitive spaceship exploration system and just plain bad game design. There is no sense of progress, no drive to accomplish anything, it is plain and boring and intentionally obtuse rather than intelligently difficult to understand. I spent a long time trying to figure out a puzzle only to find that there is no progress indicator, no way of knowing what you're doing, how well or even why, figuring out how to actually make the environment react at all is also a challenge that isn't always pleasing either. No hint system and no proper walkthrough since there are random puzzles don't help take the edge off in case figuring out useless stuff is not your thing. The game looked great in the trailer but sadly I cannot recommend it, there's just too much bad game design here despite a relatively strong start.","January 14","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games should reward progress or completion of something.. if nothing more than as a simple sign that you can move forward.\n\nI had to look up stuff online to confirm whether or not I had actually solved something cause the game itself gives you no indication that you've actually done what it wants you to do. Even going online for confirmation was difficult because the game doesn't have a set course, so you can't discuss the game easily online or check your progress in comparison to others.\n\nThis game for me separates the line between what is abtract and what is just simply challenging.

But it left me with an itch I wanted to scratch. Mirrormoon EP however fails to scratch that itch. While I like the minimalist approach and clean visuals, exploring the planets is boring. Mostly because they aren't proper planets at all. You can see the horizon bend and circumnavigate any planet in five minutes. Even Pluto, now demoted to a dwarf planet, isn't that small and featureless. The planets all look alike except for the colour palette and some minimal debris here and there. Once you've seen one planet, you've really seen them all. There are puzzles on each planet (actually it seems to be the same puzzle over and over again), but I don't want a puzzle game, I want a game about exploration. I want to see beautiful vistas, meet strange animals, find crumbled old ruins, things like that. If you're looking for something similar to Noctis, skip this game. It's an abstract puzzle game that's only posing as a space exploration game.","October 3, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And i start thinking: "Maybe we should work together" But how to communicate? Well, via Steam - Forum. So, if you find actually people playing it at the same time and know how to communicate - this game is unbeatable in atmosphere, fun, chill-factor and brain-usage.

The universe acts in seasons and is ordered randomly every few weeks or so. Your aim, if you want, is to find the planet, on which the anomaly is located you played in the tutorial (aka 1st 5min).\nYou get clues where this planet is located via other planets that show starconstellations, mostly called (by the community) observatories or map planets. You've got to wirte down the coordinates. The more observatories you find, the easer you may locate the anomalie. Often people write those coords in the forum to help each other.\nThose coordinates are a kind of border, if you connect them you narrow down the place where the anomaly can be.

I don't think I can't really handle playing this for more than 15 minutes at a time. Guhhhh.\n\nThe $9.99 price is a bit steep in my opinion. I got it when it was on special and I'd recommend waiting for it to be <$5. I'd tentatively recommend it if you can get it for cheaper than the full price.","November 13, 2015","true","41.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amlz/recommended/231310/","amlz","Allus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amlz/","379 products in account","A game about exploration and discovery, with some clever puzzles along the way.  Best played with a friend over Skype, so you can discover the wonders of MirrorMoon EP together.  (Each "season" is its own persistent universe, so make sure you join the same one as anyone you want to play with.)\n\nSide A gave me a sense of discovery and "Oh...Oh!....OHHHH!", as clanmurph put it, that I haven't had since I played the original Portal.  Side B, similarly, is all about organically discovering the rules, mechanics, and objectives of the game, but at a much slower pace, and with a much greater emphasis on exploration.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to beat, although YMMV, as it largely depends on what you randomly find as you explore.  This was also the first game in a long time that forced me to take down notes with a pen and paper, as well as compulsively screenshot everything.\n\nThis game gave me the break I needed from overdosing on Fallout 4, and I can highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be set loose in a world where they have to figure everything out for themselves from the ground up.","January 9","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a first impression, this game lacks to impress someone as less patient guy like me. Maybe someday i will come back to this game and enjoy it more, but for now it is a letdown.\n\n1/5","January 26","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

After that it enters into a randomly generated boring star cluster with its own extremely obtuse  puzzles, no explanations or basic context, an insanely complex non intuitive spaceship exploration system and just plain bad game design. There is no sense of progress, no drive to accomplish anything, it is plain and boring and intentionally obtuse rather than intelligently difficult to understand. I spent a long time trying to figure out a puzzle only to find that there is no progress indicator, no way of knowing what you're doing, how well or even why, figuring out how to actually make the environment react at all is also a challenge that isn't always pleasing either. No hint system and no proper walkthrough since there are random puzzles don't help take the edge off in case figuring out useless stuff is not your thing. The game looked great in the trailer but sadly I cannot recommend it, there's just too much bad game design here despite a relatively strong start.","January 14","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty much every major aspect of the game is broken: it's an "artsy" game that restricts your ability to look around, it's an exploration game where you spend most of your time waiting around until the ship reaches its next destination, and it's a puzzle game that involves wandering around from point A until you find point B. It also has some sort of story, I think?\n\nBy far the most frustrating aspect of the game is the fuel guage. You don't need fuel to get around, but having fuel makes the journeys much faster - and even with fuel, it can take several minutes to get between stars. Several minutes with nothing to do, and there's even an achievement that encourages you to get up and walk away instead of waiting. The most insulting part is that there's literally no reason to have such a feature; going to faraway stars isn't exactly a huge advantage that players should be discouraged from. The fuel systems seems to encourage players to solve puzzles on planets (as they reward fuel for completion), but the puzzles themselves are so dull and repetitive that one wonders why the game would want to force them on you.\n\nThe game culminated in a search for the "anomaly star," and at first it seems like a compelling enough task: certain rare planets will have it marked in the sky, along with constellations that have several other stars labeled. This requires you to go back to your navigation panel and try to line up the stars from the planet to the stars in space, and this is where the entire process breaks down. There is no way to mark stars from the navigation panel, although you can go to them and back, and use your trails to mark where the important stars are. So get ready to potentially spend hours underoing a task that, by all accounts, should be a basic and obvious feature. I don't know what it's like to search for the star after you've marked out anything of importance, because while looking for the fifth time for a star I kept losing track of, I found a system labeled "ANOMLY" and that was the end of my search.\n\nThe ending is also supremely rubbish. You redo the first puzzle of the game, but two-thirds of the way through it stops you and rolls the credits. The first level was a much better finale than the actual finale. I might have been content with it if the game wasn't so stubborn about making everything obtuse and artsy solely for the sake of everything being obtuse and artsy; the achievement for completing this level is "No More Parodxes," not that I had any idea paradoxes were ever involved.\n\nI would actually recommend it if you have a few hours to spend and are looking for an unusual experience; MirrorMoon EP is one of the more unique experiences I've had, and I don't regret my time spent with it. I just can't recommend it on its own merits.","June 5","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
