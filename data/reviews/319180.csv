Despite a few cons with this new version I can't overlook the fact that they have also added several new features that have made things better:\n\n- The game now supports THREE players instead of two, which makes for tons more fun. Likewise, the game now allows for all three players to use "joysticks" instead of just one (the joystick mode also works fine with controllers).\n\n- Different ship types. Choose from four different ships that each have slightly different guns.\nAnd let's face it, the best one is the donut gun (well to me it looks like it shoots donuts).\nThis really adds a cool new dynamic to the game when you mix and match with the other players.\n\n- HEALTH. Play in easy mode to now have health for each life (3 hearts). No more dying in one hit!\n\n- You now always keep your weapon bonuses until the timer runs out (you won't lose it if you get hit).\n\n- Two new items that you can get in the boxes: A shield for temporary invincibility and an upgrade that doubles the firepower of your given weapon (no time limit!) until you get hit.\n\nAlso I should add that the game seems to have full controller support despite the description. The only thing that might need a keyboard/mouse is for putting your name in for a high score.\n\nThe only cons I've notice so far is that the sound only comes out the right speaker (which is kind of annoying, but if you can put your speakers in mono its really not that bad), and the frame rate seems to be a little lower, but its not terrible.\n\nAll in all I'd have to say that this game is actually really fun and arguably on par with the first one.\nMaybe not for full price, but if you find it on sale I'd say it's definitely worth picking up.","November 27, 2014","true","3.3"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","2"

Each level is made up of 5 areas, and once you beat a level it unlocks in the "New Game" selection screen.  You get 5 lives and 2 continues, for a total 15 lives.  A new life is awarded ever 100k points, but the points are reset if you use a continue.\n\nI was playing on Normal until the 3rd boss proved way too difficult, after which I switched to Easy and coasted through the rest. On Normal difficulty your plane is downed in 1 hit, while on Easy it takes 4 hits - which effectively gives you quadruple lives!  So yeah, becomes pretty easy compared to the Very Hard that is Normal.  I guess that's another minus.\n\nIf the audio is ever fixed (don't hold your breath,) I'll update the review to Recommended.","October 24, 2014","false","4.7"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","0"

You fly around in a space ship and shoot all kinds of enemies, ranging from other ships to... well... er... weird things. With seemingly no story, it's basically about defeating the enemies and getting a high score, which will save once you're done. You can pick one of four different types of projectiles when you start. This will determine your normal shots as well as your powered up shots. To get the different variations of your chosen projectile type, you have to kill certain mobs of enemies that will drop a star. You will see a color and letter on the star to denote the types. It seems that there's generally a power shot that will go through enemies and destroy enemy shots but shoot slowly, a wide shot to give you better coverage, an auto shot that lets you hold down the fire button to shoot continually at max speed, and rockets which seem to be the same regardless of your ship choice. You can shoot the star to make it spin around and change to the next in the cycle of set powerups. You can also find a lightning one that will always be lightning. And sometimes stars will drop that are only one type no matter how many times you shoot them, but all of them are on a timer. You can also find crates being carried up by ballons that will drop things like coins, score multipliers, and orbiting cannons that will shoot your current projectiles alongside you. By killing specific groupings of enemies you can get bonus points. Some larger enemies will give lots of points for being killed and will also drop fruit. You can collect the fruit for more bonus points, but if you shoot them they will break apart and leave you scrambling to pick up the pieces before they call off screen. So many points will get you an extra life. There are also bosses at the end of each level. There are five levels with five areas in each. By beating a level you will get a bonus credit.\n\nI like the art of this game a lot. The claymation look is cool with lots of vibrant colors an interesting designs in the backgrounds and enemies. The music is pretty nice too. It contols fine and it pretty simple to control. Being able to choose between different ships is cool for variety, strategy, and just some replay value. The mechnics of bonus points for killing enemy groups makes you want to kill everything rather than avoid it all. And the fruit gathering requiring you to be careful not to just keep blasting constantly is a nice touch. Also, the ability to swith what the powerup you pick up will be on the fly is fun because you have to decide if you want to switch its type and risk waiting longer to grab it or go in early while it's still safe and deal with whatever you get. Plus it introduced new enemies and hazards while staying visually appealing.\n\nThere are some problems though. Yeah, it looks pretty, but sometimes all the effects of exploding enemies can get in the way of seeing projectiles, not to mention the scenery getting into the foreground and blocking your view at times. There's also a weird choppiness to the visuals. That's probably somehow my machine, but it seems to meet the requirements so I'm not sure what the problem could be. The music is cool but can get a bit annoying if you don't like the song as stages are a bit long. Steam overlay would be a nice feature to include... or online scoreboards and such, but those are all minor things. I think the biggest problem is the pacing. The game is a bit too long to necessarily do in one sitting unless you generally have longer sittings like myself. Even if you do play it all at once, your trigger finger is bound to get tired. I mean, you CAN hold down the button to auto fire but unless you have that auto fire powerup then you can press the fire button much faster than that standard auto rate. I could use a bit of shortening up or perhaps some more variety in your gameplay to go along with the new enemies and backgrounds that you get.\n\nSo what does this add up to? Well, Platypus II is a fun little game, and it's worth playing if you like colorful space shooters. However... 7 bucks is a bit much for the short title. You'd have to really want to get those high scores and try out all the ships to want to keep playing, and it can be a bit tiresome to the fingers. For 3 bucks or less, I'd say it'd be worth getting for the general public. Overall, Platypus II gets a 6 out of 10 for being a pleasing space shoot 'em up experience.","October 8, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Played these games when I was a kid forever ago. They(Nux, Platpus I and II) do look unique, but IMO Platypus is the only "good" game out the three. Recommending this game mainly out of nostalgia and cards, but with the game being minimized issue, not really recommending it positively.\n\nAs a note to the devs- It'd be nice that when anyone has the game minimized the mouse should not be locked to a certain small area, so they can do other things on their pc while the game is minimized without any issues.\n\nAlso- Nux(-90%), Platypus(-80%), and Platypus II(-90%) were on sale for a week.  $2.77=Price of purchasing games individually. $2.99= Price of buying them in a bundle.

The second Platypus is far easier than the first and also has the nice function of letting you leave the game and then come back to where you left off. Another nice thing is that you now can have up to three players. Did I mention the fantastic music? Each of the 5 worlds brings something unique, and introdues new mechanics, which towards the end of the game are all working to stop you from winning.

No, by all means it could do with a little more features.  But is it a playable claymation shooter with 25 areas, 5 bosses, 4 different ships (each with it's own set of powerups), and local coop that supports gamepads/joysticks? Well yes, yes it is.\n\nThere isn't a storyline but arcade shooters don't really require one.  The music and sound effects aren't great but the loops on each stage sort of grow on you as you albeit slowly fly your way through each stage.  The claymation is nostalgic and at least well done - even with a lot of repeating enemies there were new hazards sprinkled in even up to the last area.\n\nEach stage is split into 5 areas, with each area taking up 3~5 minutes of time and the boss at the final area taking up another 5 minutes on average.  The total gametime is only about 2-3 hours if the entire game is finished in one run.\n\nI didn't have any issues with the game that others are mentioning (my sound comes out from both speakers) and adjusting it using my volume mixer worked just fine - Windows 8 64-bit, 3.3 ghz Quad Core, 8GB RAM (though the specs might be higher than needed I think the issue for many people are compatibility issues of some sort as this isn't very taxing).  I never crashed with this game yet and the controls ingame work just fine for my mouse and even the keyboard control scheme worked without any errors (I didn't test the joypad).\n\nI wouldn't mind having a few more options in the settings outside of Music On and Off but it's ultimately passable and very simple to just jump right into the game.  This arcade shooter has just enough to keep you entertained even if the difficulty is fairly low - if you're expecting a bullet hell then this isn't the game for you.\n\n\nThe stages are varied backdrops from the Artic snowlands, deserts to greenier pastures, while the hazards in each stage are a bit on the blander side.\n\nThe enemy AI is nothing new for players who tried shooters before with predictable flying patterns and the bosses that provide weapon powerups periodically to speed them along if you don't miss the fodder provided that drop them.  Overall there isn't much challenge here but just enough for the average gamer to finish the game if they are willing.","December 20, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But that's about it. I've just only finished the first level by my self using the mouse control. Will find some more time to kill so I can finish all 5 levels.\n\nAudio seems to be more dominant on the right side, but this can easily be fixed by right-clicking your speaker icon on taskbar => click on playback devices => then properties => then in the Levels tab, click on Balance and have the Right speaker slider down to 50% whilst keeping the Left at 100%(or I suppose any 2:1 would work, like 50% Left and 25% Right - but I'm using external speakers which have their own volume knob so I put my lappy's speakers @ 100% to get all of it and use the knob on the external to vary the amount of loudness I need it be on). Click ok and close the remaining windows and done! If you want to change it back to normal, just re-do the steps and have the right speaker balance the same as the left. Nevermind, it seems to be a one off issue - just had it run with both my headset and spearkers. Just had a few more runs inbetween breaks and it seems the issue hasn't come back....which is good! EDIT: Looks like it's back so maybe it happens sometimes and sometimes it doesn't happen.\n\nThere does seem to be somewhat laggy(when there's lots of enemies displayed on screen) whilst playing the game, but that's probably due to my weak lappy, I'm sure it'd run smoother if I ran it on my tower. It was laggy during lvl 3 to 5 but that sorta gave me an advantage in that I could see projectiles coming at me with more ease....\n\nThere also doesn't seem to be a full screen option and only windowed, but I'm sure you'll find a way to run it in fullscreen mode, for me windowed is fine as it keeps its original aspect ratio and not being stretched to 16:9 which is what my screen takes when in full screen mode.Never mind, it starts full screen.\n\nAs it stands IMO, I probably wouldn't get it at full price of $6.99USD, get it when it's on sale for like a couple of dollars or something or less. Or, even better, if you got lucky, like I did - get it for free! :P\n\nBut yeah, I like it so I'm recommending this.\n=============================\nPlayed on: Dell Insprion 15 3521\nWindows 10 Home Edition x64, 8GB RAM, every other specs are stock.","December 17, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise, just buy the fist Platypus because honestly it was a better game....\n\nPlat II didnt feel as polished as the first one and it seems way more difficult, even on the easy setting. It's as if someone said the first one was too easy so make the second one REALLY hard. That was part of the charm of the first one is that you could work towards perfect scores. Plat II feels way more frantic and less relaxing.\n\nThe music in the first Plat was cool and relaxing. Plat II, not so much.....just like the ramped up difficulty, the music sounds like disco on meth.\n\nThe player two and three options that flash at the bottom of the screen are completely annoying. I am happy when I get down to my last continue because then they finally disappear off of my screen. Why would you put those there for the entire game? They get in the way and make it harder to see enemies.....you think someone that owns the game wont remember that other players can join in?\n\nPlat II seems like Plat one's little brother tried really hard to make a game as good as his big brother, but couldnt quite pull it off.","November 24, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But that's about it. I've just only finished the first level by my self using the mouse control. Will find some more time to kill so I can finish all 5 levels.\n\nAudio seems to be more dominant on the right side, but this can easily be fixed by right-clicking your speaker icon on taskbar => click on playback devices => then properties => then in the Levels tab, click on Balance and have the Right speaker slider down to 50% whilst keeping the Left at 100%(or I suppose any 2:1 would work, like 50% Left and 25% Right - but I'm using external speakers which have their own volume knob so I put my lappy's speakers @ 100% to get all of it and use the knob on the external to vary the amount of loudness I need it be on). Click ok and close the remaining windows and done! If you want to change it back to normal, just re-do the steps and have the right speaker balance the same as the left. Nevermind, it seems to be a one off issue - just had it run with both my headset and spearkers. Just had a few more runs inbetween breaks and it seems the issue hasn't come back....which is good! EDIT: Looks like it's back so maybe it happens sometimes and sometimes it doesn't happen.\n\nThere does seem to be somewhat laggy(when there's lots of enemies displayed on screen) whilst playing the game, but that's probably due to my weak lappy, I'm sure it'd run smoother if I ran it on my tower. It was laggy during lvl 3 to 5 but that sorta gave me an advantage in that I could see projectiles coming at me with more ease....\n\nThere also doesn't seem to be a full screen option and only windowed, but I'm sure you'll find a way to run it in fullscreen mode, for me windowed is fine as it keeps its original aspect ratio and not being stretched to 16:9 which is what my screen takes when in full screen mode.Never mind, it starts full screen.\n\nAs it stands IMO, I probably wouldn't get it at full price of $6.99USD, get it when it's on sale for like a couple of dollars or something or less. Or, even better, if you got lucky, like I did - get it for free! :P\n\nBut yeah, I like it so I'm recommending this.\n=============================\nPlayed on: Dell Insprion 15 3521\nWindows 10 Home Edition x64, 8GB RAM, every other specs are stock.","December 17, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise, just buy the fist Platypus because honestly it was a better game....\n\nPlat II didnt feel as polished as the first one and it seems way more difficult, even on the easy setting. It's as if someone said the first one was too easy so make the second one REALLY hard. That was part of the charm of the first one is that you could work towards perfect scores. Plat II feels way more frantic and less relaxing.\n\nThe music in the first Plat was cool and relaxing. Plat II, not so much.....just like the ramped up difficulty, the music sounds like disco on meth.\n\nThe player two and three options that flash at the bottom of the screen are completely annoying. I am happy when I get down to my last continue because then they finally disappear off of my screen. Why would you put those there for the entire game? They get in the way and make it harder to see enemies.....you think someone that owns the game wont remember that other players can join in?\n\nPlat II seems like Plat one's little brother tried really hard to make a game as good as his big brother, but couldnt quite pull it off.","November 24, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
