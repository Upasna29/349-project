See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Black Mesa is a first-person shooter game by the 'Black Mesa Modification Team' aka 'Crowbar Collective' serving as a total HD remake using the Source engine of Valve's critically acclaimed and award winning game Half-Life (1998). Although Black Mesa originally started out as a simple Half-Life 2 mod, it has since developed and evolved into its own standalone game.\n\nBlack Mesa still follows the original Half-Life 1 story (albeit with a few level redesigns) where the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist working for the Black Mesa Research Complex with a PhD in Theoretical Physics with an uncanny ability to wield human and alien military hardware. Follow him as he fights his way through the Black Mesa complex which is under siege from Alien invaders following an experiment gone horribly wrong and the military who's out to cover-up the incident.\n\nPROS:+ Immense Graphical Improvement from the original game, such as, but not limited to:\nHigh Resolution textures\nImproved particle effects\nImproved lighting effects\nGood gun models and textures\nGood animation quality\nGood character models+ Improved immersion and atmosphere that brings the Black Mesa Complex to life such as, but not limited to:\nNew NPC to Player dialogues and new NPC to NPC conversations\nDiverse NPC models including female scientist, guards and soldiers with varying uniforms and faces\nGreat sound effects\nRevamped voices of Marines and Aliens (Vortigaunt)+ Great voice acting\n+ The AI for Black Mesa Security Guards were significantly improved (they now have a better chance of survival than the Barney Calhoun clones from the original game.)..but... (See CON #6)\n+ Cool soundtrack that plays on specific levels and events\n+ The level redesigns opened several new small areas within the levels and chapters which encourages a bit of exploration\n+ Customization options for multiplayer characters\n+ Good game time (provided you're playing for immersion rather than a speed run)\n+ Free version (Legacy Version) of Black Mesa is still available for download[www.blackmesasource.com]\n+ Great over-all presentation\n+ Steam Workshop Support\n\nCONS:- Early Access (will remove after final release)\n- Half-Life 'Xen' chapters are still missing (will remove when its completed)\n- Longer than usual load times\n- Walk button is not functioning properly\n- Few minor graphical glitches (particularly, some blood stain on the hand and guns models don't disappear)\n- The Marines and Scientist AI needs improvement (The Scientist Escort AI runs into line of fire instead of taking cover; In some occasions the enemy AI just stand around like turrets.)\n- Some of the redesigned levels feels a bit shorter than the original versions. (To be more specific, 'Surface Tension' and 'On A Rail' chapters.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME that does the legendary Half-Life franchise justice and Lord Gaben proud. Brought to us by a team of volunteer artists, coders and developers, Black Mesa proves that the formula of Half-Life can and will withstand the test of time.\n\nBoth fans of the old title and the next generation of gamers can once again visit the universe that revolutionized FPS gaming.\n\nWORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at its full price of $19.99 (or your regional equivalent). Black Mesa provides at least 8-10 hours of game time with one playthrough and is highly satisfying to finish.\n\nA message from the devs to people who says “it's just a paid mod”: (This part is not necessary for the review)Originally posted by BMS | Hubicorn: Posted: 7 May @ 10:49pm\nxxx We originally started out as a Mod for Half Life 2, releasing the first half of our modification in 2012 for free. Since then, we have evolved into a full, standalone game on a new hybrid engine while making vast improvements to the single player campaign. We are no longer a modification. We entered Early Access to gain support and make the commitment to finishing up the entire single player campaign, while introducing a slew of new updates along the way. Such as day one Multiplayer, Workshop, and Steam integration support.\n\nWith this comes costs such as licenses, hardware, and servers, that without being fulfilled, we would have not been able to release our product to our lovely fans. We aimed for the lowest price possible for Early Access given these circumstances. I hope this insight helps you.\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charles1982/recommended/362890/","Charles1982","Morbus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charles1982/","798 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nForget about Half Life: Source - This remake is everything you will need!Note: This game is still in early access and not finished yet.\nHint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nBlack Mesa is a fanbased remake about "Half Life 1", which was originaly made by ValvE. Planned and scripted from Crowbar Collective as a mod for Half Life 2 back in 2012, Black Mesa started to gain a huge fan base on modDB. Its highly detailed textures, revised graphics and new features gave the ageing rough gem a new cut and let the hearts from fans of this franchise leap of joy.\n\nOne year later Crowbar Collective got the opportunity to let the people decide on greenlight wether they would like to see this mod on steam or not. Much to the joy of everyone involved, Black Mesa was able to get so much support to finally find its way on steam. It turned out to be a standalone game with higher texture models as well as more features like a stunning multiplayer. On the 5th May of 2015 people were able to purchase Black Mesa at the steamstore in a still current Early Access, caused from the fact that this game isn't finished yet.\n\nHalf Life itself is all about Gordon Freeman. A scientist who works at the Black Mesa Facility. An experiment -which was already foredoomed to fail- went wrong and unknown speciments are starting to take over the facility. Freeman's mission now: to save the facility and probably the whole world. And so his journey through a horde of aliens as well as friends and foes begins. Will Freeman be able to fullfil this destiny or will mankind be doomed?\n\nAs already mentioned the graphics are stunning. The game itself runs on the well-known source engine but the many details, new animations and refurbished textures let the player re-experience the Half Life 1-world as never before. The uranium glows in toxic green, yellow-greenish goo and dark red blood sticks on Gordon Freeman's weapons and the radiation creates a sightable static; the developer haven't been stingy on the details for sure.\n\nNothing has changed gameplaywise, this will keep the nostalgia up.\n\nThe soundtracks of the game are really remarkable. Joel Nielsen composed every single soundtrack you are able to listen to on the official Black Mesa Website as well as in the game of course. According to his own website he started composing for Black Mesa in 2004. Since 2014 he works on the soundtracks for the last missing levels named "XEN".\n\nSadly, the multiplayer gets rarely visited. A shame, because even here the upgraded graphics and details find their use to fanmade maps. Anyway, give it a try after you finished the singleplayer, it is worth the time!\n\nTwo weak things I have to mention at the end of this review:\n\nFirstly, the rising difficulty curve. What starts as a cake walk for the player, ends in the middle of the game in a big carnage. Too many AIs will try to take down Freeman at once which ends not unusualy in a very frustrating death.\nSecondly, the AI of allies. Guards, as long as they follow you, mostly run brainless into enemies and autoturrets. If a door closes in front of them, they will unlikely try to open the door to follow you again. This leads to even more lonely walks together with many dead and trapped guards.\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nThis remake might be the best of this year. While reliving the nostalgia, I found so many new paths, items and details I never payed attention to in the original game. Since I bought it in the big winter sale, this gem has cost me around 10$, but reimagine the whole gameplay it would be worth every single penny.\nYet, the game isn't completely finished and you will encounter rough edges - but thats why it is still lingering in Early Access. Only 15% - according to the official Black Mesa Website - are missing, which includes also the levels of the XEN-world, so we can certainly look forward to the final sequences of this game.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ UPDATES]▬▬▬▬●\nOn the 22th of december 2015, punctually to the Christmas days, Crowbar Collective endowed us with free content called "Crossfire". This included the singleplayer levels "crossfire" plus alot of bug fixes and also changes in the multiplayer.\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Updated graphics, new animations, high-detailed textures\n[✔] Unchanged gameplay keeps the nostalgia up high\n[✔] Remarkable soundtracks\n[✔] New areas added within the known maps\n\n[✖] Dumb Ally-Ai\n[✖] Multiplayer nearly dead\n[✖] Harshly increasing Difficulty\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

(It's also on offer from various digital retailers, including Joel Nielsen's Bandcamp[joelnielsen.bandcamp.com] for loseless formats such as FLAC)\n\nIn addition, GAMEBANANA & ModDB still have the numerous community made addons for the mod such as the well received Black Mesa Animation Revamp (Whether they will arrive to the Steam Workshop is yet to be seen as of this review), so you have plenty of opportunity to freely see for yourself if Black Mesa is a game you wish to invest in during it's Early Access period.\n\n\nNow, The Game\nAfter receiving the still persisting development for just passed a decade and being one of the first titles to be given the Steam Greenlight, it's now finally here in an Early Access build. So the first question most would surely be asking is; "What's the difference between the mod release I can still get, and the Early Access build?"\n\nWell, this official press kit should enlighten you: http://www.blackmesagame.com/bms_presskit.pdf\n\nIf you can't view the contents of the link, I'll list it here for you:\n\nHeavily Updated Single-Player Experience\nThe Black Mesa single player experience has greatly improved from the mod release; new visuals, new voice over, updated gameplay encounters, stability changes and more. Xen is not part of the Steam release of Black Mesa, but will be included as a free update when it is ready\nBlack Mesa Multipayer\nFight with or against your friends, in two game modes across six iconic maps maps from the Half Life Deathmatch universe: Bounce, Gasworks, Lambdabunker, Stalkyard, Subtransit and Undertow\nCustom Modding Tools\nUse the same tools the developers used to create your own mods, modes and maps for Black Mesa & Black Mesa Multiplayer...\nFully Integrated Steam Workshop\n...and then share your work on the fully integrated Workshop!\nComplete Steam Integration\nCollect trading cards, backgrounds, emoticons, achievements, and everything else you would expect out of a Steam integrated game.\nIn summary, you're getting the same as the mod release now with online ready multiplayer, fully integrated Steam Workshop & other Steam specific features, with the addition of improvements in audio, visuals & game stability for single-player.\nWhat I can personally vouch for with my time with it is that the weapon audio has been given welcome improvement where needed & the animations have been drastically expanded upon, improved and/or even reworked (Especially the Crowbar), with initial pick-up animations for weapons that didn't have them and half-mag & full-mag reload animations too. And there are new voice actors whom have joined the existing cast, which fans of certain existing third-party Source games should recognise fondly.\n\nFor anyone that previously enjoyed the Black Mesa mod like myself or is keen to enjoy themselves another Half Life experience, this is extremely recommendable from myself. And with the benefit of having the free mod still available, you have the chance to evaluate for yourself if this is something you want to jump into during Early Access.","May 5, 2015","true","7.5"," 190 of 215 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","190","215","7","2"

The devs have not spared any effort to that end, either, as this game brings Black Mesa to life like never before. Everything seems to have been done right here, from the level recreation, gorgeous environments, sound design, and overall loyalty to the original game. All the dedication and hard work of the devs has created something that is truly worthy of Valve's legacy and the Half-Life franchise. Make no mistake - this is the way Half-Life was meant to be played.","May 7, 2015","true","13.1"," 135 of 146 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","135","146","3","0"

Black Mesa is challenging. Black Mesa is hard. Black Mesa will eat your soul, but not before making you die a couple hundred times in-game. Black Mesa will send you back a few years, and punch you back to reality just as you start begging for more.\n\nWhy don't we have a robot or something to push this sample into the core? This looks sort of dangerous.\n\nGordon Freeman\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Black Mesa.\n\nGameplayIt’s not possible to talk about Black Mesa and not mention Half-Life, but to be honest, other than the lambda symbol, and all the internet memes, I’ve no knowledge of any of the HL games, so it’s safe to say I’m part of the 0,1% that never played them.\nWhen I started my Black Mesa adventure, I wasn’t expecting top notch graphics, state of the art technology or anything alike, and that was a good thing, as I didn’t find those. What I did find was a great adventure, or, well, a great semi-adventure, as I was stopped by a “To be continued” screen, which left me wanting more, but not better. Why am I not wanting better, you may ask. The reason is quite simple actually. From shooting aliens, to killing headcrabs, to swimming in radioactive waste and even bombing a gigantic alien-octopus, there are very few things that can get better. And just when you think you’ve got it all under control, with all the overpowered weapons, it hits you, literally, and you’re back to square one, in a way.\nI like to think a good story can make up for most of the stuff, but there was nothing to make up for with Black Mesa.\nIf I loved this game without being a previous Half-Life admirer, I’d say it’s pretty safe to say everyone can, and will, find this game extremely entertaining.\n\n\nPros Great story;\nWhen compared to Half-Life games, there’s an obvious upgrade graphics wise;\nQuite a few weapons available to annihilate humans and aliens alike;\nChallenging, not only difficulty wise, but also with some, sort of, puzzles to solve;\nSimple UI;\nSome amazing screenshots can be obtained while playing;\nVery fun, very creepy, very entertaining, and even very scary at points;\nVarious options to customize your character in multiplayer mode;\nActive community and development team.\nConsidering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a "Neutral" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.\n\nNeutral There are a few visual erros, nothing gamebreaking;\nUnfortunately I couldn’t play the multiplayer mode as much as the story mode, as it feels a bit dead.\nHardly anything in the "Cons" section.\n\nCons Loading screens are somewhat frequent, thus are annoying.\nVerdictI'd give it a 9/10, which will undoubtedly turn into a 10 by the end of the game’s development. I might even end up joining the Half-Life 3 hype bandwagon...\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.","August 7, 2015","true","22.2"," 147 of 164 people (90%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","90","147","164","23","11"

So, I decided to make a review about it instead of talking about it over and over. As usual, I'll talk first about the bad things, however there's not that many:\n\nFirst and foremost; the controversy. I've waited for a long time to buy it because I was seriously against what the devs did. You see, time ago, this was a Mod. For free. The Devs had not yet finished it, but left it there for people to test it out. When they did that, they promised that Black Mesa would NEVER cost money, as it was a mod they created with passion to revive a game they love. Well that's kind of bullsh#t because soon after the game arrived in Steam Greenlight, and after a few months it was released in Early Access, still unfinished, and FOR 20€. A lot of people did NOT take this lightly, as it was a God-damn lie which they tried to hide from the Internet. In the end, I waited long for a sale, and I got it on the Autumm sale of 2015.\n\nThe second bad point of the game, is that after so many years in development, it's still unfinished. From the start to the Lambda complex, you'll get to see an insanely beautifull recreation of Half-Life, to then get hit in the face with a "to be continued", as the Xen chapters have been in development for a ton of time. To this point it's still not there, but that's not the only thing missing, as there's also a lot of maps missing on the multiplayer. Crossfire, for example, has been my most favorite HL map ever. It's a chaotic mess that I love, and it's yet to be added (devs said it's the next map to arrive). The multiplayer is also kind of abandoned as I rarely found servers with people, although I won't blame the devs for that.\n\nThat being said, what we have left is a game so good, it almost looks like Valve made it. The engine has been pushed to it's limits, and it clearly shows. Textures, animations, models; they all look insanely beautiful. Infact, I've only found a few bugs so far, one of them with a strange hitbox of a door, and another about an elevator that gave me ammunition for no reason at all everytime I went into it. The only bug that really annoyed me was the Hive-gun not appearing on my first playthrough. It was nowhere to be found where it was on the original HL and original Black Mesa, and I couldn't find it anywhere else. I was never a fan of that gun, but it seems that it got buffed and wanted to give it a try...\n\nWeapons have been balanced and/or remade to keep them from over-shadowing others. They also can appear in different areas than in the original game (remember the guard you can safe from a zombie early on? He now lets you take a revolver instead of a shotgun, which appears much later on, when the military shows up). The game also gives you a fair amount of challenge along the game, just as it gives you a fair amount of health, armor and ammo pick ups. Exploration is important, as there are a lot of said pickup items hidden in hard to reach areas. NPC's are helpful on it's own, and also have more personality and character than in the original HL game. You actually feel like they are someone who also got screwed because of the aliens, people who are trying to survive as hard as you.\n\nIf you haven't yet (for some dumb reason) played the original Half-Life, I'm gonna tell you to play this instead. However, seeing as it's still unfinished, and the price they ask might be too high for some, you should seriously wait for a sale. 10€ would be a fair price, further down would be a must-have.\n\nOh and, nice job putting the damn hat at the beggining of the game. It's the Gnome Achievement from HL2EP2 all over again.","December 20, 2015","true","21.1"," 170 of 196 people (87%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","87","170","196","18","26"

So for those who want the short version:\n\nThis game is awesome, but I am disappointed of the progress made in development.  Still no Xen chapters since it has been on Steam. Buy it only if you feel like waiting for the game to be (possibly) finished.\n\n--------------------\n\nNow for the long version:\n\nThis game came out on Steam around May 7th, 2015 and was put in Early Access.  I bought the game May 17th, 2015.  Now,  I had played the game before it came onto Steam. The legacy version, that is the one.\n\nThe game was good fun and great memories came back to me.  Both versions felt the same to me at the time, but I figured we would be getting a finished game soon enough.  Oh, how I was wrong.\n\nAfter the game had gotten some fair updates, I picked up and played the game again through, and found that the diffculty has been tweaked.  Ammo still felt abit scarce.  Weapons didn't feel as effective either.  Other than this, I honestly couldn't tell anything was different.  Marines felt more like aimbots from a distance suddenly too.\n\nThere was still no Xen chapters either.  I updated my review sometime in November from 'Thumbs Up' to 'Thumbs Down' and simply couldn't recommend buying it.\n\nA December 2015 update was announced and I had to get hyped for it.  I mean, 6 months after it came to Steam.  Xen had to be finished and the game completed, right?\n\nDisappoint. Again.  Mostly some bugs fixed, and cosmetic changes, again. (This includes weapon models, sounds, etc.)  Still no Xen Chapters and the developers seem quiet about its progress.\n\nI notice quite a few updates to the Multiplayer, but I do not play it and I greatly feel like this feature shouldn't had been done until the Single Player game had actually been finished.  Maybe this is why Xen is taking so long to be given to us.  I do hope they redirect their focus to what is actually important.\n\n--------------------\n\nSo, that's it.  In conclusion,  I hope this review and rant was informative and I will keep on updating this to reflect what I see and believe to be the state of the game. The game is definitely a very good remake of Half-Life. I am just disappointed about its development progress and just cannot fully recommend in buying, unless it is on sale.","November 22, 2015","false","38.8"," 995 of 1,318 people (75%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","75","995","1","44","103"

Even though it's not finished yet, it offers multiplayer maps and most of the Half-Life levels remade - Just Xen levels are missing. The original great level design and gameplay is made by Valve, but the remake itself (onto the HL2 Source engine) is made pretty well except some smaller bugs.\n\nPros:- Well-made remake. Plays as great as the original Half-Life, this can bring more people to this classic game, since the old graphics may not be appealing to current gamer generation. All gameplay features remains the same.\n- Fun and challenging achievements. Don't expect achievements in "beat level X" style, you have to do crazy or hard stuff to get them.\n- Graphics. Developers squished Source engine pretty hard and it looks really nice for a HL2 mod, particle effects especially can make your FPS drop to really low values - don't expect it to run with same FPS as Half-Life 2.\n- Custom mods and Workshop support. So you can mod a mod.\n\nCons:- Not finished yet. We are missing final Xen levels.\n- Smaller bugs. It's not perfect but I've never met a bug that'd ruin my playthrough. Just expect visual bugs, mostly.\n- It's not free as it was originally promised. Well, things change, even fan-loving mod developers need a money for bread and milk.\n\nNote: I have not played the multiplayer part of the game so consider that my recommendation is based on my single player experience.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","December 31, 2015","true","16.7"," 124 of 140 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","124","140","10","2"

I've played every Half-Life game including the expansion packs for HL1, and while this game won't ever have the classic charm of the classic Half-Life, this HD port and it's creators exceeded my expectations for mod that seemed almost impossible to be true, I like HD overhauls of certain games, and the development team did very well with this, they deserve something for their hard work, and that's why I decided to buy this version, and needless to say, I wasn't expecting a more polished copy, so I was very happy and surprised from what I see in this version. I will describe below how this version is improved upon the original BMS to better help the reader decide if this is worth their buy or not.\n\n===NEW AND IMPROVED/THINGS I LIKED===\n-NOW HAS A WORKSHOP!!!!!! LET THE MODDING BEGIN!!!!\n\n-Many level designs and Architecture and scenarios are greatly improved from the original BMS, in general, I like them, and they provide a new experience for me and doesn't make me feel like I'm just playing Half-Life 1 in HD, it forces you to come up with new ideas and ways of approaching certain obstacles and enemies, while keeping level design feel more immersive and realistic, almost as if you could role-play, it's just great.\n\n-Sound Design Vastly Improved over BMS, many sounds have been refined a well as the adrenaline pumping soundtrack of this version, weapon sounds and NPC voices have also been slightly improved from what have seen so far, as well as level elements, and enemy idle sounds. A couple of examples would be the HEV suit with a new sound filter on the original voice making it feel more immersive and futuristic, fitting to the game very well, and other sound examples such as the guard post between the two doors leading to sector C, where the guard makes a comment on Gordon's ponytail removal, before his voice was heard as if he was next to you talking, and now he talks through a COM like filter while behind the window in the guard post, counting as a nice improved detail that even I missed to question in the original BMS.\n\n-Some Weapons have seen new and improved balancing, better animations, new models, and more immersive details\nwhile still keeping a balanced ammunition pool that's more realistic and adds more difficulty to the game. One example of a weapon overhaul would be the Glock-17 which now has a new model, scratched details to show wear and tear of being an old used gun, it's original functions from HL1 have returned, and normal fire shoots at the same speed as the original glock in Hl1, and has seen the return of it's famous Alt-Fire Rapid mode, and has very nice muzzle flash, and blowback animations, as well as new idle animations, and a cool sprint animation as you have it equipped.\n\n-Much more dangerous combat at higher difficulty modes balancing out the loss of certain hard nonsense obstacles with the new realistic level designs implemented. Enemies are more quick, accurate, can quickly kill you in groups at close range, and are a lot harder to kill as you turn up the difficulty. The bullsquid for example used to be an enemy you could kill quickly at any range, but it now has much higher health, more damaging attacks, and it's spit attack has splash damage that can still be fatal, if most or all of it hits you, and almost more than one magazine of a glock can kill one on Normal assuming all hits land, and their close range attacks are still dangerously damaging, I now hate seeing bullsquids ever so more. And houndeyes not only can destroy you in large groups if allowed to attack in time, their attacks can optionally (can be toggled in settings) Ring your hearing and normally can disorient your vision with their sonic attacks, making it hard to aim and hear, thus making them also more formidable than before.\n\n-I LOVED the new HEV visual intro as you pick up the suit, not only was there a new voice, but when the HEV is checking systems and analyzing defensive weapon selections and vital monitoring, it will show the pieces of the HUD that it is referring to, and use the HUD bloom accordingly to show everything, and will even give a detailed visual interpretation of the suit and the wearer's physical attributes and weight. I also LOVED the loading screens having new fun looks, and gameplay hints showing a really refined experience, and even details like that are what make a game nice to have.\n\n===THINGS I HATED/THINGS THAT NEED A FIX/HOPE TO SEE===\n-Some level hazards from the original game that could still be implemented and not hurt the realistic design are missing, one example is when you go through to restore the power for the blast pit, before you could see a puddle or water, and later it would be electrified forcing you to find a method to get across, or perhaps a new route or vent would be nice to see, but that's only my personal prefence on some of these level hazards, they don't have to be there but it does make some areas easier than they should have been.\n\n-The crobar hitting speed is way too fast, it should be nerfed a bit slower, perhaps the same as HL1's crowbar, I love how the model and animations for the crowbar were improved and more enthusiastic, but the hit speed seems unrealistic and a bit overpowered, and encourages spamming to kill headcrabs rather than accurate timing for their jump trajectory.\n\n-I'm excited to see Xen and anticipate it very much, this is not a con that it's not out yet, I understand the detail you developers want to implement and I say, Take all the time you need, it will be worth the wait for all of us.\n\n\n\n===FINAL THOUGHTS===\n-This game is very fun and it's a whole new experience for Half-Life lovers, even if it's not an official valve game, that doesn't mean it wasn't carefully worked on and detailed, and by the time the full version releases, we will see a very polished and fun game to play with lots of features, some being new over the older HL1, and BMS. Help this developer finish this game and give them what they deserve for their years of hard work and dedication, and enjoy the refreshed experience that even valve liked to see!","May 7, 2015","true","20.7"," 83 of 88 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","83","88","3","4"

If you've never played the half life series before but are turned off by the dated-ness this is a great way to get the same experience with a more modern feeling. It stays true to the original but it's also not a carbon copy.\n\nFor those of you who are familiar, this is not just a fresh coat of paint or some HD textures. It's the entire game redesigned and remastered. The levels and puzzles will be familiar, but the entire thing feels different; it's a totally new experience and  absolutely worth playing.\n\nNow for the thing on everyone's mind: is it worth $20? As a standalone product, absolutely. It delivers enough content with the quality to justify that price tag.\n\nThe point of contention here is that the game was released earlier as a free mod. I haven't played much of the mod, but the money and valve's support here seems to have been used to take the mod a bit beyond what it could achieve as a mod alone - full use of the latest source engine, a multiplayer mode with steam workshop integration for maps, graphics and sound improved even further, gameplay stability improved greatly (I haven't encountered a single bug or glitch on my playthrough).\n\nCertainly, this is an improved experience from the mod and not just the same thing with a price tag slapped on. I'm given to understand the devs have kept the mod release (now legacy version) available for free so it's up to you to decide whether $20 is a worthy asking price.\n\n\n\n","May 10, 2015","true","10.5"," 84 of 94 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","84","94","3","0"

For any newcomers to the series, this is also fantastic, and you should seriously consider making this your entry into the series if you were put off by the original game's age.\n\n\nBlack Mesa is a re-make of Half-Life, that's true, but with the effort put into its development over eight-plus years it might as well be a whole new game. And all because they were dissatisfied with Valve porting it to their then-new physics engine in 2004. Pretty much every aspect has been remastered. Worskhop support lets you modify you experience easier than ever before.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Half-Life...that's okay. You don't have to be. But if you're looking for a solid FPS that doubles as a solid experience, with some brains, a lot of tension (bordering on survival horror at times) and even a little pathos up its sleeve? You could do far worse than this. Just play it on Normal or Easy, for reasons I explain below.\n\nAnd hey, there's multiplayer included with good maps and decent netcode. It's quite similar to HL's deathmatch at HL2 Deathmatch speed, with a much wider range of player model choices. The actual gameplay is still old-school 'player who gets the best guns first gets to kill everyone quicker' for better or worse.\n\n\nOkay, now for more technical details/notes for people who've played the mod's original release or the original Half-Life:\n\nMaps have been streamlined from the mod's first launch and from Half-Life. The gameplay itself is different from HL in only one way: it's generally better. The previously mentioned Marines no longer quite resemble hideously overpowered Counter-Strike aimbots (which was a problem in the original release).\n\nThe only criticism that could be said of the campaign is that the devs made it noticeably harder than the original Half-Life. At times, this makes the game incredibly frustrating on Hard difficulty unless you follow an optimal strategy and know exactly what to expect for some areas. While classic HL had its difficult moments on Hard difficulty, I don't think it'd be unfair to say that some of BM's hardest moments more resemble tactical shooters like classic Rainbow Six/Ghost Recon. Although considering you're effectively playing Joe Schmoe Freeman, PhD and fighting highly trained US Marines, it might be fitting.\n\n(Being able to land consistent crossbow headshots helps if you have ammunition for it; the energy weapons either come too late or are too weak to efficiently dispatch enemies with.)\n\n\nBM's graphics, as you might know, could be described as an improvement. Every security guard no longer looks the same. There's actually women scientists now. The Marines have much better voice acting. The 'Black Mesa' tab in the options menu lets you configure a lot of the game's new graphical effects, such as sideways movement bob, revolver ironsights and houndeye tinnitus.\n\nThe music is pretty good. Not quite as iconic as the original music, but it definitely shines at times. Comprehensive Workshop mod support, map-making tools and Steamworks features are pretty alright too.\n\nBM's most beautiful element to me, though, is the weaponry. The arsenal's feel is massively improved over the original mod's guns; every one of them is great in their own right. I'd say they even give the original game's weapons a good run for their money.\n\n\nI already said the developers have put a huge amount of effort into this thing, but they aren't done, either. As of this writing, they're still working on a version of the final section of Half-Life that they said they wanted to make better than the original. There's also various physics bugs that I'm pretty sure they're working on.\n\nGiven all of this, Black Mesa is well worth paying for. And even if you didn't like Half-Life, I would recommend it.","June 12, 2015","true","22.0"," 60 of 62 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","60","62","2","0"

Some areas of the Black Mesa Research Facility are actually different from the original, which can be very fresh and a new experience if you played and remembered the old Half-Life, however each area can still be compared to the original. While yes, there is a free mod version of this game, the paid version, even while still in early access, holds up much better than the mod version.  For example, I remember the mod version having much more difficult enemies because some of them (for example, the vortigaunts and the HECU troops) had the accuracy of a professionally trained hitman, while still dealing out a heavy amount of damage. While in this version, while they're accurate, their damage is a little less, still creating challenging enemies. Another reason this version's better than the mod version is because the mod version is never getting the final Xen levels due to an outdated version of the Source engine, the paid version is. My only complaint would be that I feel that the weapons are not as efficient as I remember them being, for example the .357 Magnum isn't as powerful on bodyshots as it used to be, and getting headshots during a hectic firefight between a military unit and damn aliens ain't easy.\n\nOverall, despite being in early access, (the devs have stated that the Xen levels will come out in a future update), it's a really good game crafted with love and dedication to the original Half-Life. 9/10.","July 14, 2015","true","27.1"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","59","64","5","3"

Not only is the game Graphically enhanced but the voice lines are all redone and it really is a new game consisting mostly of new textures with a few pulled from HL2, there's also a variety of new npc models made exclusively for Black Mesa. They even included unique models specifically for Dr. Kliener and Eli Vance as their models for HL2 were originally based off the 2 or 3 models for scientists in the original.\n\nAlthough, you might be wondering why I put "finished" in air quotes and that's because the game isn't actually 100% completed yet, they have everything done up until you go into the portal to get to the Borderworld of Xen. Once you go into the portal you get a message saying the assignment has been postponed as they're gathering more research. Essentially what they're saying is that it's not done yet but once it's finished it will be added to the game free of charge!\n\nHowever even without Xen the game is a fantastic deal! It really helps bring the original Half-Life into the modern age of gaming whilst staying true to the story and game play of the original!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/362890/","Dukefrukem","Dukefrukem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/","811 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Black Mesa team made a considerable effort to make Half-Life look more like Half-Life 2- make the set pieces more realistic, with a thoughtful approach to how a research facility SHOULD look. Let’s be honest, we all thought Half-Life appeared “realistic” back in 1998, but when you play it today, character models look like walking legos and most level layouts made little sense. The point of Black Mesa was to correct that and it appears they do right out of the gate. I need to commend the Black Mesa team for realizing some implausible mistakes in the original opening. In Half-Life, there’s a portion of the track where a gate is lowered that requires the tram to stop to allow the passing of a robot carrying radioactive waste. Would a research facility really build a tram system low enough for this to even be in issue? In Black Mesa, the tram is far overhead as the spider-robot walks by and is merely a sightsee on opening tour. These little enhancements make the world of difference when revisiting New Mexico.

Xen is missing, and along with it, the team promises to deliver a never-before-seen custom “epilogue” chapter to develop the transition to Half-Life 2 when Freeman awakens at G-Man’s beckoning. The good news is that Black Mesa already radiates excellence, and is available for early access. The bad news is it will remind anyone who plays it that Half-Life 3 is in limbo.\n\nhttp://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/pc/preview-black-mesa/","March 14","true","15.2"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","42","44","5","0"

The free mod version was a mod. This is a GAME. There's a difference. Black Mesa: Source was a total conversion mod for half life 2, which required the base game to play. That's what makes a mod a mod. This is a standalone game that will from now on get the updates. To put it into perspective, Killing floor was a mod for Unreal tournament before it was a 20 dollar game and you asshats don't complain about that.\n\nWhen I played Black Mesa as a free mod I was thrilled, and when the standalone version came on steam I bought it without a second thought because unlike most people I wanted to support the Crowbar Collective, because if anyone would take the time to read the early access description that you all apparently hate so much, It is stated that they are strapped for resources to continue working on it.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and toss your irritating sense of entitlement aside. These people have been working toward this for 10 years and you're going to rub their face in ♥♥♥♥ because you like your mods free? Guess what. This isn't a mod anymore. Its a GAME.\n\n- Faithful recreation of the source (no pun intended) material\n- significant upgrades since it's days as a mod\n\nSupporting this dedicated team of fans is well worth 20 dollars.

Not sure) I thought I would not exactly be remembering how the game was like, but oh boy was I wrong. I have to say, as I keep playing Black Mesa, there were moments that made me go "Oh dang, I remember this level back in Half-Life. Hey, how the hell do I still remember this?"\n\nI have to say, this rather proves how much of a masterpiece Half-Life 1 truly was, if someone like me who usually forgets about old stuff still remembers certain HL levels in this game.\n\nAnd it's rather interesting but, even though the major difference between Half-Life and Black Mesa would be the graphics, I just could not stop playing. If you really loved Half-Life 1 like I did, then most likely you would not be disappointed.\n\nAnd also, music. I do not remember listening to such super amazing music in certain levels back in Half-Life 1, but I have to say, the badass music that goes out when you get your HEV Suit and how the suit gets ready and all that, that moment is already worth the full price of the game (At least for me).\n\nIs there anything else that I should be writing about?

This modification is less of a modification and more of a total conversion overhaul. This game is a complete rehaul of the original Half Life with almost identical levels & gameplay, what makes this game so special that it's not like any of the other "Half Life" remakes or Half Life: Source? Read on and find out!\n\nThe Story:\nBlack Mesa re-tells us an already very familiar story and amps up the anty by 10, with the solid plot line from the original Half Life with the glory of the Source Engine 2013 technology.\n\nYou are Gordon Freeman, a scientist hired to perform experiements in an underground research lab below Mexico desert. One day on your job you're tasked to insert a rare specimen from the planet "Xen" into a reactor machine which causes a resonance cascade that destroys the research facility, but the worst is yet to come. As you battle your way out of Black Mesa research facility through these strange alien creatures & a corrupt military task force hired to keep the Black Mesa incident a secret and stop anybody that is attempting to escape from the facility a strange man in a blue suit stalks Gordons every move, who is this strange man & why is he here? It's up to you to unravel the mystery of this strange man.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nThe gameplay is the same familiar gameplay you would expect from any Source Engine game, it works identical to that of Half Life 2, it's got solid gameplay, a beautifully & lovingly crafted modification that everyone expected "Half Life: Source" to be but were let down, this is what we wanted from Valve but in the end we got it from a very tallented modding team.\n\nThe Verdict:\nWith a complete overhaul of Half Life you can expect things to be compaired to the original & with this total conversion you should expect to see a few significant changes to the original game, some new places to explore, some alternate paths to take and some new faces to encounter, although not identical to the original game it's very cannon to the original & nothing that is in the game feels out of place.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, the guns feel like the original game & most importantly the game has 100% it's own content, nothing is stock Half Life 2 assets, even the enemies are recreated with rather noteable modifications, they even went as far as to add their own voice actors to the game rather than using the voices from Half Life 2, however in the Steam release you will hear that a few of the characters are using the original voice actors from Half Life 1 & 2, this is nice to have the noteable voices back in a game that is trying to be the Half Life game it does so well to replicate.\n\nDo I Recommend This Game?:\nYes i certainly recommend this game, if you're still on the fence about paying for a modification then you can try the free version of this available here: http://www.blackmesasource.com/\n\nIf you DO NOT own the original Half Life you SHOULD own this! If you own the original Half Life you still SHOULD own this!\n\nIf after playing the free version you still don't feel like buying the game then there's nothing i can say to make you change your mind. However i will say that the money you spend here is going towards making these modders into an indie developer company which you should do as you can see they've really poured their heart and soul into this game which could easily be improved further.","May 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","33","40","4","0"

If there's a few points to nit-pick for example the fact you don't get the crowbar untill later on in the game compared to the original and you have to run past zombies with a moronic AI and hope he can kill them so you can get past them, the fact that "bunny hopping" seems to fail way too much but that's probably because of the source engine not to mention the fact that bunny hopping is rendered a useless skill any way because they added a sprint function. Other than that it's extremely well made and for the newer generation who may not have had the privilege of experiencing Half Life and have been spoiled by next generation graphics then i highly suggest you pick this up. If how ever graphics do not bother you i would say just get the original Half Life. Or Sven since that has the original half life on it and it is free as well as not requiring the base game. Plus the multiplayer is a added bonus to Sven.","January 27","true","4.1"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/362890/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlthough in early access only, Black Mesa is an excellent pastime for those who like reminiscing about the past and find it almost exquisite to play one of their favourite, classic FPS games in a greatly enhanced form. Yes, this is Half Life 1 but this time envisioned thanks to the amazing Source engine that made it possible for us to play the sequel along with the Left 4 Dead franchise.\n\nBelow are my pros and cons about this conversion:\n\n+++ The game looks stunning! The creators did not just make a conversion but changed some of the environments. Added several items here and there to make severals rooms / hallways more realistic. Laboratories are now full of equipment; towards the end game we can really feel like being part of an ongoing war between the military and the invaders! Also, the faces of the characters look pretty cool - I assume this is a later iteration of the Source engine hence the better facial animations.\n+++ Extra dialogue options: Especially true to the first level; just keep pressing E until you hear everything the scientists or guards have to say. And oh boy there's plenty they want to share with you!\n+++ Achievements: Good ones, I have to admit! Remember the scientist in the toilet? Pass him the toilet paper!  Also, make sure you ruin the casserole in the microwave oven in the kitchen just like you did it in 1998. As the game is unfinished there are no story-related achievements at this point.\n\n--- Sometimes enemies get stuck in one place. They just get frozen and do not react until you shoot them. It can be pretty annoying sometimes as tough battles can be completed too easily after several reloads.\n--- This game is sure quite difficult! Even on normal difficulty level the soldiers can hit you from afar - this is pretty unfair and your kevlar (=HEV suit) gets depleted pretty fast almost all the time. Interestingly, the vortigaunts and the big soldier aliens are quite easy to get rid of (especially the big guys were annoying in the vanilla game). The battle on the dam with the helicopter is particularly challenging as the creators did not put enough cover there.\n--- And the biggest issue of all: the game is unfinished. Once you jump into the portal to make your way to Xen the game ends. I initially played Black Mesa 2 or 3 years ago (downloaded from the creators' website - Steam release came only this year) and while many adjustments have been made since the 4 remaining chapters (chapter 15-18) are still missing.\n\nOverall, this is a nicely done conversion. It ups the difficulty level so those getting used to today's casual games may find it quite challenging. While 10 euros are not much for the game (this is the lowered price - it gets discounted regularly) perhaps it's best to wait until Black Mesa is fully completed. However, if you are an avid fan of Gordon Freeman's journey just like myself grab it right away!","December 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","26","30","2","0"

Not easier, just less frustrating. Some levels have been expanded, while others that felt like they were dragging on, were cut in size, especially the infamous rollercoaster ride. Oh, and the HECU soldiers were sent back to their boot camp and came back thrice as deadly. You'll be cursing like crazy whenever you overhear their radio chatter, because it means a tough fight lies ahead. The aleins are more deadly as well, especially Vortigaunts and Houndeyes. The latter posed next to no threat in the original game - here, if you don't kill them as soon as they appear, they'll mess you up. Bad. And they always hunt in pack of three or more.\n\nIn terms of graphics CC achieved something unimaginable - you're playing a Source game, and yet, when you look at it, it doesn't look like a Source game. Hundreds of new assets and textures, as well as new effects make it look like it was made in a completely different engine. The textures are crisp enough for you to be able to read what's written on the candy boxes inside vending machines and on computer screens. Everything has been modelled from a scratch, with the possible exception of dr. Kleiner's head. I hold a special place in my heart for the shotgun. The original looked and sounded like a toy, while this one feels like you're holding a gunmetal-black rabid beast that's only being held back by your trigger finger. "It can obliterate everything short of a battle tank", © NerfNow.com\n\n\nSounds were easily the weakest aspect of HL1, and boy am I glad they all got replaced by new ones in Black Mesa. Not by the default, stock Source sounds, mind you. Everything sounds different. Okay, the sprinting "gasp" is still the same, but we're technically playing as the same guy, seeing how Freeman hasn't aged by the time Half-Life 2 storyline starts. Kudos to Gordon's VA, you did a tremendous job. Freeman's voice never sounded so natural. The music is a little miracle in its own right, captures the mood and the scenery it's played in perfectly, and has a certain "HL2" feel to it. You'll know what I mean once you get to play the game.\n\nBM really has limtlessss potential.","February 18","true","15.9"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","35","47","5","3"

It wasn't until 2012 that, by complete accident, I stumbled upon Half-Life after having bought it in a bundle. I tried it, and it changed my take on gaming forever. To this day, it is still, in my opinion, the most ambitious milestone in video game history, along with The Legend Of Zelda : Ocarina Of Time and BioShock. Like these two other games, it brought storytelling to a new dimension, which had only ever been reached by the greatest movie directors of the last century.\n\nVALVe has my eternal respect for this major creation, but this respect is now shared with those who did what Gaben's Padawans couldn't do : make this legendary title live up to its sequel.

As Early Access adds new features to the game, expect to give it a few more playthroughs along the way (also, try to get the hidden hat achievement). Then you've also got the multiplayer, which is a great and very well constructed throwback to classic 1990s deathmatch. It's a lot of fun and though the map selection right now isn't too good, more levels are on the way.\n\nAs for the singleplayer: well, you've got a remake/reimagining of one of the greatest and most innovative games ever made. For one, it looks, feels and for all intents and purposes, plays better than the original, which sometimes suffered from issues inherent to games made in the late 90s. You've got a few clever surprises on the way that subvert player expectations in really cool ways, although they're few and far between. Overall, the story has been improved and in some ways expanded, a lot of new dialogue has been added, the environmental "mise en scene" storytelling has been conserved if not improved. In a lot of respects it's simply a better experience - with all the amenities, details and mechanics of HL2 but the satisfying difficulty, diversity, setting, atmosphere and engagement of HL1.\n\nHowever, significant parts of the game have been removed almost brutally, without any attempts at improving or streamlining them (the We've Got Hostiles vent crawl, almost half of On A Rail and a good third of Surface Tension). It just doesn't add anything to the experience and it stands out like a sore thumb on an experience that is otherwise light-years beyond anything AAA-supported studios put together these days (that includes Valve until they finally get around to making another singleplayer game).","May 20, 2015","true","21.5"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","32","43","0","11"

Duh.\n\nThe amount and quality of the recreated content is amazing. Granted, there are many bugs, specially in regard to the artificial intelligence, and some of them do break the flow of the game, requiring a reload (to be fair, this happened just once, when I was trying to push a bit the limits of the linear gameplay). Other than that, it's great. Stuff's optimized for the level of graphic (and oh yes, it's graphic) detail, too: rarely I had any significant frame rate drop. Loading times are reasonable, I think, though some transitions are oddly placed.\n\nIf you liked the original, even if you haven't played it in a decade, it's pretty safe to get this whenever it goes on sale.

A safe haven for aliens fleeing from their enemies. Aliens from Xen go through the portal and start tearing up Black Mesa, headcrabs infecting people, vortigaunts killing scientists and guards.

If you are a fan, if you are collecting Half-Life series, this is must have.\n\nThe upside: A great restart of Half-Life 1. Not an exact copy, something was moved, something was cut, something was added just because developers thought it'd be more fun. And hell yes, they were right, I think all the little differences bring more fun to the game. Questionable Ethics chapter is marvelous, On a Rail is shorter and less messed up, and that second Gargantua approach in Surface Tension changed and is way more cool and unexpected.\n\nOther changes: Soundtrack is written from scratch. There is no old tracks, everything is replaced by new music, which in my opinion sounds really awesome. From atmospheric lyric music to aggressive combat encounters, the composer hits all the right spots.\n\nThe downside: The time. It's becoming a tradition of everything Half-Life-ish. It's been so long since it was announced, I believe first trailer stated release date 2008 or '09, it was first released like 2012 without last Xen chapters and yet still it lacks them. We all are patiently waiting, but for some reason the content updates cover multiplayer, animations, model fixes and changes, some map polishing.\nThe second bad thing about this game is AI for soldiers, on all difficulty settings they are really dumb. Changing difficulty just changes their aim and damage received from their guns. But I believe that's true for all Source-HL series, remembering how dumb it was in HL2 sometimes...\n\nWhy should you buy it here and not play the free version instead? This features slightly better source engine version, multiplayer, content updates and bug fixes, steam achievements, steam cards and badges. You might want to buy it to support dem lazy ♥♥♥ devs that bring you this marvelous HD remake. I think all HD remakes should be like this.

If things have changed for the better, I will give it a positive recommendation.\nHalf-Life and it's sequel are my favorite first person shooters. The franchise offers a unique experiance to the genre that has yet to be surpassed. I have replayed them hundreds of times!\n\nBlack Mesa offers an incredible re-imagining of Half-Life. Both in terms of it's gorgeous visuals and spectacular audio. The people who were responsible for it's detailed  environments, sound design and character development are a top notch level of talent! The Crowbar Collective has offered a stellar tribute to one of the greatest games of all  time. I wouldn't change anything about what the game offers in terms of its presentation.\n\nWhat I would change is the most important part of any fps, the combat. The developers have decided against an exact replication of the original game. There certainly is nothing wrong with that choice. In fact I am overjoyed they decided to optimize some of Half-Life's more tedious and unnecessarily long chapters. While this has worked to improve the games pacing, it has hurt a crucial area of it's mechanics.\n\nBlack Mesa's redesign of the weapons makes fighting enemies far more aggravating. This is partially due to the larger number of enemies that have been included into the new ambush sections. Dealing with these new threats is particularly difficult because the reduced amounts of ammo that can be carried. Also, the damage in certain weapons (Specifically anything using explosives) has been reduced substantially compaired with the arsenal in Half-Life. Let me use the submachine-gun as a perfect example.\n\nThe SMG from Half-Life One:\nAmmo: 50 round clip - 250 reserve - 10 grenades. Fairly accurate with a fair amount of recoil that was automatically compensated by Freeman.\n\nAs anyone knows the amount of ammo and number of guns was reduced significantly from half life one to its sequel. However whatever Valve took away they added something to replace it.\n\nThe SMG from Half-Life Two:\nAmmo: 45 round clip - 225 reserve - 3 grenades. Very accurate and faster firing speed with a small amount of recoil that was automatically compensated by Freeman.\n\nWhile we lost a small amount of bullets and large number of grenades, we gained a far\nmore accurate SMG with a higher rate of fire.\n\nThis is what the SMG looks like in Black Mesa:\nAmmo: 30 round clip - 150 reserve - 3 grenades. Accurate in small bursts with a fair amount of recoil that is NOT compensated by Freeman. Grenades damage and area of effect was also reduced.\n\nBy these numbers the new SMG should be pin point accurate, no recoil at all and should fire even faster. The alternative being that the grenades should be at least 2 times more powerful than either of the Half-Life's.\n\nWhile I could certainly go over the issues I have for each of the weapons, I won't.\nInstead I will offer a quick list of changes that, in my opinion, would make for a better tribute.\n\n1: Pistol - Half-Life 2 - Semi-Auto is love, Semi-Auto is life.\n2: Magnum - Half-Life 2 - Suit Zoom + Accuracy = Head shot.\n3: SMG - See Above... :-)\n4: Shotgun - Half- Life 1 - Needs interruptible reload animation.\n5: Crossbow - Remove the arch, faster reload, 25 ammo.\n6: RPG - Please fix the laser guidance.

I purchased this on release day as i have been following this mod since it's infancy.\n\nHowever, i cannot recommend it. it is an incomplete game, with unnecessary multiplayer and workshop support before the single player experience is completed. i understand the early access model and have to be a bit frustrated as the free mod was released over 3 years ago and the paid version is creeping up on a year. Yet all that has been said is "Its being worked on". I had no issues at all purchasing the game, as i really wanted to support development and experience a retelling of Gordon's introduction. But i feel that development shifted to workshop and multiplayer, and away from the single player experience to sell it as a multiplayer game to try and get the CS players interested.  Half Life is not about multiplayer, and is about a "Man in the wrong place, At the right time" The release of xen is approaching the fate that has fell upon the story, we got a cliffhanger in ep2 8 years ago. and still no news on xen after 4 years.\n\nIf i can change this to a recommendation in 2020 when we get news that xen will be out before 2050, I will consider changing it at that time.\n\nWhen the developers either pass the torch to someone else or completely abandon it, some form of closure will be acceptable.","March 3","false","11.9"," 129 of 221 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","129","221","12","0"

I want to say it's 'one of the best', but it really does top off all HL2 MODs I have ever played. This review will cover the following: Price, and development.\n\nLike most people, I like to get myself a good bargain. I never usually pay full price for games - especially games that were previously released for free. Would have I spent £14.99/$20 on a free game that became paid afterwards? Definitely not. Would have I paid that much to get quicker updates, receive a game I knew I was going to enjoy for longer than most modern games, have the game permanently registered onto my Steam account, and best of all, support the developers? ...I think this is already answered! (Not to mention any buyers are also supporting Valve in the process!)\n\nWith the many years of development put into it, starting with the same comical style you would expect in the start of Half-Life, continuing with the most beautiful model designs, textures, map layouts etc, and then ending with a brilliantly altered storyline - the developers really have outdone themselves! You really do feel like this is what Half-life should have been if it was made 20 years later as it still has that nice old style and clearly, as the game intends, it doesn't modernise itself too much! Whilst the storyline is based off HL1, you still get the nice treat and change now and then which makes you think 'this wasn't in HL1' - and that's what makes it even more enjoyable! You still get the HL1 experience, and you get the nice little Easter egg or slight path change to enjoy something else in the meantime!\n\nSeriously, hats off to Crowbar Collective. They have worked to their fullest to provide us with this incredible MOD and no doubt they have put more effort into this game than most other modern developers have into current games that are far more popular!","May 13, 2015","true","13.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","2"

The Crowbar Collective definitely achieved their goal, Black Mesa is nothing short of Phenomenal. Over the years it has won various awards, and even with a year or so of inactivity on their ModDB profile at the time, Black Mesa was still nominated to the top 10 mods of the year almost every time, and for a very good reason.\n\nBlack Mesa is very true to the original Half-Life in terms of level design, gameplay and difficulty, but at the same time it feels familar yet different, it is not a direct carbon copy. The chapter Questionable Ethics and Lambda Core are good examples of this. Some maps and areas are diferent or cut somewhat shorter such as On a Rail and Surface Tension which are both missing some sections found in the original game, this is the only real drawback, but it delivers in almost ever other aspect. All of the weapons you use in the original game make a return too, and while they now have a more limited aummunition capacity, they look excellent and are fun to use.\nOn top of the graphical overhaul, Black Mesa delivers in terms of depth too, some excellent voiceacting and dialog really help add to the imersive atmosphere and explaining the story and situation further, not to mention the excellent quality of the maps making the game more atmospheric than it has ever been before.\n\nNow that Black Mesa is available on Steam to purchase as a standalone game, I couldn't recommend it more. The gameplay is solid and the game itself is flawlessly beautiful. The addition of achievements, the Steam Workshop and automatic updates add much more to make Black Mesa even better and reliable. Valve themselves couldn't have done a better job on this, definitely worth the asking price.\n\nDo note that Black Mesa is still under development, hence "Early Access", so the Xen portion of the game currently doesn't exist.","May 12, 2015","true","19.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

You've got much better graphics, better sounds, really awesome reskinned guns, and the same level layout we all remember and love.*\n\n*A few areas have been slightly redesigned and some long, drawn out areas have been shortened seamlessly. Ultimately not a big deal to me, especially since there's workshop mods you can download that restore the cut areas.\n\nThe main thing I didn't like was the new voice acting. It's all right, I just prefer the original. I also prefer the music of the original but the new music here is good too.\n\nIt should be noted that currently the game only goes up to the portal that sends you to Xen; Xen will be finished at a later date and added to the game for free (of course). What is here is still many hours of fun with the promise of more to come! Also there's multiplayer but I didn't mess with that.\n\nSo is this game worth $20? It's a complete reimagining of Half-Life, FAR more than a simple graphics mod. Therefore yes I feel it's worth it, especially if you're a huge fan of the Half-Life series and want more.","May 11, 2015","true","19.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Seriously? Fine. The story takes place at the Black Mesa Research Facility in New Mexico. You play as a theoretical physicist named "Gordon Freeman". You are heading off to your normal day of work and to nobody's surprise everything goes to hell. You are then sent throughout the Black Mesa Research Facility against both the U.S. Military and aliens alike, starting your adventure in the Sector C research labs, making your way through the offices of Black Mesa, the railway transits, hell that is known as the surface, and then the lambda complex. (To be Continued: Xen.) The game is basically one long "Get from Point A to Point B" with a bunch of puzzles, confusing level design (To new players), and some small boss battles along the way. But with the twist of the design forcing you to plot how you will play the game through, make you conserve your ammunition, and at some points question your mental sanity and wonder how the hell you're supposed to get through that room with 3 health and no armour left at all.\n\n\n\nLevel Design:\n\nCan you really count "Level Design" since it's a remake? Damn straight you can. A lot of small and large changes were made to the game's levels. Even adding some new areas to the game. Some of the more noticeable changes are the scenery during the introductory tram ride, sector C laboratories, and the surface areas. It's just enough of a difference to keep the game going without making it feel like you're playing something that isn't Half-Life 1.\n\nDownside in the level design: The "Vent maze" and the "Tram maze" were cut from the Steam version of the game as the developers said they don't feel they were made to their standards. A user has re-uploaded them from the mod version to work compatibly with the game on the Steam Workshop.(On a Rail Link) (We've got Hostiles Link)\n\n\nCutscenes:\n\nThe game has been given a much more dramatic feel with more voice actors, facial generation, and quite a few added little cutscenes and dialogue. For example in Half-Life 1: "What the hell are you still doing here? Get topside I hear troops are coming to rescue us." Almost every guard or hiding scientist has their little story to share when you find them. All the existing cutscenes in the game have been overhauled amazingly well, one of my favourite being the "Tentacle Scene" in the rocket firing chamber. which has seen some rather nice improvement in visuals and sounds from the mod version. Also the new voices for the HECU soldiers in the Steam version are a ton better than the original mod version's in my opinion.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNqVc5Nq8_k\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game itself plays relatively similar to Half-Life 1 with added physics, but controls and moves as if it were Half-Life 2. You have the option in the "Black Mesa" section of the options menu to make your character always run, more like Half-Life 1 was. Holding sprint in either mode will make the player run significantly faster and play an animation on all weapons other than the crossbow and the satchel charge. The weapons all function the same. Satchels explode on command, grenades have their same insane movement influence in gravity.\n\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nJoel Nielson did an amazing job. Damn near perfect. (My personal favourite song being the first On a Rail segment) The soundtrack seems to fit amazing with the ambiance and progression of the game and it's story. The combat music is some of the better sides (Questionable Ethics #1 being an exceptional example) and fits very well into the Half-Life feel of the game. I truly imagine this mod would not have made it as far without his works added to the game.\n\n\nOther:\n\nThe visuals, sound, and AI for the game have been extremely improved upon. (AKA HECU and scientists no longer run into grenades.) The visuals to the game are extreme. Quality you'd expect from an actual game studio. Albeit limited due to the source engine. The sound design is superb, meant for modern systems with surround sound providing an extremely immersive experience.\n\nA few smaller new features were added to Black Mesa, such as an auto-crouch jump (This can be turned off from the "Black Mesa" section of the options menu). Which I can only feel was added solely because of DSP.\n\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nNote: The multiplayer is incomplete as of the current time this review was written and has some changes planned to be made. I will keep this section bound to core elements only.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game in multiplayer plays near parallel to Half-Life: Deathmatch's. And yes, crossbow bolts explode again. The multiplayer maps are being remade and modified to Black Mesa's play style and completely overhauled in visuals. It feels essentially like Half-Life Deathmatch but with an HD remake overlayed over it, but with changes in all the right places.\n\n\nLevels: (?)\n\nThe multiplayer maps have to be downloaded from the Steam Workshop. If I have to guess this is so the developers can easily update a map without having to release an update for the entire game. As of the current time there are the following maps available from play officially from the BMS team: "dm_rocketfire, dm_tension, dm_office, dm_rail, dm_shipping, dm_boom, and dm_power". Adding up to seven maps currently.\n\n\n\nA list of the good, and the bad:\n\nGood:\n\n- Complete Overhaul. Not much more needs to be said there.\n\n- Balanced and fun to play multiplayer which will have more features in future updates\n\n- Just holy hell that soundtrack.\n\n- Plenty of little Easter eggs, inside jokes, and references to find everywhere.\n\n- More improvements than the free mod version\n\nBad:\n\n- The AI can still show it's typical for the source engine at times (Several times I've walked up to HECU Soldiers and they did not do anything but stare at me with their gun practically in my throat.)\n\n- Being on Source, you can expect both good physics, but at the same time physics that will break at a moments notice and likely injure or damage the player.\n\n- Just holy hell, the human assassins will swarm the player and just spray away with their guns, making it extremely difficult to kill them without explosives or wild gunfire before dying. (You have about 5-10 seconds on the medium difficulty before they kill you.)\n\n\nMy "Overall" rating would be ultimately a  9.4 out of 10.\n\nThe game itself is very balanced in both singleplayer and multiplayer aspects, the game plays and runs fluently. I've got no real complains outside the human assassin's tendency to swarm the player.","May 9, 2015","true","23.5"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","64","27","42","17","0"

Read at your own risk.\n\nI can safely say, that this is one of the best video game remakes that i have ever gotten to experience in my life. It's the treatment Half-Life, one of the best FPS games ever developed, deserved.\n\nBlack Mesa, while having a special touch to itself, still reminds you of Half-Life when you play it.\n\nStory: The story is the same as the original Half-Life. You play as the scientist Gordon Freeman, and have to escape from the Black Mesa Research facility after an experiment goes horribly wrong. On your way out, you will encounter hostile aliens such as Vortigaunts, who are invading the facility and killing everyone they see. Later in the game you will also have to fight against human soldiers who have been sent in to "clean up" the situation. The game's story is just as refreshing as the original game.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay wise, Black Mesa plays nearly the same as the original game. You use weapons, ranging from the iconic crowbar, pistols, SMGs, shotguns to rocket propelled grenade launchers and even alien weapons. However, there's been some noticeable changes to certain chapters, such as We've got hostiles and Surface Tension. People used to today's FPS games will find Black Mesa somewhat difficult to play, with it's old school mechanics such as crouch-jumping. But overall, the gameplay is great, and sometimes even better than the original.\n\nGraphics: Despite the Source Engine's dated techonology, Black Mesa definatively manages to look beautiful, and is certainly how Half-Life should look with today's graphics. The scenery, NPC's, props... everything looks great.\n\nSound: Soundwise, Black Mesa does good most of the time. The music is fantastic, Joel Nielsen did a great job at composing the tracks for the game. However, it can occasionally feel out of place in the respective situations. The voice acting was pretty good too. The Scientists and Security Guards voices capture the feel of Harry S Robins respective Michael Shapiro. The Soldier's voice acting feels... better than they were in the mod version where they sounded like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nIn conclusion, Black Mesa does a good job of bringing Half-Life to newer generations, even with some few flaws that it has. Even if you played the original game before, it's still worth paying to play this amazing remake.\n\nWritten by the gaming dinosaur, Littlefoot.","July 16, 2015","true","11.9"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","1"

Black Mesa is basically Half-Life with a huge facelift.  I knew I would recommend this game before playing it because I'm a veteran of the original Half-Life games.  If you're an avid player of first person shooters you owe it to yourself to play Black Mesa (or the original HL).  This game was groundbreaking back when it was new.  Just like playing Super Mario is my cornerstone of platformer games, Half-Life is my cornerstone of first person shooters/adventure games.

It really shows how big of a fan the developers are of the Half-Life series. I have never seen a group of people put so much effort into a free mod that is being turned into a work of art and something that will be recognized world wide as a master piece.  With all that said, the multiplayer needs a ton of work:\n1) The game crashes often\n2) Very poor performance (studdering, low framerate, ladders are very laggy and netcode needs optimization)\n3) The bunny bhop doesn't work well\n4) The crossbow zoom isn't instant, can't quick zoom\n5) Crossbow bolts aren't hitscan like HL1DM or Adrenaline gamer\n6) The gauss charges slower than HL/AG\n7) The gauss no longer does splash damage on corner wall shots\n8) The gauss doesn't penetrate walls effectively and do splash damage behind\n9) Suit chargers are not 30 points anymore (75 now) and charge way too quickly for competitive play\n10) Spawning takes up to 7 seconds or more and the camera follows the fragger.  HL/AG is instant respawn and HL2DM is 4 seconds.  This isn't ideal for competitive play especially when playing 2v2's and 3v3's.\n\nI really hope the developers keep these things in mind and implement them as the game gets developed.  As of right now, the game is no where near ready for competitive play (weapon and gameplay wise).  Alot of old HL1DM and Adrenaline gamer players that quit in late 2005 would only come back if these major unique gameplay features are implemented.  The days of fast paced arena deathmatch games of the late 90's and early 00's are long gone but I hope this game gives that genre one last breath.\n","May 12, 2015","true","11.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","3"

It's kind of like a puzzle game that turned into a bar brawl, making the player figure out what they have to do whilst shooting things. The NPCs are funny and there's plenty of hints to the plot itself, other Half-life characters and (of course) Gman.\n\nI had played Gmod before black mesa, so the mechanics made me feel comfortable but not too close to home (which would make it too similar), but it's still a great game for those who are new to valve or computer games.","April 1","true","29.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","4"

All the aliens present in both half-life and half-life 2 have been updated to the half-life 2 models, and the aliens only present in half-life have been updated to a standered that you would expect from half-life 2, if not even better. All the weapons have updated models aswell. I also own half life:source, and I always found the soldiers could kill you to easily, not so with Black Mesa. While the soldiers are by no means "easy pickings", they are much easier to kill and are a far more fair fight than the one in half life:source. Currently 85 percent of all the chapters are complete, with just the Xen chapters left to finish. This is probably why it is still listed as early access, not because it may have some bugs, (I myself have experianced none so far), but because it is simply not finished. In conclusion if you dont own half life but want to buy it, I would buy this instead as the better graphics and updated models will have you more engrosed in the story and its characters. I would also reccomend it to people who owned the original half life and loved it, because this game does it justice very well.","August 28, 2015","true","22.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

Black Mesa is in my opinion BETTER than Half-Life, it cuts out all the fat of the\norginal Half-Sandwich and adds some new and interesting mechanics (One example of a cut was the complete absense of those annoying ♥♥♥ leeches). The gameplay picked itself up with a sprint mechanic and best of all you get to shove your hand up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a helpless creature. The story remains the same however important characters from Half-Life 2 make their appearance in Black Mesa, the game runs swimingly but one issue remains: that good ol' fashioned slippery Gordon. If you haven't played the OG Half-Life allow me to update you when you dare attempt to climb a ladder or jump a gap Gordon moves around as if he has butter on his shoes and a shiv up his ♥♥♥, to aid this the developers did add a better ladder mechanic but platforming can still be a tad awkward.\nTo be frank if you don't like the orginal Half-Brisket this game may or may not be a waste of your hard earned chore money.\nBut all in all I rate it 8 Alien Molesters out of 10","April 18","true","14.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","9","11","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rastrelly/recommended/362890/","rastrelly","Rastrelly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rastrelly/","556 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf Black Mesa still was a usual mod, I'd give it as many positive screams as possible, and would be running with it around screaming on every corner how awesome it is. Basically, at the time I more or less did it, when original mod came out. But this is not a mod. This is a game that's sold for a price. This is a PRODUCT. Even more so, this is now just another HD remake, like Homeworld Remastered, Majesty Gold HD or Silent Hill 2 HD. And I am evaluating it exactly this way.\n\nHalf Life - the original game - was nearly flawless in terms of level design. Environments were expressive, but never restrictive, all levels differed from one another, and the game was overall one whole innovation. But this is not 1998, it is 2015. How does this remake hold up?\n\nLet's start with some positives. Environments are stunningly great. Details on all models and in all location are epic - you can see there was a lot of attention put into the game. Same goes to new models, like bullsquids, military guys, alien grunts, black ops, helicopters and so on. All areas look more or less realistic. Huge machinery is simply breathtakingly awesome.\n\nAll weapons are back as well, and they all are quite pleasant to use.\n\nStory wise nothing has changed - it is the same old Half-Life with some lore-friendly elements added from Half-Life 2, like Dr. Vance and Dr, Kleiner.\n\nMost of the levels follow the original with added level of details like additional doors to mimic open environments. Some areas changed though - especially Surface Tension level, which got a lot bigger, and On The Rail, getting MUCH smaller.\n\nMusic came out to be great and atmospheric, an actual improvement over original soundtrack, I must admit.\n\nBut what's bad? Level design and atmosphere - this is where problems start to pop up. For starters, some later levels were showing alien infestation spreading in the area - weird fungus, strange surfaces, odd looking formations; in this game there are THREE areas which at least resemble alien infested zones that were in the original, and they both seem soooo much out of place because the rest is absent.\n\nIn Half-Life there were areas where you needed to get help from guards and scientists - now there is only one area where you REQUIRE them. Also there is zero tension between Freeman and military now. Famous "Forget about Freeman!" line is now absolutely out of place - mostly thanks to super-cut On the Rail level, whic actually was built around the idea of marines hating Freeman even more then the aliens.\n\nBut the worst part is combat itself. It swings around from ridiculously easy (like vortigaunts fire, which can be avoided like there is none) to absurdly hard, as in case of helicopter fight on the cliff (made better in 0.2 patch, still annoying though). This comes from reworked enemy patterns, which were crafted with great care in the original, and seem pretty much random in Black Mesa.\n\nUber-detalisation I mentioned before, while improving visuals, harms level awareness, making some areas too obscure and hard to orient, which never was the case in Half-Life, and obviously will not be fixed at release.\n\nSome things can be credited to Early Access state - like possibility to see into nothingness in some areas, camera often clipping through models, and even untriggered ladder in final area (before leaping to Xen).\n\nAs a mod, it would be a great experience for nostalgic players. But as a standalone game? It feels too amateur to be taken seriously, and I highly doubt it will get better a release point.\n\nI can advise this to extreme fans who wish to experience nostalgia only; all the rest - grab original Half-Life, it's a much better option.\n\nP.S. AI and animation bugs, as I hope, will be fixed in release version, so I don't put emphasis on it.","May 11, 2015","false","12.9"," 605 of 1,139 people (53%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","53","605","1","37","96"

It combines the best of both Half-Life and Half-Life², into one very solid game, with the technology of the Source engine. If you played the mod version that was released about 3 years ago, you will be very surprised to see that the standalone version is almost an entirely different game, attributed to the amount of upgrades and polishing that has been done to the single-player campaign. Most of the weapons have new models, and all of them have completely new animations. The MP5, Hand Grenades and explosive Satchel Charges have received some gameplay improvements, with the MP5 now being full auto, rather than 3-round-burst. Hand Grenades and Satchel Charges can now be thrown much farther than in the previous version, and you can now cook grenades to have them detonate sooner after being thrown. Voice acting in this version is top-notch, with a lot of lines being re-done to do a better job at making the characters seem more like real people.\n\nThe new multiplayer mode of the game is really really fun, and it is very similar to the multiplayer component of the original Half-Life, although it currently seems to almost lack the ability to bunny-hop. Weapon balance seems to be pretty good, although in my opinion, the Tau Cannon's secondary fire should need to be charged for a longer period of time to be a one-shot kill.\n\nNow for the big question... is the game currently worth it? That's a decision that I can't make for you. If you're a huge fan of Half-Life and you really think you'll enjoy what the game currently has to offer, then, by all means purchase the game. I see the $20 price tag as more of a donation to the developers than an actual price for the game itself. The Crowbar Collective has been working on Black Mesa for about 10 years at this point, and now is the best time for the community to show even more appreciation for their work. Black Mesa is outstanding, and it's only going to get better from here on out.","May 6, 2015","true","24.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Sure, graphics, game-play or the engine: No need to argue,  Half-Life2 + episodes win these points. For me personally, the bigger impact (mainly the  atmosphere), had the first part. So, just keep in mind, this review is a pretty subjective one.\n\nI was pretty happy, when I saw the first few screenshots and facts, from the Black Mesa Project. Then, they released the free modification and it was overwhelming. I saw so much love for details, while playing. It felt like the good old classic, but in a fresh and modern environment. It´s also not a simple 1:1 remake, they also brought in some little changes and ideas, but never destroying the atmosphere of the original. Sure, the current Source-engine is not state-of-the-art anymore, but can still be impressing, if you ask me.\n\nIf you like the first Half-Life, this modification is simply a must-play!\n\nI remembering the heated debate, when Valve thought about an option to pay for mods, some weeks ago. I understand most of the points of both sides, but the day they were offering Black Mesa-Early Access on steam-store, there was no alternative for me: Shut the hell up and take my fu&%$& money. :-)\n\nIf you don´t want to pay for it/early access, it´s okay.

The original Half-Life is one of my favorite games of all time. I first saw it as Half-Life: Uplink at my friends house in 1999. I really enjoyed what they added to Black Mesa, female scientists, security guards that aren't just Barneys, parts of levels redesigned to make more sense. I did encounter a few bugs, but it is still in Early Access. Early in the game, a security guard said "here let me open this gate for you!" he then walked through the gate and back, and it was still locked. Then about a minute later he opened it. Later in the game a ladder fell on me and i got stuck, but that's not really a big deal. My only other complaint is that a lot of the time I couldn't figure out where to go, I beat Half-Life when I was 14 and I don't remember ever getting stuck, I don't know if it's how they redesigned the levels; maybe I just suck more at games now than when I was a kid lol. The graphics are great, it uses a newer version of the Source engine. I also liked the original sound track a lot. One thing I think they could add is the Hazard Course, I thought that was a a good tutorial in the original game it would be cool to see that added. Breaking boxes with the crowbar never gets old, and I felt like I was 14 playing Half-Life again. I'm looking forward to when they finish the Xen part of the game. 9/10 Coop coins.","June 17, 2015","true","21.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

I understand it's Half Life, the multiple award winning game etc etc but that won't stop me from criticizing it\n- Crude animations\n\nOverall,this is a meh game. The pros and the cons is balanced for me and I got bored to play this game after a couple of hours. I meant no offense for the half life fans. I know that they're trying to revive an old game by combining it with the 21st century gaming technology but I do think they need to do more to attract more people than just half life fans and 20 year old guys trying to replay their childhood memories.Of course,not all of the current players are either of them and I don't know they are successful statistically or not. I would still recommend this game even if you are not a half life fan. It's still worth the price.","May 27, 2015","true","7.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

Probably without some features which are only available in the retail version.\nExample: There seems to be also a multiplayer but I am not that interested in it yet.\nHowever, the campaign is as good as it was in the year 1998. Just with better graphics, a few additions but also a few reductions.\nNothing which matters in such a bad way to give this game bad credit.\n\nI don't know why there are people who complain about that remake, but they probably overestimate their own opinion.\nAs for an EA game it works flawless and I am looking forward to further content arriving (especially the final release of Xen).\nIf people want to have a similar experience without the need to pay they should stick with the mod and calm down.\n\n\n\nOk...\nDas Wichtigste zuerst: Ich habe Half-Life damals auf meiner PS2 gespielt und ebenfalls die Decay-Missionen zu 100% abgeschlossen, um die geheime Vortigaunt-Mission freizuschalten.\nDanach kaufte ich mir Half-Life 2 für PC und in dem Paket war ebenfalls eine Gratiskopie von Half-Life: Source enthalten, was ich ebenfalls wieder spielte.\nAlso kenne ich die alten Versionen sehr gut...\n\nUnd ich kann nur sagen, dass man Remakes genauso machen sollte: Neue Grafik, altes Gameplay.\nGanz nach dem Motto: Ändere niemals ein funktionierendes System.\n\nZuvor spielte ich die Mod anno 2012 und ich kann nichts Schlechtes an diesem EA-Titel erkennen, außer, dass man ebenfalls in der Lage ist das Spiel gratis eben als Source-Mod zu erhalten. Selbstverständlich fehlen einige Features der Verkaufsversion.\nBeispiel: Es gibt auch einen Multiplayer, an dem ich jetzt aber nicht so interessiert bin.\nWie auch immer, die Kampagne ist genausogut wie damals 1998 nur eben mit besserer Grafik und einigen Erweiterungen, aber auch Einsparungen.\nNichts was grob ins Gewicht fallen würde.\n\nIch weiß nicht warum manche Spieler sich so sehr über dieses Remake aufregen, aber wahrscheinlich überschätzen sie nur ihre eigene Meinung.\nFür ein Early Access-Spiel funktioniert es makellos und ich freue mich auf die kommenden Inhalte (speziell auf den vollständigen Release der Xen-Episoden).\nWenn Leute eine ähnliche Erfahrung machen möchte, ohne etwas dafür zu zahlen sollen sie bei der Mod bleiben und sich beruhigen.","May 11, 2015","true","60.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The level designs are breath taking compared to the level design of the original, though there were some parts that made me rage a little bit, but those were just hard sections no bugs or anything. Graphics look downright beautiful, playing on a 144Hz monitor, turning all of the settings to the max including AA is a very exhilarating experience. Gameplay wise there are levels that are even harder than the singleplayer of the original half-life, I don't want to spoil them to the players that are going to play this game in the near future, I'm just letting you guys take note that this game is quite a challenge. I will say that the MP5 is a lot more accurate than the MP5/M16 in the original half-life so that's less of a challenge on that part of the game. A huge majority of the sound effects are brand new and not from the original Half-life, the sound effects do sound great when compared to the graphics(which are really well made from the Source engine.) Overall this is a very brilliant recreation of the insta-classic Half-life, If you're even on the slightest side of being a Half-life fan then i would highly recommend playing this game, you won't be disappointed. If you're a huge Half-life fan like i personally am, just buy the game without even thinking about it. really enjoying this so far and I can't wait until the developers are finished with the Xen related chapters.

This January I decided to play through it from start to finish, and I was both positively and negatively surprised.\n\nStarting with the good parts: obviously, the graphics have been improved a lot.  At times the game is even beautiful to look at.  I found the level design quite nice while still staying close to that of the original.  I can't say which ones I liked more, but some of the "puzzles" had been slightly altered compared to HL1; mostly they had a more HL2-ey feel to them.  The sound track is absolutely phenomenal.\n\nAs for the bad parts..  The game is still really buggy.  Two or three of the weapons didn't seem to be working correctly -- one of them was bad enough that it was completely unusable in the game thanks to its unreliability, and even caused a couple of crashes until I figured out how to avoid them.  The scopes in the revolver and the crossbow zoom in and out so slowly that you'll simply die before you get a chance to adjust your aim, and sometimes they just do something completely wacko.  There doesn't seem to be a way to walk without crouching if "Always Run" is on.  The AI sometimes completely stops working (e.g. Vortigaunts just staring at you), and even when it is working, it's sometimes bad enough that it can be abused for cheap kills (for example, an Alien Grunt can be killed at melee range with the SMG without taking any damage).

This January I decided to play through it from start to finish, and I was both positively and negatively surprised.\n\nStarting with the good parts: obviously, the graphics have been improved a lot.  At times the game is even beautiful to look at.  I found the level design quite nice while still staying close to that of the original.  I can't say which ones I liked more, but some of the "puzzles" had been slightly altered compared to HL1; mostly they had a more HL2-ey feel to them.  The sound track is absolutely phenomenal.\n\nAs for the bad parts..  The game is still really buggy.  Two or three of the weapons didn't seem to be working correctly -- one of them was bad enough that it was completely unusable in the game thanks to its unreliability, and even caused a couple of crashes until I figured out how to avoid them.  The scopes in the revolver and the crossbow zoom in and out so slowly that you'll simply die before you get a chance to adjust your aim, and sometimes they just do something completely wacko.  There doesn't seem to be a way to walk without crouching if "Always Run" is on.  The AI sometimes completely stops working (e.g. Vortigaunts just staring at you), and even when it is working, it's sometimes bad enough that it can be abused for cheap kills (for example, an Alien Grunt can be killed at melee range with the SMG without taking any damage).  The list goes on and on and on.\n\nAside from all the bugs, the number of additional revolver magazines you're allowed to carry was brought down from five to two, which I thought really hurt my ability to clear bunkers stationed at open or semi-open areas, especially since there didn't seem to be a lot of hand grenades available.  A similar treatment was given to crossbows: you're only allowed to carry around two extra magazines (down from nine), and gravity now affects your bolts, which makes long-distance shots a lot more difficult.

So with me completeing the game, I can now give my thoughts about the game, But I'll just do pro's and con's.\n\nPROS:-The game almost feels like it was made by valve, so a fantastic job to 'Crowbar Collective'!\n-The atmosphere and environment of the game is absolutely stunning and perfect!\n-They removed some of the parts of the original Half-life that was very annoying to get through, which is great!\n-The sounds, and the visuals is top-notch!\n-This is a very good game to start on if you are interested in playing the Half-life series!\n-With 16 hours of gamplay, I was not at one point bored or uninterested in the current situation of the game.\n\nCONS:-The voice acting was good, but it's like every scientist I would walk to, they all had the same voice actor, which was just a bit odd at times. Same for the security guards/police. Hearing the same voices kind of made the game feel repititive.\n-The levels where you go to the alien's planet is completely removed/not added to the game, resulting in entering the teleporter, it ends the game. I think its kind of unacceptable for them to take this long to develop those final levels, but when they are finished, they better be good!\n\nSo thats the pros and cons of the game. I'll be honest, after beating Black Mesa, the old love I had for Half-life had came back. Its a shame that Half-Life 3 to this day still isn't even confirmed. Either way though, Black Mesa remasters Half-Life in just the right way, which my final score will be:\n\n8/10 (It could be a 9/10 if the Xen levels could come sooner)","December 27, 2015","true","16.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

This game may not be much different to it's earlier release, but it's been as equally as awesome.\n\nI felt as though I was in the game itself, having played the original Half Life, the first release of Black Mesa as a mod, and now this release made me feel "Late for work, again!" in the sense of getting the games. The environments in the game are nothing short of spectacular, the ambience of the interior of the research facility after the accident felt very, very real and frightful to me as I stumble my way out of ground zero, on my way to the surface, the dialogues and voice acting is all excellent and this game is in my opinion, better than any of the Call of Duty games that were good - 2 and the fist modern warfare - combined, and even better than that, several times over and over.\n\nBlack Mesa sends out a message that sometimes, in order to make possibly the best game within a generation, is just to have your weapons, your HEV on and activated, and your wits to strive for victory against all hostiles.

You'll need to go about 20fps above your normal framerate -2\n-The crowbar is a OP at the beginning -2\n-There are some game-breaking bugs here and there. For example, if you throw a wrench at an elevator near the start you can jam it in the shaft and you'll be stuck -4\n\nOverall: -19/+45\nIf you have the money for it, and like half-life at all, buy it.\nIf you think my negatives are a bit low, you're right and wrong. Right, they are low. Wrong in your assumption that I'm gushing.

Physics objects are often stuck in the floor or also twitching around.\nVery often there is a 'Node graph out of date. Rebuilding.." message when you start a new map.\nI can remember none of these things in the free mod and they ruin the immersion I felt with the free mod.\n\nSecond:\nThe free mod also had some funny textures scattered around the first level, which they removed. There are many places in many maps in the new version that seem reachable, but are not reachable either due to invisible walls or unimplemented physics for ladders. In the current state playing the paid version has been a worse experience than playing the free mod and the Xen chapters are not even added yet and this might still take a very long time.\n\nSo currently in this alpha state I wouldn't recommend spending $20 on this, the free mod was better.","February 14","false","6.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It is an amazing remake of the game that revolutionized the first person genre: Half Life. The game improves further on some aspects that weren’t even accessible back in the days which makes the story even more immersive. The game is completely cannon and adds some characters that are crucial to the Half Life Universe which weren’t in the first game. When Valve asked them to take the mod a step further and create a full retain copy I got super exited. They have not let me down, lots of improvements have been made to make this the remake it deserves to be. Better voice acting than the mod, new improved visuals and to top it all of a full Multiplayer Deathmatch.\n\nMore is coming though, Xen and as far as I heard they are experimenting with a CTF gamemode.\n\nAbsolutely a must have!\n\n\n","May 11, 2015","true","63.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wraggle/recommended/362890/","wraggle","Wraggle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wraggle/","188 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBlack Mesa is a modern remake of Half-Life, which started out as an ambitious mod and has been released as a fully fledged, standalone game, Currently in Early Access the developers have committed to continued support and bringing the final Xen levels that were missing from the mod. As it is set before Half-Life 2, Black Mesa follows the events that occurred to bring the Combine to Earth in the second game. It is part horror and part full blown action.\n\nBlack Mesa, as a mod, always had a rough ride in getting over the final hurdle. Changes in engine, team members, and the sheer pace in which modern games have evolved makes it an accomplishment that the mod was released and for free. They have now released their game on Steam and with a deathmatch component which is hoping to bring new players a small slice of what Half-Life Deathmatch was like. The retail version is running on a hybrid of Source engines so contains changes that aren't backwards compatible with the mod version. Most of the changes are subtle improvements in lighting, more stability and bugfixes, but also integration with Steamworks. Already there are new DM maps and mods for Black Mesa in the Steam Workshop which add to the experience.\n\nBlack Mesa is pretty comparible to other retail games. It has a good level of polish overall but has a few odd blemishes along the way. I think it is safe to say the Black Mesa, as the title suggests, is about the facility. The level of detail and focus put on the actual environment is very impressive. The machinery and laboritories are the best elements of the game. There is some equipment which is expertly modeled. When you see it in motion with the sound effects it is quite a sight. Overall the sound design is good, voice acting is well done with improvements to the HECU (marines) but there are some voices that are out of place. In some places Black Mesa also feels deathly quiet or slightly muffled with only an air con unit humming or a distant thumping. In Half-Life, sound was used to announce danger, so the HECU would be overly loud on their radios or the Vortigaunts would be gargling away. Yes, in Half-Life it was over the top but it made the game feel punchy. In places Black Mesa has no impact and I think it is down to the sound.\n\nThe AI have been reworked since the mod, so no more HECU soldiers sniping you with aimbot machine guns, and the aliens attacks have a bit more delay to them. However the developers seemed to have dialed them down too much to the point where the soldiers are almost pacifistic at times. They seemed to be scripted to hold back or huddle up. Some encounters I've seen them run back and forth between a rock and concrete block whilst I stood doing nothing. It is jarring and some battles become a duck shoot. The AI needs more work as it has turned the alien grunts and HECU into slightly timid enemies when they should be threats. On the other hand the assassins in game are agile but cause too much damage. This is being addressed by the developers but the levels with those enemies are almost unplayable. Its a shame as the enemy AI overall ranges from good (houndeyes and bullsquids) to bad (Ichthyosaur and alien grunts).\n\nThe set pieces in the game are still enjoyable and some are better than Half-Life. Most of the unforgiving insta-death moments in Half-Life are gone, but Black Mesa is still a lethal trial and error game in places. The On a Rail chapter is no longer a winding maze of rails and the Questionable Ethics and Lambda Core levels are really well done. Its a bit strange that with these improvements levels such as Residual Processing is still a bore and riding conveyor belts around with steep falls is plainly not fun. Surface Tension is also cut down so there is no sense of retreat by the HECU.\n\nDeathmatch is in its early stages but a fun, chaotic, game which is more closer to HL2:DM than HL:DM. Olders players are complaining of the reduced movement but for me it is a fun distraction for a hour or two. Weapons are all solid and meaty and using the experimental weapons is still a lot of fun. Its death match so takes a lot of practice before you feel any ounce of skill.\n\nHow you view the entire package falls down if you have followed the development or not. If you have followed the project for a long time and want to award the devs for releasing the mod for free, then buy it on Steam. If you have been following the project and just want to play Xen then for now stick to the free mod version and wait. If you have not followed the project then I would suggest trying the free version for now as this is still being worked on.\n\nI would recommend it based on the quality of other released games, however it is not Half Life, and needs tweaking. Let it mature a bit. The developers are still working on upgrading textures, tweaking multi-player and eventually bringing out Xen. I think it will be a few more years but hopefully a small monetary incentive will help them.","May 17, 2015","true","39.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Until my energy collapsed :P\n\nWell, where can I start?\nBlack Mesa is a remaster of Half-Life 1, the first game of the Half-Life franchise, made by Valve.\nNot only a graphics remaster but a complete mechanics remaster, for those who don't know, Black Mesa, is a graphical/mechanical remasterization for HL 1.\n\nIt occurs in Texas, 1999 in the Black Mesa facility (oh, don't you say that, Sherlock) where a scientist named Gordon Freeman is about to test a new machine for his fellow scientists partners. I can't say more about the start because... It will be a huge spoiler and nobody likes that...\n\nAfter a long while playing the free demo (a.k.a. not updated test version) version, I saw a lot of glitches, triggers you could walk past without activating them and... Buggy weapons... Of course there will be lots of bugs on the Demo (a.k.a NUTV (let's call it like that)) and it was a testing version "leaked" for people to play and try the new mechanics.\n\nWell, after 9 years of devel-\nNo, it's not my script...\n\nAfter 8.6 hours of gameplay, I can say that the game itself is pretty good, they fixed lots of bugs that were in the Demo and made some "passed by-able" (idk, don't ask, Im Brazilian, don't force me to speak perfect english :P) triggers bigger, so the player can't actually continue the game without activating them. Some of them were "NPC A.I. Activator" if I can call it like that, that made the game a little easy for players to speed run, I don't blame speed runners, I like it and I think I'll try it some day.\nPros.:Nice graphics\nNice mechanics\nAnnoying bugs were fixed from Half-Life 1\nThey HAVE a full game demo for players to test and approve/disapprove their game\nThe gameplay is awesome and immersiveCons.:Still a bit buggy (Early Acess Review, remember!)\nYou can still pass by some triggers without activating it\nThere is no Xen yet, yep...

I never played the first one, and I was unable to complete the second.\n\nThat being said, I've enjoyed alot of Black Mesa so far. The cast of characters are helpful and informative, giving the player incentive to save as many people as possible. They also engage in dialogue, and occasionally, the things they say to each other are profound and believable. The hard difficulty provides enough of a challenge without being too difficult. The enemies are tough, yet fair. The atmosphere and level design is reminicent of Bioshock (another game I hold dear).\n\nAlthough I've given Black Mesa alot of praise, that does not mean it is without flaws. I ran into a couple of issues; the Vorts' AI seem to be broken during the Office Complex chapter (which I tested multiple times), the last few chapters are still in development, and occasionally, the HECU marine does not drop the shotgun like he is suppose to.\n\nOverall, I LOVE this game, but I do not think it is worth the full price in it's current state.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iSunsetQuesadilla/recommended/362890/","iSunsetQuesadilla","iSunsetQuesadilla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iSunsetQuesadilla/","66 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is just... unbelievable.\n\nFor those who don't want to read this really long review, just here are my quick thoughts: It's amazing; the graphics are amazing, the music is amazing, and the gameplay is amazing. It's worth every f***ing cent. Buy it right now.\n\nNow for those who have nothing better to do with their time:\n\nI first came in contact with the game back in 2008 when my sister's boyfriend talked to the both of us about it. I had become a fan of Half-Life already when I first saw Freeman's Mind and gradually became more and more addicted to the franchise as a whole. So, when I saw Black Mesa, I got really damn pumped, anxiously waiting for the 2009 release. Of course, as you now know, there were tons of delays. So many to the point that I thought the project would never get released. I came back and left and came back and left when looking at updates. I still was an avid fan and hoped for the better. It came as a shock to my friend and I when the original mod was released via Gamefront back in 2012, released at 8:47 A.M. mountain time. Now that's awesome.\n\nThis version on Steam is an Early-access version of the game that is recieving updates constantly and is yet to recieve the remaining Xen chapters. But from what I have played now for hours and hours, I can give my final thoughts. I don't even care of the Xen parts are crap, which I know they won't be, because as I fan and a critic, I can safely say this about the game:\n\nIt is better than the original Half-Life in every single way and is almost better than Half-Life 2 in some aspects. This is one of the best games I have played in years. It's hard to know where to start when analyzing this masterpiece but by just going through the basics, I guess. The level structures are beyond impressive. There was a lot of time and hard effort put into making this a realistic looking game and giving it a very, and again I say, realisitc look. The original game, because of its graphical limitations, wasn't that detailed, and thus, maps for levels were very blocky and designed in a linear manner. That made this Black Mesa facility look laughingly built like just a video game level. It kind of takes you out of the experience if you think about it. Black Mesa here on the other hand, adds lots of extra rooms, more details, extra desks in understandable locations, and objects that fit in certain locations. It is a gorgeous looking game, to say the least. I wish I could post screenshots here for examples.\n\nSo the level design is beyond outstanding. One of the best looking games out there, far better than Half-Life 2. The gameplay hasn't been altered much, but new HUD effects and animations for the guns have made the shooting action seem different from all other titles in the franchise. The weapons have a lot of good weight to them. You really feel like you're doing damage to the environment around you and the enemies you encounter along the way. However, there is a lot of hidden stuff and optional actions for the players to partake in that really add to the atmosphere of the game. While there was some of this in the original Half-Life, much more has been added into this game. For example, in the chapter "Anamolous Materials", all you HAVE to do is grab your H.E.V. suit and go down to the test chamber. You can though listen to other people's conversations, which some of them go on for a very long time, hand toilet paper to a struggling man in the bathroom, cause disruptions during other people's work, and so on. In the third chapter, after the resonance cascade, you can have a security guard follow you back up to the front office you started in the previous chapter. However, here when the guard reaches the desk, he tries to phone for help and you can stand there watching him. Him desperately calling and no one responding at all really adds to the dark tone of the game, reinforcing the idea that you are alone in this dark place. It almost reminds of the movie "Alien" at times.\n\nAtmosphere, level structure, and gameplay are nailed perfectly. Not a single flaw I can find in those categories. But now comes onto the positive and negatives of the sound. The only places I can find flaws in at the moment in this whole game, besides some parts of multiplayer, are the sound. All physics and movement sound effects are perfect. There are thousands of sounds that correctly correspond to certain environments you travel through. Weapon noises are perfect in a sense they carry this heavy feel to them. The magnum in particular is my favorite. And I think I should address one of my favorite aspects of the game besides the graphics... the music... Joel Nielsen... thank you... seriously... I adore this soundtrack. Every single track is beyond perfection. Surface Tension 2 and Questionable Ethics 1 are some of the best pieces of video game score I have ever heard in my entire life. I've been having those specific tracks loop as I write this review. They are that amazing. So, the score is obviously a must buy. Like, go buy this soundtrack. It's worth the money. But now, there are the negatives to the sound. The voice acting is passable, but it needs a lot of improvement. Now, I'm not going to hold much against a very small team that spent many years developing a game that was original going to just be free. The voice acting is good for a mod. The problem is now this is being sold as a normal game. It's not a big problem or anything, it's just a lot of the line deliviries are very cheesy. Moments that are supposed to be very dramatic and terrifying are made kind of funny because of the way some of these actors bring out their voice. It distracts from the horrific scenes that take place in the visuals. So, the only thing I suggest for the sound is: before the Early-access label is taken down and the game is fully released, re-record the voices. Trust me, I think it would help the game just a little bit.\n\nSo that about covers it for the core aspects of the game. Just to recap, the graphics are beautiful, the sound is stellar, the gameplay is mesmerizing, and the overall structure of the levels shows impeccable work. The core game is one of the best games I have ever played. Right now, I'd say go buy it... and... yeah, go f**king buy it. Stop reading this and buy it! These people deserve your money. They worked very hard and spent 10 years of their lives to get this project completed. They deserve this reward and recognition. I might update my review once the Xen levels come out, but I doubt I'll need to, unless they're bad and I need to deduct points, but even then I won't.\n\nI love this game. I really love it. It's one of my favorite games of all time now. Valve, if you're reading this, please hire these guys. If you have already, then I say thank you.\n\nThis gets an A+ ...\n\n\n\nWhy are you still here? They're waiting for you... in the test chamber...","June 9, 2015","true","68.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_solios/recommended/362890/","_solios","solios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_solios/","134 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe paid Steam release is the free release from a couple of years back with a number of jaw-dropping improvements to visual fidelity.... and a number of bugs the old free release didn't have, mostly relating to NPC meshes and quickloading so if you're one of those 1377d3wdz who plays on hard and hasn't died in an FPS since 1998 you'll never have most of the problems I experienced with the game.  The reflection mapping is cute but the fact that the player character does not reflect gave me a headache at first, as my art-brain was strenuously offended by such a glaring omission - though the PC does not "exist" in most FPS in any meaningful way and that's entirely consistent with the original Half-Life.  As of May 2015 the developers seem to be focused on multiplayer so if you want the final act of the story you'll still need to play Half-Life: Source or the original Half-Life.\n\nFeature-wise, the game would benefit enormously from some very un-Half-Life FPS luxuries such as leaning, a melee function that is detached from weapon select (see: the Metro games, Bioshock: Infinite, Borderlands), and maybe a shorter grenade chucking distance.  It feels like the shotgun is way off from the previous release, the Source version, HL2, etc - damage is light and the spread is tight.  In point of fact the shotgun handles less like a shotgun and more like a weaker, slower, range-limited revolver with a spread that feels about as wide as the MP5.  Marines are hyper-vigilant and very aggressive, with long sight lines and instant reflexes - the crossbow is only useful at range if the target is completely oblivious; otherwise they dodge the bolt long before it can strike.  Other reviews critical of Marine AI (and AI in general) provide more and more accurate information about NPC behavior - it's changed from the previous release and in my opinion not for the better.  I found sniping by selecting the .357, sighting with the Z key then releasing Z and pressing fire at the same time to be much more effective than the crossbow - everything can and does duck bolts but I have yet to encounter an NPC that can duck a properly aimed bullet.  I did not find single player combat satisfying but I'm used to different games and I'm mentally comparing the experience to Half-Life 2, Half-Life: Source, and the previous Black Mesa release - all of which seem a bit more forgiving by comparison.\n\nI bought this game for two reasons - to give the devs some money in exchange for the enjoyment I gleaned from the free release, and to rack up a bunch of achievements in a game world I was already familiar with.  I have not played multiplayer and do not plan to; I consider the fact that the current release does not have multiplayer achievements to be a feature and wish more story-centric games would structure their achievements similarly.\n\nRecommended if you like the Half-Life games and haven't played it yet.  If you didn't like Half-Life this game isn't going to change your mind, though the modern visuals might make a convincing argument.\n\nI'll try for the "Rare Specimen" achievement in the final release.","May 20, 2015","true","16.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Better visual effects.  Cleaner textures.  Slightly greater features.  Noticeably better gameplay.  Better sound quality with some charming vocal talents thrown in.  Don't even get me started on how much fast-paced fun the multiplayer is!  Just... augh, I LOVE THIS GAME.  And if you're a fan of the Half-Life series, you will too.\n\nNow, let's pretend you've never heard of this mod or half-life.  Is it still worth your time?\nAbsolutely, yes.  This is not only a competent shooter, but one of the best in it's field.  Though not the prettiest shooter nor the most modern, it is extremely well put together, it handles magnificently, it has wonderful ideas (both from Valve's original and from the dev team), it's very well-characterized and it's one of the keystones of gaming upon which an era was founded.  You might not know it, but you probably need this game in your life.\n\n"Is it worth shelling out $20 when the mod is free?"\nIn every respect, absolutely.  The mod has a fair number of bases covered, no question, but this uses a much newer engine, has a lot of tweaks and upgrades to the mod, and is improved in virtually every aspect in ways both little and huge.

Some little things have been changed as far as I have seen and little touches of detail. For example, when you enter the locker room in Anomalous Materials and when you get the HEV suit, it feels like you are actually putting on a helmet. HUD display, code display and etc. It's difficult to explain that, you'll have to see it for yourself. Animations have been changed, which is a nice touch to be honest. Another example of this is when you run with certain weapons, you lower them down and literally start waving it around as you run around. It looks like you are actually sprinting, as opposed to the mod version, where you lowered your weapon when you started sprinting.\nThe game is also now using a modified variant of SDK, which has better lighting, textures and  more.\nThe absence of Xen is still, odd, considering the time they had after releasing the free version, but we can wait for that, right? Textures have been updated and I believe that some parts of the map have also been updated, if I saw it correctly.\n\nThe biggest difference between this and the mod, is it's feature of Multiplayer. I haven't given it much of a go myself currently, I'm pretty bad at PvP combat. There are quite a amount of people usually online on MP as I've seen on servers which have dm_undertow.\nA big difference also added on this version is the support of modding, as seen by the addition of the Workshop. We will hopefully see many good releases on there, maybe even as far as big single-player maps. eh?\n\nIt's quite an amazing feeling coming to this game, especially after the wait of 6 years that I had went over, and not to mention the time that I've been waiting to get my hands on this version.\nIf you want to support the developers who have given their time and effort, and by that I mean some serious effort, you should most definitely buy the game. I've also heard that some developers had quit their jobs to work full-time on this. That could be a rumour so don't take that for granted.\n\nOver all, it being in Early-Access might be a disgust to some people, but maybe the devs need the dolla' to hire artists and people to finish Xen, that is possible, it's still worth buying. I see good things for the future of this game, considering the added Multiplayer and Workshop. If you have the spare money, give this game a go. If you aren't sure to either buy the game or to play the free version, the free version is still avaliable, at the time of writing.","May 5, 2015","true","5.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","53"

Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198089099783/","18 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is when the source engine is used at its best, by the best.. Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of VALVe's world famous 'Half-Life' (1998), with updated visuals, graphics and physics gameplay updating to modern day requirements. Black Mesa still captures the excitement and isolation the Half-Life created and takes you round the old Half-Life scenes and encounters, as well as polishing them up to the best standards. The new weapon models (My favourite being the Tau cannon), the textures and new NPC models make Black Mesa seem almost like a window into reality compared to Half-Life's old graphics.\n\nOne of my personal favourites of the improvements was that the HECU Marines did not speak through Radio's, but instead spoke normally in their voices. This immedietly made me more immersed and empathetic towards them, as you could hear their emotions through their voices for the first time, ranging from determined and aggressive to terrified and nervous. They did not have the bad-guy, kill em' all tone that they had in Half-Life but are now showing a more Human side. This was so effective that I even felt sorry killing the marines!\n\nBlack Mesa has also included a multiplayer gamemode, which uses some of the old maps multiplayer maps from half life 2, such as Gasworks and re-imagines them like the rest of the game. The multiplayer itself is a fun, enjoyable experience which has sucked a lot of my time into it. The fact multiplayer has been revived and focused on in such detail shows the amount of work and consideration being put into this project.\n\nUnfortunately, the final Xen chapter is still going under development at crowbar collective. I predict that Xen will still have a while to go until it is ready for release. But the only possible outcome is that it will be outstanding and provide an excellent conclusion the this shining game. After all, the amount of work that was made to the main bulk of the game must surely tell us what Xen will be like!\n\nI did encounter a small jigglebone bug with the scientists' ties and the Tau cannon pipe. They spasmed manically all the time and made the game a little funny. However, this did not turn out to be a major problem, as the game is centered more on yourself and personal experience than the involvement of NPC's and the use of certain weapons.\n\nIn conclusion, I take my hat of to Crowbar Collective and the other Dev's that are taking the time and contribution to this game and the amazing improvements they have made. I wish them the best for their futures and I give them a very big Thank you!\n\n9.8/10\n","June 7, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I LOVE this mod, not because it simply updates the old Half-Life game...\n\nNo, this mod retells the story that Valve first told decades ago in the late 90s, much better, ironically, than they ever could have done. You don't play through the Black Mesa Incident anymore, you live through it. You don't simply stroll on in late to work, you stop and talk to people who know and work with you every day, people who all have their own relationships with you...\n\nWhich makes it all the more hard-hitting when the Resonance Cascade hits, and hits hard at that, and you are left to piece together what happened from the ashes not only your home, but the homes of many others. This is not a Half-Life remake, this is quite simply, what Half-Life is.\n\nNow that my gushing over this amazing mod is out of the way, I'd like to take a moment to address the "controversy" over this being a paid mod. Not a few weeks ago, the whole Skyrim Workshop debacle got me just as ruffled up as anyone else. It was a very flawed system, and I did everything I could to help contribute to getting the system removed. That said, BLACK MESA IS NOT WORKSHOPGATE 2.0!\n\nFor one, they've said for at least a year now that they would have a paid version on Steam, so it shouldn't be surprising to anyone who's actually followed the mod. Also, you can still get the mod for free off their site. Finally, this game, and its very talented development team, deserves to be paid for. Not only has the Crowbar Collective matched Valve's quality, it has surpassed it. For years, this team has worked on this mod to retell one of the most influential stories in gaming's history, and in my opinion, their work is more than worthy of my hard-earned cash.\n\nAlso, if you haven't gathered this so far, the Crowbar Collective isn't some team of chuckles that simply makes mods, they put love and effort into their work. Yes, they may not work as fast as we want at times (believe me, two years of waiting to see this mod finally up showed me that much), but they deliver something that is worth the wait.\n\nSo, now that my review is done, all I can say is good work Crowbar Collective, and I recommend that any person who enjoys the Half-Life series, mods, First-Person Shooters, or video games in general give this mod a shot. You don't have to buy it immediately, you can check out the free version, which does a great job of showing off the mod. Then, if you're like me, and believe the Collective is worthy, you can give the team a bit of your cash for their well-done work.\n\n10/10 Crowbar Collective, Black Mesa has always been, and I anticipate will always be, one of the shining beacons of what modding can be.","May 8, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The sound design, voice acting, and music are excellently done as well, with a beautiful musical score and crisp, clean sounds. Voice acting is also superb, and is mostly faithful to the original Half-Life, save for some improvements in acting quality.\n\nOverall, it's a vast improvement over the original mod, and even includes multiplayer and addon/mod support through the Steam Workshop. If you loved Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and ESPECIALLY the original Black Mesa mod, this game is a must-buy.","May 7, 2015","true","34.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As it stands, it's not a mod. It's a full-on remake, and a damned good one at that. The level design stays fairly true to the original, but it takes some liberties that make use of the newer Source engine.\n\nI also had the opportunity to accidentally do a side-by-side test between a new PC and a 6 year old PC, since I just upgraded. Performance on the older computer was pretty good, with a few hiccups here and there (it was also running on an external drive, which undoubtedly impacted performance), and ran flawlessly on the new PC. Since the Source engine is older than that PC, that's probably to be expected.\n\nThe elephant in the room has to be the lack of a Xen chapter. I'm given to understanding that this is part of the reason it's in Early Access, which makes sense. They're also not discussing development of the chapter, so when it comes out it comes out, I suppose. As it stands, I recommend the game. I'll probably recommend it even more after Xen is released.","May 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After that there was so many cool mods, then we had Counter Strike, Steam, Portal, HL2, Source Engine and so many games related that changed and influenced the game industry forever, Half Life has much credit for that.\n\nBlack Mesa is a remake of the first Half-Life, made by a independent developer, and they did a incredible job. I played the free source version, but this is much improved. I read the reviews before buy and they are extremely positive but still the game exceed my expectations. They were very successful on preserve and improve the atmosphere and every thing that made HL so great, but still they improved so much the gameplay, puzzles and etc.  The Source physics are not only added, it really interact with the game.\n\nOf course it´s not flawless, we have some problems specially with NPC and AI, but still awesome to play, and as early access maybe we yet get some improvement.\n\nIt´s pretty much like Half-Life 2, but Black Mesa facilities have a unique feeling, once you get inside there you will never forget.","June 11, 2015","true","27.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With Black Mesa, your experiences wandering through the halls and engaging in fire fights with either aliens from another world, or military officers that have been sent to kill you and all employees, has been amplified. The original story of Half-Life now touched upon, the voice cast have also improved their performances, giving us incredible and very immersive characters to meet and save.\n\nThe recoil mechanics provide an excellent balance to the sheer power your weapons possess. Various new models have been added to the game, along with previous models getting a touch up. Weapons now look much nicer, and the H.E.V Mark IV is now a nice blend between the original Mark IV model, and the Mark V from Half-Life 2.\n\nOverall, Black Mesa is an incredible game. It serves as a nice way to bring those that are looking to enter the Half-Life series (game and lore wise) by bringing the game into modern times.\n\n10/10","May 7, 2015","true","112.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played Half-Life when I was a kid, well I started with Half-Life 2 then with Half-Life.. If you're fan of Half-Life you should try this remake.. I know Xen is not released yet, but I will say it's worth the money to play at least the campaign without it until it gets released.. and of course I'm not forgetting about Operation: Black Mesa and Guard On Duty.. Still waiting for those too. I really appreciate the developers of this game, they really did a good job and I respect them for that, the music it's the only thing that made me enjoy the game more, I played the mod 3 years ago and listening to the music while playing the game was INCREDIBLE!

Logan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cmdrlogan/","179 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is truly well worked on. The attention to detail, voice acting, textures, fidelity to the story line, as well as the overall construction is amazing. There are very few structural and object placement changes (I confess I was feeling really uncomfortable not having the legendary crowbar where it used to be in the original Half-Life. It can be found slightly farther ahead now, but it's enough to make old timers break a sweat).\n\nThe game, overall, is incredible. It is Half-Life after all, isn't it? I'll just point out a few of the bad points. Take these off and you have yourselves a must-have recreation:\n\n- I feel the hitboxes weren't thoroughly designed. Sometimes, a zombie will be able to hit you even if you're about 3 feet away from its reach, making crowbar fighting a quite tough experience; also, depending on the ongoing animation, clear headshots just won't register, and you'll find yourself wasting ammo that technically shouldn't have been wasted;\n\n- I'm not sure whether more finale options have been added to this, as I have only tried it once. But where the hell is the Xen world? If there is one, I didn't get to set foot in it. It is pretty disappointing, as it is a big part of the original game.\n\n- If you're reloading your shotgun from zero, make sure you switch weapons when you have 7 shells in. The pump action animation will invariably fire a round into whatever you're looking at. Switching weapons 'kills' the animation and prevents the accidental fire;\n\n- Iron sights only work in the .357. It is a plus, although I don't remember it being a thing in the original Half-Life. However, it is pretty buggy. At first, it'll only work like the zoom in Counter-Strike (as though your neck has stretched some painful 2 feet forward). After a few seconds, the gun will line up in center just fine. The problem is, when you're not aiming anymore, it'll stay there, blocking your view of potentially important things until it's reloaded or switched for another weapon.\n\nEither way, I'd totally recommend this revamped nostalgia streak for all veterans out there. Did I mention multiplayer is really fun?","May 26, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's more difficult than the original, with some segments that will seriously take some effort.  Once you finally win though, you end up feeling extremely good about yourself.  The icythosauruses are scary as hell, and overall the alien enemies, Marines, and Special Ops are well done with good AI and character design.  Right now, Xen is still in development, but I trust that Crowbar Collective will eventually deliver with an awesome experience.

As it stands, it's not a mod. It's a full-on remake, and a damned good one at that. The level design stays fairly true to the original, but it takes some liberties that make use of the newer Source engine.\n\nI also had the opportunity to accidentally do a side-by-side test between a new PC and a 6 year old PC, since I just upgraded. Performance on the older computer was pretty good, with a few hiccups here and there (it was also running on an external drive, which undoubtedly impacted performance), and ran flawlessly on the new PC. Since the Source engine is older than that PC, that's probably to be expected.\n\nThe elephant in the room has to be the lack of a Xen chapter. I'm given to understanding that this is part of the reason it's in Early Access, which makes sense. They're also not discussing development of the chapter, so when it comes out it comes out, I suppose. As it stands, I recommend the game. I'll probably recommend it even more after Xen is released.","May 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are incredibly polished compared to anything that was published beforehand, the game is surprisingly stable, and they even fixed the crouch-jump issue - well at least mostly. To be completely honest, I found it ridiculously overpriced at 20 eur, which is why I waited for a discount, but seeing all the work and effort put into this game made me understand the pricing: they built a Valve-worthy game out of scratch with a predecessor that has put the bar insanely high.

It has been made purely for the sake of making what Half-Life: Source should have been.

I've never played the original Half-Life, however I can really see how much the developers of Black Mesa loved the original and their passion for it. Their love and dedication to this game is something I really felt and has won me over.\n\nThere's really a feeling of tragedy and disaster in the game; to which I find myself doing my best to protect the scientists and security partners. You feel sad and helpless when you watch another scientist and/or security guard get killed and there's nothing you can do about it. I don't know how many times I've tried to save one scientist from falling to his death only to watch him die and have myself die several times in the process! At least until I realized there was literally no way to save him.\n\nI can't wait to finally visit Xen and complete the game!

That is not to say it isn't a milestone in game design - far from it, HL 1 was actually one of the DEFINING games of the late 90's. Probably the first game that tells a story without cutting any corners, Half Life to me is like a diamond waiting to be cut, it's what kickstarted the genre. Duke Nukem and Quake were there before it, but not a single one of those was as immersive, as "alive", as content-filled and believable.\n\nNow, the undisputed king of all 3D FPS games to me is Unreal. But that comparison wouldn't be overly fair. There is infinitely more sexiness in alien vistas where no man has trodden before (or so you think when you (crash-)land in Na Pali for the first time, than in decaying concrete buildings and scrapped experiments where man has already done plenty enough. Still, both games by any standard, especially when compared to what we are used to having today, are MASSIVE. There is so much "terrain" to cross, so many places to visit, and all that was done with high enough fidelity to let players feel what Mr. Freeman felt (perhaps, except for the sticky tongue of a barnacle, but those things still give me the creeps).\n\nNow both these games have aged, and would hardly elicit the smile in a modern player like they did back then. Half Life got lucky, however, in this remastering. I am glad indeed that more and more "classic" games are being remastered, re-released today for new folks to enjoy them, but what always worries me is the "quality" of those remakes. Often the publisher thinks perfection can be "improved" by integrating some new mechanics... ugh!\n\nThis particular release is as true to the original as any could ever be. In fact, I do remember a few differences between the old game, and the new one. But it is not something that bothers me too much, far from it. It IS Half-Life 1 where it counts. And it's gorgeous (at least, it wouldn't feel ashamed next to Bioshock graphics, and, seriously, does anyone need Crysis level graphics in a game that spends most of its time in concrete halls and near strange shiny green liquids?\n\nYes, if you pay close attention to level design, you'll see just how low poly all of them are. But then look around you next time you're in some underground parking lot. Are those shapes complex? You don't notice any lack of fidelity, because most of the places Mr. Freeman visits aren't really palace party halls, those are functional, simple, and, until recently, were being used for practical things. Enough about graphics. Those are sufficient and do not get in the way of enjoying the game.\n\nAs some other reviewers mentioned here, this is one of the first cutscene-less games that manages to tell a story. No extra reading needed, you get to see (and hear) everything through the eyes of your character. Speaking of which, I often hear Bioshock Infinite criticized for not having the option for a female character. Black Mesa will not give one to you either. In case of the former it's the setting - there was no way someone would send a female detective (there weren't any) in Bioshock's time. In case of the latter, Half Life 1 had Gordon Freeman, and so shall Black Mesa. There simply can't be someone else in this game, male or female (or alien, for that matter).\n\nIt is a great game by all accounts, but it is not quite finished yet. So expect some quirks. It is also trying to be as close to the original as possible, so expect some more quirks that the original had. Ladders *cough cough. Those are actually worse than I remember. Textures here and there aren't fully uprezzed (or they need another pass). If you are the kind of player that gets disappointed by game glitches or other deficiencies, wait for release. If you can tolerate these, don't think twice, grab this. Whether to take a nostalgic tour in what gaming was at its finest, or to simply have a break from CoD-style drivel, you owe it to yourself to give this a try.","May 17, 2015","true","18.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As for the BM deathmatch... You will never laugh harder at so much ensuing morbid hilarity amongst the spray of bullets, blood, guts, and dismembered limbs.\n\nI probably played the free pre-Steam release of BM four times, and just finished the Steam release version. There is some new content added to the game  -- graphics, areas, etc. -- including new voice acting for the marines, which is a good thing since the previous voice for the marines was amateur compared to the rest of the voice acting quality. The developers really do improve on HL1 in many ways, and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves FPS games or the HL series. I can't wait for Xen.\n\nHowever, in my latest BM experience, the Steam release version notably had more bugs than the pre-Steam version. The AI was pretty bad on a number of occasions which didn't occur during the pre-Steam version. A few glitches of dead characters miraculously standing up manifested themselves (see my screen shots). The physics also needs some tweaking; for example, instead of some items leaning on each other or moving out of the way they just passed right through each other. These bugs made my play-through less great than it could have been, and these bugs need fixing to perfect this game.\n\nOther than bugs, one complaint is that I think BM should not have omitted some content from the original HL1. Some things may be cheesy to keep -- and I understand omitting those things. But there are scenes missing from Surface Tension, for example, where the chopper is hunting Freeman down on the desert surface amongst minefields. And I think such a scene would have been great to preserve. Maybe those will turn up on the Workshop, but I would have liked to see the BM devs do them right. And of course, we need the Xen chapter soon, too. But none of this, of course, makes BM worth overlooking!","May 31, 2015","true","73.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I do like the original Half Life, a game that still seems to hold up today in terms of story detail (not necessarily being thrown directly at your face), but I've been spoiled by much prettier games for far too long.\n\nBlack Mesa is exactly what it is setting out to be: A complete re-make of Half Life in the Source engine with more detailed environments, much better lighting, shadows, textures, and visual effects as a result. The game will be entirely familiar to anyone who played the original game, and is a great way for people who have never played it before to give it a go.\nAt this point however, it's still missing Xen, an arguably weaker portion of the game, but still a portion of it regardless. Many were hoping, myself included, that the Steam release would finally see this part of the game included. Instead, it seems we got multiplayer for now.\n\nThis is easily one of the best looking Source games (unless you count the heavily modified version used in something like Titanfall) and it runs exactly like a source engine game. My system can run the game with full max settings at 4K resolution AND AA enabled at 60FPS no problem at all. Gameplay is smooth, very similar to Half Life 2, and keeps all the exact same mechanics.\n\nThe atmosphere was nailed perfectly. Obviously with the leap in engine and technology from the original, this game manages to have much better atmosphere than Half Life, with the previously mentioned better lighting and shadows, causing a more drastic and dramatic change to the Black Mesa facility after "the incident". Sound is fantastic as well. Something about that heavy, boot thud after falling down from something is very satisfying to me. All the gun models look fantastic and sound just as great, packing real punch.\n\nIt's really quite amazing how accurate this game is to the original, from item and environment placement to the same character voices, all while managing to add their own detail as well that feels entirely appropriate.\n\nIs it worth your $20 right now? Well, it's in Early Access right now for a reason: It's incomplete. My thought is that they developers are trying to gain a few bucks now so they can speed up the process on creating the remainder of the game, so if you want to support the developers, and to have much easier access to the game (rather than torrenting it and having to download the SDK) then go ahead.

The weapons really need to be exactly like they were in Half-Life because strangely (And I'm not the most nitpicky I swear.) the small changes made to how they work just make them not very fun to use. The comabt is kinda dull. Before an update May 14th here is how I felt about two important enemy types you'll encounters remade incarnations: "What it really needs to do is fix the soldiers as they are not as intelligent or as fun to fight as their GoldSource counter parts..." While the HECU's mod AI had a jaw dropping aimbot and firing rate which did get fixed in the retail version but even still before the update the soldiers acted less like real humans or the HECU and more like reskinned combine in terms of behavior. As of the update currently the HECU run away, group up and spread out a lot more than before AND even make meangful hand signals which is a big improvement even though they aren't as smart as their Gold Source and Half-Life: Source counterparts YET. I've seen soldiers try and sometimes suceed in distracting me with supressing fire after gesturing a soldier to try to move up to my position which having check the console was done by  the AI and not thanks to a triggered scripted sequence. Effectivley they will sometimes try to sneak up on you in an unscripted manner. The Vortiguants now have similar timing for charging and aiming their lazers where as before in the 2012 mos they completley missed the point of their Half-Life counterparts having a charge up times. The only problem now is that you can dodge their attacks without getting behind cover like in Half-Life and can simply strafe right or left. On another dour note the Source engine is really starting to show it's age as these remade visuals are ( a wee bit) inconsistant in terms of quality. I feel some sort of Ultra option for textures and models should be added to uncompress the textures or use 2048x2048 resolution textures and higher poly versions of the models that having followed the games development I know they have. I would even suggest adding an "r_lod 0" option to the video settings so as to minimize whatever pop or lod shifts there are. Some of the faces look great while others look more dated than the faces from Half-Life 2 which might I add have aged quite well even more so for 2004. Even with all of that said this is probably the best game on early access right now and this iteration improves greatly apon the 2012 mod version. The development is slow but it's a fun, shiny version of Half-Life. Not everyone will be able to enjoy a game thats aged as well gameplay wise as Half-Life or get immeresed thanks to the visuals like I was and still am making this a must play for newcomers intersted in the series. Xen is missing too because it's in alpha but honestly thats a blessing in disguise. ;)","May 5, 2015","true","89.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

As long as you own any source game (Previous to the SDK Source 2007 release for free) this game will cost you nothing"\n\nThe Black Mesa Team\n\n\nSaying this words, it's a shame seeing that the proyect took so much money from them that they charge 20 dollars for the early access to the game (to finish Xen i suppose) that now that took their own words, make a tiny ball of paper and trowed at gamers because you have to pay to own a mod that was supposelly to be free on steam to anyone who enjoy and wants to play half life 1 witht the source engine at it's fullest.\n\nLeaving that aside this game it's the most wonderful and stunning game i've seen in years, the very same day this mod (i'm gonna call it game) was released i already took 4/5 hours to beat on hard just to feel the rush, everything about it was glorious, atention to every detail, an amazing soundtrack that really puts you on the move, faithful recreation of the game, being truth to it's origins and adding many things taken from the later installments of the half life saga, voices trully magnificent (especially doctor Kleiner), action everywhere. I enjoy this game really bad until i saw the price tag on Steam, still it's a great game and any half life fan will support the proyect, i just wished they had put it on greenlight along with "we need the money because the proyect without money cannot be completed".

At that was my what I noted here after playing through the game. First off, if you didn't know, Black Mesa is a remake of Half Life 1 in Half Life 2 with new voiceacting and some minor tweaks which are from the perspective of the developers okay.\n\nMostly I agree with them, some fixes like in the currently last chapter, "Lambda Core" I was getting punched through the floor and also all my alien enemies also disappeared through the floor with a decent hit of my, usually, normal gun, would be nice if they would get a patch.\n\nSeriously, I was not having a single problem with that until the last chapter. (currently being "Lambda Core")\n\nNevertheless, the amount of effort and work that has been put into this project is awesome and honorable! The now new multiplayer Deathmatch is nice to have, but totally uninteresting to me. Sorry.\n\nI just hope that the Xen Levels are coming quick, I want to finish the game in this style asap, because it's nice to have a piece of history polished and better than the first original one, without losing the spirit of Half Life, that everybody loves.","June 23, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Black Mesa takes place in the Black Mesa Research Facility and stars Gordon Freeman, a random scientist. This game has extremley good graphics, huge monsters with flame throwers for hands, huge fish with spikes for hands, and floating monsters that shoot energy at you from their faces. The story line of this game is more or less the same as the original game, called Half Life, but there are many small differences. I have not tried this game's multiplayer part, but the singleplayer campain is full of awesomeness and took me about three days to beat. I have heard that there are a couple of small bugs in this game, but the only one that I have experienced is the one that makes you sprint all of the times.

As movement is more fast paced and weapons feel slightly awkward as if it was trying to mimic Quake a lot more than it means to.\nThe game is smooth and voice acting is reminiscent of the original. All the graphics are top notch and perfectly fits the game perfectly how it should always be. My only complaint about the core game (The Story) is that there were a ton of loading screens (at least for me). The weapons are still great and very nice and well done. Ammo seems to be a problem, as in the original game I would have stockpiles of ammo ready for any part.\nNow the multiplayer was alive, but it’s dying as there really no one playing online anymore. If you can get people to play with you the multiplayer is fast paced and always seems to keep you on your toes. But if you look past what is the base multiplayer, the mode is broken. Lag seems to be a big issue (At least during launch), the lag issue is now at least better and rarely occurred for me. Though over the time the game has been released the game has been patched so performance is no longer a big issue and multiplayer is more bearable.\nOverall the game is a 9/10","June 12, 2015","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been following the mod for a few years, eagerly awaiting the full release of the game, and, well, Half-Life 3.\n\nWell. now at least one of those are out, and in Early Access, at least. If you have played through the mod before and don't feel like dropping $20 on this game, there are some very noticeable differences and additions made to the Steam release that the mod doesn't have. New reload animations, graphical updates, map layout tweaks, workshop support, and even a Multiplayer Deathmatch mode that remastered some of the original Half-Life Deathmatch maps. However, the game still isn't done. Xen is not available at the time of this review (Hence, Early Access) and there are some bugs, so it definitely isn't finished.\n\nHowever, the amount of content you get for only $20 is downright outstanding. I would've gladly dropped $60 on this game right now, even in its state of Early Access. Although I only have about 2 hours on Black Mesa at the time of writing this review, the amount of nostalgia and fun I've had playing through this masterpeice is unspeakable. This is THE best version of Half-Life.\n\nIf you've never played any of the Half-Life games before, or even a Half-Life nerd (like me :P) looking for an excuse to play Half-Life again, this is your chance!","May 7, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definately worth a buy even in early access to support the wonderful developers who made this classic game into something more special than it already was.\n\nI find myself constantly spending time replaying the game just for the details within each level, I've even come to learn a valuable lesson about pizza being untrustable.","May 7, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hats off for the developers, who actually spent a long time fine tuning and developing an impressive array of textures, weapons, models, maps, and all that other good stuff.\nIt's deathmatch mode is also great fun, especially with the latest patch update (Thankyou, weapon engineers :D), making deathmatch more enjoyable.\nAs well as this, the cinematics in Black Mesa are astounding, and include many great works of architecture within all it's maps.\nI recommend you buying this game now (Like, literally RIGHT now) 'cos it's still developing! Forget about Xen, enjoy the game (and it's deathmatch mode too - another great plan in action there) and think about this: the less support (e.g financial (buying the game) or complimentary) that these guys have, probably the more time they'll spend chipping out the final levels and gameplay of Xen, ssimply because they won't feel so encouraged.

Black Mesa is one of the funnest experiences I've had in gaming in a long time, and not because of "Nostalgia". Although I know the power of nostalgia, many reviews are just talking about the Nostalgia the game gave them, rather than reviewing the game for what it really is. So here is my simple review.\n\n+ Great Level Design. Great levels are extended, and unnecessary levels are shortened.\n+ Voice acting is now more believable and realistic, and overall well done (Some lines may need work).\n+ Great graphics and well optimized, especially for the Source Engine.\n+ The interactive parts in the beginning really set the mood.\n+ Atmosphere is awesome, the beginning having the best mood of survival, the middle and end having action.\n+ Weapons feel nice and polished. Weapons like the SMG feel real, and add to the already great atmosphere.\n+ Great variety of enemies (All of them from Half-Life, but they feel more real thanks to Source2)\n+ Physics engine isn't used too much, but add a little 'zing' to the game.\n+ Game is much longer than Half-Life (My Half-Life Completion time: 10 Hours | Black Mesa: 14 Hours)\n+ Multiplayer with multiple game modes add to the great amount of content.\n+ Exploration is encouraged and rewarded with extra ammo and health items.\n+/- AI is better, but a bit clumsy. Marines sometimes run from my gun fire, sometimes they run into it.\n+/- Small amount of bugs, but none of them game breaking (I can't be the only one with glitchy ties).\n+/- A few frame drops here and there, but none of them too bad.\n- The "On A Rail" feels way too short.\n- The Xen chapters are missing. It feels awkward having the end game not there, sadly. (Anti-Climactic Ending, for now).\n- Not many multiplayer servers, and hardly any people on those servers.\n- Multiplayer lags sometimes, and can get you killed numerous times.\n- Multiplayer has bad and unfair spawns sometimes (This is mostly in FFA).\n- The helicopter fight is very unfair. I would tone down the damage.\n- The ninja assassin guys should be nerfed, too. Tone down their damage or their numbers, and it would be alright.\n\nA few other recommendations: It would be cool if you could see the corpse of your player when you died. Another cool thing would be if there were optional scientist rescue missions, where they lead you to a locked room full of supplies, but have to be protected from threats.\n\nOverall, Black Mesa has only a few flaws, most of which are small, but the pros push out the cons, and this is just overall an amazing experience. One of the best purchases I've made on Steam in a long time. The subtle storytelling is kept, along with the great sense of dread and danger around every corner that will keep you on your toes. This is a must play, just like the original.\n\nScore: 9/10\n(Both the review and the score are subject to change as the game is updated, but thanks for reading!)","May 16, 2015","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is an awesome redo if one of the best fps games of all time.\nI have many fond memories of Half-Life and the hours spent playing it alone as well as with my 2 sons who are now grown and moved away. This is the game that caused me to invest in a high-end video card. To anyone thinking about whether to buy, all I can say is you won't be disappointed. It may not have the glitz & sparkle of some the newer games but it's got depth & soul. The story will keep you up late at night and coming back for more.

First of all, I never even bothered to touch the multiplayer whenever I first got this, I played through the singleplayer then started playing the multiplayer. From what I've seen, there are two gamemodes, FFA and TDM (Free For All and Team Deathmatch)\n\nFrom when I've played, they're pretty fun. But, there are no goals, no stats, really no anything except for shooting other players. I feel like they could make a really interesting Multiplayer. But first, you have to think: What makes major Multiplayer games like Counter Strike, Call Of Duty (Yes I am mentioning CoD, because although it gets major hate, it doesn't get loads of sales for no reason), TF2, and Battlefield so fun? I think they should add in more features to multiplayer, and REALLY try to focus on what makes a multiplayer game fun. I mean, don't get me wrong, the whole reason they made this was for the Single Player. But, why hasn't Valve made Half-Life 3 yet? Well, if Half-Life 3 had a successful Multiplayer that could gain them more money somehow, then they would definitely make it.\n\nThat's what I want Black Mesa to be.\n\nI want it to be the game Valve wanted Half-Life 3 to be.\n\nHell, integrate Steam Market into the Multiplayer somehow, I don't care.\n\nJust make it something where people would spend hundreds, even thousands of hours on, and have it still make money like the economy in CS:GO, Dota 2, and TF2 does.\n\nJust don't make it all cosmetics, like where you can only buy hats and shirts and models and such.\n\nI know you can think of something.","May 21, 2015","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's way too strong to be so accurate when fired from the hip, thus making it overpowered\n-Ragdolls look goofy at times, especially when some NPC has a scripted death\n-Game has it's hiccups and AI blackouts sometimes, but quite rare\n- A few of similar minor annoyances are found in the game sometimes, nothing too serious\n\nWhat I would like to see:\n\nFULL BODY AWARENESS: Make it at least some optional feature, if it's possible at all. Increases the immersion dramatically in my opinion\n\nOverall:\n\nBuy it and support these talented developers so they can make the game perfect and then maybe start with their own thing (intellectual property wise), if they plan to carry on with making games. The game has it's issues, but it's quite detailed and you feel the effort and love they put into the game.","May 8, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the classic you fell in love with years ago.  But it has been completely overhauled.  You'll start out just like the classic, visit familiar places and meet old friends.  But the locations have been upgraded and feel more alive.  The people you meet are more varied in appearence however there are some duplicate faces.  You get the best of both worlds in that way.  It is all familiar but new at the same time.  The old dialouge and story remains but new lines of dialogue are available and there are enhancemetns of new "puzzles" and new rooms.\n\nThe best analogy is to think of Cloud City in The Empire Strikes Back...remember how the hallways looked the same except where once there was a blank white wall you now saw a window with clouds and ships flying around after a CGI update?  It's the same here.  Where there was once an empty wall there may now be a new room.  And these rooms are populated and you can go in them and converse with people.  You can still do things like set off the alarms at the security station and blow up the meal in the microwave.  But there is a lot of new places to explore and things to try out.\n\nThe old enemies are back but enhanced in appearance.  They now more resemble what you see in Half-Life 2 and the expansion packs.  Not all the puzzles are the same.  Some are changed completely or just have a new twist to them in general.  If this game were just a "pretty new version" of the original it would only be worth playing for a few minutes without paying for it.  But it is a whole new yet completely familiar gameplay.  It is worth the $20 cost.\n\nI am loving going back and spending lots of time back at Black Mesa.  There are some issues (though the worst so far is the flickering fluttering ties of the scientists...c'mon, fix it).  But overall I have not experienced any major bugs.  I have only played the single player game so can only comment on that.  And for players like me who are getting older, whose panful fingers have gotten stiffer with age and reflexes aren't as quick, know that you can use cheat codes if you have to that you wouldn't need before, but are a welcome help to offset these issues that come with older age.\n\nDon't hesitate!

Sure, it's still incomplete; but it's here nonetheless. I know that some people are still complaining about the graphics being ten years old; but if you think about it, Black Mesa originated as a mod for Half-Life 2. Screw the graphics, look at the engine! When you sprint, it actually looks like you're sprinting! Such a feature was never introduced to Half-Life. There are different view models for the player arms in multiplayer, unlike in Half-Life 2 Deathmatch where your arms are still from Gordon Freeman's HEV Suit. Also, how your HUD starts appearing when you start wearing the HEV Suit. EPIC!!!\n\nI'll give this game a 9/10. I would give it a 10/10 if it had any of the Xen levels. Thankfully, Xen will not be presented in a DLC. The makers of Black Mesa have confirmed that Xen will be introduced in the game's final update. Otherwise, yeah, my rating would be lower if it was going to be a DLC.","May 8, 2015","true","32.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But even if you did fix the ladder, climbing back up would put you on the wrong side of the shaft.

I quickly found myseld drifting back into the game's clutches, paying attention to the tiniest sounds as I navigated Black Mesa's hallways - something extremely few games manage to make me do after having played them for years, and especially when I've since started working in game development. I've been looking to replay the series, but having played the original several times over the years, I figured I'd wait until this 'remaster' to give it another go. I'm glad I did. The added level bits and characer interactions are welcome little distractions and don't take away from the experience or feel 'tacked on'; the guts are still the same old Half Life you know and love, just with a that shiny nice look provided by a fresh audio-visual coat of paint.

If you think that way as well you might get disappointed. As some reviews already pointed out this is not exactly Half Life 1. It follows the general story line and sticks to the original map layouts wherever sensible and possible. But it still brings its own style. And as soon as you accept that this is a mod with its own style it's actually quite enjoyable.\n\nOne thing I (as a casual player) did not like is the difficulty which is solely generated by raising the number of enemies significantly (and - in my opinion - unnecessarily). Half Life (all of it) for me is first and foremost about the story telling. And when you play through HL2 and its two episodes with commentary on you really get a feel of the level in which that was done intentionally by Valve. This is where raw numbers of enemies don't make sense. A good balance does.\n\nGenerally: Play it. It's worth it!

The graphical overhaul is insanely well done, but the gameplay stays true to the original. So true that even keeps the pain points, such as the ridiculous assasin "battle" and residue processing labyrinth. It's eerily good how well some of the environments are re-imagined while still being entirely recognizable from the original.\n\nI would definitely recommend.

There's still no XEN at this moment and hopefully Crowbar Collective won't take too long to release that part. About Xen, that section will only release in the paid version, as mentioned by the developers.\n\nMy big gripe with this game seems to be the Artificial Intelligence. It feels very underwhelming, even compared to the original Half Life. Hopefully the devs will fix this down the road! In example, when an enemy spots you, 50% of the time it attacks you or go hiding. Then if YOU go hiding, the enemy/monster goes on its merry way, ignoring you completely.\n\nSo, let's see the PROS and CONS of BLACK MESA:\n\nPROS:+A love letter to every Half Life fan! A true work of dedicated fans!\n+Impressive visuals, even compared to the free mod version.\n+Funny dialogues between NPCS.\n+Assassins are quite tough in this Black Mesa version.\n+Can have permanent flashlight activated. Your HEV suit now has an unlimited sprint mode. It's slower than HL2 and even slower than normal running speed of HL1 vanilla.\n+Added competitive multiplayer game mode (deathmatch and team deathmatch).\n+Mod support with Steam Workshop.\n+Continuous support for this game version\n\nCONS:-A.I. needs refinement for sure!\n-A few gamebreaking bugs and game crashes... but to be expected in Early Access games.\n-Many loading screens... but this can't really be the developers' fault since this engine is designed that way.\n-Many portions of the game got removed compared to Half Life original. Devs mentions it is to remove unnecessary parts of the game, in order to have a better flow but I actually liked those areas...\n-Still no XEN. Hopefully it won't take 2 years to release! But at least, Crowbar Collective are still faster than Valve about releasing anything Half Life related!\n\n\nOVERALL:I've enjoyed every last minute of this game. Granted I have a few disappointments but they are quite minor compared to all the PROS this game has to offer you. It is still in Early Access so you may wait it up until it is more completed or you can still get it now and enjoy many hours of good old fun. The game is still incomplete until the XEN portion get's done and added afterwards.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:YES! It is highly recommended for every FPS fans out there! Even for newcomers, I'd recommend this for those who had never experienced HALF LIFE 1. Just fire up this BLACK MESA and you will be playing a modern version of the masterpiece known as HALF LIFE!\n\nEARLY ACCESS RATING:9.0 / 10","May 13, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's hard to say, really. The original half life is a game that I had logged far too many hours to count in before steam even allowed me to. I literally can play the first few levels blindfolded, and when I have a really bad day, like a breakup or a death or just life in general, half life is a soothing ointment to my wounds. So to have some guys say "hey we're going to remake this like it should have been for Half Life: Source" sets some high expectations.\n\nI am going to say this plainly: This game exceeds all of my exacting, insane, fanboyish nerdrage obsessions. The man  ho does the voices makes me jealous my own talent. Even my incredibly sensitive ears could not really tell that he was not the original voice actor for these characters. The man who made the new soundtrack HAD NEVER MADE A SOUNDTRACK before and was like "I guess I will just try for how the original sounded" and I bought it. Separately. Because he did it. This game EXPANDS on Half LIfe. It makes it better. This game, second only to Homeworld in my heart, has been improved. There are more areas to explore. There is well written dialogue that helps lead into HL2 and further expands the original Black Mesa experience. There is more. The developers of this mod are human beings after my own heart, maniac fanatics who worship at the altar of the crowbar.\n\nThere was one thing I didn't like. I think the rifle sounds aren't as good as the old ones. The report is subdued and sounds more like a TMP than anything else. That is all. That is my sole negative comment about this game. If you have any concerns, throw them aside. If someone has never played Half LIfe one and never will because of how bad the graphics are, throw this game in their face and say prepare to crap your pants because this is the ultimate SF shooter experience, the progenitor of all shooters that have even a semblance of a story, as so few tend to.\n\nAlso people explode again, like they did in the GOOD OLD DAYS.\n\nHave fun.","May 11, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're in for one hell of a ride.\n\nDefinitely an inprovement over the original Black Mesa mod, and if they even just ported that onto steam it'd be worth the $20. Either way you try it you can't go wrong.","May 11, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It brings back my old childhood memories of pulling out the PS2 with friends and just playing for hours. For an early access game it is pretty good. The graphics are better than half life but aren't the best they could be. To be honest i thought for graphics these days they where pretty average didn't exactly blow me away but they are probably 100* better than Half life's original. The gameplay is smooth and there aren't many glitches. There is a few times i got stuck in the same door but thanks to the autosave it was fine.\n\nFor you die hard half life fans i would totally recommend this title.","May 6, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However I believe in supporting creatives like these guys so we get more stuff in the future.\n\nThe game itself is fantastic for the most part. Black Mesa has been lovingly recreated with fantastic detail and depth. However as it currentlty stands their are some minor issues that are a little irksome. Amongst these include the general balance of the gameplay. Some weapons feel distintctly underpowerd such as the shotgun and grenedes which can lead to unrealistic combat. The shotgun and grenedes for example feel a little weak. The biggest problem I am personaly experiencing though is with saves. Twice I have found myself replaying large portions of a game due to an unrealiable auto-save system or my latest save not appearing upon booting the game, often time the auto-save aren't particulalry well thought out either. Some are close together, some far apart and some put in silly areas. One example being the time the game auto-saved me falling to my death.\n\nHopefully these things will be fixed soon enough, I can not stress that despite the minor issues the game feels fresh, fantastic and relevent again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brookhaven/recommended/362890/","brookhaven","Former Human","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brookhaven/","367 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI played the majority of Black Mesa Source before it came to early access, and I'm enjoying playing the current incarnation even more, being that it's more rounded out and has some great (and authentic) multiplayer. Some performance issues aside online, the game is running very smoothly and it is clear that the game is a labour of love by a dedicated team.\n\nMy only bone of contention, and it's arguable that I'm perhaps missing the point, is that in some ways the game doesn't quite go far enough in it's vision, or perhaps rather than it is at times inconsistent in it's execution. The approach, obviously, is to recreate, or 're-envision' Half-Life from beginning to end, using modern technology and methods that are more contemporary to gaming post 2000 (or even 2005). The result is a game that is not just visually familiar but one that plays very familiarly, for better and worse. Some of Half-Life's more irritating sections have been altered and streamlined, yet some are curiously left unaltered, issues intact. Something about this inconsistency speaks to the games origins as a mod by a team spread out geographically, with level designers with different ideas of what the game should be like spread out far and wide. The Sector C labs, for instance, have been extended and fleshed out with a great deal more detail, but this is more superficial, whereas the Office Complex unit has been edited and reshaped more substantially, to greater effect. Some of the original chapter's more bland areas are not just visually striking, but contain fresh secrets and nooks and crannies to explore, as well as some surprises, enemy wise. At the very least, the facelift is welcome, but at times it feels like the opportunity to really take the essence of Half-Life and build upon it is underused in favour of remaining faithful.\n\nThe game is still in development, of course. Xen is still absent, presumably because it was always going to be the most problematic chapter to rebuild in terms of making it actually enjoyable, this time around (it always was a bizarre end to the original Half-Life, tonally shifting entirely from intense combat to akward platforming mechanics and a really terrible boss fight at the end). I'm hoping the workshop features some other additions that allow other interpretations to be dropped into the single player experience as well as the welcome but predictable multiplayer remakes.\n\nThe multiplayer component, whilst suffering from performance issues at the moment (a few days after initial release), is a blast and really does take me back to the LAN party death-match sessions I would indulge in when I was fifteen and sixteen years old. The weapons all feel substantial and impactful, and the map design is first-rate.","May 9, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So if you liked the original, chances are you'll like this.\n\nThere's been a few changes in level designs and I think the weapons have been slightly rebalanced, so don't expect a complete carbon copy of the original. Saying that, I liked most of the changes. Personally, I found some of the platforming sections annoying (as I did in the original - something I would have been happy if they had skipped recreating) and the bloody assassins are real pains, but getting past them gives the same sense of achievement. In that sense I enjoyed the game.\n\nHowever, the big selling point, and the original point (from what I remember) of the mod, was to recreate Half Life with better graphics. And this is where the developers both succeed and fail. If this had been released a couple of years after Half Life 2, then I wouldn't have any reservations about recommending it. Unfortunately, the engine has aged (not as badly as some mind you), but its obvious that this engine is 11 years old. And it struggles to compete against more recent efforts. Saying that, its obvious that, in certain areas, the developers have put a lot of effort in, and the game looks absolutely amazing. I certainly paused in places to have a look around and enjoy the views. But, at this stage in development, that quality isn't consistent. And that's the problem. Its 2015, and at times, I would be hard pressed to tell the difference between this game and the original 17 year old game (yeah... that's made me feel old).\n\nSo its hard to recommend it, but I will.

It's HL better than you remember; I felt like I was playing HL1 for the first time again.\nIt has the same story as HL1 but beyond that everything has been updated. New textures on EVERYTHING, new voice acting, new scripted events, new ENGINE.\nThe new textures make gameplay more immersive and the people look more like, well, people. The bullsquid is incredibly terrifying now. The voice acting has been redone and some new dialogue can be heard, especially from the new female scientists (I guess the EO complaints finally caught up with Lambda.)\nThere are new scripted events for enemy intros that really show off all the work the Crowbar Collective has put into this game. Most levels have been modified in small ways to use puzzle mechanics from 2HL2. Anyone who is a fan of the HL series will enjoy playing game as we wait for the next installmant in the HL franchise.\nPros:\n-New Engine!\n-HL2 mechanics-set enemies on fire, throw back grenades, crawling zombies\n-New textures for EVERYTHING\n-Voice acting redone and more dialogue from NPCs, female scientists.\n-New enemy intros, attack styles, and sounds\n-Most levels updated to feature puzzle mechanics from HL2\n-Amazing gameplay!\n\n\nCons:\n-As of writing this the entire game has not been completed yet; Xen levels not released.\n-Some of the levels have ledges big enough to walk around/skip fights i.e. Surface Tension\n-On the level "Surface Tension" if you travel to the sublevel 'Ordnance Exterior', leave and return you can be stuck in a loop of gameover explosions. Can set you back if you don't save.\n-Enemy AI seems more like NPCs always know where you are even-through walls. i.e. Tanks and Helicopters are always aimed and shooting at you even inside buildings.","May 9, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many people say that this is JUST Half-Life 1 with new graphics. I have Half-Life 1 Gold Source and so have the original version and yes I am very good at Half-Life. Personally my favorite level is "Office Complex" in this part you will see how wrecked the Black Mesa Research Facility is after the resonance cascade. In the Gold Source version lacks enough detail to really show the infrastructures suffer as well the scientists. This makes the game very emotional and gave me this sad and sorry feeling inside. The story is the same but Black Mesa is just better. Don't have a bad feeling if you already have Half-Life Gold Source, you will miss something if you don't buy this. Well I must admit those ties are quite weird since they swing around but they will fix it. I just love this game. (I haven't even finished this game, my body was almost static during the download due to excitement and I played till 4:35 in the morning and I didn't notice I played Half-Life 1 several times.

Years ago, I tried the original free release and was impressed by the level design, but found there were a lot of gameplay mechanics that needed to be adjusted, fixed, etc.  I am happy to report that the Steam release is a huge improvement over the original free one, particularly in the combat portions, and is far closer to being a "completed" game despite it not currently having the last Xen levels done yet.\n\nMany people online have been complaining that the $20 price is too expensive, but when you consider the fact that this group of people have been working very hard for years to make this happen, you can't help but appreciate all the time and effort they have put into it.  In fact, they have actually improved upon many chapters/levels from the original game in many ways and the overall presentation is excellent.\n\nFor a person that has played both HL1 and HL2 too many times to count, this was just as much fun in its own ways and think you'll dig it too.  I look forward to seeing it completed and fully tweaked, no matter how long it takes and wish the team the best of luck in finally being able to reach the finish line.","May 9, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was made by fans of the Half-Life franchise, and it is a very large project indeed. It originally started as a mod of Half-Life 2, but has now grown into a standalone game.\n\nThere are two versions of Black Mesa.\nBMS 2012 (The mod version)\nBMS 2015 (The Steam version)\n\nBMS 2012 was released in 2012, as a mod that required Valve's free Source SDK base 2007 to run. It was a groundbreaking remake of the first Half-Life game's single player campaign, minus the final four chapters. After 8 years in development, it was worth the weight wait.\n\nBMS 2015 was recently released, you guessed it, in 2015, on Steam. This version features updated graphics, new content, new voice acting, and an all new multiplayer experience, featuring free-for-all deathmatch and team deathmatch modes. The final four chapters have yet to be added, and I am very excited for them, as I have heard that they will be packed full of gameplay. People have complained about the $20 price tag, despite the fact that the developers that make up Crowbar Collective have stated long ago that they intended to sell the Steam version.\n\nI am happy with the price, as the developers deserve to earn money for such a jaw-droppingly epic project. People also need to understand that it is in early access, so of course there will be problems that will ultimately be fixed. As a game, Black Mesa is very engaging in the departments of gameplay and story. As a remake, Black Mesa is truly beyond astounding. It reminds me so much of Half-Life, when it comes to the art style, the level design, and the (occasional) humor. The developers have added many nods to the Half-Life storyline that developed after the first game was released. And also, the Gman is as mysterious as ever.\n\n10/10. Amazing.","May 9, 2015","true","44.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's excellent as a game. I feel the price could be a bit lower, $15 seems like a more ideal starting point for anything running on the Source Engine at this point especially in Early Access when we're still waiting on Xen, but regardless, what this is is a finely crafted masterpiece that stands up there with official Valve games in presentation and quality. It also stands as an example of how I believe modders should be able to make money from their work, by starting off with a free base and using that to craft something that is genuinely retail quality, and going through official channels like Greenlight to become an official product with all that entails instead of the vaguely defined rules and assurances and horrible implementation of that disastrous Workshop incident with Skyrim.\n\nIf nothing else, buy this game as a statement of how mods turning into retail products is supposed to work, following the legacy of the likes of Counterstrike and Team Fortress and Red Orchestra. But better yet, buy it because it's just an awesome game, squeezing the best graphics seen yet out of the Source Engine with superb gameplay that fills a gap in the Half Life universe many gamers hadn't experienced due to Half Life 1 being before their time.","May 6, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When it comes down to remaking one of the best games of all time, it's a very high bar to set for yourself to even be acceptable in the gaming community, but I'll tell you, it was definitely accomplished. Triple A multimillion dollar games fall flat on their faces compared to this game. If you followed the developement of this game, you'll know there was several snags, and several delays with such a small team that was changing constantly over the past 8 or so years. When the free version released in 2012, it was a ton of fun, lacking the Xen levels, but it gave you a taste of what you were going to be getting when the finished product was here. So here's the steam release. If you played the free version, the first thing you'll notice is how much smoother and cleaner the game feels. The visuals have all been bumped up to probably being the prettiest source GAME let alone the prettiest source mod. When you got lost in half life for the first time, you experienced action, tension, and entertaining puzzles and sometimes fierce battles. Black Mesa succeeded completely in being able to bring this feeling out again. While feeling very familiar, every environment was brand new and designed brilliantly. I'd find myself normally know where to go thanks to playing the original so much, but there were also more than a couple moments where I'd get lost and have some minor issues progressing, but that's a good thing in my mind, taking an old game and making it challenging again. Certain aspects of Half life that got annoying or tedious have more or less been altered to make it quicker, more managable, and less hassle. For example, during the "Power up" level, you may remember the useless guard laying on the floor that does nothing while you go and turn on the generator, get the train going, and then you have to run all the way back up to where the guard is to turn the train to continue forward. Now, that same useless guard will turn the train for you so the gameplay doesn't get interrupted and stopped for the moment. It may be a small thing to some, but many improvements like that will come up having you say, "Oh I remember having to do it like this, but this is a lot more useful". Being in Early access still, Xen is incomplete yet, but even without it, there's a solid 6-8 hours of gameplay depending on how often you get lost. Overall, if you were looking to relive a game from your past in a new and improved, and dare I say BETTER way than you remember it? Don't be stingy, $20 is practically a robbery for this game, and you would be letting yourself down to not pick this up.\n\nPros:\n-The best looking source game you'll find\n-A classic remade into a modern, new, but familiar experience\n-Good challenge\n-Vintage multiplayer (if you're interested in it)\nCons:\n-Missing Xen (Early access, acceptable as it will come)\n-Sometimes enemy AI gets a little brain dead (soldiers walking right past you even if you're in front of them, Vorts stop and just stand in front of you; rare and minor issues)","May 18, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Deathmatch is just chaotic killing and I'm sure team deathmatch is a lot better with friends than it is on your own. The maps are full of detail, being big enough to survive and find a weapon, but not too big that you're isolated from the action. It's a shame there are only two gamemodes, but I feel the quality and quantity of the maps make up for that, and I'm looking forward to when they do add different gamemodes in the future.\n\nThe singleplayer is better than it was in the mod, there are several significant changes; the new sounds and models are great, the general look is better with various subtle changes, and some major ones too. Even though the game is unfinished, it still has a lot of replay value to it. I've played the mod excessively, yet I'm sure I'll play this newer version many times until the game is completed. So far, there haven't been any game-breaking bugs, the game crashed several times when I first started and there have been a few dodgy textures floating around but they are not frequent enough to be annoying.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. It is reasonably priced by today's standards, and there is a lot to do in both the single and the multiplayer, even being unfinished.","May 16, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hear people say that this game is way too expensive or it's not worth it when you can get the mod for free. I would like to clarify the Black Mesa Dev Team/Crowbar Collective have spent their time and hard earned money to develop a beautiful and atmospheric game for the community and do VALVes job of making a TRUE Half-Life Remake. My personal opinion is that these guys deserve it.... ALOT!!!! Any point during the development phase they could have just canned the project, But they didn't . They wanted to keep their promise (VALVe.... Take note) and continually inform the public and keep posting updates during the 8 year development period. Sure it has its kinks and defects but thats why they released it on Early access, They wanted our say.\n\nSo please if you have played the original mod and thougt it was a piece of art....

Years ago, I tried the original free release and was impressed by the level design, but found there were a lot of gameplay mechanics that needed to be adjusted, fixed, etc.  I am happy to report that the Steam release is a huge improvement over the original free one, particularly in the combat portions, and is far closer to being a "completed" game despite it not currently having the last Xen levels done yet.\n\nMany people online have been complaining that the $20 price is too expensive, but when you consider the fact that this group of people have been working very hard for years to make this happen, you can't help but appreciate all the time and effort they have put into it.  In fact, they have actually improved upon many chapters/levels from the original game in many ways and the overall presentation is excellent.\n\nFor a person that has played both HL1 and HL2 too many times to count, this was just as much fun in its own ways and think you'll dig it too.

It was made by fans of the Half-Life franchise, and it is a very large project indeed. It originally started as a mod of Half-Life 2, but has now grown into a standalone game.\n\nThere are two versions of Black Mesa.\nBMS 2012 (The mod version)\nBMS 2015 (The Steam version)\n\nBMS 2012 was released in 2012, as a mod that required Valve's free Source SDK base 2007 to run. It was a groundbreaking remake of the first Half-Life game's single player campaign, minus the final four chapters. After 8 years in development, it was worth the weight wait.\n\nBMS 2015 was recently released, you guessed it, in 2015, on Steam. This version features updated graphics, new content, new voice acting, and an all new multiplayer experience, featuring free-for-all deathmatch and team deathmatch modes. The final four chapters have yet to be added, and I am very excited for them, as I have heard that they will be packed full of gameplay. People have complained about the $20 price tag, despite the fact that the developers that make up Crowbar Collective have stated long ago that they intended to sell the Steam version.\n\nI am happy with the price, as the developers deserve to earn money for such a jaw-droppingly epic project. People also need to understand that it is in early access, so of course there will be problems that will ultimately be fixed. As a game, Black Mesa is very engaging in the departments of gameplay and story. As a remake, Black Mesa is truly beyond astounding. It reminds me so much of Half-Life, when it comes to the art style, the level design, and the (occasional) humor. The developers have added many nods to the Half-Life storyline that developed after the first game was released. And also, the Gman is as mysterious as ever.\n\n10/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brookhaven/recommended/362890/","brookhaven","Former Human","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brookhaven/","367 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI played the majority of Black Mesa Source before it came to early access, and I'm enjoying playing the current incarnation even more, being that it's more rounded out and has some great (and authentic) multiplayer. Some performance issues aside online, the game is running very smoothly and it is clear that the game is a labour of love by a dedicated team.\n\nMy only bone of contention, and it's arguable that I'm perhaps missing the point, is that in some ways the game doesn't quite go far enough in it's vision, or perhaps rather than it is at times inconsistent in it's execution. The approach, obviously, is to recreate, or 're-envision' Half-Life from beginning to end, using modern technology and methods that are more contemporary to gaming post 2000 (or even 2005). The result is a game that is not just visually familiar but one that plays very familiarly, for better and worse. Some of Half-Life's more irritating sections have been altered and streamlined, yet some are curiously left unaltered, issues intact. Something about this inconsistency speaks to the games origins as a mod by a team spread out geographically, with level designers with different ideas of what the game should be like spread out far and wide. The Sector C labs, for instance, have been extended and fleshed out with a great deal more detail, but this is more superficial, whereas the Office Complex unit has been edited and reshaped more substantially, to greater effect. Some of the original chapter's more bland areas are not just visually striking, but contain fresh secrets and nooks and crannies to explore, as well as some surprises, enemy wise. At the very least, the facelift is welcome, but at times it feels like the opportunity to really take the essence of Half-Life and build upon it is underused in favour of remaining faithful.\n\nThe game is still in development, of course. Xen is still absent, presumably because it was always going to be the most problematic chapter to rebuild in terms of making it actually enjoyable, this time around (it always was a bizarre end to the original Half-Life, tonally shifting entirely from intense combat to akward platforming mechanics and a really terrible boss fight at the end). I'm hoping the workshop features some other additions that allow other interpretations to be dropped into the single player experience as well as the welcome but predictable multiplayer remakes.\n\nThe multiplayer component, whilst suffering from performance issues at the moment (a few days after initial release), is a blast and really does take me back to the LAN party death-match sessions I would indulge in when I was fifteen and sixteen years old. The weapons all feel substantial and impactful, and the map design is first-rate.","May 9, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So if you liked the original, chances are you'll like this.\n\nThere's been a few changes in level designs and I think the weapons have been slightly rebalanced, so don't expect a complete carbon copy of the original. Saying that, I liked most of the changes. Personally, I found some of the platforming sections annoying (as I did in the original - something I would have been happy if they had skipped recreating) and the bloody assassins are real pains, but getting past them gives the same sense of achievement. In that sense I enjoyed the game.\n\nHowever, the big selling point, and the original point (from what I remember) of the mod, was to recreate Half Life with better graphics. And this is where the developers both succeed and fail. If this had been released a couple of years after Half Life 2, then I wouldn't have any reservations about recommending it. Unfortunately, the engine has aged (not as badly as some mind you), but its obvious that this engine is 11 years old. And it struggles to compete against more recent efforts. Saying that, its obvious that, in certain areas, the developers have put a lot of effort in, and the game looks absolutely amazing. I certainly paused in places to have a look around and enjoy the views. But, at this stage in development, that quality isn't consistent. And that's the problem. Its 2015, and at times, I would be hard pressed to tell the difference between this game and the original 17 year old game (yeah... that's made me feel old).\n\nSo its hard to recommend it, but I will. I loved the original, and this game has allowed me to revisit that world, but in a much prettier way.\n","May 9, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's HL better than you remember; I felt like I was playing HL1 for the first time again.\nIt has the same story as HL1 but beyond that everything has been updated. New textures on EVERYTHING, new voice acting, new scripted events, new ENGINE.\nThe new textures make gameplay more immersive and the people look more like, well, people. The bullsquid is incredibly terrifying now. The voice acting has been redone and some new dialogue can be heard, especially from the new female scientists (I guess the EO complaints finally caught up with Lambda.)\nThere are new scripted events for enemy intros that really show off all the work the Crowbar Collective has put into this game. Most levels have been modified in small ways to use puzzle mechanics from 2HL2. Anyone who is a fan of the HL series will enjoy playing game as we wait for the next installmant in the HL franchise.\nPros:\n-New Engine!\n-HL2 mechanics-set enemies on fire, throw back grenades, crawling zombies\n-New textures for EVERYTHING\n-Voice acting redone and more dialogue from NPCs, female scientists.\n-New enemy intros, attack styles, and sounds\n-Most levels updated to feature puzzle mechanics from HL2\n-Amazing gameplay!\n\n\nCons:\n-As of writing this the entire game has not been completed yet; Xen levels not released.\n-Some of the levels have ledges big enough to walk around/skip fights i.e. Surface Tension\n-On the level "Surface Tension" if you travel to the sublevel 'Ordnance Exterior', leave and return you can be stuck in a loop of gameover explosions. Can set you back if you don't save.\n-Enemy AI seems more like NPCs always know where you are even-through walls. i.e. Tanks and Helicopters are always aimed and shooting at you even inside buildings.","May 9, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First, the texture, graphical and enviromental improvements, such as shadows and advanced lightning system, something that shows up a bit higher than Source engine normal standards, making you notice how well enhanced this basic engine is from its original version. Everything is so refined at its best.\nSecond to mention, weapons. They passed through a large model modification (Mp5, the Glock, Magnum, Gauss Gun). But the shotgun and some others only had an animation readjust, but still really better than the Mod version. In the mod version the shotgun sounded. just. ♥♥♥♥♥♥\nIn this version they also changed the H.E.C.U voice acting, which was pretty ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell in the mod version.

So here is my simple review.\n\n+ Great Level Design. Great levels are extended, and unnecessary levels are shortened.\n+ Voice acting is now more believable and realistic, and overall well done (Some lines may need work).\n+ Great graphics and well optimized, especially for the Source Engine.\n+ The interactive parts in the beginning really set the mood.\n+ Atmosphere is awesome, the beginning having the best mood of survival, the middle and end having action.\n+ Weapons feel nice and polished. Weapons like the SMG feel real, and add to the already great atmosphere.\n+ Great variety of enemies (All of them from Half-Life, but they feel more real thanks to Source2)\n+ Physics engine isn't used too much, but add a little 'zing' to the game.\n+ Game is much longer than Half-Life (My Half-Life Completion time: 10 Hours | Black Mesa: 14 Hours)\n+ Multiplayer with multiple game modes add to the great amount of content.\n+ Exploration is encouraged and rewarded with extra ammo and health items.\n+/- AI is better, but a bit clumsy. Marines sometimes run from my gun fire, sometimes they run into it.\n+/- Small amount of bugs, but none of them game breaking (I can't be the only one with glitchy ties).\n+/- A few frame drops here and there, but none of them too bad.\n- The "On A Rail" feels way too short.\n- The Xen chapters are missing. It feels awkward having the end game not there, sadly. (Anti-Climactic Ending, for now).\n- Not many multiplayer servers, and hardly any people on those servers.\n- Multiplayer lags sometimes, and can get you killed numerous times.\n- Multiplayer has bad and unfair spawns sometimes (This is mostly in FFA).\n- The helicopter fight is very unfair. I would tone down the damage.\n- The ninja assassin guys should be nerfed, too. Tone down their damage or their numbers, and it would be alright.\n\nA few other recommendations: It would be cool if you could see the corpse of your player when you died. Another cool thing would be if there were optional scientist rescue missions, where they lead you to a locked room full of supplies, but have to be protected from threats.\n\nOverall, Black Mesa has only a few flaws, most of which are small, but the pros push out the cons, and this is just overall an amazing experience. One of the best purchases I've made on Steam in a long time. The subtle storytelling is kept, along with the great sense of dread and danger around every corner that will keep you on your toes. This is a must play, just like the original.\n\nScore: 9/10\n(Both the review and the score are subject to change as the game is updated, but thanks for reading!)","May 16, 2015","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game was a joy to play - I actually loved being able to roam a huge base again, but in very high resolution and with all the little touches like coffee cups and decent looking instrumentation and damaged areas.  Very realistic.  The game presented lots of interesting and relevant puzzles and challenges yet it is very intuitive - you solve things the way you really would if you were in the situation.  No bugs - excellent performance - outstanding graphic realism - smart enemies.\n\nFantastic job - MORE PLEASE!!!!!

There are new animations, new weapon models, better NPC voices, and numerous tweaks to the AI. The original mod version is still available for free. Just keep in mind that the mod version does not have the aforementioned tweaks.\n\nI just fininished the single player portion, and I enjoyed it every bit as much as I did when I played the original mod version back in 2012. My only real complaint concerns the AI tweaks. The HECU soldiers in the original mod had deadly accuracy and split-second reaction times, causing firefights with them to feel extremely unfair. This has been fixed for the Steam release. Unfortunately, the soldiers are now too dumb, instead of being too smart. Sometimes they charge blindy at you with no sense of self-preservation, and other times they just stand there without even bothering to shoot back. This issue is even more noticeable with the Vortigaunts. I would like to see the AI tweaked a bit further.\n","May 9, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Deathmatch is just chaotic killing and I'm sure team deathmatch is a lot better with friends than it is on your own. The maps are full of detail, being big enough to survive and find a weapon, but not too big that you're isolated from the action. It's a shame there are only two gamemodes, but I feel the quality and quantity of the maps make up for that, and I'm looking forward to when they do add different gamemodes in the future.\n\nThe singleplayer is better than it was in the mod, there are several significant changes; the new sounds and models are great, the general look is better with various subtle changes, and some major ones too. Even though the game is unfinished, it still has a lot of replay value to it. I've played the mod excessively, yet I'm sure I'll play this newer version many times until the game is completed. So far, there haven't been any game-breaking bugs, the game crashed several times when I first started and there have been a few dodgy textures floating around but they are not frequent enough to be annoying.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. It is reasonably priced by today's standards, and there is a lot to do in both the single and the multiplayer, even being unfinished.","May 16, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As for why, I simply didn't have the time nor the effort to go out and get it. But this has made me realize the errors of that decision. I have seen playthroughs on youtube of the original, and thought to myself, "Hmm... this game looks good... but not good enough." Then this came along. This beautiful remastered  version. I have played through and the only thing that I have noticed missing is the final chapter of the game (which I am sure the developer is currently working on it as it is a crucial part to the storyline).\n\nI have noticed a few bugs with my playthrough. None that made it horrible or impossible, but just made it seem a little less real. I noticed that headcrabs would sometimes jump towards me then walk away or a marine absolutely spam the crap outta the grenades. Physics bugs here and there but all in all it didn't break.

If you think that way as well you might get disappointed. As some reviews already pointed out this is not exactly Half Life 1. It follows the general story line and sticks to the original map layouts wherever sensible and possible. But it still brings its own style. And as soon as you accept that this is a mod with its own style it's actually quite enjoyable.\n\nOne thing I (as a casual player) did not like is the difficulty which is solely generated by raising the number of enemies significantly (and - in my opinion - unnecessarily). Half Life (all of it) for me is first and foremost about the story telling. And when you play through HL2 and its two episodes with commentary on you really get a feel of the level in which that was done intentionally by Valve. This is where raw numbers of enemies don't make sense. A good balance does.\n\nGenerally: Play it. It's worth it!

This is basically half life with great graphical improvements and some minor changes to game play, i.e.. the crowbar is a little harder to find. If you liked the original then you should like this. However if you have played the original a lot you may not want to spend £14.99 for basically an improved version, especially as, so far, I have not found any major changes to the actual game play itself. It does look good, not quite on par with today's standard of games, but at least that means my slower PC can handle it, which is nice !!! It works with an xbox 360 controller which is another plus. A nice job all round.","May 14, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, it's based on Valve's existing game, but it stops there. This is not an HD texture reskin. I believe this to be a top-down remake (textures, models, animations).\n\nI was amazed at how well this was put tothether and how well it ran on my mobile card (780m, 175-299fps).\n\nIf you liked Half-Life, this one is a no-brainer.","June 14, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Firstly (admittedly because for some reason half life 2 engine doesnt like my laptop) load times are terrible. But when you get there... wow. Black mesa, not just the way you remember it, but the way you imagined it... the way it would have been.\n\nThe old fashioined puzzles that are still from the original have been augmented by puzzles thattake advantage of the newer engine. Stunning. Still nothing more delightful than doing away with the tentacles in blast pit. Or watching the rocket launch... awesome.\n\nThe new sound track is great, emotive and appropriate to the setting. The look of the aliens is entirely convincing, and you really believe that the alien slaves are just fighting because they have been ordered to, so they dont clash too much with their role in the second half life. I particularly like the Houndeyes, which i missed a little in the sequel. And seriously the bullsquid is just as horrifying as the first time round, with more convinving chemical spit, which glows and sticks to your hands and weapon most beautifully.\n\nThis is a GREAT re working of a classic. But there are at least 2 reasons why it needs work. 1; AI of army and assassins is bloody atrocious, and occasionally aliens will ignore you until you shoot at them. Head crabs appear to move towards some sort of "anchor point" before trying to attack again, rather than continuously attacking. 2: Although i love the use of the modern engine for some puzzles, i think it could have been used more. Flares being used instead of a crowbar for killing the first few zombies GREAT, why not a flare based puzzle, flammable liquids or weak ceilings supported by burnable boxes. Re-connecting electrical supplies by picking up the plug, wonderful! Why not some cable length based puzzles (like HL2E2) where you have a load of electrical points which need connecting up, but you only have wires of cirtain lengths.\n\nLets not forget, Freeman is a scientist. Lets see some science puzzles in there.\nBut regardless, these bad points are MINOR, appart from the AI which varies from Unforgivable to OK. If, like me, you love a trip down memory lane and find that Valve's HL1 redux was a bit pointless (it looked WORSE than the original if you had an openGL driver, remember them? wonderful bit of kit) then this is the bees knees. The sheer pleasure of slotting baddies with the revolver, the great achievements, the knowlege that SOMEONE cares about Dr Freeman... its great.\n\nOne question... What about Cpl Shepherd?","June 11, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
