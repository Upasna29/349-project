It blends elements of tower defense, RPG, action-strategy, and bullet-dodging to form a short-and-sweet little game.  Personally, the game felt a lot like the “Protect the Queen” games I used to play on StarCraft custom maps.   There are no truly innovative mechanics to the game, but the way the pieces come together do manage to form a game that has a strong charm of novelty.\n\nThe game is short.  It took me just under 5 hours to earn all achievements.  That’s OK though, because it was a fun 5 hours and I didn’t really need any more.  If you find yourself wanting more you can compete on the leaderboards.\n\nAlso, the game is casual.  Even on the “insane” difficulty, the game becomes simple once you’ve bought enough upgrades.  As someone who enjoys casual games, I really felt the balance of difficulty in this game was very enjoyable.  You have to pay attention and play, but you won’t ever find yourself frustrated.  Having said that, people who like very difficult games may find themselves left wanting by Bardbarian.\n\nThe gameplay itself is extremely simple.  You’ll have it all figured out in the first minute and it won’t change much after that.  There are new units and upgrades which you unlock that spice things up as you progress.  But I will admit, the content is rather limited.\n\nThe graphics are "cartoonish" and simple, but they fit the atmosphere.  The music is not bad by any means, but I felt it could have been a little more epic and various considering the game has strong musical undertones.   The controls are fluid and intuitive.  The game is stable; I experienced no glitches or crashing.\n\nIn summary, I would say Bardbarian is very fun and worth playing.  It’s simple enough that almost anyone should be able to enjoy the gameplay.  If you are itching for something fresh and a little different you can probably get some fun out of this game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 17, 2015","true","4.6"," 66 of 71 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","66","71","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/269490/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Bardbarian "is a mixture of Tower Defense, RPG & RTS with some 'Shmup and Snake elements". I have no clue where the RTS element is.\n\nIt's essentially a game about defending your town crystal from incoming waves of enemies. How do you defend it? You summon party members with different abilities, and you run around dodging bullets and buffing your party (you do not control your attacks, that's all done automatically).\n\nWhen I saw this game, I thought it looked interesting enough to give it a go. The reviews were surprisingly positive, so... why not?\n\nI'll just say that I was extremely disappointed with this game, and the reviews are unbelievable. I honestly don't know why people think this is a good game of PC! Here's a more lengthy analysis.\n\n\nFirst off, presentation.\nThe graphics look a bit average to me, but they're fine. What you see is what you get (from the screenshots). One problem with it, is that it's highly repetitive, even visually, since you have only one map for the campaign. And it doesn't really change its look. Other modes have different maps, but nothing beautiful or interesting.\nThey're fine. That's all I can say about it.\n\nThe music was actually not bad. It's almost neo-classical metal, instrumental only. Unfortunately, there's only one song on the campaign. The song loops the entire time, which can (and does) get repetitive after listening to it hours on end. The song loops pretty seemlessly, so that's good (from what I could tell). It was just background music, didn't really add to the experience.\nThere were no volume sliders either. Only music/sound-effects on/off.\nVery limited overall. A bit more effort and it could have been much more enjoyable, but playing the same track over and over and over... not good.\n\nThe interface was fine. The mouse support works fine on the menus. I played the game with a Gamepad and it worked well as well, so good job on that. Unfortunately, the concept of an Options Meny seems to be very foreign to the developer. There's barely anything, which is really annoying. But hey, at least it had rebindable keys!\nIt's.. again, fine. Nothing noteworthy here, it's missing a bunch of options, but it didn't really prove to be a problem, in my experience.\n\n\n\nSo, how's gameplay?\nWell, it's a grindfest. Almost a waiting game...\nAs I said, you don't actually attack. So, your whole job is to summon party members, and run around the map, getting close enough for your party to attack. You can also boost the party with +Attack, +Speed, +Defense, or a special Stun ability. If your party member dies, you'll have to summon them again, at a cost. If you Bard dies, or your Crystal is destroyed, you lose. Simple enough.\n\nTo summon units and use buffs, you'll need to gather "Notes". You gain a few over time, and you get some more from enemy drops, sometimes.\nAnd that's pretty much it, as gameplay.\nEnemy variety was pretty good. They'll shoot at you, with some of them being faster, some firing multiple shots, in multiple directions, etc. It felt inspired by The Binding of Isaac (in a good way). That's not to say that the enemy variety is even remotely closer. Not at all. There are about 10 different enemies, and some of them are fairly similar.\n\nSo, all you have to do is literally run around, for the most part. And it gets very old, very fast. It's clearly designed as an iOS game... And a lazy one.\nIt does have some bullet hell elements. And those could have saved the game! But, there's a huge problem with that. As I mentioned, you have units. These run around you. Which means that your hitbox is huge, and very inconsistent. You simply can't do those awesome dodges you would in a bullet hell. There's no way.\nThere's an upgrade on the shop for the party to stick closer together, but it barely helps... Everytime you move, they'll stay a bit behind, which would be fine, but it provides nothing of worth! It simply inutilizes most of the dodging. Which means that you'll always play safe, run around, not feeling like a badass.\nThat's all the gameplay is. Running around.\nThe Boss fights were significantly better, but still not very good. A few simple patterns, but they at least felt more refreshing.\n\nThe second part of this game, is the upgrading system. The game is structured with 4 times of the day, each with 5 levels (a Boss Fight in the 5th). Once you beat a Boss, you can't start from that point after you die, or you can go back to the beginning. This could have been fine, but it isn't.\nThe upgrades are absolutely necessary. It's literally impossible to make any progress without upgrading everything. And that's usually how games go, but this is different. Your progress is 95% affected by your upgrades. There's no skill involved. It's a question of either having enough damage, or not having it. Even if you're a good player, you'll simply be overun by enemies that will rush you crystal. Once you die, there you go upgrade some more, and then beat it easily. And that's the whole game. The upgrades aren't at all interesting.\nThey're just that, upgrades. More damage, more health, more speed, more money, more notes, etc.\nThis makes for a very, very stale game. You're always doing the same thing! Running around, collecting gold so that you can buy more upgrades, until you reach the end. There are no deep mechanics to learn or master, no strategy, no anything.\n\nThe only glimpse of strategy, is choosing your units. You'll unlock different units throughout the game, with different abilities. There's a huge problem with it, though. First off, some of them are pretty much useless. They're not helpful at all, so there's no point in even existing. The other problem, is unit upgrades.\nYou can upgrade them too (see it as levels, basically. higher level=better version of the unit, simply that). BUT, if you want to test a unit, and see if they're any good, you'll have to upgrade them to the same level that your other units are. Otherwise, you can't compare them very well, can you? But, to upgrade them, you'll waste gold, that you only want to use in a unit that you know will be useful. And this is where the system falls apart.\n\nTo try the unit, you'll have to waste gold already, otherwise, there's no point, as they'll be incredibly underpowered. This makes it a waste of gold (which equals to a waste of time, as your play time is simply to collect enough gold to make progress!). It's broken and pointless. This leads to a very limited cast of characters. I stuck around with most of the initial ones because of it. And I've done fine. Different characters could interact differently, but when the gameplay is literally just running around, it makes almost no difference! You don't play with the characters, they play themselves.\n\n\n\nTo its credit, there are 2 other game modes. One is just survival, in which you get a random unit spawn that you must collect, and sometimes food (healing). There are bosses, from time to time, and the enemies will try to kill you (no crystal this time).\nThe other one is an infinite runner mode, you a few stationary enemies (pretty much towers), and randomly spawned obstacles. Both of these modes unlock 2 cross-over characters, so you are encouraged to try them out.\nThe achievements were... meh. Barely anything to encourage you different (and interesting) character combinations, which is a really big miss. They're mostly for beating each Boss, unlocking characters, upgrades, etc. Nothing interesting. And that's unfortunate.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis game is literally a waste of time. You'll collect gold to buy upgrades and progress in the game. You'll not learn how to master the mechanics the more you play. You won't feel any kind of rewarding sensation whenever you beat a Boss.\n\nThe game has potential, but ends up feeling like a lazy iOS game. You'll be entertained for 1-2 hours. Not more.","July 10, 2014","false","6.7"," 99 of 131 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","99","131","0","11"

The cartoon graphics are beautiful and the various towers look great.\n\nYou troops come in many familiar variants, from glass cannon ninjas to de-buffing Shaman to front line tanks and healers.  There are even some familiar faces from the Indie world that make an appearance!  There is a decent amount of strategy in the choice but you can only bring 3 types of towers at a time, I can't help but think if this limit was relaxed it would have provided a more interesting game.  It is increased to 4 after you complete the game once but still...\n\nYou can be constantly on the move, attack from angles with high damage low health units to attacking front on with the tank taking the damage while shooing down lanes or even some variation thereof.  I used a front line of ninjas with shamans and an engineer to provide support.  Looking around there does seem to be a nice variation of viable builds, a definite plus!\n\nThe grind is the biggest issue here and shows the games IAP roots.  Taking out IAP and just making the game paid for the PC market does not a great game make, it seems as though the grind is the primary game mechanism at times, not fun.  There is only one map in the main game and even though every 5 levels out of the the total of 20 the time of day changes and you get a unique boss, there is no discernible difference apart from slightly different creeps.  There are a couple of other modes, survival where creeps come from all angles and and escape mode where you navigate a maze of creeps and obstacles to see how far you go.\n\nThere are a few cosmetic bugs, but nothing major and I'm sure they will get patched at some point.\n\nIf steam reviews had a “meh” category this game would fall into it.  It's too grindy for a paid game and doesn't really offer enough value for it's price.  Pick it up in a bundle or on sale and wile away a few hours or don't!","April 11, 2014","true","7.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

It has quite an original concept, being a tower defense with more than a twist. There is a central point to defend, and there are enemies coming in to attack, ever more, ever more strong. So far, so good.\nBut. The towers to defend your stronghold are not static, but are attached as party-members to the Bard you can steer around the battlefield, destroying enemies "on the fly" as it were. You do not attack yourself, but one can enhance the attacks of your party-members by playing short guitar-riffs, played free by collecting notes. Extra attack, speed, defence and a short freeze of the enemies come in handy as the waves of enemies get stronger. As usual, units and your Bard himself can be upgraded, for this one needs the coins the enemies drop in abundance.\nIn order to succeed, fast reactions and speedy thinking are necesarry. I found it difficult at first to keep an overview of the battlefield, as several issues need attention: where are the enemies coming in at thier strongest, which buffs are needed, did any of my units die so I have to summon a new one, is my stronghold still going strong, .... But after a while I got used to it and enjoyed running all over the place, with my little but brave party. Playing it with an Xbox 360-controller certainly helps and feels most natural.\n\nEnemies get quite strong before halfway in the game, and so sustaining the 20 waves is no easy task. Every 5 levels there is a boss, but for the most part enemies do not change that much during the game. Still, with an extra "free run" mode (try to get as far as you can dodging the enemies) and with a "survival mode", one can come back to this game again and again. As can be expected nowadays, there are Steam trading cards and some inviting achievements, which really help to appreciate the game to the full. No classic, but still very enjoyable. Don't hesitate to buy this, especially when it's on sale or in a bundle.\n\nGameplay: 20/30\nGraphics: 12/20\nSound: 9/10 (the combination of the sound-track and the guitar riffs works admirably well)\nLongelivety: 14/20 (thanks to the extra modes, and to an extra difficulty level)\nTechnical & stability: 9/10\nPersonal rating: 7/10\n\nOverall: 71/100","August 16, 2014","true","11.6"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","1"

In Bardbarian you’re charged with protecting a village rather than destroying one. You don’t do it by clobbering your foes with axes and hammers. No, you use the power of music to save them!As you might have surmised from the game’s title, you play a bard in Bardbarian. Well, to be more accurate, you play a barbarian who decides to trade in his weapons in order to take up shredding on a different kind of axe; in this case, a musical one. It just so happens the day he makes this important, life-changing decision, his village is attacked by a bevy of orcs and other baddies. With axe in hand, he uses the power of song to inspire his fellow townspeople to rise up against the invaders.The premise of Bardbarian is fairly simple, and therein lies the fun. All of the action takes place in the village and your main goal is to protect its crystal. Waves of enemies will stream in from the forest to the right, so it’s your job to have Brad round up townspeople to defend their homes. Brad can call upon archers, healers, brawlers, dwarves, storm knights and other kinds of units.These guys can provide ranged damage, melee/projectile damage and healing for Brad and his party. The right combination of units can help you plow enemies en masse with ease, so pay careful attention to your party makeup with relation to the enemies on the field at any given time.Your party’s makeup matters a lot because spellcasters and ranged damage dealers will flank Brad while tough melee units will act as tanks and lead the party. Different classes have different aggro ranges, so you’ll either have to move Brad in very close to have units like Brawlers activate their attacks or kite enemies at a distance so that Archers can loose their arrows. As the game gets more difficult, more enemies appear onscreen at the same time, so you’ll have to be very judicious about your movements to make sure you’re inflicting optimum damage while also avoiding enemy projectiles.Gathering units expends Notes, which Brad generates by jamming out when he’s standing still. You merely need to tap on a portrait of a unit to spend Notes and have Brad play a sick solo to summon them from their homes. Once you’ve gathered your units and are ready to defend the town, killing baddies is as easy as dragging Brad around and getting his party within range of the enemies. They’ll fire off their shots, destroy enemies and continue following Brad around.Fallen enemies drop gold coins, which can then be used in the Item Shop. You’ll be able to purchase upgrades for Brad’s buffs, increase the size of his party, hire different units and even make upgrades to the town. The game can be very difficult, but it is also very fun and rewarding. You’ll have to tackle stages over and over to amass enough gold to upgrade everything to a level that gives you a fighting chance against bosses, but that’s part of Bardbarian’s fun.Bardbarian’s action is made all the more enjoyable thanks to the hand-drawn, cartoony graphics. The style is reminiscent of the multiplayer game, Castle Crashers, and adds the right amount of goofiness to the proceedings. If there is one thing that really holds Bardbarian back from being a truly perfect game, it’s the fact that it’s so challenging. While the difficulty may be fun for fans of the genre it kind of hampers the story a bit and may cause other gamers to lose interest.Bardbarian is a heavy blast of cartoon violence that slowly but surely develops into a concentrated and exciting action game, that's not quite like anything you've played before.","January 3, 2015","true","11.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

Thankfully, it's not so hard to pick up. It throws you right into the game without any notable intro/knowledge but don't worry, figuring everything out is a matter of few minutes. It doesn't take long and you will be addicted to Bardbarian.\n\n======OVERVIEW======\n\nBardbarian takes the Tower Defense genre to a whole new level, where you can actually influence the outcome of a battle, whether you just move differently or have other units spawned. Every level usually somehow differs each time you play it. However, if you play a certain level few times, you can actually remember when and where a specific enemy spawns. That being said, it is not a big deal since you'd have to spend too many hours in this game to actually remember the pattern of spawning. Besides the regular adventure/story mode, there are two more game modes: survival and escape. Both of them bring a fresh air if you're just burnt out of the main mode and I must say that surprisingly enough, I've enjoyed these. Plus you can unlock some of otherwise not approachable units and you can come up with some other interesting strategies. So far I'm using ordinary units more but might give those specials try if I ever struggle with some specific level. And yeah, you'll find yourself struggling with a level more often than you're willing to admit but don't worry, it gets better with almost every upgrade. Far better when you find yourself some comfortable unit combinations. One more noticable thing: sound. The way this game works with soundtrack and sound effects is just beautiful.\n\nPROS- visual side\n- controls/gameplay\n- trading cards\n- sound effects and soundtrack\n- grinding\n- replay value\n- achievements + trading cards\n- crossover features with other indie games\n\nCONS- lacks events/seasons updates (last update was on Halloween, still in the game to this game which kinda doesn't make sense)\n\n======RATING======\nI love this game. It sets the standard for Tower Defense games too high and it'll honestly be a hard quest for other games to overcome the great experience I've had playing Bardbarian. I'd highly recommend it to every casual gamer out there, heck, even to those hardcore gamers, you can spend some quality time playing this game as well.\n\nFor recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","February 17","true","5.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

First off, the claim of "Steam exclusive" characters in this version is completely false. Don't believe me? Download the FREE version on google play or the app store and see for yourself. The only item that costs money in the free (and virtually identical) version is the golden axe, which is obtained with in game currency in this version but costs only $3 in the free tablet/smartphone version. This game is normally priced at $8 and thus, I cannot recommend it unless you get it on sale (for controller support, I suppose).

Buy some friends! Bacon can be the difference between life and death.\n\nBardbarian is a casual RPG "tower defence" game. You play as Brad the Bardbarian and your aim is to protect the town crystal, which is conveniently placed at the end of the town, with a huge field of open grass separating it from the forest. This game is different to other games in the RPG tower defense genre, however, because instead of the main protagonist, Brad, fighting, he summons troops using notes that he has played on his lute to fight for him. The troops can range from wizards and mages to knights to even mechanics, so you can make some pretty interesting crew combinations.\n\nThe main idea of the game is very similar to that of "Earn to die". You obtain money as you play and you can use it later to upgrade things in three different categories. Your troops, your town, or yourself. This can lead to some extremely repetitive grinds for gold, but other than that the gameplay is excellent. There are 2 different types of difficulties: Casual, and Insane. Casual would be for people who haven't played much of the genre before, but for me, insane was just the right amount of difficulty to make it fun.

The entire backstory is there in the title.\n\nUnfortunately this new devotion to music and abhorrence of inflicting violence could not be timed worse, since an invasion force of monsters is approaching the quiet town you live in.\nWhy? Nobody knows. There is no plot beyond the setting.\n\nThis leaves the town in a pickle though, without the barbarian they will need another way to protect their town.\nDespite no longer fighting directly the Bardbarian has decided to help. The local adventurers' guild has plenty of warriors around and all they need to join the defence is some encouragement. Musical encouragement.\n\nSo the Bardbarian runs around the battlefield, playing (monotonous but fun) music to gather a resource called Notes. These notes can be spent to recruit warriors from the adventurers' guild who will start following you around the battlefield, attacking any enemies that come close.\n\nThis turns the game into a defence game, you navigate your group of adventurers around the battlefield to keep the monsters away from the town square where a magical crystal does... something important, apparently. Wave after wave, until you get a boss fight and move on to the next segment of the game and do it all over again.\n\nAfter your almost inevitable failure you spend the gold you earned from the enemies the adventurers have vanquished to upgrade... quite a lot of different things. Upgrade your units, unlock new units, upgrade your own stats, research spells and facilities around the village that make your time just a bit easier.\nA weird item that you can buy is the Golden Guitar, which doubles all future Gold income. It's a relic of the time where the game had a cash shop on mobile, but fortunately it can be bought with regular currency in this Steam version. You should do that as soon as possible.\n\nAll in all the game gets a bit repetitive as it goes on, and some of the later units are so much stronger than the other ones that you don't really feel like you're customizing so much as levelling that one unit until you get past the level you're stuck on.\nHowever, it's a pretty game with a lot of content and a solid soundtrack.\nRecommended if you're looking for a fun defence game.","September 22, 2015","true","6.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I tried the game out and im surprised on how good it is. You play through levels, kill enemies and try to defend your throne. When you kill creeps they drop gold, which you can use to upgrade your followers health, damage, etc.\n\nThe graphics are okay. Looks like a cute cartoon-ish style, almost like a mobile game. The game runs fine though and the PC port seems to be solid in every way. Since there's a lot of grinding involved in this, you might wanna play this game for short periods at a time.\n\nI'm enjoying the music that comes with it. It's a rock song with some nice drum rhythm, and I think it suits the game really well. As you progress you unlock new followers that have different abillities, and like I said, you upgrade them with the gold you collect. It starts of easy but it gets hard pretty quick.\n\ndefinitely a nice little game, but due to the repetitive grinding you might want to pick it up on sale or in a bundle.

This game isn't awful but you can find better similar games for free on Kongregate.\n\nYour a bardbarian and you summon different units to fight waves of enemy and protect the crystal. You can use powerups and a stun attack to affect the battle but most the time your dodging projectiles and trying to get within the proper range of an enemy. You can upgrade the main character, the units and the town.\n\nThere just isn't much to this game. The campaign is actually pretty short but it pads itself out by making you grind gold for upgrades, which could be fun but the gameplay gets stale pretty quick so it just becomes a chore. The unlockable units are frustrating because you're not going to want to replace one of the units you have already upgraded - so you probably wont be changing your roster until later levels.  You have to pick 3 units you can summon for each run through, so a lot of the others will fall by the wayside. Your minions will miss constantly, especially long range ones.  The units give you a pretty wide hit area with how they stand around you (without upgrading), so a lot of dodging will involve turning another direction so your units mash together to get to the other side of you. So everything is pretty inprecise and skill doesn't come into play much, it's just comes down to grinding for those upgrades. The controller support is flawed, often you wont be able to preform the stun move and you have to restart the game for it to work again (at least on 360 controllers). Also, the soundtrack and sound effects are annoying and repetitive. I could see how this would be a better IOS game if you just wanted to mindlessly kill a few minutes but I wouldn't suggest buying it on Steam.  On the plus side it does have nice art and the Steam exclusive characters are pretty cool.\n","August 4, 2014","false","2.9"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","13","20","3","0"

Song notes represent the unit currency of the game that allows you to hire or buff your recruits.. Units are active, which makes movement important, staying still will result in them being hit, or worse you being killed. The focus relies on player movement rather than building towers to re-route enemies.\n\nEndless and Survival are two side mini-games which provides cash based on performance, that helps upgrade units for the main campaign. You can unlock characters by accomplishing certain feats on both modes. Endless mode is when you are running and trying to survive all the bullets on the screen, accumulating as many miles as possible which I found a welcome mix-up from the normal gameplay.","July 21, 2014","true","12.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/recommended/269490/","lovinglife139","lovinglife139","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/","1123 products in account","Bardbarian is a casual action game with hints of tower defense. I wasn't a huge fan of the game's cartoonish look, but tower defense is my favorite casual genre of game, and I go out of my way to try any game of the genre, whether it claims to add something new or not.\n\nBardbarian is fun in doses, but it quickly wears out its welcome. It adds something new to the tower defense genre, which is the fact that your "towers" are various characters that you can upgrade and you can influence their actions using music. You also have no stationary units (other than a full upgrade later on in the game where you can have units defend from on top of two buildings), and you are in charge of moving to the enemies and killing them off before they get close to your town center. While this is a new take on the genre, I didn't find that it added much enjoyment gameplay-wise, and in many cases, it turned out to be frustrating. You essentially have three entrances where enemies spawn, and the screen isn't large enough to cover the entire "field", so it's easy to be focusing on defeating enemies on one side of the screen and completely miss enemies coming through on the other side, because they are not visible on screen but only on the mini-map.\n\nOne of my favorite things about the tower defense genre is conquering maps and moving onto new challenging maps, and figuring out the best strategies for handling the routes enemies would take. Unfortunately, Bardbarian has one map, and one map only. It's understandable, in a way, because your towers are not stationary, so therefore new maps wouldn't be necessary. However, the game quickly becomes dull and repetitive because your surroundings are never changing. To add insult to injury, this game is one of the biggest grindfests I've ever played. Reading other reviews that state it was developed for phones now that I've played the game makes total sense, because this game sure does play like a phone game. Expect to play the same levels and waves of enemies over and over and over and over in order to save enough gold to buy even some of the most basic upgrades. Also, there are 20 waves of enemies, total, in the game. 20 waves TOTAL, which is equal to about one or two maps in most other tower defense games. The game only saves your level progress at every five levels, so if you don't beat the boss at the ends of levels 5, 10, 15, and 20, don't expect to start back on the level you died on. You have to go all the way back to the beginning of that "section" to try again.\n\nAnother issue I find with the game is the fact that your units are so easily killed, even when fully upgraded. Playing through a grindfest of a game to save enough for certain upgrades can be somewhat justified if those upgrades make the player feel as if it was worth it, but upgrading anything--anything, from the Barbarian's own health to his units or the town itself--feels ultimately underwhelming.\n\nThe game also sports a survival mode (with one map to choose from) and an escape mode (one map). Both are ways to post high scores, add small value to the game, and potentially make a little extra gold. Survival mode is fun for a few tries, but escape wasn't really my cup of tea.\n\nIn summary, I began this review with the intention on giving the game a "recommended, but only on sale for $2.00 or less," but the more I thought about the game to write this, the more I realized I couldn't justify recommending it. In the end, it's up to you to decide, but I implore those fellow tower defense fans out there to find a different game of the genre to try. Bardbarian removes more enjoyment from the genre than it adds, and to be completely honest, it's possible that tagging this game as tower defense does it an injustice, because I went into this game wanting something that I ultimately did not get. Bardbarian can be fun, but it plays like an action casual phone or online Flash game. If you are willing to pay to purchase it with that in mind, you probably won't be disappointed. Otherwise, I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this.\n\nEdit 4/29/2016: I've noticed that an abnormal percentage of people have marked this review as unhelpful. As I always try my best to cover all aspects of a game in a review to be helpful to potential consumers, I would appreciate any comments on my review letting me know the information I've left out, or any questions you have about the game which my review left unanswered. I will update the review as applicable. Thank you!","October 20, 2014","false","4.6"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

Your companions are the only way to attack enemies for you are the bard player, their leader, and they trail behind you or just in front of you whever you go.  For companions, you do get a wide variety that unlock as you progress in the game, from short range heavy damage, to long range low damage, healers, and other abilities, etc.  I found if I just picked a couple to focus on and upgrade those, I found I could go farther.\n\nFor what it is, the game is pretty well done and I had a pretty good time, but the game could definitely use more music -- that just added to the repetitive feeling of the game.\n\nThe Good:+ Nice graphics.  I like the style and the theme of the game.\n+ Nice style of gameplay.  Leading the companions to do the attacking for you.\n+ Entertaining.  I not only finished the campaign but continued on to complete some additional Steam Achievements.\n+ Nice upgrade options.  You can upgrade yourself (health, speed, number of followers, etc), your companions (health, damage), and your town (pet, health/gold bonuses while playing, strength, defenses).\n+ Couple other game modes.  Survival Mode where you just run around (not in town) and see how long you can survive where you are given a few periodic random drops like bacon (for health) and followers.  And Distance, where without any followers you see how far you can run without taking a single hit.  They're both fun for a few attempts, but I like that they were included.\n\nThe OK:~ Every level the same.  It's always your town.  The monsters change.  Nothing else.  Not even the lighting despite the levels being grouped into different times of the day.  (Morning, Noon, Evening, Night).\n\nThe Bad:~ Too repetitive.  Felt too much like grinding the same levels over and over to get gold to level up your guys to survive longer.\n\nOverall:  This is a fun Tower Defense game with a 5.7hr campaign (for me), suffering only from being too repetitive early on.  7.5 out of 10.","March 5","true","10.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can even employ the help of the townspeople, even the town drunk.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

All in all an awesome deal of many fun hours for a cheap price (especially when reduced).\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that isn't disgusted by tower defense games and (not too hard) bullet hell shmups.","October 2, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're some buff barbarian and you decide to be a rockin barbarian. It's very simple and costs a meager 7 bucks.\n\nIn this game you will protect the crystal on the left from the dudes coming from the right. Everytime you fail you will be given the oppurtunity to upgrade your stuff. In general this is the entire game. You kill things, get gold, get further, die and upgrade. It's not a bad game if you enjoy this and I found it fun for a bit, but it doesn't hold a lot of variety. It also doesn't help that the metal knight dude is full on OP and makes variety a joke. I'm also not a fan of the fact the healer kills herself to heal your units. That makes them somewhat worthless.\n\nI'd still recommend the game as something to mess around with, but I would not recommend it for serious play.

One day monsters attack Brad's village but when the local townspeople call upon his help Brad does not really feel in the mood for fighting.\n\nSo he picks up his custom guitar to play some tunes instead. With his massive tunes Brad can summon forth units of all sorts and sizes to protect him and fight in his place.\n\nWill Brad be able to protect the towns Crystal and will he be able to fend of waves of foes come to destroy it?\n\n--------------------\n- About the Game\n--------------------\n\nTo control Brad you can use either, keyboard or controller. Though a controller is highly recommended to get the best fun out of this game.\n\nWhile standing still Brad plays his instrument which only then generates musical notes that can be used, like currency, to summon forth several units.\n\nThose units will follow Brad around and do the attacking instead. The units are anything from close to long range combat, each with unique attacks, strength and weaknesses.\n\nAt the beginning your maximum party size can only contain 3 summoned units, though this can be increased through upgrades you can purchase with gold coins that drop from enemies.\n\nMusical notes are also used to allow the purchase of temporary buffs, such as increased speed, strength or raised defence.\nBrad also has a special Stun skill that charges with each kill and is your out of Jail skill when things get hairy.\n\nThe game is progressing through waves of enemies which will try and destroy the town's Crystal. If the Crystal or you die the game ends and you will have to start from scratch again.\n\nThough after several waves a Boss is encountered and upon defeating the boss you unlock a save point you can choose to continue from after you die.\n\nBetween deaths, you can use collected gold coins to upgrade the town, Brad himself, your units or purchase general perks.\n\nUpgrades can be anything from stronger units to higher health, bigger party sizes (allowing more units to be summoned at any one time), increased musical note generation and much much more.\n\nDuring each wave of enemies you must run around to get close to the enemies so your units can attack them. Be careful though as your units as well as yourself can get damaged and die.\n\nIf you die the game ends, if your units die you can re-summon another unit at the cost of Musical Notes which are not endless as they only generate when Brad stands still.\n\nSometimes musical notes are also dropped by enemies or can be given to you by supporting town folks you can purchase as perks in the upgrade store.\n\n--------------------\n- Summary\n--------------------\n\nThe game is a lot of fun and the upgrade store has a lot to offer to make the game more interesting as you continue to play it adding great replay value. Death is expected in this game as it gives you then a chance to spend your hard-earned gold coins on upgrades and perks to support you to blast through more waves than before.\n\nI definitely would recommend this game.\n\n--------------------\n- Known Bugs\n--------------------\nBrads special Stun skill is most of the time bugged and cannot be executed by keyboard or by controller.\nThe game is still fun and even without that skill very playable, just a little more challenging.\n\nI don't know if it effects all users or only users with controllers or certain combination of things but either way the developers have replied in this thread that they are aware of it, had even released a fix in July but it still is bugged. (For me anyway).\n\nI assume/hope another update is soon to follow.","July 11, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This did not add anything of note new to it, it is overpriced and even trying to spend as long as possible you will be lucky to spend 5 hours of time on the game.

All of the indie game tie-in characters add a flash of whimsy to this casual hybrid of Real Time Strategy and Tower Defense, but it's hard to gloss over the fact that you'll have experienced much of what the game has to offer in about 30 seconds of play. To its credit, the game packs in a lot of things to do in the form of different modes, minigames, and achievements. Unfortunately, the strategy aspect of Bardbarian is very shallow, and you can steamroll through about 98% of this game just by leveling any three units enough. Still, the action is instantly gratifying and the prospect of leveling your abilities to get just that little bit further makes the game addictive for the limited amount of time you'll spend on it. While I'd hardly call this game essential to your library, at the end of the day, I had $5 worth of fun and a good time getting all of the achievements.","October 18, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a nice mechanic that keeps the game flowing along nicely allowing you to upgrade your arsenal of chosen Warriors after each fight is over!\n\nGraphics/Music\n\nBeing an Indie game it is sometimes hit and miss with what graphics can be on offer but I personally found the overall 'sheen' and 'quality' to be of a very high standard.\nThe music seems to suit the game well, I liked the touch of the little guitar 'licks' each time you engaged Brad to summon a warrior or power. I accidently left the title screen music playing for about 30 mins on once occasion and it didn't grate on me either which is definitely not a bad thing.\n\nPros/Cons\n\nPros\n+ Pleasing high-quality graphics and production.\n+ A Casual game but still has that 'one more game before I turn it off.. appeal!'.\n+ Wide arrays of characters for your arsenal of good guys.\n+ Extra game modes to play alongside the main campaign.\n\nCons\n- Took a long time to figure out the correct (and best) upgrade paths for your team.\n- Can have a frustrating one hit death to your main character Brad at the most inconvenient times.\n\nFinal/Personal Thoughts\n\nBardbarian is a high-quality Indie title that I personally enjoyed playing through, yes it can be frustrating at times but as soon as you have put some time and effort into the game it will reward you with revisiting the same levels but the game being a lot easier to conquer (having a team with fully upgraded warriors!).\nRecommended purchase if on sale or part of a bundle!","February 6","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being D&D player for many years, I've always seen Bards get the short end of the stick. This one puts the bard center stage at the heart of the party in a funny action-packed way. Lots of dodging, explosions, death, and all in a nice little pg-13 package.\nGameplay is good, though I've only played Bardbarian on PC. The wealth of party members make for some interesting combinations, giving you a lot of leeway on play style. It's a simple, straight forward game that can give you hours of entertainment.\n\nNot real complaints on this one oddly enough. Thoughrolly enjoyed this one from start to end. Even managed to clear all the achievements, which almost never happens with me.\n\nBardbarian is definetely one to add to the library.","October 7, 2015","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels a lot like a combination of tower defense and arcade games... As if it would be a tower defense game, except you have to move the "towers" around with you while making sure that not only enemies don't reach their target but also that you and your "towers" survive too.\n\nThere's a large ammount of characters to use and a lot of different strategies with combining different characters and plenty of unlockables and upgrades will keep the game fresh for a long time. Other gameplay modes adds a bit more variety and Insane difficulty adds quite a lot of challenge while also not being impossible to beat.\n\nIf there's ever a second Bardbarian game, I'd love to see a longer campaign and perhaps multiplayer!","March 4, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bardbarian, however, is a very close second.\n\nWith Bardbarian, you don't actually do any attack yourself, or set up towers that attack lanes of enemies. Instead, you move freely about the battlefield, commanding your troops who you bring in with "Sick Lute Licks," which in turn attack the enemies who come in from the right side of the screen. With a variety of attackers (Some long range, some short), a variety of enemy types, and a slew of upgrades to make your life easier, it's a fun game to play...if only for a few hours.\n\nThe main issue I personally have with the game is that there is litle longevity to it. Once you learn the enemy types and ugrade everythin to max, you could probably beat the game within 6-8 hours, even less if your quick about upgrading your stuff. Even the addition of an insane mde, which barely amps up the difficulty itself, isn't enough to satisfy me for very long. The game does however, have three main games modes.\n\nThe campaign is split up in to four sections with five levels each. At the end of each level is a boss. Beat the waves, beat the boss, move on. Simple enough. The other two modes aren't so standard. Survival has you in an enclosed area with enemies coming from all angles. Instead of summoning your troops like you do in hte campaign, you find them on the field. This is nice because the notes you generate to normally summon units can be diverted solely on powerups for them. It stinks because they don't spawn into the gamtoo quickly, and you are often times left defenseless, seeing as you are unable to attack on your own. The final mode is Escape, and its basically a run right as long as you can while a wall of death follows you. You collect gold along the way and avoid enemies, making it a good mode to make some quick gold if you need to.\n\nAll in all, the first few hours of the game were just plain fun for me. Unlocking new allies was always nice, and upgrading them, the town and myself added that extra touch. The other games modes were a lot of fun too. But as I stated befor,e once you get into the 6 hour mark, and have upgraded almost everything...it get sold fast. If the game has any future updates, I'm unaware, so as of right now, it's a good experience, but for a limited time.\n\nIf you want a game to kill a few hours with, I highly recommend it. If you want something that will keep you entertained for a long time...this will help ease the pain of waiting for Fallout 4 to download...\n\nIf you thought this review was helpful, let me know! I like doing these, and plan on doing more for the other 190 games I own, so please let me know if this helped! Also, check out some of the other reviews I've done, and have fun playing!","November 19, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A Barbarian turned Bard that gets units to fight for him by playing sick riff after riff on his sweet axe.\n\nIt's a fairly simple and repetitious game. Bad guys come in waves to try and attack the town crystal while you and your units try to defend it. You use notes to summon units as well as power ups and can collect them and coins from fallen enemies. This is a whole day affair and is broken up into parts. For instance if you completed Morning but died or needed to quit the game, you can skip that phase the next time you play and go on to Afternoon. You can also buy upgrades that will help you achieve victory like a town drunk that spews on the ground to help slow enemies or better barracks and colleges for your units so when they come out of them, they are a higher level and will do more damage. However, you can only buy upgrades after each death or else the coins you collected will disappear. This goes for unused notes as well.\n\nIt's a cute game, a little frustrating, and a great time killer.","May 26, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was juggling the toughest enemies in the game with push-backs and stun before it was even close to over. Waves 1-18 are child's play, and then 19 and 20 will kick your ♥♥♥ if you don't have a balanced party of stuns, slows, and push-backs at your desposal. I felt too powerful most of the time in Normal Mode, making it feel kind'a grindy.\n\n\nTIPS TO THE UNWARY:\n-Skip normal mode and play on insane. You'll do less gold-grinding that way, and the game is actually better balanced. You also won't have to play the game twice to get all the achievements. (I got all but one)\n\n-Don't forget to SCROLL DOWN in the unlockables and permenant upgrades screens. I didn't get the "double your gold" item until almost the very end, and felt very much the fool for it.\n\n-The wizard's pushback/stun is the most potent thing in the game. Upgrade him early and JUGGLE all your enemies!\n\n\nTDLR:\n\nDefinitely recommended! :D","February 13, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a nice mechanic that keeps the game flowing along nicely allowing you to upgrade your arsenal of chosen Warriors after each fight is over!\n\nGraphics/Music\n\nBeing an Indie game it is sometimes hit and miss with what graphics can be on offer but I personally found the overall 'sheen' and 'quality' to be of a very high standard.\nThe music seems to suit the game well, I liked the touch of the little guitar 'licks' each time you engaged Brad to summon a warrior or power. I accidently left the title screen music playing for about 30 mins on once occasion and it didn't grate on me either which is definitely not a bad thing.\n\nPros/Cons\n\nPros\n+ Pleasing high-quality graphics and production.\n+ A Casual game but still has that 'one more game before I turn it off.. appeal!'.\n+ Wide arrays of characters for your arsenal of good guys.\n+ Extra game modes to play alongside the main campaign.\n\nCons\n- Took a long time to figure out the correct (and best) upgrade paths for your team.\n- Can have a frustrating one hit death to your main character Brad at the most inconvenient times.\n\nFinal/Personal Thoughts\n\nBardbarian is a high-quality Indie title that I personally enjoyed playing through, yes it can be frustrating at times but as soon as you have put some time and effort into the game it will reward you with revisiting the same levels but the game being a lot easier to conquer (having a team with fully upgraded warriors!).\nRecommended purchase if on sale or part of a bundle!","February 6","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game was well-suited to living room play and I'd recommend playing it that way if you can.\n\nThe variety of units is good and allows some customization of your party.  You start with basic units like an archer and a brawler, and can unlock more specialized units like healer, tank, ninja, etc.  All of the units I tried seemed like they would be useful in the right circumstance.  My favorite was the necromancer - she raises the dead, who can be used as an unwilling meat shield in front of your party.","June 13, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Jokes); there is no open-world or sidequests tacked on***\nUnlike Plants vs Zombies, you are free to move about; not bound to setting up your towers/plants.\n\nYou are Brad, a barbarian who has rigged his axe into a lute. Monsters are attacking the village. You use your axe/lute (so "axe") to call companions; you've further solo's to buff yourself and those followers. A dynamic conga-line, you weave between enemies' projectiles, enabling your companions to return fire. You collect Gold (you can buy a Ratcoon to collect the loot for you) to purchase upgrades.\n\nVery addicting.\n\n***There are two other game modes in addition to the Campaign:\n--Endless plants you into the thick of it; you only have your three Buff solo's at your disposal. Companions/Health randomly drop. The challenge is to recruit those Companions and not have them die THE SECOND they start following you. The game claims that this is a good mode for farming gold. Too bad your Ratcoon is absent; So sad that Companions (your only means of dispatching enemies) survive for mere seconds. Totally unfair, in my opinion.\n--Escape has you running from a wall of darkness. No companions to worry about, no strategy in using solo's; strictly a runner mode - one hit kills you. It's much more fun than Endless, though hardly related to the main game.\n\nParting Words:\nTown Drunk's barf slows down enemies;\nSuper Meat Boy and Octodad are unlockable companions.\nThe HUD is too big, even though the UI is said to have been "revamped."\n\n\n\n...I just now read "About This Game":\n"An awesome Rock/Metal original soundtrack by Maximum Satan "\n...why...j-just why?... Damn :/\n\nEDIT 2: Get on Insane Mode ASAP and farm Escape; that's where the money is.

Its a single player MOBA on 1/2 a MOBA stage. You've got the 3 lanes spawning creeps and the goal is to defend the MOBA doohickey that will make you lose if destroyed. Its not difficult or complex.\n\nOn normal difficulty, this game stinks. Its insultingly easy. Bad enough I was going to give a negative review.\n\nHard difficulty... Well, that's where the game actually gets fun.\n\nBardbarian has a distinct newgroundsy free flash game feel to it. It also has annoying bugs that should be fixed but haven't. Also they didn't try to make the music loop properly which is way more annoying than you'd think.\n\nAnyway, I found myself enjoying the game. $5 is a bit much for the state the game is in. If its on sale and you've got pocket change burning a hole in your pocket, you can't go too wrong. Just wish they'd f-ing fix the obvious very common bugs though.

The app was very fleshed out.\n\nThis game is just as fleshed out, and I have enjoyed playing it thus far.\n\nYou play as a bard, so your player character does not actually attack. Instead, you summon support units (ex: archer, fighter, mage; party limit is initially 3 max) who follow you around, snake-style, and attack the closest enemies. In the beginning, you will notice that the party is a little spread out, and this is fixed by upgrading "body spray" in the store. The game is very charming and comical, the art and music is very good.\n\nEnemies spawn on the right side of the map and make their way toward your town gem on the left. Over time, you slowly gain "notes" that you use to summon units (you can select 3 from you unit pool to take along with you into the levels) and also to trigger buffs like enchanced damage, speed, or defense.\n\nThe upgrading is pretty well fleshed out, as you can upgrade your units, your hero, and the town. For your units, it is basic overall upgrades like health and damage. There are also unlockable characters like Octodad and Super Meat Boy, which is a cute addition. Your hero can upgrade health, party size, party closeness (body spray), and other things. It is critical to upgrade the bard, as once he is dead, your round is over.\n\nUpgrading the town is crucial as well, as you can unlock things like a town pet who grabs gold for you (allowing you to effectively dodge more enemy projectiles and not worry about disappearing loot), a town drunk who periodically vomits, slowing any enemies that enter the bile radius. Later, you may unlock a high level barracks or college, which generates extra free units to help you in defense of the town.\n\nThe game is really, really fun if you like this style of gameplay, and you can easily spend time playing this if you enjoy upgrading to completion.\n\nThe controls are very responsive, you can easily play with just the mouse, but I recommend you either use the keyboard (WASD) to move + mouse to trigger skills, or to use the mouse to move and the keyboard hotkeys to summon units and trigger skills. The tutorial is short, skippable, and very helpful. Learning curve is minimal, however, the game is suprisingly difficult in thr beginning - I had thought I was fighting the boss, but it was only the "pre-boss" (indicated by a skull on the minimap. The real bosses come when you move onto a red (vs. blue) square on the minimap.\n\nNeedless to say, I got served very hard.\n\nGive it a try, definitely recommend.","July 7, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Reminds Plant vs. Zombies a little, or Poof vs. the Cursed Kitty or Zombie Pirates, or even maybe Orcs Must Die and Sanctum - meaning that you must protect your base (here: town crystal) while fighting "personally" and developing new tools of destruction, new defences etc. It's easy to pick up, easy to play but...\n\nCONS:\n- really awful, unesthetic graphics\n- a game for maybe 3-4 hours (then it becomes boring and very repetitive)\n- should and could be better\n- looks like a poor mobile port (which it probably is)\n- sometimes a little bit too difficult to proceed to the next levels\n- this electric guitar sounds get quite annoying after a while...\n- I've lost my savegame after a few hours of gameplay\n- it's nothing special to be honest\n\nPROS:\n- it's easy to pick up and play\n- it's funny\n- many items to buy\n- good for a few hours if you have nothing better to do\n\nVERDICT:\nIMO all the games that I've mentioned above are simply much, much better than Bardbarian. After 3-4 hours it became very repetitive and boring. If you're looking for this kind of game I would  rather recommend Poof (with 2D graphics) and of course Orcs Must Die (3D graphics) instead. But this one here is also palyable, so if you have a chance to get on a sale for less than 1 Euro maybe you could give it a try... You shouldn't have huge exspectations though.

While it's not even pretending to be original, this mix is nice from every angle (if you'll not be looking for too long).\nYou'll be playing for the partygoer who can't fight monsters himself, but good at avoiding hits and making friends. And with help of those friends you'll be defending your village from the onslaught of gremlins, lizards, beholders... and so on. The main catch of this game is that those Bard's friends acts very differently, so you can develop various tactics of the best team around you. Some of those helpers will be taking damage, some - dealing it to the enemies, but it's only for start! An engineer, per example, will be setting shooting towers, so for some time you can play it as basic tower defence game - two engineers in your team can overrun almost everything in the first half of the game! Glory to the engineers!\nAnd glory to the rock music!\nBut seriously, it's a short break game. It can create some fun, but it's a very simplified game experience. I cannot praise that game highly, despite the fact it is a well made stuff. I'll mark it as 7/10.\nYou surely can buy Bardbarian in some bundle, or with good discount, and spend 3-4 hours of your time. Just don't overdo it. It is mobile casual, and not a chess game.

The graphics are fun and have lots of bright colors, the sound is good, and the music is, well, 80's hair-metal guitar riffs that make my ears bleed and not in a good way. The units you can summon are mostly pretty cool (I use blue sword warriors or ninjas, a necromancer, and either a hammer stun thrower or mage) but some are basically useless. The enemies are nothing special and are pretty standard fare for a game like this. It has a few funny little things thrown in, like how you can recruit the town drunk to walk up and down the screen and barf out toxic vomit puddles that slow the enemy. The powerups are all cool and the game is a fair challenge, requiring some grinding and upgrading in order to beat the game. It even has a mode after you beat the game so you can play on longer and gives you new items and upgrades, something you rarely see in games.\n\n7.5/10 good replay value","October 30, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

WONDER NO MORE! Bardbarian is labeled as RPG-Strategy and it's true, you can take up to 4 different units to battle and as you progress you upgrade your favorite units abilities and more unit slots (only 4 kinds at  a time, but you can summon multiple units later on).\n\nBut Hot, why did you talk about Tower Defense you drunk Batman?! Well, there are 3 lanes of enemies and you must manage to kill each one of them with your units, you can chose which units to summon and when to play a guitar solo to give them different boosts (speed, defense and attack), so it's like chosing which tower/champions to use and upgrade to progress more.\n\nAs a final thought, to enjoy more the game aim for the Golden Axe Upgrade as soon as possible to get double gold and kill all the Bosses you can! Then chose the 3 units that suit the most your playstyle and focus on upgrading them, I suggest one long range, one mid and the last one is up to you, just try to not take too many glass cannons.","February 26, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monohybrid/recommended/269490/","monohybrid","TheSLAP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monohybrid/","362 products in account","Bardbarian is a somewhat fun game that mixes elements of bullet-hell and tower defense.  The gameplay feels interesting, at first, but lacks more than a few hours of gameplay.  I beat the game on Insane difficulty in about 3 hours.  I have basically everything unlocked and maxed except for a few units (which would require grinding for another hour or so).  Even on Insane difficulty, I found myself standing at the front gate killing enemies before they could even get a single shot off.  Eventually you'd hit a wave / boss that's a brick wall and would require you to die and upgrade (sometimes a few times) before you could pass it.  If the developer could smooth out this progression, it would feel much more exciting to play.\n\nBesides all of the cons I've listed above, the game is some sort of Flash port.  I have a gaming PC, and I get about 3 frames per second on the main title in windowed mode.  In fullscreen mode, the main screen doesn't even load and the game crashes.  I spent the first few hours after purchasing this game trying to solve this problem.  The game is littered with other bugs as well.\n\nI would avoid this game, personally, but if you like grindy games, I suppose I could recommend it at $1 or in a bundle somewhere.\n\n2/5 Stars","November 24, 2014","false","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I can't recomend it for a PC (and definatly not a Mac PC in this case), the main game has noticable lag (at the moment). Even if the lag is fixed, I can only say that this game is best suited to a mobile/touch screen device.\n\nThe second reason I can't recomend it  is because of the repetative grind. Constantly playing through to a death hoping that you have enough gold to make an upgrade to yourself, the town or your units. The games description does state "The usual grind for XP has grown dull, and he has decided to pursue his dreams of making music instead of shedding blood." Note that this does not mean that there is no grind.\n\nWhile there are two other modes to continue the grind for gold through, they are briefly fun but challenging. The current price is also steep comparing it to the Android version. If the price is similar to the Android one, then it worth checking out at that point.","April 10, 2014","false","4.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There's no way to attack anything directly (aside from expensive special attacks) and the only things that can routinely attack the enemies aren't directly controllabe by you. (They just sort of follow you around.) So it's hard to get them to dodge attacks, etc. Basically this game uses some good ideas, but the execution just isn't quite there.","July 13, 2014","false","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It will be fully charged and ready to go and it just won't work. Simple as that. Lost many long sessions because of this bug.\n\nAnd the game does a poor job at explaining its own gameplay mechanics (see below)\n\n-Game tells you that you will recieve an additional unit to defend the tower if you upgrade the barracks to the max. But they fail to inform you if that unit is effected by levels, buffers, powerups and they also fail to tell you what type of unit and if that unit can score critical hits or not. Things like this are important to know in strategy games.\n\n-Game allows you to upgrade your player speed and health but fails to inform you if those upgrades carry over to the other gametypes like survival and escape.\n\n-Game lists a "Healer" but feels no need to tell you that the healer sacrifices her OWN health to give you more.\n\n-Towards the end of the game enemies leave a random skull and crossbones stake in the ground and i have no idea what they are. The game does not tell you.\n\n-One perk says "Keep shops open longer, increase drop rate by 50%" which costs 2000 gold, while another perks with a golden axe says "Double your gold drop rate and look good while doing it". Well i purchased the 2000 gold perk and enemies who dropped 13gold before still drop 13 gold now. So obviously that perk is only referring to musical tune drops which would have been nice to know before i spent 2000 gold.\n\n-Game allows you to upgrade your units but fails to explain why characters still "Level up" after killing enemies. Why are my maxxed out units still leveling up?\n\n-Game tells you units can score critical hits at higher levels but fail to inform you what chance the unit has to score a critical chance or how much more damage a critical hit does.\n\n-Game shows a speed boost buffer but doesn't feel the need to inform you that the speed buffer also increases your units rate of fire as well as movement speed. These things would have been nice to know beforehand.\n\n-Game tells you that the bards rate of musical notes increase while idle, but do not inform you how much more. Same goes for units like the mechanic which build turrets after standing idle for a period of time, they don't tell you how long it takes standing still before he builds a turret and they do not tell you how much damage the turret does or if the turret can score critical hits or not.\n\n-Game does not have a counter to tell you how many active units you have out on the battlefield at once, In the early stage of the game it is easy to count but good luck when you are able to have 9 at once and you have maxxed out "Body spray". Yeah good luck counting 9 individual units all twirling/spinning/sprinting around with thousands of rocks/missiles coming at you.\n\nIt just seems silly to fail to explain simple gameplay mechanics in a game where strategy is key. A small strategical difference can mean the difference between victory or defeat. And the fact that this company does not even feel the need to explain to you what is happening on the battlefield in complete detail is extremely ignorant.\n\nAnd the overall gameplay setup of the game is just poor. Instead of perks being a bonus to give you an edge over your opponent, its mandatory pre-requisite required to proceed through the campaign. The game is purposely setup to force the player to grind for experience/gold. For example, in order to get past stage2, you need about two hours worth of gold farming to upgrade your characters. Even if you do everything properly in terms of strategy, you simply will not do enough DPS to stop the kamikaze bomber before he reaches your base.\n\nAnd ironically, for a game that is called "Bardbarian" and is centered around guitar shredding and musical notes. It only has one mediocre background tune for all three game types.\n\nAnd p.s.The vote up/down option is to determine if the review was helpful or not. Its not a damn like or dislike button","April 8, 2014","false","9.3"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","1"

This means that even though the game hands you your butt on a plate quite often... you will think to yourself "I'm pretty sure I have a chance now I upgraded that wizard a couple of times" and you will try again.... and again... and again... but you will enjoy every second of it while you retry again and again!  Great replay value here and great fun to load up for a quick 15 minute blast at a time or even to play for hours at a time. ;)  It's very cheap right now (Humble has it for a measly £1.49 (approx $2 to $3) as I write this!) so what are you waiting for? :) Go grab it! :)","May 13, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a bard-barian, that doesn't attack, but struns his awesome axe, and calls for varying party memebers (archer, mage, healer, brawler, etc.) and then can strum to add buffs to your party (increased speed, defence, attack, etc.).

"Survival" and "Escape" modes are not very addictive to play.\n\nGraphics[\b]: Nice but not the best. Some of the boss animations could have been better.\n\nMusic / SFX[\b]: Really weak.

Great art work and loveable characters. this game is perfect for when you want to play something a little more casual and different. This game has awesome music, cool boss fights, and unique characters that have their own strengths and weaknesses. The game is pretty easy but some of the later levels can prove to be quite difficult and will take multiple play throughs. Also even when your done with the game you can play on insane mode which unlocks a new character slot and allows you to upgrade each unit once more. You won't take long to beat the regular story mode but there is survival and escape mode that is also pretty fun at times to play.

Play time can vary depending on how many achievements you want to pick up, but you can spend as little as five minutes on this game and still have a great time. Survival mode is challenging to even the most hardened player and the Escape style mode is a great way to earn yourself some extra gold while actually testing your reflexes and mental sharpness.\n\nI wholly recommend this game to everyone and anyone, but especially those that enjoy the format of summoning or tower defence games.

Great art work and loveable characters. this game is perfect for when you want to play something a little more casual and different. This game has awesome music, cool boss fights, and unique characters that have their own strengths and weaknesses. The game is pretty easy but some of the later levels can prove to be quite difficult and will take multiple play throughs. Also even when your done with the game you can play on insane mode which unlocks a new character slot and allows you to upgrade each unit once more. You won't take long to beat the regular story mode but there is survival and escape mode that is also pretty fun at times to play. The game play can be quite tedious and repetitive from time to time but I think one can expect that from a tower defense game. Even with the sometimes bland gameplay this game's goods far out way the few bads that it has. I would love to see the game to have a longer story mode or even some short of an adventure mode in the future but the game is pretty much good as it is for a casual tower defense game.\n\nPros:\n+ Amazing Artwork\n+ Unique and hilarious characters that you can unlock\n+ Adorable raccoon companion\n+ Great soundtrack\n+ humorous story\n+ Octodad\n\nCons:\n- limited game modes\n- Short story mode\n\nOverall:     9.5/10","April 15, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

If you're a fan of defending stuff and dodging stuff, why haven't you gotten this game already?  If you're not, you should probably still get this game because it's pretty fun.  The only flaw I've found is that sometimes your allies aren't quite looking at the same things, so maybe like 5% of the time they'll shoot in completely the wrong direction.  This becomes less of an issue the more allies you have, so you'll really only notice it in the early stages of the game.","April 4, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bardbarian, *a Barbarian who just got sick of the barian part, and just decided to be a BARD-bariann instead* has to stop the evil, kinda cute goblins/trolls from destroying the towns prized possesion, a decorative crystal. Very fancy.\nBy playing through waves, which many a gamer should be familiar with, you kill monsters, level up your team and collect gold. As the bard yourself, you don't actually attack anyone, but your teammates do automatically. They can be upgraded via the gold you earn. The town and bard can also be upgraded. You can have more health for your crystal, get a Ratcoon. *Yes. Rat-coon* and have a town drunk spit speed reducing and health reducing vomit. Have a college to make your teammates stronger when they first come out, and give yourself extra speed, among several other things.\nThe game does exactly what you would expect it to do if you are familier with with such... Let's say tower defence games already. Perhaps Plants vs Zombies is a better example, but only slightly. It doesn't try anything new, but what it does offer for the price is a good game.  You are getting what you see in the video, plus a survival mode and a deathrun minigame as a quick way to earn coins if you get tired of playing the main mode. A reasonable, casual like timewaster for a price that seems right for such a game. Get it when you have the opputunity.","July 30, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Survival" and "Escape" modes are not very addictive to play.\n\nGraphics[\b]: Nice but not the best. Some of the boss animations could have been better.\n\nMusic / SFX[\b]: Really weak. You have pretty few sound effects in the game and 2 different background music, that's all.

Regardless of what you do each wave the enemys have more HP and do more damage which makes it a bit challanging. If you enjoy spending hours grinding away and upgrading then grab this game.

I've never played it on android phone before, so this review is strictly from the perspective of a PC game.   I tried playing both via keyboard and a xbox 360 controller, and I recommend playing this with the controller.\n\nAt a glance, the main game is deceptively simple.  Your tower is on the left side of the map, and creatures approach from the right side of the map.  The hordes of monsters will continuously come at you (first) and the tower (second).  Your Brad the Bardbarian can't do any attacks on his own.  He needs to drum up some tunes on his axe-lute to call up the cavalry--troops who follow your character and fire at the mobs.  You will die sooner or later, but your goal is to last long enough to accumulate gold to buy upgrades for your troops, your hero character, and your town.  These upgrades DO carry over.  The challenge continually increases as monsters appear in greater numbers, and more powerful to boot.  And it becomes apparent that you need upgrades in order to advance further in the story mode.\n\nThe game also comes with a survival mode, and a distance mode.  The survival mode consists of a timer to see how long you last while trying to get troops and dodging enemy fire.  Distance mode involves your character moving from left to right while dodging environmental obstacles and enemy fire.  Both allow you to accumlate gold and possibly unlock new troop units.\n\nI purchased this game for $5.24 on sale at Steam, and to me it's money well spent.","April 3, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worst game I've played this year so far, I'm mostly baffled by how they completely missed the point of a tower defense game: it's the first game I can remember where you're supposed to lose countless times before winning, you literally can't win the game on your first try. That's a pretty big design fail in my opinion: one of the most important mechanics in a tower defense is being able to buy and upgrade units on the go, in order to adjust to what the waves of enemies contain; here you can't, you just choose three type of units at the beginning and that's it, you can't even upgrade on the field, you have to lose to do it (but you have to grind the money playing and dying soo thereafter), of course the units are severely underpowered at first so the whole system falls on itself and crumbles.

It does get a bit grindy towards the end, but I found the mechanics entertaining enough in their own right that I never felt too bored. The charming art-style was a big plus as well.

I know that's a bit of a mouthful but the formula works quite well.\n\nMusic was enjoyable and I found myself waiting to hit the guitar rifts whenever I activated my abilities.\n\nHere's some gameplay footage.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ATAFvd-5Slc","May 8","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easy to get addicted to!\nIn the beginning you'll be just playing shortly, but after a few upgrades, it will draw you into the game even more.\nThe name of the game is really chosen well: it's sometimes hard to fight, but still always a bit funny. The music and sound effects fit great in the game!","March 13","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bardbarian however was a pleasant surprise, a game that takes two genres I'm usually lukewarm on (tower defense and shumps) and manges to combine them in a way that I found super addictive. It does get a bit grindy towards the end, but I found the mechanics entertaining enough in their own right that I never felt too bored. The charming art-style was a big plus as well. An easy reccomendation for anyone looking for something to tackle in bite-size chunks (it's a great 15 minute break game) and for the achivement hunters out there, they're a pretty easy 100%.","May 23","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it because I thought as my friend had spoken about wanting being a Bardbarian in DnD and you know what? So worth it! It's the kind of charming funny little game I would expect around the whole Bardbarian idea.\n\nAlso his lute is an elctric guitar and that is awesome!\n10/10 would buff team with solos again.","May 25","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
