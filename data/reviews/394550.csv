As much as I love the first one (and still play it every now and then on my 3ds) this one is just vibrant with more beautiful colors, music, and textures. Not to mention the more challenging gameplay, which is bound to make you get tons of retries on your first playthrough. Plus, with the extra challenges like "No Damage", as well as 4 save files, and 4 playable characters (with one locked) each with their own abilities, it's bound to keep you interested in it for a long time. Plus, it's cheap.","September 3, 2015","true","0.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","16","17","4","0"

What you get here, is superb platformer gameplay. Challenging, but fair. Short, but rich in variety. And just very enjoyable and very much worth the small price they're asking for it. If you ask me, they can make 5 more of those. I will buy them all.

This is a very worthy sucessor to the first one.  The level design is much better and just plain awesome (you never know what you and Clive will be doing next), the enemies are very varied and well-done, the visuals are f**king fantastic, the music is kick-a**, and the bosses are extremely cool.  This game is longer than the first game, it takes abouy 2-2.5 hours to complete, and tougher, but very fairly so.  It's one of the best games i've played recently, and at 3 dollars it's excellently priced.  I HIGHLY recommend this game; a lot of heart, soul, and creativity was put into it, something you rarely see in games these days, and it shows.

Played it on my 3DS and enjoyed every moment of it. Sure, I got frustrated when I couldn't get through a stage, but that satisfaction of beating the stage you were stuck on for the longest time is amazing. Soundtrack made it even better going through the stages and the boss battles were challenging and that's a good thing. Now Gunman Clive 2 does everything bigger and better. More variety in boss battles, different types of stages compared to the first one, and there's more color! COLOR PEOPLE! The soundtrack is still on point with everything you're doing. Probably the best $3 spent on Steam ever.","September 4, 2015","true","3.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The first game pretty much explored the simplistic platforming to it's fullest, but Clives return isn't as focused anymore. Platforming, while still a major part of the game, makes up only 60% of the total levels. The rest are drawn out boss battles and some lackluster third person shoot'em up sequences thrown in for no real reason.\n\nThe leveldesign also took a hit and just doesn't strike me as thoughtful and carefully planned as the original game. Stages are generally longer, with rather annoying auto-scroller segments and way more gimmicks (gravity, physics-shenanigans, bottomless pits galore) - somewhat limiting your approach to finishing them.\n\nSpeedrunning and no-hit/no-death runs are still the major motivation of the second Gunman game, but the aforementioned physics add a level of annoying frustration that ultimately stopped me from trying to go for the perfect run. On the plus-side, the game is visually much more interesting and has a lot of different themes going - not exactly the most creative ones, but there are some really nice scenarios. Music is more upbeat than the original, which I don't like entirely - the soundtrack of the first game was more chilled and relaxing and helped getting into the calm mood needed for flawless play.\n\nGunman Clive 2 is still a cool little game, but I don't think all the stuff they added to it really makes it superior to the prequel. If you haven't already, check out the first game before taking on the world in Gunman Clive 2.","October 11, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's quite short - 20 levels, 6 bosses - but there are 3 difficulty levels (don't bother with easy though, play first with medium and then with hard) and four characters which all play differently, giving the game a lot of replayability.

Each of these characters will have their own set of skills, and moves. Going through the campaign will give you a lot of troubles as the difficulty reward smart thinkers and patient players as it was for old school games.\n\nNot only old school here, but also the new one, as a lot of variety is proposed in different levels, the 2D flying levels encountered here were something absolutely nex, fresh and very, very entertaining. Gunman Clive is absolutely a classic and will steal all your attention. The difficulty is something that will catch you and will never let you go, beating a level and another one and another one will grant you hours of fun.\n\nFurthermore a special note for the soundtrack, exciting and really well thought out.\n\nAn absolute Masterpiece and a must have for all those missing Old School games.\n\nVideogame News, Indie Score: 9.0 | ULTRA RECOMMENDED","September 18, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What happened? I'll get the good out of the way, so what does Gunman Clive 2 do right? To start the soundtrack is as good if not better than the original, featuring more varied tracks. The controls are fair, though this might just be me adjusting to the steam controller, but I feel the original had tighter controls. Bosses are more interesting and the difficulty has increased overall with both Chieftain Bob and the Duck offering a mix-up to the regular gameplay all of the above is what I appreciate from this game.\n\nSo what do I feel Gunman Clive got wrong? The clear crisp sketch like visuals are now muddier than before, where previously colour was limited to enemies, various effects and the occasional bit of background scenery, now that everything is in colour I feel something has been lost in the transition. World and level design also feels off to me, devoid of originality. No longer does the stages feel concise but rather littered around the world for the sake of "more diverse environments". The stages suffer as a result, becoming both unoriginal and forgettable.\n\nI think the worst part is one of my major complaints about the original title still stands. Difficulty levels are meaningless, yes the difficulty of the game has increased but the choice of difficulty is pretty inconsequential, especially if you're going for the no damage run.\n\nI'll summarise for the sake of clarity, I don't think this is an inherently bad game, but as a sequel it has left me disappointed. If you do want to get this, I would urge you buy the 3DS version if you can as it is pretty much better than any other version of the game. I didn't want to give this a negative review, it's really deserving of a mixed review. So I guess I'll be the one to leave the first public negative review.","March 9","false","5.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

If you like Mario, Donkey Kong Country, Shovel Knight, etc. you will enjoy this.\n\nI played this without playing the original Gunman Clive. There isn't any story so it didn't matter at all.\n\nIt's a short game - I beat it in 3 hours (on Easy) - but you can replay it with different characters if you want to.\n\nSome of the stages are quite tricky, but every time I died I felt it was because of my own mistakes, not bad luck or bad design. (Actually the levels are very well designed with plenty of variety to keep it interesting.) You have unlimited lives so you eventually learn how to complete each stage, and it's very satisfying when you do.\n\nNote that when you die you go back to the beginning of the stage, which can be frustrating, but the stages are quite short so it's not such a big deal.\n\nMy only real criticism is the Steam Achievements are only awarded on finishing the game with different characters. A few mid-game achievements would have been nice.\n\nI give Gunman Clive 2 a 9/10. Highly recommended!","January 8","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
