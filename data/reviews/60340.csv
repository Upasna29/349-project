"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/recommended/60340/","thistauruslovesgames","Hermix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/","193 products in account","Luxor 5th Passage. The fifth game in the Luxor series. A match-3 marble shooter set on another adventure through Egypt.\n\nThe main objective is to stop the evil deity Set from taking over the united lands while fighting alongside his nephew Horus. Throughout the game, you must create matches of three or more colored spheres and prevent the scarabs from entering your pyramid. Unlike the other games in the series, this one features Blast Mode and Player's Choice\n\nMy opinions of it all: To some players of Steam, this review may seem a bit misleading. Recommend watching some gameplay of this game before purchasing. The writer of this review is not responsible for any disappointment upon this game's purchase.\nThe Good\nBefore Steam, I used to play simple games such as this one and didn't really complain too much about the repetiton the game had. Another interest was the [Egyptian] mythology that grabbed my attention. Though small, the soundtrack was very fitting, and the power-ups were lovely whenever collected, especially the four new ones exclusive to this very game: Black Hole, Double Shooter, Lead Barrage, Spiker.\n\nThe Bad\nAt some point in the game as I neared the end, one particular power-up seemed to bug or glitch, malfunction upon collection: Sorter. If the stage was cleared and this was collected, Luxor 5 would instantly crash. Restarting the game, it was obvious that the progress wasn't saved, leaving me to start over. Sorter also didn't exactly work as intended, having all the spheres pushed by the scarab closest to the pyramid vanish from the screen and never reappeared organized by color.\n\nOverall\nThis was, yet, another awesome game in the Luxor series. I managed to complete the game all the way in a few hours, but time doesn't matter all that much to me. Again, this writer is not responsible for any disappointment receive upon the purchase of this very game. You have been warned.\n\n--Sir Shinigami.","March 16, 2014","true","18.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Fullscreen mode is supported, although the screen is stretched from a fairly low resolution window, but unfortunately the Steam Overlay is not supported.  The game features a wide variety of detailed scenario backdrops and ball paths, as well as a nice selection of power ups, extra point gems and coins and end level achievement trophies that are in game only. Altogether this is one of the better casual puzzle games on the market and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a solid casual challenge.","July 20, 2012","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Even when I had old CRT monitors I would of been ticked off with this game! But to sell a game in this resolution is a joke. As far as I know, there is nothing that you can do regarding some sort of widescreen hack etc, like you can with some older games.\n\nThe game itself, playablity wise, MAY be okay. But to be honest, I just can't bring myself to play Luxor with oval shaped stretched balls coming down the screen.\n\nJust glad I didn't pay much for this one. :(\n","August 7, 2014","false","0.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I wasn't expecting support for anything above 1920x1080, but the fact that this is still limited to 800x600 is ridiculous. Couple that with the lack of any Steam specific features (achievements, cards) and there's no reason to support this, especially at the price that they're charging. Don't get me wrong, it's just as good of a game as the entire series has been, but there's too much missing in terms of features to justify picking it up, even at half off.","November 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Fun power ups, easy to learn, good gameplay.\n\nHowever, theres issues with the game that makes it unplayable. Sometimes I encounter a bug that renders the shooter unable to make the balls hit the target. I can shoot anywhere, it never registers.\n\nThe resolution on the game is also painfully small for someone with a wide screen. 800 texture on a 1900 monitor just doesn't work and playing it in windowed mode makes the game screen too tiny.","July 2, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
