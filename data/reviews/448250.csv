What a strange abomination....\n- No intro story or context as to what the thing is above your head or why you are collecting things for it\n- No way to zoom out the camera to see more of the stage, a majority of the time I was just doing leaps of faith "hoping" a platform would appear on the other side or below...\n\nOverall I think this platformer has too many flaws at the moment to recommend, but hopefully they will be fixed with future updates.","March 11","false","4.9"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","29","40","0","0"

Played for about 10min and after dying about 30 times because the inputs don't always regester I've given up. Simply dropping from one ledge to the one below it can prove futile as the... thumb(?) seems to want to launch itself off everything making every step a roll of the dice if you get to live or start over. If input recognition and control gets fixed, it could be a fun game, but till then, it's not.\n\nPro:\n+Interesting avatar, a dissembodied thumb-knight thing.\n+Looks and runs well.\n\nCon:\n-Controls\n-No story. Not asking much here, just a simple thing like "You are the thumb of a great knight, cut from him during battle. Make your way back to him so he can continue to fight."\n-What is that thing floating over me, and... ahh never mind, I'm playing as a dissembodied thumb-knight thing so what's a floating shape thing matter.","March 23","false","0.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

The developer is probably in primary or high school.\nThe controls simply don't always register, the jumps are random. If the controls don't work properly,\nthat means the game is broken. There's plenty more wrong here, but now that you know the controls don't work you won't have to read through all the other problems either...\n\nPros:\n- Good music\n\nCons:\n- Bad controls\n- Boring level design\n(- Terrible English , which adds to the unprofessional characterstic of this game)\n\n1/10\n* you get the 1 for giving me an achievement for actually opening this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ *","May 16","false","3.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

The story is unique and funny. There are many interesting levels in the game and you must make up your mind what to do next, because the game is not that simple as it might look in the begginig. Still it need some work , but I think it will be a great game to play in the end. I will be looking forward to play new levels and understand the story of the character. The game is recommended for all platformer lovers. You will have a great time, I think. )","March 12","true","1.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

In my opinion levels feel boring and contentless but boss levels are funnier because you have to find the way to kill them. Remember me the classic free browser platform games.\nAs other comments say controls are pretty weird and unpredictable.","April 28","false","3.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I would much prefer controller support.  After playing consoles for years, I honestly couldn't make it off the first platform.  It is unplayable to me in its current state (early-release).  But if I could control the character, it looks like an interesting mechanic. (good for trading cards, until controller support added).","May 8","false","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I get that it is in Early Access, but that doesn't mean that the game can't still be good.  Just look at Unturned, still in Early Access I think, it's a solid game.  But in its current state, this game as platformer, it just doesn't work.  The jumping is really clunky.  I thought I had it at one point, but the idiot decides to jump off a platform.  Also, why is there no controllable double jump?  And even after buying the Jump Three Times thing in the shop, how does it work?  Don't get me wrong, this game looks great and has the potential to be something great, but not right now.","April 30","false","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I bought it because it was on sale for like $0.50. That's about $10 more than it should have been. Yes, I should have been paid to play this game. Maybe they are planning to do more with the game than have you jump around and try to make progressively longer jumps.","April 29","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
