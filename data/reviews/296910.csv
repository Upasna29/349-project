For independent developers, the ability to build retro throwback games to their youth is one of the most compelling drawcards of having access to all these game creator tools. And this is where 8BitBoy comes from.\n\n“What am I doing with my life?” is a common question that people ask themselves. As the hero of 8BitBoy ponders this question to himself he thinks back to the good old days when he got to sit around and play as much as he wanted to on his trusty old video game system. Thinking on that, he wonders, do I still have that system? He descends to the basement and starts to rummage through all the old stuff trying to find it. His old 8 bit system in all of its glory with all of his old games worn with the passing of time. Then joy suddenly turns into curiosity has he discovers one brand new game with no label simply sitting there. He loads up the console and the mysterious cartridge and then gets sucked into the game, becoming an 8 bit character in the process.\n\n8BitBoy is a throwback to the old platforming days where games featured not more than a few different buttons to play with, and players had only one goal to be accomplished, such as “make it to the end of the level without dying.” Graphically this game is pretty, with a nice application of the 8 bit aesthetic. The main character, the enemies, and the environments are very well polished and smooth which creates a seamless landscapes for the stages that you pass through from one world to the next. Oddly enough the game is almost too pretty, with the clean visuals damaging the illusion that you're playing an 8 bit game somewhat.\n\nThere are two different ways to play; Kiddy or Retro Mode. Kiddy Mode grants more time within levels and autosaves after every level which makes dying and game overs later on a little bit easier to handle. Retro Mode requires finding a very specific coin that is hidden in the levels to be able to save. These coins are tough to find and the one thing to remember is, the clock is ticking. If you really are an old school gamer, this title will challenge you.\n\nFrom the different worlds to the various enemies that can be encountered, 8BitBoy really feels like an homage to the 8-bit days of Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros. series. To say that 8BitBoy is a simple experience would be to take away from its retro elegance. Platforming traditions of all types are represented in the game, from disappearing platforms to raising quicksand. The game steadfastly refuses to pick up on some of the more modern game design elements found in platformers, and it's almost quaint in its dedication to old school gameplay, even to the detriment of its playability compared to other games that are now on the market.\n\nAvailable to the main character within the stages are two forms of powerups. The first is a shield that will protect the character from any one hit, while the second is a red fruit that turns his clothes red and allows him to shoot fireballs. Now if the launching of fireballs was not enough, there is a second fruit that is available only after attaining the first one which turns the clothes green and allows for two simultaneous fireballs to be launched. It's not exactly a subtle reference to Super Mario Bros, but it's a fun touch nonetheless.\n\n8BitBoy will frustrate players who haven't kept up with their old school play skills. The game requires precise platforming skills, and there are moments where a well timed jump will still just fail, or missing an attacking jump by a single pixel can cost a death. That said, 8BitBoy is a great throwback to the NES era of platform gaming where skill and mastery were required if you were to make it through to the end of the game. It’s games like these that remind us that button mashing does not always win the day and sometimes, just sometimes, perseverance can be a reward into itself.","November 2, 2015","true","60.0"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","39","44","3","0"

Whoever is taking 16+ hours to clear this game is either 90+ years old having never played a computer game in their life or a 2 year old toddler who is in the process of developing his/her hand and eye co-ordination. Having played for just over three hours I have already managed to reach the fifth and final world. Sure I can see a bit more longevity in the game if you seek out all the secret rooms within each level but 16 hrs is definitely pushing it. Also if there is a story in all of this outside of some grown man booting up his 8-bit console and magically getting sucked into its game world then I must have missed that part.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355374546\nBooting up the game you are greeted with a simple message from its creator who professes his undying love for everything gaming related. There is no denying he was obviously heavily influenced by the platformers of yesteryear - particularly Super Mario Bros. - because at the heart of it 8BitBoy is a simple Mario clone (with the main character  and the world he inhabits basically ripped straight from the 80's Nintendo Mario classics). Mushrooms are replaced with birds as our titular copy-paste hero bounces on heads to remove enemy obstacles. In much the same way Mario punched blocks to reveal coins and power-ups so does 8BitBoy. It's all very...retro chic but without the chic bit. 8bitBoy does give the player the abilty to shoot projectiles but its never really explained why eating fruit such as blackberries gives the hero the ability to shoot out tiny little fireballs. If you played any of the old NES Marios back in the day, 8BitBoy will be instantly recognizable as you traverse its five different worlds. Where the game excels is in delivering a great little chiptune soundtrack although it's very limited musical array starts to repeat fairly early on.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355373493\nAs a homage, 8BitBoy is perfectly serviceable and while it isn't going to bring down the house it should offer those looking for some 8-bit nostalgia a relatively fun-filled time. In the end 8BitBoy achieves what it sets out to do...almost! It's still no patch for the actual games it's inspired by and I would say you are better off going to play the original Mario SNES classics, which are freely available all over the internet today, but considering the price ($3.99) and that clearly 8BitBoy is made with an undying fandom love and you could be doing a whole lot worse with those $4.00.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","December 13, 2014","true","7.9"," 69 of 93 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","69","93","4","7"

So he remembers his childhood playing video games and having fun. While going to his basement he finds his old console, and a game thats un labeled. When plugging it in he suddenly is transported to the Gaming World. Nice Game pick it up for the sale price its $7 right now. Worth the purchase..

While its obvious that it takes a lot from Mario games, 8BitBoy has its own flavor and style. It looks and plays like your typical Super Mario game. To be more specific, Super Mario Bros 1 or even Super Mario Land because of its power ups. There are four tiers of power ups. You'll first get a shield power up, that only allows you to take an extra hit. Then you'll get a bouncing red ball projectile, not like Mario's fireball, but like a bouncing ball. Its a nice dynamic weapon. The next tier is a double green fireball that goes faster and finally a fire version as the final tier.\n\nThe enemies feel good and there is a lot of diversity, even if they are color swapped birds for the most part. Blue birds take two hits, green birds fall off platforms, black birds throw snowballs, pink birds shoot arrows. There are fish that jump out of water pits. Most of them can get taken out with head stomps ala Mario. When you bounce on an enemy it is an auto jump instead of being able to hold the jump button as a jump. That auto jump feels problematic especially when platforms are so small. I've learned to not jump on enemies with other enemies flying over them. Auto jump will get you killed.\n\nEach level is pretty open and seems big enough. You're able to explore and find hidden blocks, and passageways that go through walls. The secret areas feel nice and are usually found pushing up against walls. You'll go up, down, left and right, but never fly or swim. Each level goes to the next. You will never have a choice. It just seems lacking when compared to Mario when that's what the developer took inspiration from. The levels go in succession with no level map, just a world map with all 5 of the worlds, each having 10+ levels. These aren't worlds so much as levels. Levels going in succession without being able to select them just feels like a chore having to go through 10 levels to a boss. Its like Super Mario 1 or 2, and less like Mario 3 or Mario World, being able to move around a world and land. When you start each level it tells you level 1-2 world 1. Wouldn't the 1 in level 1-2 imply that you're at world 1?\n\nThe controls are easy, and the developer has listened to feedback. There's a run / attack button, a jump button and a use item button. After listening to feedback, the attack and run buttons have gotten merged together. It just  felt awkward having them as separate buttons. The stopping can be slippery. Without running, 8-Bit Boy just feels slow. When you get 100 coins, you earn a random item to use when you want to. That keeps the game going. If you die and need a quick power-up, just use that. You don't even need to catch it. You'll just have it.\n\nThe game is difficult, but forgiving, especially on the standard difficulty. When you get a game over, you'll restart the level from the last save point. So if you started level 1-2 with 2 lives and fireballs, then die twice, you'll get a game over. Then you restart with those 2 lives and fireballs again. Retro difficulty will only save when you find hidden save coins. I think restarting a level from a save point is just a way to compensate for how difficult the game is and how few extra lives you'll find. Even when you complete the world, and lose all your lives, you still restart with the lives you had entering the world. So you're almost stuck with 1 last life all throughout the entire game. Imagine getting a game over screen each time you die and having the wait to reload the level. Not just that, but use your analog stick as a mouse pointer to click reload game. You're able to use a 360 controller, but the menus turn your analog stick into the mouse cursor. It just feels inefficient, when I could just press a button to play again. Then after that, you need to wait for the game to tell you level 2-4 world 2, before you can move. Super Meat Boy at least throws you right back into the action.\n\nIt is only difficult for constant jumps over death pits that you'll need to land on one block platforms over and over again. If you miss, its death. In the desert, enemies will jump out of the background with no warning other than remembering where they are. This is especially problematic when there are jumps that need you to hit this background jumping enemies.\n\nFor a game called 8-Bit Boy, it didn't feel 8-Bit. The introduction cut scenes don't look 8-Bit either. The resolution is too high for the images. While the game felt like Mario, it didn't feel 8-Bit.\n\nAnother problem I have with this game is screen control. There are some blind jumps due to the screen being stuck to show 3/5s to the right of the character and 2/5ths to the left of the character. Each level can be a maze, which is a good thing, but it makes you blind to the left side, if not blind drops down to platforms. Using the L and R buttons to scroll the screen would have been helpful. Boss fights that use only one screen don't lock the screen to the boss's room. So you can be blind to where the fast moving bosses are.\n\nWater is deadly too, even one block high water when your character is two blocks high and looks like his head would be above water. These are issues that the developer has told me on the forum that will get fixed in the sequel.\n\nThe reloading saves via mouse after every death is an issue, when five lives could be easily granted after using a continue. Pinpoint jumps aren't fun, but really its how slow 8BitBoy moves. There is a run button, but I just think the game could be more fun than it currently is. All of the levels feel the same, even if they're different. There are no new elements added to them except maybe conveyer belts in the fourth world. In the end, there are better games out there even if the game has some fun. It just pales in comparison to the game it tries so hard to be.","June 25, 2014","false","5.8"," 80 of 115 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","80","115","0","4"

Specially if you are just shooting for the end without exploring. Having branching paths and secrets is ok, but have your main level be interesting as well. That's just like making an RPG have awesome side quests and a bad main story. Side quests are a bonus, not the main stuff, it's like the topings on an ice cream.\nVariety is also an issue, each world has a lot of levels, but they all feel like the same level with rearranged stuff. Each world introduces some new baddies and graphics, but they are not well distributed or introduced.\nAlso, levels are long but they don't flow right, I find myself a lot waiting idle for a monster to get out of the way or a moving platform to reach me. Or sometimes the opposite, for example on the flooding levels, where you "escape" water that rises, since it expects you go down the bazillion secret paths, if you just follow the main level the water is never even close to you. This just tells me the levels were not really planned much, stuff was just thrown there. I would much prefer fewer levels but better planned than a ton of levels all the same.\nThe enemies don't follow any "consistent" pattern, they move, jump and shoot whenever they want. This extends to other stuff, for example one of the enemies throws a big snowball that sometimes hits the wrong pixel and rebound on a different direction from where it was supposed to go. This happens with a lot of stuff including the bosses, they rebound against the walls in a weird fashion when they jump.\nYou die because you can't predict stuff, it's just twitch reactions a lot of the time or simply impossible to dodge.\nI'm honestly not sure if this is related to framerate or whatever, but it's just an ingredient for a bad plaformer.\nConsistency is what makes these kinds of plaformers fun (at least the ones this game is trying to emulate). On most games from the NES/SNES/Sega era, the enemies and the enviroment reset on each life, and always move the exact same way when you respawn, so you can learn the level. This way when you die you know it was your fault.\n\nMoving on to glitchy stuff\nHitboxes are weird. Sometimes you don't properly hit platforms or pass through them.\nSolid blocks and non-solid blocks look the same.\nSome of the background can be confused with platforms.\nBreaking squares from below also behaves badly, sometimes you have to hit squares twice or more.\nThrowables from enemies go through stuff. I was hit a couple of times by one of the small snowballs from an enemy I wasn't even seeing on the screen.\nFinally, my biggest issues, several game mechanics are bad:\nLevel exploration is super punishing. On my playthrough I was going through levels in a straight line to the finish. Levels are super hard already without exploring, and exploring is just pointless, any benefit is crushed by the fact that any mistake and it's back to the start without power ups. Exploring stops being fun after the 30th death, where you have to redo the entire level from the beginning, while also loosing the power up. Risk is not worth it just to get a couple extra coins.\nThe power up system is very unbalanced. The game doesn't know if it wants to be a shooting plaformer or a jumping plaformer, and the mix is not well done. A power up makes enemies super easy, but no power up makes them a nightmare. You are massively underpowered without a power up. And, let's not overlook the fact that, if you don't have one, you die in 1 hit. So you can't shoot, but you also insta-die, it's the worst and not well balanced.\nLevels don't help at all, some enemies are even impossible to kill by jumping, for example the birds that fly high and shoot at you. If you compare this to super mario for example, the difference is that in super mario the main focus was jumping, and you could finish all levels just with small mario, the flower was just a "nice to have". And if you compare to most shooting plaformers the difference is that you already start with a gun or have means to handle enemies other way. In this game the balance is bad, and you start with nothing each time you die....\nLast, the lives are just worthless. The fact that, loading the save restores your power up when entering the level, just makes it better to have 1 life with a power up and get a game over on each death. Also, harvesting lives is horrible. If you are going to make a game inspired in old games, bring only the good stuff, not the bad. In any case, harvesting lives doesn't work here, because A) it's super hard so you would need like 2000 lives B) there isn't any fun level to quickly get lives C) on each death you loose the power up D) it's better to get game over and continue than having lives\nThe rant ends here, these game mechanics were the last thing that ruined it for me, but they could be fixed with changes like:\nAdding checkpoints would encourage exploration. Super nintendo games added them for a reason. If you want to keep the difficulty, you can do something like Shovel Knight or Bit Trip Runner 2 where you have the option to break or skip the checkpoint if you want.\nFor the power ups the easiest would be to make the shield be a default on death, and make the first pickup be the red berries. An alternative would be to better balance the levels for when you don't have any pickups. Since right now it's a death sentence.\nThe behavior on death should be the same as loading the last game or something similar. I would just get rid of the lives system entirely. The game could keep track of the deaths but have them be meaningless except for points or something.","November 4, 2014","false","2.8"," 54 of 74 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","54","74","3","0"

To its credit, it does evoke a sense of nostalgia; the visuals and music are very reminiscent of a Genesis/SNES game (thus making 16BitBoy a more appropriate title, but that's splitting hairs). The graphics are simple and cartoony, everything is brightly-coloured and you can clearly see what is an enemy, what is a powerup, a platform, etc. The game's presentation is fine.\n\nHowever, in an attempt to emulate some of the classic platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras, I feel that 8BitBoy has not quite hit the mark in terms of quality gameplay; your character seems to slide around very easily, almost as if every level were an ice level. I've also noticed that the main character's hitbox when it comes to platforming is smaller than its sprite; classic platformers like Mario and Sonic allowed you to land your foot on the edge of a platform and be fine, yet in 8BitBoy you had better make sure you land square on a platform, otherwise you're likely to fall and die.\n\nDeath is another problem with this game. Lives are in short supply, and the levels have no checkpoints. Granted, they're not really long enough to warrent them, and there is little downtime between dying and respawning. However, because of the aforementioned hitbox detection, death is very likely. And the power-ups you'll have collected (which amount to a series of slightly different projectile attacks), will be lost. There is a plus-side to this; the game autosaves at every level, keeping track of your lives total and power-ups when you enter a level. Hence, when you get a game over, you can restart the level with everything. However, this completely invalidates the point of having extra lives. If I die in a level and lose all my power-ups, why would I want to play the level without them, when I can just suicide until I get a Game Over and restart the level with my arsenal intact?\n\nI can't really say I can recommend 8BitBoy. I've not played it long, but the brief period I've spent trying it has been enough to dissuade me from ever playing it again. I would say the developer has their heart in the right place, but I feel they have more lessons still to learn from the classic platformers they clearly idolise. A solid attempt, but that is all.","October 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","0"

Still good with a Mario spirit.\n\nLonger: Although I'm by no means done, I'm already happy with my purchase of 8BitBoy. The creator posted on r/gaming about how happy he was that his game was greenlit, and the price was right for a game that looked decent. Thankfully, the game is as decent as it looks!\n\n8BitBoy is heavily inspired by the early Mario games, complete with floaty physics. They work just fine, although I would really like a WASD option for keyboard users such as myself. Not having that option is my biggest qualm with the game, since it's how I play every other computer platformer ever. I cannot report in on how it works with a controller as I do not have one.\n\nMy biggest praise for the game is how different types of enemies attack in different ways, and how exploration is a big focus of the game (even early on). I could see it being played in a meandering 100% completion style, and also speedrun. That's a big plus. Unfortunately, the enemies are also one of my causes for complaint -- they're rather fat, which makes them take up an awkward amount of space. This is a problem when they die, since they're not knocked off the screen like in Mario, but rather their bodies persist for a while. It makes the world feel unnecessarily cluttered in my opinion.\n\nI recommend this game for people who liked oldschool Mario, and/or who enjoy simple platformers with a lot of possible exploration.","May 8, 2014","true","0.8"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","0"

While the game unashamedly barrows from said title (not to mention a number of other classic platformers), 8-Bit Boy nonetheless manages to please. Ironically, it is because it harkens with such transparency back to many-an-old-school side-scroller that this title is such a surprising joy to play.\n\nThe controls are very good--much better, in fact, than many of the games from which it models itself. Level-design does not disappoint either; while simple, they are all just about the right length and offer some pretty rewarding treasures for those adventurous enough to explore all the nooks and crannies. In fact, once you have beaten the game, you are able to select any stage in order to collect anything you may have missed on your first path.\n\nThe difficulty gets kind of steep in places (I had to resist a rage-quit or two), but it is not so brutal that the challenges cannot be overcome with a little persistence. Keeping at this one and making progress turns out to be very rewarding, and the bosses are fun to tackle and put away.\n\nThe soundtrack, while not mind-blowing, is a notch above serviceable, making it plenty good for this sort of outing. The composer certainly succeeds in capturing the old-school tunes of yesteryear, which actually get to be rather catchy after awhile rather than annoying.\n\nGraphically, the game appears a "bit" archaic, but since every ingredient in 8-Bit Boy is designed to evoke late-80's gaming, they are perfectly suitable.\n\nI have returned to old games like Super Mario Bros., Mega Man, and Donkey Kong Country again and again. 8-Bit Boy is like any of these titles in the sense that it can be enjoyed more than once on account of it being well-designed, fun, and relatively short--especially once you get dialed back into the "twitch-thumb" playing you used to do while sitting in front of the old cathode ray tube, Nintendo controller in hands.\n\nSo if you have a hankering to revisit those crusty-old NES cartridges, you might want to grab this inexpensive game as an appetizer. You likely won't be disappointed.","February 27, 2015","true","7.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

You are missing out, my friend.\n\nI went into playing this with that exact attitude and I was so pleasantly surprised to find how well crafted this title is. Yes it is almost identical to Mario, but there are added features such as being able to shoot the bad guys with three different "stages" of boosts - Red, Green and Black.\n\nI found my self completed hooked as soon as I loaded it up. Each level can last between 2-5 minutes each, and will gradually get harder and harder.\n\nXbox controller again, works wonders and makes the whole experience that bit more enjoyable.\n\nThe game does over exaggerate a bit when it claims to have 16+ hours of levels to explore, I managed to clear the game in just under five hours. Still, I was not expecting it to take that long anyway!\n\nI highly recommend you pick this game up. It's so cheap, you would really need a good reason not too.

As can be seen, the game is a Mario clone, and a very bland one at that.  There's just no kind of personality or anything particularly memorable about it.  It also has sort of an identity crisis, with the name 8bitboy, but graphics more akin to SNES or Genesis, and music and SFX sounding like a blend of Game Boy and Game Gear.\n\nThe levels are all fairly uninteresting, with no real flow from one part to the next.  It's just one random platforming challenge after another, with no real theming or patterns to make the levels feel cohesive.  Not only that, but the level design also frequently feels cramped. This isn't likely to get you killed, but it still doesn't help the overall feel of the game.\n\nThe physics aren't too good either.  Running is incredibly loose and slippy, like everything is covered in ice.  In addition, your character's hitbox is smaller than his sprite.  This becomes a huge problem later when having to do jumps with pinpoint accuracy, especially when you add the slippery physics on top of it.\n\nShould you get this game?  If you can get it for under a dollar as part of a bundle of some sort and you really really need a Mario clone, then sure.  It probably won't hold your attention for long though, as their are much better games out there with a similar asking price.  From the boring level design, to the slippery controls, the game doesn't have much going for it.","November 2, 2014","false","0.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

It looked like a Mario clone and for the most part it is. The retro platforming aspect is here in full force, the puzzling element is thrown in and multiple ways to complete the level presents itself nicely. There is also much exploration and fun to be had.\n\nEach of it's five worlds consist of nine levels and a final boss level.  The backstory personally spoke to me as I could easily relate. The controls are out of the days of the Nintendo and C64. 2 buttons to control firing and jumping if you prefer and a directional pad to move around. For the most part the game performed and responding to my commands decently. I found a gamepad to be easier and more responsive then the keyboard.  Like in Mario and so many other platformers of that bygone era, you spend your time avoiding various enemies, collecting coins and bonus trinkets. Powerups are smartly scattered around the level, making you have to use your noggin as well as your trigger finger to get at them. There are also many secret areas enclosed within each level. Each level also contains a save token for you to find, once you do, you can continue the game from that level with whatever your current specs were when you found the token.\n\nThis game is not easy by any means. The programmer dares you to beat it and it is a challenge to do so. The difficulty levels are erratic and vary greatly even amongst same world levels. For example I found level 4-8 to be extremely difficult if not downright frustrating while level 4-9 was hard but enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this game but it brings me to the one fatal issue I am having with it. It has to do with the constant updates. This in itself, is an extremely good thing and the creator is repsonding to many ideas that players have had. That is where my problem lies. To me, this says this was a somewhat unfinished early access game in disguise. When I purchased this game many of the features that are being added were not included. I don't mind one or two updates to fix bugs, but aside from some bugs there are constantly features being added and I am not sure this game would warrant another playthrough to see them.  For example, speed running and warps were added when I was already upto world 5. All of this should have been implemented before a full program launch. Otherwise, it should have been labeled as early access which it clearly wasn't. If you are a fan of achievements, you should also know that they are not here as of this writing.\n\nStill, the constant additions aside, this is a fun game and well worth a $6 asking price. But if you are not a fan of early access, you might want to put this on your wishlist and hold off for a month or two so you can play a completed game.","June 11, 2014","true","27.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

They take me back to the days when I was a kid, sitting up late at night, trying to get through various incarnations of the genre in the early days of NES.  I've never claimed to be good at them, mind you, but I enjoy them a lot.\n\n8BitBoy didn't seem like much at first glance.  It came in a bundle, which means I was after something else in said bundle most likely, and 8BitBoy just came along for a ride.  One day I was digging through my library to find a cure for a sleepy Sunday afternoon, and I happened to catch the platformer tag when I scrolled across it.  I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a spin.\n\nThe first time through?  8BitBoy feels a bit off.  You go in expecting Mario, but the controls just aren't the same.  They're a bit more floaty, not quite as precise.  This will throw you off a bit, but press on.  As you dig a little deeper, you start get the hang of the controls and the game starts to feel more familar.  You're progressing through the maps, you're stomping on birds and making jumps.  Then there's that special moment when you're standing on a ledge and accidentally push the control into the wall, and you slip through and discover a secret room...and now 8BitBoy has its hooks in you!\n\n8BitBoy is a love song to those platformers of old.  You will notice elements of them all throughout.  While looking back so fondly, the game still manages to be its own beast.  It's hard.  Hell, it's very hard!  It's also packed full of secrets, warps to other zones, many many maps and more.

The music and graphics remind me of playing classic Pokemon and Super Mario games and the controls are very smooth (I recommend using a console controller). Full-clearing the levels is also very challenging (and rewarding if you are going for highscores) but it is not entirely necessary if you just want to beat the game. So if you're a gamer who likes to go for 100% on every level, good luck to you!

Go replay the same exact levels all over again and collect the coins you missed!"), and even the soundtrack is completely forgettable.\n\nThis is one of the most generic, forgettable, and frustrating platformers I have ever played.  It has no personality what-so-ever, nor does it do anything remotely interesting with its story or gameplay.  Even having died multiple times in some of the later levels, I still finished all 50 of them in about three hours.  And no, I didn't collect every special coin, nor will I.  The game wasn't nearly good or fun enough to warrant replaying the same levels I'd already beaten just to hunt for silly coins.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vermilicious/recommended/296910/","vermilicious","Vermilicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vermilicious/","324 products in account","Many people my age grew up with early gaming consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System. For me, and likely them, Super Mario was one of the big titles, starring a rather crude pixel representation of an italian plumber in his quest for saving a princess. These games defined the platform genre, and since then more such games have appeared - some good, others not so good. Recently there have been plenty of variants with relatively spectacular presentation, and some bullet-hell and death-trap variants which is a sort of different deal. On the classic retro-end, there hasn't been all that much. That, and combined with fairly interesting teasers, made this particular game appeal to me.\n\nSo, how does this retro experience fare? Since the game is so obviously inspired by old school games, comparing it to the likes of Super Mario is unavoidable. Considering the obvious technical advances in gaming over a couple of decades, one would expect that a well-performing 2D game would be fairly easy to create. Sadly, this game feels awkward and not up to par. In particular, it's hard to control the character properly, leading to a lot of frustrating, fatal incidences. Old games were really a challenge, but this one's just hard to play right. It's a sort of "fake" difficulty.\n\nVisually, the game is alright, if nothing amazing. The menu UI is rather poor when using a gamepad. The enemies are a bit on the easy side. The stages are full of secrets, which is nice, but other than that, not particularly difficult, but at sometimes very unforgiving. The soundtrack is very limited. When it comes to game mechanics, I haven't seen anything particularly innovative. The power-ups are fairly basic. The obstacles are very familiar. There isn't really a story, but there's an intro explaining how this guy ended up in the virtual world as the character in the game. There's not much to motivate you to press on.\n\nAs a platformer with an obvious inspiration from games of old, it falls short. It feels awkward and uninspiring. In sum, with the risk of not having seen quite enough of the game at the time of writing, a mediocre experience at best.\n\n2014-06-09: Switching to thumbs up and made a few changes. It has a way to go, but I have found it somewhat enjoyable. It's still frustrating at times though. The game is often updated, which is nice.","June 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Let me also state that this game is also very hard! I tried the hard difficulty and died like all the time so i played the easier one and lemme tell you its still hard!! Its scary when you jump to a platform not knowing if it will dissapear or jumping to a wall and go through it and think oh no I just died only to discover its a secret! Btw some of these secrets arent even safe. It may have a special coin but in order to get it you have to jump over enemies and spikes- hmmm risk my life fr that damn coin or come back later-yep im coming back later sowie coin lol. Enemies are easy to kill but they trick you-dont want to spoil their moves but lemme tell you that just because you think they wont hit you and think that you are safe-well you are not! I like the music especially world 4- reminds me of old school vid-game soundtracks! Theres also tons of collecting to find but to find those special coins is hard as heck because sometimes you have to be quick-or face dangerous situations and risk a life in order to get that coin! I will say I think the character can sometimes be kinda floaty when you run and jump- like hes landing on ice. Its makes your heart skip a beat thinking wow I almost fell in the pit! I do like the powers which there is 3 versions of and a shield! Gripe about the powers tho is that if you get hit once- you lose it- it be better if you got hit and lost the black suit and went to the green and then got hit again and went down to the red but I suppose that adds to the difficulty! Plus its harder to save on the hardmode version of the game as opposed to easy mode where it saves after every level which is welcomed because lives are hard to come by. I like this game tho and it takes me back to mario days of past! Stumbling into secrets and the cute music and figuring out the boss patterns is fun! It never gets to want to break laptops screen hard. I would highly recomend it if you like platformers- a challenge- are a collector junkie and just love nostalgia!

A look back in time to another generation of gaming.\n\nPresentation:\nLet me put this straight, you get what you ask for. The game in itself is not a grand game full of pretty graphic achivments and amazing and inuvative gameplay, it`s a throwback to another era of gaming and the game tells you that right form the begining.\n\nThe look sound and overall plot is really oldschool, and it would properly work better on me, if I was growing up in the oldschool era, but I didn`t. Instead I get to see another era of gaming, which I didn`t complain about. The game overall was a positive experince.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is very Marioesk and you jump on enemyes to kill them. You pick up a lot of fireball spells, in order to have extra hits just like Mario. The fireball spells are all basiclly the same, with only some bouncing to really set them apart.\n\nThe platforming which is the main focus of the game, is done rather well and I only had issues with it few times throughout the game. One of the bigger issues were the convatorbelts in the game, were you have to jump with momentum. I felt the controles were a bit off here, but when you learn the timing, you wont have much trouble with it afterwerds.\n\nCharecters:\nYou play as a boy, who is turned into a 8-bit charecter. It`s all in the titel!\n\nThere are really not some kind of bigger thing to the game, other than you just have to clear every area, which all have bird themed enemyes and bosses. All of thee charecters (including the main charecter) dosen`t really have eny charecter traids, other than in the intro of the game. Afterwards charecters don`t really matter, but I think it`s fitting for the generation of gaming, which this game trys to show. In this generation charecters were not that important, the game and gameplay itself were in focus.\n\nVisuels:\nThe game has an 8-bit style, and uses it to show very typical areas for the generation. This includes an ice level, a dessert level, a robot level etc. The visuels did not do much for me, but this game is a throwback, and everyone who should buy tihs would properly like the artstyle, since that is what the game is all about.\n\nSound/Music:\nThe soundeffects are few in this game, but again it was typicall for the era. The music is fine but nothing to write home about in my opinion. I liked some of the themes and they really set the tone of an 8-bit game.\n\nStory/Bosses:\nSo the story is simple; person get`s inside a game, and now he must fight himself through all the levels of the gam he is in. From there every level is themed after a typical level from the 8-bit era. At the end of every world a bossfight with a bird happens, and you get one step closer to the end.\n\nNow about the end...I did acually not see it. To cmplete the game fully, you have to go trough every single level, in order to find secrets to unlock the ending. Now I did not have the patience to go through the enterie game again, in order to unlock the true ending, but maybe you have more patience than me.\n\nOverall I fell a bit sad about never seeing the end of the game, since I kind of fell like I deserved it. I played every level of the game and yet got nothing out of it other than a screne pretty much telling me to go back.\n\nConclution:\n8-bitboy is a fun game and an amazing trowback to another generation of gaming. If you were bon in the NES era, you will properly apriciate this game more than I did. The game is very short, but you could argue that the game is not done, untill every secret is found, so there is your long game time.","February 26","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But that's kinda what I was expecting when I bought this so I can't say I'm disappointed. It is fun to play and I will recommend it for people who are fans of these type of basic old-school platform games. But if you're looking for an original, unique platform gaming experience then you won't find it here, not one bit.\n\nIt is harder than mario and there's probably a risk of going insane if you try to beat it on its difficult setting.

Not only is it incredibly fun and extremely reminiscent of the original 'Mario Bros' for Nintendo, but it's also tough as nails. Which brings up the age old question; is a platformer really that good if it never makes you contemplate smashing your controller? If you answered no to this question, then proceed to the checkout page for you are about to purchase this game.\n\nPerfectly timed jumps, relentless enemies, easily lost power-ups, and boss battles that continue to get harder; '8BitBoy' has everything that you would come to expect from a sidescroller and more. Which is hard to come by in a time where many games attempt to re-create a wonderful 8 bit experience, but end up falling flat in the end. In fact, '8BitBoy' feels like one gigantic homage to platformers in general, and playing through it you're sure to notice plenty of elements from the classics.\n\nNot only is this one of the best platformers out, but it's constantly being updated, so there's always something new to discover. If you're a fan of games like 'Super Meat Boy', 'Shovel Knight', or pretty much any platformer in general, this game is worth checking out a million times over. Here's hoping that '8BitBoy' gets a sequel sometime soon, but even if it doesn't, I'm sure I'll return to this one time and time again anyway. Happy jumping!","June 22, 2014","true","5.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I haven't 100% the game yet, but I doubt it'll take me another 14+ hours to do that.\n\nThe game is quite friendly up until the final world, then it starts being a bit more... pesky. A few too many "Oh, you missed one out of seven jumps, here's a pit of death." areas in that world. The rest is fine though.\n\nApparently there's a story in here as well. You're a 30 (I think) something guy, who misses the good old days of playing video games, so you go down into the basement to pick up your old Sega (I assume, due to one mention of Genesis later). You find a cartridge with no label, that doesn't look like it's ever been played, which is scary so obviously you have to play it. Plug it in, and boom, now you're a video game character. (Think Captain N, only slightly less cool.)\n\nFinally, is the game any good? Yeah, definitely. It was really fun, a really nice throwback game. If you like classic platformers, odds are you'll like this one. In my opinion definitely a throwback to some Atari and Amiga games, more than NES and Genesis/Mega Drive games. But that might just be because that's what I grew up with. :)\n\n\n\nEdit: It took a total of 6 hours to complete the game, mostly because of one secret that just didn't want to be found.","February 17, 2015","true","6.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I must say, when you think of retro platform based games, you think of the likes of Mario, and Mario, and then, Mario... This game lived up to that name. It was fun, challenging and overall, rage inducing! Personally, i think its best played with a controller of some kind, I felt extremely comfortable using the Xbox 360 controller and the button lay-out was well done. The game itself, it took me 11 hours fully complete the levels and to find all the hidden stars on each level, but you can't complete the story until you find all 50 stars, 1 per map, so that resulted in me running through all 50 levels again to finish the game. I was then going to run it on the 'EXTREME' difficulty, but the only difference is you have to collect the coins to save your game, instead of it saving after completion of each level, and you get slightly less time. Wasn't all that challenging. Despite that, I very much enjoyed playing this game and would recommend it. 9/10","June 15, 2015","true","12.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Its very obvious that this game was a work of love, created by someone who really enjoyed and understood what made the 8-bit platformers so much fun.\n\nI'm on world 4, and i'ts hard to describe in words how lovely and rare it is to find a game that makes one feel they picked up (for lack of a better word) an expansion pack to games they played in the 80s/90s. Yeah, I could go back and play those games, but being able to play a brand new game that embodies everything that made those games great is truely a special treat.\n\nIf their other games are any thing like this, I will be buy, in a heart beat, anything from Awesome Blade. Can't wait for more.\n\nEDIT2: I've noticed lots of people who down rate the game mentioning unreliable controls. I have not seen this issue on my computer at all. I've used xbox 360 wireless controller with a usb wireless adapter as well as keyboard. Both have worked excellent for me. One person mentioned that there controllers were acting screwy, but acted fine once they disabled some extraneous drivers on their computer. So I would say, if you are having issues with your controller, try a keyboard. Again, I didn't have any issues with my xbox 360 controller, but mileage may vary. I love this game !!! haha :D\nEDIT: My only warning is that this is a challenging game. I'm constantly reloading saves, but that is just my play style. I'm sitting on about 17 lives at the moment. What I do is I run through and let my self screw up a bunch, and find the best way to get to the end of the level. When I finally get to the end of the level and I only have 1-3 lives left, I reload the level so I have 17 lives, and run it until I reach the end of the level without dieing once. This can take several reloads, but its how I prefer to play.","July 17, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's questionable, the problem is it's awkward and doesn't seem to fit how you move. And there isn't any checkpoints, before you say i'm casual scum let me just say that some of the levels just drag on too long and there is extremely hard parts and trail and error ♥♥♥♥ going on. And sometimes the game just ♥♥♥♥s up. 5-7 theres a part when you jump and by some wierd voodoo magic you get propelled to the right overshooting your jump. Now from what i've seen on youtube nobody has even completed this game and i couldn't blame them, nobody can really put up with this much bull. I say buy it on sale, it's good while it lasts but don't expect to beat the game(as in get all 50 coins and get an ending)","June 29, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Its very obvious that this game was a work of love, created by someone who really enjoyed and understood what made the 8-bit platformers so much fun.\n\nI'm on world 4, and i'ts hard to describe in words how lovely and rare it is to find a game that makes one feel they picked up (for lack of a better word) an expansion pack to games they played in the 80s/90s. Yeah, I could go back and play those games, but being able to play a brand new game that embodies everything that made those games great is truely a special treat.\n\nIf their other games are any thing like this, I will be buy, in a heart beat, anything from Awesome Blade. Can't wait for more.\n\nEDIT2: I've noticed lots of people who down rate the game mentioning unreliable controls. I have not seen this issue on my computer at all. I've used xbox 360 wireless controller with a usb wireless adapter as well as keyboard. Both have worked excellent for me. One person mentioned that there controllers were acting screwy, but acted fine once they disabled some extraneous drivers on their computer. So I would say, if you are having issues with your controller, try a keyboard. Again, I didn't have any issues with my xbox 360 controller, but mileage may vary. I love this game !!! haha :D\nEDIT: My only warning is that this is a challenging game. I'm constantly reloading saves, but that is just my play style. I'm sitting on about 17 lives at the moment. What I do is I run through and let my self screw up a bunch, and find the best way to get to the end of the level. When I finally get to the end of the level and I only have 1-3 lives left, I reload the level so I have 17 lives, and run it until I reach the end of the level without dieing once. This can take several reloads, but its how I prefer to play.","July 17, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The reference about it being 8 Bit is a little to low of itself considering the game looks more like a 16/32bit game.  I was pretty excited about getting this game when it was being given away for free part of those little promotions that some gaming sites give away.  But there is some flaws of course and that is the controls are a bit off and at times you'll be falling into a hole or running into an enemy more then you'd like.  Will that make you stop playing the game... well i'm not quite sure for me I wanted to keep going just to see if I could finish this game off.\n\nI did and maybe its not like all your traditional platformers like Super Mario Bros. which this game tries to pull off.  This game is crazy hard do to the level design which I felt to be a bit horrible.  One of the levels the world fills with water while you have to jump from platform to platform to make sure you don't fall into it.  At the beginning of the level your first platform you have to jump on is just a tiny bit high and you have to make sure you can make the jump just right or you die.  I remember the first time I played the level it tooks me awhile to finally get up and complete the level.  There will be a lot of hit and misses in the game and you have to keep trying over and over again to make sure you can complete the level.\n\nThis is pretty much the part that makes you enjoy the game and I'm not 100% sure if that is a good thing or not but like I said you just want to beat the game.  For me I beat all the bosses and got to the end but its one of those games that if you want to see the good ending make sure you collect everything so you can.  The good thing though is that the map is completely unlocked and you can go back and collect what is missing and then go back to fight that final boss and possibly get that ending.\n\nFor me it was to much the game was already difficult enough for me to beat all the bosses I just said "i'm done" and moved on.  If you get that far you should be happy.  To this moment though I'm still thinking about collecting everything just to see that ending.  This game to me is playable there could be worse titles out there but it plays like other platformers but I just feel it being a little more difficult then your traditional that your used to playing.  The controls can suck and that is one big disappointment with the level design adding to it.  The graphics are nice and even though being quite difficult you'll fight your way through just to see if you can beat it.  Get this game if you have that will to fight through a hard game and if you don't this game isn't for you.","May 10","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I now will complete this game.\n\n***********UPDATED************\n\nAfter finally beating the game 100% (AKA all 50 coins on normal) I can honestly say this was an awesome game. There were levels where you died many, many times, so hopefully you have a strong controller and a full head of hair that you don't mind ripping out some.

The great thing however about this game compared to other newer retro titles is that instead of trying to emulate and clone the content it aspires to be, it makes its own improvements and feels like a new game. Crisp sprites, loads of awesome hidden content for those that want to find it, will make you want to  stretch the most out of your limited time on each level.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/androsphinx12/recommended/296910/","androsphinx12","AndroSphinx12","http://steamcommunity.com/id/androsphinx12/","621 products in account","I would reccomend this game if you like platformers like Mario. Some of the levels can be challenging and the boss fights at the end of each world become more challenging the farther you get into the game. The description says 16+ hours for the story I technically only delved straight to the level and world completion and not other aspects per level and once I beat the last world I had clocked in 7hr50min. I loved finding secret areas some of them caught me off guard and I was like no way could have sworn I was going to die. All in all I think once I go back and try to get everything in the game I will be at 20-30+ hours on record for Steam.\n\nPros:\nGood platforming challenges.\nHas a decent pace to each level did't feel rushed.\nNice boss fights with different mechanics per fight.\nGood progression of difficulty per world from level to level but doesnt hold your hand.\nController Support I love games that have controller support especially ones I don't have to rebind the keys.\n\nCons:\nI think the only issue I had which is very small was the music felt repetative(Like it was re-used level to level) and to be honest it isn't bad thing just some of the beats are stuck in my head haha.\nAnother thing that I would like to see in this game is achievements.\n\nAll in all I think the game was well designed and I appreciate the developer updating as much as they can to make sure you don't have preformance issues. For $4.00 you really can't say 16-30+ hours of gameplay isnt worth it alot of AAA titles that come out now are $60.00 and only last half the time. If the game goes on sale there should be no reason you don't purchase the game.","February 16, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game doesn't do that, and that is the main reason I am writing it this positive review!\n\nThe art style is nice with just a few modern touches to remind you that it isn't actually on an old system!\n\nOverall, very pleased - I bought it for only about 40p but if I'd known I would enjoy it this much I'd happily have paid a bit more as it's a solid title :)\n\nGood stuff!","December 12, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Easy controls but secrets everywhere.\n- A save system!\n\nThe bad parts:\n- Hard.\n- Nothing that's not been done over a million times already.\n- Remember the frustration when dying and losing your upgrades/items/stuff? Be prepared to experience it again and again.\n\nThe conclusion:\nHonestly, the frustration got to me. I have gotten older and time has become a luxury. So, sorry, 8BitBoy, It was fun while it lasted. Lastly, gamepad recommended over mouse & keyboard.

Background music is mediocre though\n- Great artstyle = Colourful and reminds me of the super nintendo days...\n- Great Gameplay = Similar to 2D mario you need to reach the other side, whilst platforming and stomping on enemies along the way.\n- Secret areas = Lots of secret areas within levels with extra coins or power ups.\n- 5 stages with dozens of levels each\n- Power ups = There are 3: Red, green and black which change your projectiles\n- Boss fights = At the end of each stage\n- Items = Like the shield which protects you from one attack\n- Wide enemy variety = You will face birds, snakes, bats and different variations of them as you progress through each stage.\n\nCons\n- No checkpoints within levels = Each death causes you to respawn at the begining of the level.\n- LImited story = Basically you play as a guy who got sucked into your old game console and now has to get through the levels via platforming. Not really told during gameplay either.\n- Water trap = Wished  it was red (like lava) and didn't kill you instantly when you touch it.\n- Fidgety controls = Found it difficult to sprint in certain areas and kept falling off ledges.\n- Limited item variety\n\n\nIf your looking for a good 2D mario-like platformer game, this game is for you.","September 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mario.\n\n\n8 Bit Boy is a 2D platforming game developed by AwesomeBlade.\n\nPositives\n- Runs at 60 FPS\n- SFX = Reminds me of 2D mario games, especially the jumping sounds. Background music is mediocre though\n- Great artstyle = Colourful and reminds me of the super nintendo days...\n- Great Gameplay = Similar to 2D mario you need to reach the other side, whilst platforming and stomping on enemies along the way.\n- Secret areas = Lots of secret areas within levels with extra coins or power ups.\n- 5 stages with dozens of levels each\n- Power ups = There are 3: Red, green and black which change your projectiles\n- Boss fights = At the end of each stage\n- Items = Like the shield which protects you from one attack\n- Wide enemy variety = You will face birds, snakes, bats and different variations of them as you progress through each stage.\n\nCons\n- No checkpoints within levels = Each death causes you to respawn at the begining of the level.\n- LImited story = Basically you play as a guy who got sucked into your old game console and now has to get through the levels via platforming. Not really told during gameplay either.\n- Water trap = Wished  it was red (like lava) and didn't kill you instantly when you touch it.\n- Fidgety controls = Found it difficult to sprint in certain areas and kept falling off ledges.\n- Limited item variety\n\n\nIf your looking for a good 2D mario-like platformer game, this game is for you.","September 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I mean early.\nThis is no beefed up rosy eyed retro remake.\nThe game runs fairly sedately relying more on good level design than trying to simply overwhelm the player.\nThe resolution is low but still feels right. The sound has that ad-lib feel of the early PC gaming days when shareware would have been the only source for this. Unless of course you owned a certain console featuring a certain italian plumber.\nThose are the plus points. One of the few criticisms I can make is that the levels are a bit short.\nThat aside we're talking about a very keen price and a 90mb download so essentially it is still well worth the money.

I have no idea how it works, but all I had to do was to unzip the contents into the game's directory, and it recognized my joystick. So +1 in fact for the fact that this is similar to many older games, in that you often had to scratch your head at least once to get them to install properly. But keyboard input is also just fine.\n\nAlright with that out of the way, I found that this game is well worth the price of four dollars, but you can see by my saying that that it's really not that exciting of a game. I would almost say it's better for children, but I believe the original classics are all around a better choice.\n\nThe market is disgustingly lacking in simple retro platformers. Almost all of them feel rushed or just simply lack that charming excellence of Mario 3 or Sonic. This one feels sort of like the graphics are over-done, and the gameplay is under-done. But, it has that sense of individuality and experimentation. The first boss level which simply entailed a big ballonish bird kind of let me know it's no Commander Keen.","November 13, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So you might say that he got sucked into his own parallel 8-bit world.\n\nThe game’s vital statistics are:\n8-16 hours main story!\n· 56 Levels + huge 5 Worlds\n· 300+ Hidden Locations!\n· Hidden Warp zones!\n· Coin collecting game + tons of Power-Ups\n· Boss-battles\n· 60 fps frame rate (GPU dependent)\n· Frequently updated with new content\nAppropriate for all ages\n\nI managed to complete the game in about 5 hours, over all I have to be honest I found the game good fun but difficult to play as normally I use WASD instead of the arrow keys and my hand wasn’t used to the strain.\n\nYears ago when I started playing games all of them used the arrow keys and I suspect that I would've completed the game much quicker as a boy used to playing this style of game.\n\nI know what you’re thinking why didnt I just connect a joypad or xbox controller to my PC and use that, well the thought only crossed my mind when my Right hand started to get painfull.\n\n\nSo the Pro’s of the game are:\n\nThe game is reminiscent of the classic games i grew up with and because of that it was irritatingly fun to play.\n\nCurrently we are on build 1.5.3 and I hear that the game is regularly updated with bug fixes and content\n\nI really enjoyed stomping on characters that looked like roxio’s popular game angry birds as I’ve had many frustrating hour on that too.\n\nThe cons\n\nI feel that the younger generations may bypass this game altogether as it sparks very little emotional attachment to this era of gaming if you’re not from it or don’t remember it.\n\nI don’t really develop any feeling of who the enemies are in the game and why i'm stomping on them     just that I have to in order to get by\n\nOnce you get through the game I feel like there is little point in going back and completing all the little extras but hey i'm not the completest that some are.\n\n\n\nSo overall I generally enjoyed the game It made me think of all the games I should of played in the early 90’s and the games I failed to complete, it reminded me of why we all hung out at arcades back in the day\n\nBut it also reminded me of what we’ve got and how powerful our computers are and how awesome the games we have today have become.\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen to me and my review I will upload the rest of the gameplay in the next few days and you can make your own mind up on the game.\n\n","September 20, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So you might say that he got sucked into his own parallel 8-bit world.\n\nThe game’s vital statistics are:\n8-16 hours main story!\n· 56 Levels + huge 5 Worlds\n· 300+ Hidden Locations!\n· Hidden Warp zones!\n· Coin collecting game + tons of Power-Ups\n· Boss-battles\n· 60 fps frame rate (GPU dependent)\n· Frequently updated with new content\nAppropriate for all ages\n\nI managed to complete the game in about 5 hours, over all I have to be honest I found the game good fun but difficult to play as normally I use WASD instead of the arrow keys and my hand wasn’t used to the strain.\n\nYears ago when I started playing games all of them used the arrow keys and I suspect that I would've completed the game much quicker as a boy used to playing this style of game.\n\nI know what you’re thinking why didnt I just connect a joypad or xbox controller to my PC and use that, well the thought only crossed my mind when my Right hand started to get painfull.\n\n\nSo the Pro’s of the game are:\n\nThe game is reminiscent of the classic games i grew up with and because of that it was irritatingly fun to play.\n\nCurrently we are on build 1.5.3 and I hear that the game is regularly updated with bug fixes and content\n\nI really enjoyed stomping on characters that looked like roxio’s popular game angry birds as I’ve had many frustrating hour on that too.\n\nThe cons\n\nI feel that the younger generations may bypass this game altogether as it sparks very little emotional attachment to this era of gaming if you’re not from it or don’t remember it.\n\nI don’t really develop any feeling of who the enemies are in the game and why i'm stomping on them     just that I have to in order to get by\n\nOnce you get through the game I feel like there is little point in going back and completing all the little extras but hey i'm not the completest that some are.\n\n\n\nSo overall I generally enjoyed the game It made me think of all the games I should of played in the early 90’s and the games I failed to complete, it reminded me of why we all hung out at arcades back in the day\n\nBut it also reminded me of what we’ve got and how powerful our computers are and how awesome the games we have today have become.\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen to me and my review I will upload the rest of the gameplay in the next few days and you can make your own mind up on the game.\n\n","September 20, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

From huge levels with multiple routes to fun powerups, this title does a good job of saluting bygone greats while remaining an enjoyable game on its own.

In fact, even the character looks like Mario.\n\nBesides, the character looking like Mario, the gameplay is also very similar to Super Mario Brothers. In 8BitBoy, the character breaks blocks with its head, collect coins, jump on enemies and even shoot fireballs.\n\nThe game world also feels very much like Super Mario Brothers. Even some of the sounds are very similar, if not exactly the same, as those in Super Mario Brothers.\n\nI know, this review is for 8BitBoy but, unfortunately, the game just reminds me of Super Mario Brothers every time I look at it, every time I see it and every time I play it.\n\nOverall, I think 8BitBoy is a good game to get specially if you are into old-school retro-style platform games. It has that 80's look and feel, it's easy to play and it has a lot of secrets for you to discover.\n\nWith that said, my rating for 8BitBoy for this review is a very positive 7 out of 10. It's not perfect and it didn't blow me away but I enjoyed playing it.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0uTrIkXgSk","July 14, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It does what it says on the tin, which in this case is '8-Bit Platformer'. Admittedly it's an 8-Bit STYLE platformer, and the things it does well are not what makes it stand out.\n\nThis is - put simply - a polished platformer. My one and only complaint (which is rather a big one, thinking about it) - is the ending...\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nThe game gives you the option of choosing between two difficulties at the beginning, so - I plumped for the more casual setting, as I wanted to enjoy the game in a relaxed manner. One of the extras you must complete in the 'Hard' difficulty, is to obtain a hidden coin in each level before you can progress (and it turns auto save off, so... I guess you just do it yourself..?\n\nAnyway - come to the end of the game on casual mode, and the game informs me after the final boss that I need to go back and collect all the hidden coins before I can get the ending.\n\nNO EXCUSES, AWFUL GAME MECHANIC RIGHT THERE. I have no desire whatsoever to repeat each level and find a coin for some arbitrary reason (the button that takes me home needs power! Feed it coins to activate it!).\n\n[/spoiler alert]\n\nSo, with that in mind, I still recommend the game, since it was fun to play, but that ending does need tidying up, for I was not rewarded whatsoever for my effort, and have been turned off ever wishing to try. Maybe one day...\n\nNEW PLAYERS: PICK THE HARD MODE OR FACE CRUSHING DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\nI have produced a video series on this game, so - decide for yourself! (I even found no less than three of the hidden warp-zones, pretty pointless though, given my spoiler text!).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCwZpiJ0wAk","April 12, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

She had been looking for ages upon years and was no closer to the capture of her quarrying.\n\n"It has been many months why have you not found Osama Bin Laden?" Asked Joseph Bradley with frustration.\n\n"I am trying but it is hard. He hides from justice like moon hides from the sun." Maya responded with exasperation tears.\n\n"You must keep on the hunt and be ready for the pounce, America needs you." Said Joseph Bradley as he walked out.\n\n"Where are you Osama Bin Laden?!" Cried out Maya with fist raised to sky.\n\nMaya traveled all over world to but was no closer to the villain. She traveled to lands of desert and sand like Pakistan and Afghanistan but it was no use. Full of exhaustion and depression she went back to room to sleep.\n\n"It is no use I am useless." Said Maya as she cried herself to slumber tears. In her dreams of sleeping agony Osama Bin Laden was running from her but she could not capture. He was giggling like school girl and ducking in rabbit holes.\n\n"Heehee you cannot catch me." Said Osama Bin Laden as he leaped into rabbit hole. Maya jumped in after him and stumbled into twisting tunnel of spiraling chaos. When sliding finally ended she found herself in room at last cornering Osama Bin Laden.\n\n"Hoohooheehee." Said Osama Bin Laden as he split into 20 Osama Bin Ladens!\n\n"Nooooo." Cried out Maya in panic. Maya could not tell which Osama Bin Laden was Osama Bin Laden and her body filled with distraught. Then with suddenness Orange figure filled with manly presence appeared and breathed fire on the Osama Bin Ladens burning them all to cinder. After Osama Bin Laden burning, the figure of mystery stared at Maya with eyes of fiery fury. After looking, the figure disappeared into sunset and Maya woke up in her room. She was covered with sweating and was trembling at power she had witnessed.\n\n"Who was that awesome power and what could this mean?" Thought Maya to herself as she shook with amazement.\n\nAs Maya sat in thoughtfulness on her bed she heard phone ring with alarming.\n\n"Hello this is Maya who is talking?" Asked Maya with questions as she answered the phone.\n\n"This is Leon Panetta of the CIA we need you to come to CIA Headquarters right now for update." Answered the voice with authority.\n\n"Ok sir I am on my way." Responded Maya with obedience.\n\nMaya flew to Washington DC USA and walked into CIA building with anxiousness. She was full of nerves since for all of her searching she was no closer to the founding. Inside she went to the elevator and hit on the button for CIA Headquarters. When she arrived at CIA Headquarters Leon Panetta and Joseph Bradley were sitting at table awaiting reports.\n\n"Well Ms. Maya what is your status, have you found the fiend?" Asked Leon Panetta with inquisition.\n\n"Yes surely you must have succeeded after all this time only a total failure would have nothing." Scolded Joseph Bradley with jeering.\n\nMaya looked down at her feet and tears fell from her eyes like drops of sadness from pools of regret.\n\n"I AM A FAILURE." Cried out Maya as she collapsed on her knees.\n\n"If top notch CIA agent Maya can not find Osama Bin Laden than all hope is truly lost." Said Leon Panetta with sad resignation.\n\nThen in the hour of dire despair when all hope was gone to death and dust, a figure of awesome power burst through wall riding a Custom Harley Davidson Motorcycle and wearing cool poncho with lasagna insignia while Scorpions "Rock you like a Hurricane" played for all to hear. The figures eyes burned like searing orbs of roaring lasagna.\n\n"GARFIELD?!" Cried out Leon Panetta and Joseph Bradley in unison.\n\nMaya looked on in amazement wonder for it was the mysterious figure of her dreams.\n\n"Who is this marvel man?" Thought Maya as she stared at him.\n\n"I am here in country of America land of freedom yet I am hearing the whines of babies." Said Garfield with disgust.\n\n"But we are lost of hope. Osama Bin Laden will never be found we have looked everywhere." Cried Joseph Bradley with whimpering.\n\n"It is true it is impossible. I have looked world over with CIA expertise, no one can find him." Said Maya with doubting words.\n\n"Fools. I will find this Osama Bin Laden and bring justice to him like justice has never been brought." Garfield roared with knowing.\n\n"But you cannot you are not CIA super agent! Osama Bin Laden can be everywhere!" Protested Maya with defiance.\n\nGarfield stepped off Motorcycle with his masculine feet and walked over to model globe in the corner with strut of cool confidence. Garfield spun the globe and then stopped it with one finger.\n\n"OSAMA BIN LADEN IS THERE." Declared Garfield with his finger on the globe.\n\n"Of course." Said Leon Panetta in awe of Garfield.\n\n"Now that the prey is found it is time for the hunting to begin." Garfield said as he loaded his Desert Eagle for justice dispensing.\n\n"Garfield wait you will need Seal Team Six." Cautioned Leon Panetta with wary words.\n\n"This is my Seal Team Six." Garfield replied pointing to his toned abs.\n\nLeon Panetta and Joseph Bradley nodded in agreement and examined with envy while Maya admired Garfield's toned body with careful inspection.\n\n"Will you need anything Garfield? Entire treasury of the USA is at your disposal." Informed Leon Panetta with offers.\n\n"I will need Bachelor Pad Villa and weekend's worth of lasagna and refreshments. Before I am finding deviants for destruction I am going to be having one hell of a bash." Garfield replied with righteousness.\n\n"Sir this is most out of ordinary and can not be allowed!" Protested Maya in defiance.\n\n"Very well Garfield it will be done." Agreed Leon Panetta with wisdom.\n\n"That is more like it. Now if you are excusing me I have party to attend to," Garfield said as he began to walk out. Before Garfield left he turned to Maya and looked her up and down with approval. "Hey there my spicy spy. Why don't you come by later to see what life in the fast lane is all about." Garfield said with a wink.\n\n"Why you..!" Gasped Maya with appalling.\n\n"Think about it my CoveOps cutie." Garfield Replied with flirting as he handed Maya his address and walked out of room.\n\n"Sir we our professionals we cannot allow this recklessness! This is against all rules!" Maya said with insistence.\n\n"Garfield does not live by our rules. He follows a higher code." Leon Panetta informed with truth.\n\n"A real man like that respects only the law of lasagna and steel." Said Joseph Bradley with humble respect of Garfield.\n\nMaya shook her head in disbelief and left office in disgust.\n\n"One day she will understand." Leon Panetta Said with wise words.\n\nMaya was driving home in her car with angry steering. She could not believe the galling words that entered her ears that day. She was cool calm professional woman and had no patience for the manly boldness of Garfield. Although filled with the anger she could not stop thinking about his rugged manliness and was fascinated by him. She decided to go to his Bachelor Pad Villa and confront him with her thoughts.\n\n"I must find what makes the man tick." Thought Maya as she drove with agility to Garfield's Bachelor Pad Villa.\n\nOn arrival at Garfield's Bachelor Pad Villa she saw sight of splendor. Cool music was playing as hot ladies in bikinis were all around sipping champagne and eating fine lasagna. All around were decorations of highest cost. Exotic Erotic Art and Palm trees were all around for mood making. In courtyard Maya saw Garfield lounging by poolside with hot sexy ladies all around. Garfield was smoking lasagna cigarette as sexy bikini ladies rubbed suntan oil on his shirtless body. Garfield saw Maya approach and interest peaked at sight of new sexy lady.\n\n"Hey there my fiery fox I am glad to see you showed up." Garfield said with suaveness.\n\n"Do not be getting your hopes up. I am only here for discussion." Responded Maya with rebuffing.\n\n"Very well chicky baby, ask away."

Throw it again without moving, goes on a completely different path.)\n-Tries to be 8-bit, but instead produces 16-bit graphics.\n-Auto-walks into the tutorial and forcing users into it.

Makes me wonder why in the world I am. i can Run CSGO and other games like that just find. But on a platformer? One with not that great of graphics either? Obviously is something wrong with the game itself. It is fun I will have to admit. THERE IS CONTROLLER SUPPORT. If there wasnt, i honestly wouldnt have this much time on it as i do now. A platformer like mario, without controller support is not worth it at all. So thank you Dev for making that possible. Even though theres only a need for 2 buttons and a Directional Pad. Good job there Dev\n\nI immediatly noticed the frame drop though. THis is obviously something within the program that you are using, or the build of the game, so it would be nice to actually play the game with more frames then the old nintendo itself :O\n\nOther then that the games pretty Decent. The monsters are nice, the music is nice, and everyhing else is good too. When using a controller though, adjust it so the speed at witch you move the cursor at the main menu is faster, seems very slow.\n\nThe game is nice, worth whatever price i paid during the holiday sale.

Much like Giana Sisters back in the day, it's obvious where the inspiration came from - but something feels really off and the result is a bit rubbish. While it reminds me of Mario, the physics and responsiveness of the controls aren't quite the same - making 8BitBoy feel more floaty and less responsive than it should be. 8BitBoys hitbox is kinda big and occasionally I spotted hitdetection issues which somehow seem to be a common problem with all of these modern indie-retrogames. This behaviour combined with somewhat weird physics can turn some stages and especially the bossfights into real nightmares.\n\nFor whatever reason the game plays out Super Mario Bros. 1 style the first time around (all levels have to be completed in a row) before unlocking a World Map after beating the final boss, allowing you to revisit levels and look for collectibles that will unlock the true ending. The big problem here is that you can easily screw yourself over the first time around, entering certain stages "naked" - and making things a lot harder for yourself. This wouldn't be such a big deal if I was allowed to go to the world map, grab a power up or two or go back to an earlier stage or whatever.\n\nBe prepared for frustration as you enter death-loops until you find that room with enough coins to grant you a power-up or an item to up your chances for survival (you can always "git gud" as well ;)). Should you be stuck on a boss, have fun re-watching the boss intro each time as well as seeing the completely pointless continue-screen every couple of lives - (5-B in particular made me really mad). It really doesn't seem like much thought has been put into these aspects and they hurt the game - since you can't go anywhere else or stock up on items, frustration might happen.\n\nOn the plus-side, the levels aren't too bad in a late 80ies kind of way with lots of hidden areas and warpzones all around.   Pretty fair and easy for the most part, had like two or three levels where I struggled for a bit but the rest was pretty easy (didn't care going for collectables though, I hate that kind of stuff - rushing through the 50 levels took me a bit over 2 hours). 8BitBoy isn't complete trash, but could use a bit more polish here and there, especially in the "precision platforming"-department. Personally, I'd rather play an actual game from the era that 8BitBoy is mimicking than 8BitBoy itself.","January 3","false","2.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","3"

When you die, there's too much delay in restarting, especially with bosses. Actually I stopped playing the game in world 4 boss because it takes way too much time to learn to avoid any mistake.\n\nIf you need yet another platformer that is not bad, then give this ago. But not near the league of Rayman Legends, or even too-simple-for-my-taste New Super Mario Bros series.","July 2, 2014","false","4.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Banzatou/recommended/296910/","Banzatou","Banzatou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Banzatou/","157 products in account","UPDATE (november 20, 2014)\n\nSo I'm giving this review another go, seeing as to how I've been trying a whole lot more platformers since my last review, which sounded very unforgiving.\n\nUnfortunately, my statement still stands that I can't recommend this game to anyone I know.\n\nLast time I reviewed this, I couldn't exactly put my finger as to why I couldn't get into this. I wondered if my bar of expectation was too high, especially since this game had a nice percentage of positive reviews from the community, and that I just expect too much from indie platformers.\n\nBut after playing games like  "You Have to Win the Game", as well as the more well-known "Super Meat Boy", I can safely say this game is too dragged out, punishing you for mistakes harsher than it should.\n\nI understand that half the fun and adventure comes from learning your own mistakes, but as you progress, the zones get longer and harder. And personally, the zones get too long for me to even quickly remember what I've done wrong on my second try on that zone. Sometimes, the game just punishes you for not even being psychic.\n\nHonestly, how was I supposed to know I need to jump onto a safety block after going through 3 conveyor belts and onto a deteriorating platform?\n\nHow was I supposed to know I'm not supposed to hyper dash on conveyor belts, and my jump was going to be no higher than if I tried to blast off my seat with my fart??\n\nAnd how was I supposed to know that my invincibility frames after getting hit was as small as my mom's height!? What the ♥♥♥♥!\n\nI really tried to like this game. But with the lack of checkpoints, there's no point in having a live count. You're better off reloading your save with all your power ups intact before you get mauled by another set of fat quails.\n\nAnd because there's lack of music variety, it just makes the game all that more frustrating. Yes, I have the option to turn off the music, but why am I going to change a feature that obviously was meant to be there by default?\n\nThe game is supposed to be played with said settings intact.\nSo I play it.\n\nAnd I hate it.\n\nThe beginning first world is fun, I'll give this game that much of credit.\nBut after going through 8 zones and a boss zone, you already feel worn out.\n\nAnd then you go through another 4 worlds with 9 more zones each?\nAnd the game says you're not done yet when you reach the end, and you have to go through all 5 worlds again to collect coins just to get that ending??\n\nI can't do that, especially when I know that I can die at any point. And if I don't learn fast enough, then I have to start that zone all over again. And if I exhaust all of my lives, then I get that unsatisfying boss/gameover music with a bull skull above my ahead, as if it's mocking me.\n\nUnless the game is supposed to be Dark Souls, I don't like being treated an idiot.\n\nThat said, I can't give a thumbs up to this Mario clone.\nIf you want to try some platformers worth your time, try the ones I've mentioned above.\n\nA game should feel rewarding when you reach the end, not frustrated that you must go back to collect 50 not-so-obviously-placed achievement coins.\n\nBut...don't take my word for it.\n\nThere's a good portion of people in this community that love this game to bits, and while I have the hardest time understanding why, I'm not one to give a death sentence to a game just because I hate it.\n\nIf you love this game, then kudos. Perhaps the $4 retail value is good enough for you. I would personally wait for a sale before buying.\n\nAnd if you didn't like my review by the end of this (which by the way, thank you fo reading this long essay of mine) then that's fine too. I just don't know anyone personally that has the patience to play this game from start to finish.\n\nAnd to the game developer: If my words hold any value to you, then all I can say is please make the zones shorter, or at least cut the amount of zones in each world by half, and please add checkpoints to the game. It would make the game more fun for people like me if you did that, and would actually add value to the lives count system.\n\nThank you for your time in reading this, and I hope this helps give you some more insight to this game before buying.","October 26, 2014","false","3.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

In addition to that, there's also a special token you can find in each of the levels ala collecting star coins in NSMB, and that really opens up the game for exploration giving it more play time.

I really can't find any serious faults with this other than, in my personal opinion, there isn't enough of it. I would LOVE to see some added DLC for this. It's probably one of my favorite indie games, and it is definitely my favorite indie platformer.\n\nIt comes equipped with a full dose of wonderful nostalgia for anyone that grew up playing "old-school" platformers like the Mario games, and it's got some wonderful things borrowed in tribute from others, as well as a few touches that are all this game on its own.\n\nHighly recommended, especially for the price. Even if this was a ten dollar game I'd recommend it. It's a gem, and it deserves much more attention than it has gotten so far.\n\nOne last thing. While this game does have full controller support, it's just as playable with a keyboard. So if you don't have a controller that isn't an excuse to not pick this up.

But that's not exactly a compliment. What I mean is, the controls are a bit clunky for a platformer, but once you get used to them the game is not half bad, considering I got it for $0.16 in those Steam auctions. I decided to finish it and review it anyway.\n\nUnfortunately the game is backwards! The first world is not really engaging, the sound track chiptune eats away at your brain and the first boss is unnecessarily frustrating. Admittedly the game does get better as you play in to it, as I will explain in detail in a second, but I have to ask why... why not engage the players early? Oh well. Probably why it was $0.16. I'll get all the bad things out of the way first.. but where do I start? Ok, let's start with probably my biggest peeve, the "secret" areas. I put secret in quotation marks because well they aren't really that secret. They're ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere! There are probably 5 or so secrets per level, 8 levels per world, 5 worlds. That's a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of secret areas, you kinda get tired of them after a little while. Mainly because the rewards in them are often petty or you are forced to risk your life or fight a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of enemies to get to a chance of a good reward. Yeah ♥♥♥♥ that. I learnt quickly to skip the secrets. But sometimes you can't skip them! There were times where you see a ledge, and you jump, and then, ohhh ♥♥♥♥ invisible wall - you're dead. Mother ♥♥♥♥er..\n\nWhat next? The bugs? After collecting a token and entering a secret world where sprint is disabled, when you get back to the main game, sprinting and shooting is still disabled. You have to quit the game and re-open your save file to be able to do it again. How did they miss that? Actually it kinda made the game more fun and challenging the first time it happened. I thought it was intentional, and played the level without shooting. It made me realize that the power-ups are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and overpowered. There's also a few collision detection bugs, which you do NOT want in a platformer. There were times where things did not even touch me, but they still killed me. Other times where I quite literally dodged a bullet, because the bullet hitboxes are so tiny, they can sometimes pass right through you and not hurt you. In parts where you aren't meant to control your character, you can still press the down and left key, making your character moonwalk or butt-slide. Not game breaking, more humorous actually.\n\nArtwork! Now this is gonna be a bit of a mixed answer. I loved and hated it. I loved the art style on the enemies and some parts of the map, they were really detailed. However, other parts of the map objects and the main character sprite were really lacking. They looked a bit rushed. If you take a look at this video I made of the world 5 boss fight you can see what I mean. The boss is really detailed but some other things like the player, the flag, the user interface are really poorly done. They just don't sit well next to each other and just give the overall look of it being put together a bit quickly. Some improvement here and with the clunky gameplay would have really improved this game substantially.\n\nAlright, better talk about some things that were enjoyable. A lot of the mechanics were ♥♥♥♥ing god awful like the inverse Mario style blocks that broke when you jump on them or cactus enemies that hide behind other cacti so you can't see them. They're also introduced so ♥♥♥♥ing poorly, you don't even know it's coming - it just hits you. You are meant to let players learn new ♥♥♥♥ before just throwing it at them! ♥♥♥♥! Ok, meant to be saying nice things. Some mechanics were cool.. I was really impressed with the sinking sand in world 2. I actually really liked where they took that. I was actually thinking "hey they should have a level where you race the sinking sand" and lo and behold, 2 levels later they did it! The snow world was a bit cooler too. Lots of new stuff implemented here, the guys throwing the snow balls were pretty cool, although if you had max power ups you could wreck them pretty easily. The boss fights got more fun as the game progressed too, which was nice because I nearly quit the ♥♥♥♥ing game after World 2's boss fight cause it was so infuriating.. The map design in the final world was really fun in a not-too-easy but still challenging way.Where the rest of the game was either easy, or ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Last world was right in the middle. This may have been because I was slowly getting used to the awkward controls, but hey, that's old school game progression for you, right?\n\nOverall verdict - it was worth what I paid? I guess?","April 14, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For full review, please look below.\n\n8BitBoy is a 'retro' style game created to pay homage to the old 8bit platformers of yester-century.  Sound good? There are quite a few problems I have with this game:\n\n- By all means, pay homage to your childhood games. However, there's a line where paying homage turns into gameplay plagiarism/copying. And sadly. 8BitBoy crossed that line. The similarities to Mario are just way too much for this game to be enjoyable. Every level in this game made me feel like I've played it before - and I have.. on a better game.\n\n- 8BitBoy promises to bring nostalgia galore from the NES era with an 8Bit classic game. Oh wait... is it 8Bit? Hell no, the graphics more resemble a 16 video game and the colour palette is definitely not something out of the NES. It would really help to make your game 8 Bit if your game is called '8BitBoy'!.\n\n- The music is... okay. It does a decent job on providing a 16 bit (cough, cough) experience to the game. However, the sound effects are nothing short but painful. If you intent to play this, do not play with headphones unless you happen to like the smell of blood dropping out of your eyes.\n\n- The game.. well it lacks 'fun'. The controls are awkward, mapping the run button to the fire button was NOT a good idea. The hitboxes are off and the game leaves you wanted a better made, finished game rather than an uninspired mess.    I do not enjoy playing this game - it doesn't entertain me. That is not a good recipe for a video game.\n\n\nSo what then? What do I play, may you ask?\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/250760/\nThat's called Shovel Knight. It's a homage to old NES era platformers while bringing something inspiring and new to the table. I think Polygon put it best.\n\n"Shovel Knight is so much more than a love letter to the genre — it is, in fact, the kind of game people write love letters about." - Polygon\n\nAnd that's what 8BitBoy isn't. 8BitBoy is an unfinished love letter with terrible grammar - with classic lines as 'I wuv you' - and includes terrible references to other famous love letters but gets the references wrong every single time.\n\nI think that's how I'll leave this game. It's a 'terrible love letter' to retro gaming.\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E-46yHzkxg/","March 31","false","0.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","1"

It took me 3 months to consider this as good or bad and unfortunately, I cannot post a mixed review.\n\nGot this for free off of PC Gamer and was intrigued by the name.  "8bitboy".   I instantly got it, but grew pale when I saw "No Steam Achievements"....another game would taint my library...gathering dust due to the lack of incentive to play the game.   But the name kept intriguing me, whispering in my ear.  "8 bit....8 bit..."\n\nMuch like our depressing hero, I decided “what the hell” and booted it up.  I was instantly met with the hero of our story, a depressing individual who seems to be on the verge of suicide (sadly, his life seems similar to that of some real people with some feelings of self-disappointment we feel from time to time)…the music doesn’t help this mood either as the player gets the vibe that this guy really will kill himself.   After plugging in a mysterious game into his console, he’s teleported to a videogame world.  This begins our tale of this Mario/Giana Sisters game.\n\n\nPROS:\nGreat message for a true ending  (  What a great feeling it is to do something because you want to.  Believing in yourself gives your life purpose.  )\nDecent Mario/Giana Sisters clone\nRetro and nostalgic\n\nCONS:\nSuper depressing story (yet real to some people)\nRunning and jumping left is impossible\nJumping in general can be unresponsive at certain points.\nJumping is floaty (one level demands perfect jumping in an ice area right before the exit)\nLack in enemy variety (World-specific cosmetic clones in each world)\nBosses are all the same except with new gimmicks/tricks each world (so…5 big, fat owls)\nNot worth paying full price ($4)\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is essentially more like Giana Sisters than Mario as your fireballs don’t bounce, but fly and bounce off walls.  It’s a somewhat decent and difficult game (for the wrong reasons), but it’s not worth the money.  It's not terrible, but it's not great by any means.  I found myself depressed and frustrated during this game.   The ending was decent, but I don't think it was worth all the anger, frustration, and depression along the way.\n\nIf you already have the game, try it out.   If you don’t have it, you’re probably better off without this one in your library.  If you still want this game, wait for a sale, a bundle, or a giveaway (like PC Gamer).  Overall, I would prefer playing Mario or Giana Sisters over this.  (And you can find Mario anywhere now...just not on Steam)\n\n3/10  (Decent, but not worth the money.  Needs fixing.  Depressing)","January 7","false","7.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

For independent developers, the ability to build retro throwback games to their youth is one of the most compelling drawcards of having access to all these game creator tools. And this is where 8BitBoy comes from.\n\n“What am I doing with my life?” is a common question that people ask themselves. As the hero of 8BitBoy ponders this question to himself he thinks back to the good old days when he got to sit around and play as much as he wanted to on his trusty old video game system. Thinking on that, he wonders, do I still have that system? He descends to the basement and starts to rummage through all the old stuff trying to find it. His old 8 bit system in all of its glory with all of his old games worn with the passing of time. Then joy suddenly turns into curiosity has he discovers one brand new game with no label simply sitting there. He loads up the console and the mysterious cartridge and then gets sucked into the game, becoming an 8 bit character in the process.\n\n8BitBoy is a throwback to the old platforming days where games featured not more than a few different buttons to play with, and players had only one goal to be accomplished, such as “make it to the end of the level without dying.” Graphically this game is pretty, with a nice application of the 8 bit aesthetic. The main character, the enemies, and the environments are very well polished and smooth which creates a seamless landscapes for the stages that you pass through from one world to the next. Oddly enough the game is almost too pretty, with the clean visuals damaging the illusion that you're playing an 8 bit game somewhat.\n\nThere are two different ways to play; Kiddy or Retro Mode. Kiddy Mode grants more time within levels and autosaves after every level which makes dying and game overs later on a little bit easier to handle. Retro Mode requires finding a very specific coin that is hidden in the levels to be able to save. These coins are tough to find and the one thing to remember is, the clock is ticking. If you really are an old school gamer, this title will challenge you.\n\nFrom the different worlds to the various enemies that can be encountered, 8BitBoy really feels like an homage to the 8-bit days of Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros. series. To say that 8BitBoy is a simple experience would be to take away from its retro elegance. Platforming traditions of all types are represented in the game, from disappearing platforms to raising quicksand. The game steadfastly refuses to pick up on some of the more modern game design elements found in platformers, and it's almost quaint in its dedication to old school gameplay, even to the detriment of its playability compared to other games that are now on the market.\n\nAvailable to the main character within the stages are two forms of powerups. The first is a shield that will protect the character from any one hit, while the second is a red fruit that turns his clothes red and allows him to shoot fireballs. Now if the launching of fireballs was not enough, there is a second fruit that is available only after attaining the first one which turns the clothes green and allows for two simultaneous fireballs to be launched. It's not exactly a subtle reference to Super Mario Bros, but it's a fun touch nonetheless.\n\n8BitBoy will frustrate players who haven't kept up with their old school play skills. The game requires precise platforming skills, and there are moments where a well timed jump will still just fail, or missing an attacking jump by a single pixel can cost a death. That said, 8BitBoy is a great throwback to the NES era of platform gaming where skill and mastery were required if you were to make it through to the end of the game. It’s games like these that remind us that button mashing does not always win the day and sometimes, just sometimes, perseverance can be a reward into itself.","November 2, 2015","true","60.0"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","39","44","3","0"

Whoever is taking 16+ hours to clear this game is either 90+ years old having never played a computer game in their life or a 2 year old toddler who is in the process of developing his/her hand and eye co-ordination. Having played for just over three hours I have already managed to reach the fifth and final world. Sure I can see a bit more longevity in the game if you seek out all the secret rooms within each level but 16 hrs is definitely pushing it. Also if there is a story in all of this outside of some grown man booting up his 8-bit console and magically getting sucked into its game world then I must have missed that part.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355374546\nBooting up the game you are greeted with a simple message from its creator who professes his undying love for everything gaming related. There is no denying he was obviously heavily influenced by the platformers of yesteryear - particularly Super Mario Bros. - because at the heart of it 8BitBoy is a simple Mario clone (with the main character  and the world he inhabits basically ripped straight from the 80's Nintendo Mario classics). Mushrooms are replaced with birds as our titular copy-paste hero bounces on heads to remove enemy obstacles. In much the same way Mario punched blocks to reveal coins and power-ups so does 8BitBoy. It's all very...retro chic but without the chic bit. 8bitBoy does give the player the abilty to shoot projectiles but its never really explained why eating fruit such as blackberries gives the hero the ability to shoot out tiny little fireballs. If you played any of the old NES Marios back in the day, 8BitBoy will be instantly recognizable as you traverse its five different worlds. Where the game excels is in delivering a great little chiptune soundtrack although it's very limited musical array starts to repeat fairly early on.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355373493\nAs a homage, 8BitBoy is perfectly serviceable and while it isn't going to bring down the house it should offer those looking for some 8-bit nostalgia a relatively fun-filled time. In the end 8BitBoy achieves what it sets out to do...almost! It's still no patch for the actual games it's inspired by and I would say you are better off going to play the original Mario SNES classics, which are freely available all over the internet today, but considering the price ($3.99) and that clearly 8BitBoy is made with an undying fandom love and you could be doing a whole lot worse with those $4.00.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","December 13, 2014","true","7.9"," 69 of 93 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","69","93","4","7"

While its obvious that it takes a lot from Mario games, 8BitBoy has its own flavor and style. It looks and plays like your typical Super Mario game. To be more specific, Super Mario Bros 1 or even Super Mario Land because of its power ups. There are four tiers of power ups. You'll first get a shield power up, that only allows you to take an extra hit. Then you'll get a bouncing red ball projectile, not like Mario's fireball, but like a bouncing ball. Its a nice dynamic weapon. The next tier is a double green fireball that goes faster and finally a fire version as the final tier.\n\nThe enemies feel good and there is a lot of diversity, even if they are color swapped birds for the most part. Blue birds take two hits, green birds fall off platforms, black birds throw snowballs, pink birds shoot arrows. There are fish that jump out of water pits. Most of them can get taken out with head stomps ala Mario. When you bounce on an enemy it is an auto jump instead of being able to hold the jump button as a jump. That auto jump feels problematic especially when platforms are so small. I've learned to not jump on enemies with other enemies flying over them. Auto jump will get you killed.\n\nEach level is pretty open and seems big enough. You're able to explore and find hidden blocks, and passageways that go through walls. The secret areas feel nice and are usually found pushing up against walls. You'll go up, down, left and right, but never fly or swim. Each level goes to the next. You will never have a choice. It just seems lacking when compared to Mario when that's what the developer took inspiration from. The levels go in succession with no level map, just a world map with all 5 of the worlds, each having 10+ levels. These aren't worlds so much as levels. Levels going in succession without being able to select them just feels like a chore having to go through 10 levels to a boss. Its like Super Mario 1 or 2, and less like Mario 3 or Mario World, being able to move around a world and land. When you start each level it tells you level 1-2 world 1. Wouldn't the 1 in level 1-2 imply that you're at world 1?\n\nThe controls are easy, and the developer has listened to feedback. There's a run / attack button, a jump button and a use item button. After listening to feedback, the attack and run buttons have gotten merged together. It just  felt awkward having them as separate buttons. The stopping can be slippery. Without running, 8-Bit Boy just feels slow. When you get 100 coins, you earn a random item to use when you want to. That keeps the game going. If you die and need a quick power-up, just use that. You don't even need to catch it. You'll just have it.\n\nThe game is difficult, but forgiving, especially on the standard difficulty. When you get a game over, you'll restart the level from the last save point. So if you started level 1-2 with 2 lives and fireballs, then die twice, you'll get a game over. Then you restart with those 2 lives and fireballs again. Retro difficulty will only save when you find hidden save coins. I think restarting a level from a save point is just a way to compensate for how difficult the game is and how few extra lives you'll find. Even when you complete the world, and lose all your lives, you still restart with the lives you had entering the world. So you're almost stuck with 1 last life all throughout the entire game. Imagine getting a game over screen each time you die and having the wait to reload the level. Not just that, but use your analog stick as a mouse pointer to click reload game. You're able to use a 360 controller, but the menus turn your analog stick into the mouse cursor. It just feels inefficient, when I could just press a button to play again. Then after that, you need to wait for the game to tell you level 2-4 world 2, before you can move. Super Meat Boy at least throws you right back into the action.\n\nIt is only difficult for constant jumps over death pits that you'll need to land on one block platforms over and over again. If you miss, its death. In the desert, enemies will jump out of the background with no warning other than remembering where they are. This is especially problematic when there are jumps that need you to hit this background jumping enemies.\n\nFor a game called 8-Bit Boy, it didn't feel 8-Bit. The introduction cut scenes don't look 8-Bit either. The resolution is too high for the images. While the game felt like Mario, it didn't feel 8-Bit.\n\nAnother problem I have with this game is screen control. There are some blind jumps due to the screen being stuck to show 3/5s to the right of the character and 2/5ths to the left of the character. Each level can be a maze, which is a good thing, but it makes you blind to the left side, if not blind drops down to platforms. Using the L and R buttons to scroll the screen would have been helpful. Boss fights that use only one screen don't lock the screen to the boss's room. So you can be blind to where the fast moving bosses are.\n\nWater is deadly too, even one block high water when your character is two blocks high and looks like his head would be above water. These are issues that the developer has told me on the forum that will get fixed in the sequel.\n\nThe reloading saves via mouse after every death is an issue, when five lives could be easily granted after using a continue. Pinpoint jumps aren't fun, but really its how slow 8BitBoy moves. There is a run button, but I just think the game could be more fun than it currently is. All of the levels feel the same, even if they're different. There are no new elements added to them except maybe conveyer belts in the fourth world. In the end, there are better games out there even if the game has some fun. It just pales in comparison to the game it tries so hard to be.","June 25, 2014","false","5.8"," 80 of 115 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","80","115","0","4"

Specially if you are just shooting for the end without exploring. Having branching paths and secrets is ok, but have your main level be interesting as well. That's just like making an RPG have awesome side quests and a bad main story. Side quests are a bonus, not the main stuff, it's like the topings on an ice cream.\nVariety is also an issue, each world has a lot of levels, but they all feel like the same level with rearranged stuff. Each world introduces some new baddies and graphics, but they are not well distributed or introduced.\nAlso, levels are long but they don't flow right, I find myself a lot waiting idle for a monster to get out of the way or a moving platform to reach me. Or sometimes the opposite, for example on the flooding levels, where you "escape" water that rises, since it expects you go down the bazillion secret paths, if you just follow the main level the water is never even close to you. This just tells me the levels were not really planned much, stuff was just thrown there. I would much prefer fewer levels but better planned than a ton of levels all the same.\nThe enemies don't follow any "consistent" pattern, they move, jump and shoot whenever they want. This extends to other stuff, for example one of the enemies throws a big snowball that sometimes hits the wrong pixel and rebound on a different direction from where it was supposed to go. This happens with a lot of stuff including the bosses, they rebound against the walls in a weird fashion when they jump.\nYou die because you can't predict stuff, it's just twitch reactions a lot of the time or simply impossible to dodge.\nI'm honestly not sure if this is related to framerate or whatever, but it's just an ingredient for a bad plaformer.\nConsistency is what makes these kinds of plaformers fun (at least the ones this game is trying to emulate). On most games from the NES/SNES/Sega era, the enemies and the enviroment reset on each life, and always move the exact same way when you respawn, so you can learn the level. This way when you die you know it was your fault.\n\nMoving on to glitchy stuff\nHitboxes are weird. Sometimes you don't properly hit platforms or pass through them.\nSolid blocks and non-solid blocks look the same.\nSome of the background can be confused with platforms.\nBreaking squares from below also behaves badly, sometimes you have to hit squares twice or more.\nThrowables from enemies go through stuff. I was hit a couple of times by one of the small snowballs from an enemy I wasn't even seeing on the screen.\nFinally, my biggest issues, several game mechanics are bad:\nLevel exploration is super punishing. On my playthrough I was going through levels in a straight line to the finish. Levels are super hard already without exploring, and exploring is just pointless, any benefit is crushed by the fact that any mistake and it's back to the start without power ups. Exploring stops being fun after the 30th death, where you have to redo the entire level from the beginning, while also loosing the power up. Risk is not worth it just to get a couple extra coins.\nThe power up system is very unbalanced. The game doesn't know if it wants to be a shooting plaformer or a jumping plaformer, and the mix is not well done. A power up makes enemies super easy, but no power up makes them a nightmare. You are massively underpowered without a power up. And, let's not overlook the fact that, if you don't have one, you die in 1 hit. So you can't shoot, but you also insta-die, it's the worst and not well balanced.\nLevels don't help at all, some enemies are even impossible to kill by jumping, for example the birds that fly high and shoot at you. If you compare this to super mario for example, the difference is that in super mario the main focus was jumping, and you could finish all levels just with small mario, the flower was just a "nice to have". And if you compare to most shooting plaformers the difference is that you already start with a gun or have means to handle enemies other way. In this game the balance is bad, and you start with nothing each time you die....\nLast, the lives are just worthless. The fact that, loading the save restores your power up when entering the level, just makes it better to have 1 life with a power up and get a game over on each death. Also, harvesting lives is horrible. If you are going to make a game inspired in old games, bring only the good stuff, not the bad. In any case, harvesting lives doesn't work here, because A) it's super hard so you would need like 2000 lives B) there isn't any fun level to quickly get lives C) on each death you loose the power up D) it's better to get game over and continue than having lives\nThe rant ends here, these game mechanics were the last thing that ruined it for me, but they could be fixed with changes like:\nAdding checkpoints would encourage exploration. Super nintendo games added them for a reason. If you want to keep the difficulty, you can do something like Shovel Knight or Bit Trip Runner 2 where you have the option to break or skip the checkpoint if you want.\nFor the power ups the easiest would be to make the shield be a default on death, and make the first pickup be the red berries. An alternative would be to better balance the levels for when you don't have any pickups. Since right now it's a death sentence.\nThe behavior on death should be the same as loading the last game or something similar. I would just get rid of the lives system entirely. The game could keep track of the deaths but have them be meaningless except for points or something.","November 4, 2014","false","2.8"," 54 of 74 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","54","74","3","0"

To its credit, it does evoke a sense of nostalgia; the visuals and music are very reminiscent of a Genesis/SNES game (thus making 16BitBoy a more appropriate title, but that's splitting hairs). The graphics are simple and cartoony, everything is brightly-coloured and you can clearly see what is an enemy, what is a powerup, a platform, etc. The game's presentation is fine.\n\nHowever, in an attempt to emulate some of the classic platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras, I feel that 8BitBoy has not quite hit the mark in terms of quality gameplay; your character seems to slide around very easily, almost as if every level were an ice level. I've also noticed that the main character's hitbox when it comes to platforming is smaller than its sprite; classic platformers like Mario and Sonic allowed you to land your foot on the edge of a platform and be fine, yet in 8BitBoy you had better make sure you land square on a platform, otherwise you're likely to fall and die.\n\nDeath is another problem with this game. Lives are in short supply, and the levels have no checkpoints. Granted, they're not really long enough to warrent them, and there is little downtime between dying and respawning. However, because of the aforementioned hitbox detection, death is very likely. And the power-ups you'll have collected (which amount to a series of slightly different projectile attacks), will be lost. There is a plus-side to this; the game autosaves at every level, keeping track of your lives total and power-ups when you enter a level. Hence, when you get a game over, you can restart the level with everything. However, this completely invalidates the point of having extra lives. If I die in a level and lose all my power-ups, why would I want to play the level without them, when I can just suicide until I get a Game Over and restart the level with my arsenal intact?\n\nI can't really say I can recommend 8BitBoy. I've not played it long, but the brief period I've spent trying it has been enough to dissuade me from ever playing it again. I would say the developer has their heart in the right place, but I feel they have more lessons still to learn from the classic platformers they clearly idolise. A solid attempt, but that is all.","October 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","0"

Still good with a Mario spirit.\n\nLonger: Although I'm by no means done, I'm already happy with my purchase of 8BitBoy. The creator posted on r/gaming about how happy he was that his game was greenlit, and the price was right for a game that looked decent. Thankfully, the game is as decent as it looks!\n\n8BitBoy is heavily inspired by the early Mario games, complete with floaty physics. They work just fine, although I would really like a WASD option for keyboard users such as myself. Not having that option is my biggest qualm with the game, since it's how I play every other computer platformer ever. I cannot report in on how it works with a controller as I do not have one.\n\nMy biggest praise for the game is how different types of enemies attack in different ways, and how exploration is a big focus of the game (even early on). I could see it being played in a meandering 100% completion style, and also speedrun. That's a big plus. Unfortunately, the enemies are also one of my causes for complaint -- they're rather fat, which makes them take up an awkward amount of space. This is a problem when they die, since they're not knocked off the screen like in Mario, but rather their bodies persist for a while. It makes the world feel unnecessarily cluttered in my opinion.\n\nI recommend this game for people who liked oldschool Mario, and/or who enjoy simple platformers with a lot of possible exploration.","May 8, 2014","true","0.8"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","0"

While the game unashamedly barrows from said title (not to mention a number of other classic platformers), 8-Bit Boy nonetheless manages to please. Ironically, it is because it harkens with such transparency back to many-an-old-school side-scroller that this title is such a surprising joy to play.\n\nThe controls are very good--much better, in fact, than many of the games from which it models itself. Level-design does not disappoint either; while simple, they are all just about the right length and offer some pretty rewarding treasures for those adventurous enough to explore all the nooks and crannies. In fact, once you have beaten the game, you are able to select any stage in order to collect anything you may have missed on your first path.\n\nThe difficulty gets kind of steep in places (I had to resist a rage-quit or two), but it is not so brutal that the challenges cannot be overcome with a little persistence. Keeping at this one and making progress turns out to be very rewarding, and the bosses are fun to tackle and put away.\n\nThe soundtrack, while not mind-blowing, is a notch above serviceable, making it plenty good for this sort of outing. The composer certainly succeeds in capturing the old-school tunes of yesteryear, which actually get to be rather catchy after awhile rather than annoying.\n\nGraphically, the game appears a "bit" archaic, but since every ingredient in 8-Bit Boy is designed to evoke late-80's gaming, they are perfectly suitable.\n\nI have returned to old games like Super Mario Bros., Mega Man, and Donkey Kong Country again and again. 8-Bit Boy is like any of these titles in the sense that it can be enjoyed more than once on account of it being well-designed, fun, and relatively short--especially once you get dialed back into the "twitch-thumb" playing you used to do while sitting in front of the old cathode ray tube, Nintendo controller in hands.\n\nSo if you have a hankering to revisit those crusty-old NES cartridges, you might want to grab this inexpensive game as an appetizer. You likely won't be disappointed.","February 27, 2015","true","7.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

You are missing out, my friend.\n\nI went into playing this with that exact attitude and I was so pleasantly surprised to find how well crafted this title is. Yes it is almost identical to Mario, but there are added features such as being able to shoot the bad guys with three different "stages" of boosts - Red, Green and Black.\n\nI found my self completed hooked as soon as I loaded it up. Each level can last between 2-5 minutes each, and will gradually get harder and harder.\n\nXbox controller again, works wonders and makes the whole experience that bit more enjoyable.\n\nThe game does over exaggerate a bit when it claims to have 16+ hours of levels to explore, I managed to clear the game in just under five hours. Still, I was not expecting it to take that long anyway!\n\nI highly recommend you pick this game up. It's so cheap, you would really need a good reason not too.

As can be seen, the game is a Mario clone, and a very bland one at that.  There's just no kind of personality or anything particularly memorable about it.  It also has sort of an identity crisis, with the name 8bitboy, but graphics more akin to SNES or Genesis, and music and SFX sounding like a blend of Game Boy and Game Gear.\n\nThe levels are all fairly uninteresting, with no real flow from one part to the next.  It's just one random platforming challenge after another, with no real theming or patterns to make the levels feel cohesive.  Not only that, but the level design also frequently feels cramped. This isn't likely to get you killed, but it still doesn't help the overall feel of the game.\n\nThe physics aren't too good either.  Running is incredibly loose and slippy, like everything is covered in ice.  In addition, your character's hitbox is smaller than his sprite.  This becomes a huge problem later when having to do jumps with pinpoint accuracy, especially when you add the slippery physics on top of it.\n\nShould you get this game?  If you can get it for under a dollar as part of a bundle of some sort and you really really need a Mario clone, then sure.  It probably won't hold your attention for long though, as their are much better games out there with a similar asking price.  From the boring level design, to the slippery controls, the game doesn't have much going for it.","November 2, 2014","false","0.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

It looked like a Mario clone and for the most part it is. The retro platforming aspect is here in full force, the puzzling element is thrown in and multiple ways to complete the level presents itself nicely. There is also much exploration and fun to be had.\n\nEach of it's five worlds consist of nine levels and a final boss level.  The backstory personally spoke to me as I could easily relate. The controls are out of the days of the Nintendo and C64. 2 buttons to control firing and jumping if you prefer and a directional pad to move around. For the most part the game performed and responding to my commands decently. I found a gamepad to be easier and more responsive then the keyboard.  Like in Mario and so many other platformers of that bygone era, you spend your time avoiding various enemies, collecting coins and bonus trinkets. Powerups are smartly scattered around the level, making you have to use your noggin as well as your trigger finger to get at them. There are also many secret areas enclosed within each level. Each level also contains a save token for you to find, once you do, you can continue the game from that level with whatever your current specs were when you found the token.\n\nThis game is not easy by any means. The programmer dares you to beat it and it is a challenge to do so. The difficulty levels are erratic and vary greatly even amongst same world levels. For example I found level 4-8 to be extremely difficult if not downright frustrating while level 4-9 was hard but enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this game but it brings me to the one fatal issue I am having with it. It has to do with the constant updates. This in itself, is an extremely good thing and the creator is repsonding to many ideas that players have had. That is where my problem lies. To me, this says this was a somewhat unfinished early access game in disguise. When I purchased this game many of the features that are being added were not included. I don't mind one or two updates to fix bugs, but aside from some bugs there are constantly features being added and I am not sure this game would warrant another playthrough to see them.  For example, speed running and warps were added when I was already upto world 5. All of this should have been implemented before a full program launch. Otherwise, it should have been labeled as early access which it clearly wasn't. If you are a fan of achievements, you should also know that they are not here as of this writing.\n\nStill, the constant additions aside, this is a fun game and well worth a $6 asking price. But if you are not a fan of early access, you might want to put this on your wishlist and hold off for a month or two so you can play a completed game.","June 11, 2014","true","27.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is called "8BitBoy" but the art style is that of a 16 bit game.\n\nSpeaking of art, the art design is uninspired and tacky. The levels and characters are the most basic enemy types with garish colors.\n\nLevel design is incredibly dull and at times atrocious (some secrets you can't get to or get out of, although if it's just me being terrible, I can admit that)\n\nMusic is repetitive and forgetable.\n\n"Story", a 20-some year old man who wants to just play his old video games again and gets trapped in an old video game console, is incredibly groan-worthy. Also, for furhter notes, if you are going to have a gaint wall of text over a static image on a black background, I would stay away from that (see what I said about the Art Design)\n\nAnd worse of all, some levels dropped to 19 FPS. Not because there are too many enemies or a lot going on in the level or enviroment (because you can go through all of world 1 with around 60 fps). It drops for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe one good thing I can think of is that it gave you a FPS counter. But that was a double-edge sword now wasn't it?\n\nSo, I wouldn't really recommend this game.","December 15, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They take me back to the days when I was a kid, sitting up late at night, trying to get through various incarnations of the genre in the early days of NES.  I've never claimed to be good at them, mind you, but I enjoy them a lot.\n\n8BitBoy didn't seem like much at first glance.  It came in a bundle, which means I was after something else in said bundle most likely, and 8BitBoy just came along for a ride.  One day I was digging through my library to find a cure for a sleepy Sunday afternoon, and I happened to catch the platformer tag when I scrolled across it.  I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a spin.\n\nThe first time through?  8BitBoy feels a bit off.  You go in expecting Mario, but the controls just aren't the same.  They're a bit more floaty, not quite as precise.  This will throw you off a bit, but press on.  As you dig a little deeper, you start get the hang of the controls and the game starts to feel more familar.  You're progressing through the maps, you're stomping on birds and making jumps.  Then there's that special moment when you're standing on a ledge and accidentally push the control into the wall, and you slip through and discover a secret room...and now 8BitBoy has its hooks in you!\n\n8BitBoy is a love song to those platformers of old.  You will notice elements of them all throughout.  While looking back so fondly, the game still manages to be its own beast.  It's hard.  Hell, it's very hard!  It's also packed full of secrets, warps to other zones, many many maps and more.  All it makes for a very fun, low budget platformer that you may not have noticed otherwise!\n\n","July 30, 2014","true","1.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Anyone who has played 8BitBoy will tell you it is not one of those games and its touching introduction will have you hooked right off the bat! As for the gameplay, it is flawless and nostalgic. The music and graphics remind me of playing classic Pokemon and Super Mario games and the controls are very smooth (I recommend using a console controller). Full-clearing the levels is also very challenging (and rewarding if you are going for highscores) but it is not entirely necessary if you just want to beat the game. So if you're a gamer who likes to go for 100% on every level, good luck to you!

It has no personality what-so-ever, nor does it do anything remotely interesting with its story or gameplay.  Even having died multiple times in some of the later levels, I still finished all 50 of them in about three hours.  And no, I didn't collect every special coin, nor will I.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vermilicious/recommended/296910/","vermilicious","Vermilicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vermilicious/","324 products in account","Many people my age grew up with early gaming consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System. For me, and likely them, Super Mario was one of the big titles, starring a rather crude pixel representation of an italian plumber in his quest for saving a princess. These games defined the platform genre, and since then more such games have appeared - some good, others not so good. Recently there have been plenty of variants with relatively spectacular presentation, and some bullet-hell and death-trap variants which is a sort of different deal. On the classic retro-end, there hasn't been all that much. That, and combined with fairly interesting teasers, made this particular game appeal to me.\n\nSo, how does this retro experience fare? Since the game is so obviously inspired by old school games, comparing it to the likes of Super Mario is unavoidable. Considering the obvious technical advances in gaming over a couple of decades, one would expect that a well-performing 2D game would be fairly easy to create. Sadly, this game feels awkward and not up to par. In particular, it's hard to control the character properly, leading to a lot of frustrating, fatal incidences. Old games were really a challenge, but this one's just hard to play right. It's a sort of "fake" difficulty.\n\nVisually, the game is alright, if nothing amazing. The menu UI is rather poor when using a gamepad. The enemies are a bit on the easy side. The stages are full of secrets, which is nice, but other than that, not particularly difficult, but at sometimes very unforgiving. The soundtrack is very limited. When it comes to game mechanics, I haven't seen anything particularly innovative. The power-ups are fairly basic. The obstacles are very familiar. There isn't really a story, but there's an intro explaining how this guy ended up in the virtual world as the character in the game. There's not much to motivate you to press on.\n\nAs a platformer with an obvious inspiration from games of old, it falls short. It feels awkward and uninspiring. In sum, with the risk of not having seen quite enough of the game at the time of writing, a mediocre experience at best.\n\n2014-06-09: Switching to thumbs up and made a few changes. It has a way to go, but I have found it somewhat enjoyable. It's still frustrating at times though. The game is often updated, which is nice.","June 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Let me also state that this game is also very hard! I tried the hard difficulty and died like all the time so i played the easier one and lemme tell you its still hard!! Its scary when you jump to a platform not knowing if it will dissapear or jumping to a wall and go through it and think oh no I just died only to discover its a secret! Btw some of these secrets arent even safe. It may have a special coin but in order to get it you have to jump over enemies and spikes- hmmm risk my life fr that damn coin or come back later-yep im coming back later sowie coin lol. Enemies are easy to kill but they trick you-dont want to spoil their moves but lemme tell you that just because you think they wont hit you and think that you are safe-well you are not! I like the music especially world 4- reminds me of old school vid-game soundtracks! Theres also tons of collecting to find but to find those special coins is hard as heck because sometimes you have to be quick-or face dangerous situations and risk a life in order to get that coin! I will say I think the character can sometimes be kinda floaty when you run and jump- like hes landing on ice. Its makes your heart skip a beat thinking wow I almost fell in the pit! I do like the powers which there is 3 versions of and a shield! Gripe about the powers tho is that if you get hit once- you lose it- it be better if you got hit and lost the black suit and went to the green and then got hit again and went down to the red but I suppose that adds to the difficulty! Plus its harder to save on the hardmode version of the game as opposed to easy mode where it saves after every level which is welcomed because lives are hard to come by. I like this game tho and it takes me back to mario days of past! Stumbling into secrets and the cute music and figuring out the boss patterns is fun! It never gets to want to break laptops screen hard. I would highly recomend it if you like platformers- a challenge- are a collector junkie and just love nostalgia!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/recommended/296910/","Nawrusi","Nawrusi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/","789 products in account","I like what the game tryed to do. A look back in time to another generation of gaming.\n\nPresentation:\nLet me put this straight, you get what you ask for. The game in itself is not a grand game full of pretty graphic achivments and amazing and inuvative gameplay, it`s a throwback to another era of gaming and the game tells you that right form the begining.\n\nThe look sound and overall plot is really oldschool, and it would properly work better on me, if I was growing up in the oldschool era, but I didn`t. Instead I get to see another era of gaming, which I didn`t complain about. The game overall was a positive experince.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is very Marioesk and you jump on enemyes to kill them. You pick up a lot of fireball spells, in order to have extra hits just like Mario. The fireball spells are all basiclly the same, with only some bouncing to really set them apart.\n\nThe platforming which is the main focus of the game, is done rather well and I only had issues with it few times throughout the game. One of the bigger issues were the convatorbelts in the game, were you have to jump with momentum. I felt the controles were a bit off here, but when you learn the timing, you wont have much trouble with it afterwerds.\n\nCharecters:\nYou play as a boy, who is turned into a 8-bit charecter. It`s all in the titel!\n\nThere are really not some kind of bigger thing to the game, other than you just have to clear every area, which all have bird themed enemyes and bosses. All of thee charecters (including the main charecter) dosen`t really have eny charecter traids, other than in the intro of the game. Afterwards charecters don`t really matter, but I think it`s fitting for the generation of gaming, which this game trys to show. In this generation charecters were not that important, the game and gameplay itself were in focus.\n\nVisuels:\nThe game has an 8-bit style, and uses it to show very typical areas for the generation. This includes an ice level, a dessert level, a robot level etc. The visuels did not do much for me, but this game is a throwback, and everyone who should buy tihs would properly like the artstyle, since that is what the game is all about.\n\nSound/Music:\nThe soundeffects are few in this game, but again it was typicall for the era. The music is fine but nothing to write home about in my opinion. I liked some of the themes and they really set the tone of an 8-bit game.\n\nStory/Bosses:\nSo the story is simple; person get`s inside a game, and now he must fight himself through all the levels of the gam he is in. From there every level is themed after a typical level from the 8-bit era. At the end of every world a bossfight with a bird happens, and you get one step closer to the end.\n\nNow about the end...I did acually not see it. To cmplete the game fully, you have to go trough every single level, in order to find secrets to unlock the ending. Now I did not have the patience to go through the enterie game again, in order to unlock the true ending, but maybe you have more patience than me.\n\nOverall I fell a bit sad about never seeing the end of the game, since I kind of fell like I deserved it. I played every level of the game and yet got nothing out of it other than a screne pretty much telling me to go back.\n\nConclution:\n8-bitboy is a fun game and an amazing trowback to another generation of gaming. If you were bon in the NES era, you will properly apriciate this game more than I did. The game is very short, but you could argue that the game is not done, untill every secret is found, so there is your long game time.","February 26","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While fairly competent as a platformer from a technical point of view, it quickly becomes very, very dull; after the first few levels, you have seen practically everything the game has to offer, and while new enemy types are added throughout the game, none of them really provide enough of a challenge to combat that boredom. The graphics and sounds are alright, nothing to write home about but neither are particularly offensive and they do their job well. The levels can be at times fairly elaborate and are overall quite well designed, with plenty of secrets and well-balanced difficulty, but the simplistic gameplay and complete and utter lack of innovation bury whatever potential the game might have had.","April 1","false","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here's why I would recommend playing something else:\n\nCons:\nThe character movement is challenging and seems inconsistent\nThere are issues with collison detection, blocks don't break\nYou move faster walking on treadmills than trying to run--running is slower and will cause death\nMany times you'll die because you must drop down and you're unable to see what's below you\nIt uses controller, but then has you move a mouse like finger around in the menu with the controller\n\nAll this was experience on Mac version 1.50--which is supposed to be a great stable version.\n\nI bought it cheap, beat (first part) in a couple hours.

Not only is it incredibly fun and extremely reminiscent of the original 'Mario Bros' for Nintendo, but it's also tough as nails. Which brings up the age old question; is a platformer really that good if it never makes you contemplate smashing your controller? If you answered no to this question, then proceed to the checkout page for you are about to purchase this game.\n\nPerfectly timed jumps, relentless enemies, easily lost power-ups, and boss battles that continue to get harder; '8BitBoy' has everything that you would come to expect from a sidescroller and more. Which is hard to come by in a time where many games attempt to re-create a wonderful 8 bit experience, but end up falling flat in the end. In fact, '8BitBoy' feels like one gigantic homage to platformers in general, and playing through it you're sure to notice plenty of elements from the classics.\n\nNot only is this one of the best platformers out, but it's constantly being updated, so there's always something new to discover. If you're a fan of games like 'Super Meat Boy', 'Shovel Knight', or pretty much any platformer in general, this game is worth checking out a million times over. Here's hoping that '8BitBoy' gets a sequel sometime soon, but even if it doesn't, I'm sure I'll return to this one time and time again anyway.

A few too many "Oh, you missed one out of seven jumps, here's a pit of death." areas in that world. The rest is fine though.\n\nApparently there's a story in here as well. You're a 30 (I think) something guy, who misses the good old days of playing video games, so you go down into the basement to pick up your old Sega (I assume, due to one mention of Genesis later). You find a cartridge with no label, that doesn't look like it's ever been played, which is scary so obviously you have to play it. Plug it in, and boom, now you're a video game character. (Think Captain N, only slightly less cool.)\n\nFinally, is the game any good? Yeah, definitely. It was really fun, a really nice throwback game. If you like classic platformers, odds are you'll like this one. In my opinion definitely a throwback to some Atari and Amiga games, more than NES and Genesis/Mega Drive games.

So overall I would highly recommend it to fans of old school platformers, especially when the price is only 65p right now in the weekly sale!!!","October 12, 2014","true","9.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I must say, when you think of retro platform based games, you think of the likes of Mario, and Mario, and then, Mario... This game lived up to that name. It was fun, challenging and overall, rage inducing! Personally, i think its best played with a controller of some kind, I felt extremely comfortable using the Xbox 360 controller and the button lay-out was well done. The game itself, it took me 11 hours fully complete the levels and to find all the hidden stars on each level, but you can't complete the story until you find all 50 stars, 1 per map, so that resulted in me running through all 50 levels again to finish the game. I was then going to run it on the 'EXTREME' difficulty, but the only difference is you have to collect the coins to save your game, instead of it saving after completion of each level, and you get slightly less time. Wasn't all that challenging.

Lets start with good like always. The game works for the most part, with only a few bugs encountered. It kind of reminds you of old NES platformers, and mario that it clearly rips off. Also there are many secrets to be found most levels and alternate routes to uncover. Then there is the bad. People are right the games hitboxes are some of the worst I've ever seen in a platformer, I've jumped on people and been killed by them so many times it's ridiculous. Someone pointed out how stupid the game design is in the fact that if you die and still have lives left, you begin with nothing you had at the start of the last life, which is super stupid and no other games does. Why would he think that was a good idea. So you just kill yourself to get back to your first life, because you want your power ups. This wastes time and makes no more than 1 life worthwhile. There are basically 2 powerups, a shield and shooting fireballs, thats it the entire game, which is super boring and uninspiring. Then there are the gameplay mechanics. The running and jumping doesn't work half the time, if you try it on a short length platforms for some reason it doesn't read it sometimes and you just jump half way. Other times it won't read you jumping even though you press it before you are off. Other times on the moving tiles you will press it perfectly and once again you won't jump...herp derp. It is almost like there is too much of a delay. On the moving platforms you will press it right away and it still won't read it. Sometimes when you land on platforms you slide, dont ask me why. The worst part is the game level design. Where as mario has interesting levels with varying things like pipes and riding ♥♥♥♥ and different levels of things to jump on, 8 bit has the same levels and they are dumb. They are all basically levels 2/3 of it with fire/water/spike that are instant kills, and you just jump onto single little platforms. This is stupid for many reasons. First off my having every level be mostly instadeath, with no checkpoints, all of your powerups you got are usually worthless because you just die and at any time if the game mechanics don't hold up, and you restart the level. Mario didn't do this, it had flat surfac levels because people don't want to have to jump over level every 2 seconds. Also by making every platform just single platforms it artifically raises difficulty and is just sloppy design. Mario and other platformers aren't all just single jumps over lava. Could have spent time and been inventive instead of making the same level. The final boss is stupid as you can't get any powerups and have to go through these 3 different attacking forms before you can hit her once, and you have to do that at least 4 or more times. If you get hit once its all over and you have to redo it all. Not worth my time. Just not that good of a platformer, obsessed with instant death and single platforms, and the wonky mechanics and hitboxes make it more frustating than fun that you have to restart levels over and over when its not your fault. 4.5/10","March 10, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

If anything, this game resembles Superfrog - a billion levels with very little to set them apart from each other, and every single one is filled to the brim with secrets of varying usefulness and satisfaction upon collection. The way the stages are mostly built from a sprinkle of narrow little platforms also spells Superfrog, or a lackluster Mario hack rather than the real deal.\n\nThe features that do make me think of Mario, such as hitting blocks repeatedly for multiple coins, seem to have been borrowed without much thought. It's questionable whether these blocks were all that fun to begin with, but certainly no new ground is broken by placing them willy-nilly in empty corridors, especially in a game where separate 10-coin pickups exist.\n\nAside from being a mess of tiny blocks, the level design is repetitive with a noticeable lack of interesting enemy placement and unique stage features. Low-ceiling instakill pits abound. Enemies, on the other hand, usually present no challenge due to the player character's super overpowered projectile attacks that bounce everywhere and kill most baddies before they've properly entered the screen. The projectiles are lost upon death and require multiple pickups to regain, though, contributing to a shifty game balance.\n\nThe basic movement mechanics are solid enough, so if you really like bouncing around and finding a coin stash from every block of land big enough for one in an environment where nothing leaves a lasting impression, you will probably love this game. If you've actually played the nonspecific platforming greats this game tries to emulate, I'll be surprised if 8BitBoy leaves you satisfied. Unless, of course, the untouchable classic you were thinking of is Superfrog.","February 20, 2015","false","7.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","3"

If you are a fan of old platformer games with lots of hidden secrets then buy it! Not only does it support the developer, you will also derrive a lot of pleasure from this indie title. It is indeed a hidden gem.","July 15, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its very obvious that this game was a work of love, created by someone who really enjoyed and understood what made the 8-bit platformers so much fun.\n\nI'm on world 4, and i'ts hard to describe in words how lovely and rare it is to find a game that makes one feel they picked up (for lack of a better word) an expansion pack to games they played in the 80s/90s. Yeah, I could go back and play those games, but being able to play a brand new game that embodies everything that made those games great is truely a special treat.\n\nIf their other games are any thing like this, I will be buy, in a heart beat, anything from Awesome Blade. Can't wait for more.\n\nEDIT2: I've noticed lots of people who down rate the game mentioning unreliable controls. I have not seen this issue on my computer at all. I've used xbox 360 wireless controller with a usb wireless adapter as well as keyboard. Both have worked excellent for me. One person mentioned that there controllers were acting screwy, but acted fine once they disabled some extraneous drivers on their computer. So I would say, if you are having issues with your controller, try a keyboard. Again, I didn't have any issues with my xbox 360 controller, but mileage may vary. I love this game !!! haha :D\nEDIT: My only warning is that this is a challenging game. I'm constantly reloading saves, but that is just my play style. I'm sitting on about 17 lives at the moment. What I do is I run through and let my self screw up a bunch, and find the best way to get to the end of the level. When I finally get to the end of the level and I only have 1-3 lives left, I reload the level so I have 17 lives, and run it until I reach the end of the level without dieing once. This can take several reloads, but its how I prefer to play.","July 17, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls and physics are slippery, which makes for a lot of needless frustration, and for goodness sake it's 2014 - stop with limited lives and unlimited continues. Unless the consequence of death is permadeath, don't use limited lives, it's a small but frustratingly bad design decision that way too many developers still make.\n\nThe more I play this, the worse it seems. The controls are just so slippery, basic navigation becomes a chore. A chore resulting in frequent unfair deaths. I'm not even sure this is decent for a bundle game anymore, it's just kinda bad.

The reference about it being 8 Bit is a little to low of itself considering the game looks more like a 16/32bit game.  I was pretty excited about getting this game when it was being given away for free part of those little promotions that some gaming sites give away.  But there is some flaws of course and that is the controls are a bit off and at times you'll be falling into a hole or running into an enemy more then you'd like.  Will that make you stop playing the game... well i'm not quite sure for me I wanted to keep going just to see if I could finish this game off.\n\nI did and maybe its not like all your traditional platformers like Super Mario Bros. which this game tries to pull off.  This game is crazy hard do to the level design which I felt to be a bit horrible.  One of the levels the world fills with water while you have to jump from platform to platform to make sure you don't fall into it.  At the beginning of the level your first platform you have to jump on is just a tiny bit high and you have to make sure you can make the jump just right or you die.  I remember the first time I played the level it tooks me awhile to finally get up and complete the level.  There will be a lot of hit and misses in the game and you have to keep trying over and over again to make sure you can complete the level.\n\nThis is pretty much the part that makes you enjoy the game and I'm not 100% sure if that is a good thing or not but like I said you just want to beat the game.  For me I beat all the bosses and got to the end but its one of those games that if you want to see the good ending make sure you collect everything so you can.  The good thing though is that the map is completely unlocked and you can go back and collect what is missing and then go back to fight that final boss and possibly get that ending.\n\nFor me it was to much the game was already difficult enough for me to beat all the bosses I just said "i'm done" and moved on.  If you get that far you should be happy.  To this moment though I'm still thinking about collecting everything just to see that ending.  This game to me is playable there could be worse titles out there but it plays like other platformers but I just feel it being a little more difficult then your traditional that your used to playing.  The controls can suck and that is one big disappointment with the level design adding to it.  The graphics are nice and even though being quite difficult you'll fight your way through just to see if you can beat it.  Get this game if you have that will to fight through a hard game and if you don't this game isn't for you.","May 10","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It doesn't try to do anything unique or pretentious.  It does one thing and one thing only - be a solid 2D platformer.\n\nYou will have to realize the controls may borrow concepts from classic Mario games, but they follow their own "rules".  This was something I had to shake from my ingrained muscle memory of playing tons of Mario games - for example, running does not make you jump higher - longer yes, but higher no.\n\nThis makes some level designs mildly annoying, since it's obvious some levels were made exclusively to limit you because of these jumps.  There will be jumps where you just won't be able to make it because of a one block difference, and you're forced to either go around a long way just to reach that jump or use some other means to get there.  Super Mario games had a lot of these, but the level designs for those games didn't feel as... obvious as the levels in this one.\n\nThe enemy designs are kinda funny, strangely satisfying to stomp on enemies that look like Angry Birds.  It's like the author knew that people who like these older retro style games have a bit of a dislike for what the "Angry Birds" genre of casual mobile games have caused for the video game industry.\n\nRegardless, if you want a few hours of fun, there's way worse things you can spend your money on.  There's lots of Youtube videos you can look up if you want first impressions of the game, and it's highly recommended you use a controller for an optimal playing experience, seeing how this game harkens back to the console platforms of old.","September 6, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That will make or break your enjoyment of this game, because it feels like the difficulty is based around mastering those kind of controls (which I personally never liked in the first place).  In a game like Super Meat Boy or Mega Man, you never feel like you died because of the controls, but I couldn't get over the sense of frustration in 8BitBoy.\n\nThe music is fine but nothing memorable, and the level designs are pretty blatant knockoffs of Super Mario World and the Super Mario Land games for Gameboy.  Collecting coins?  A plant that lets you shoot projectices?  Springs?  I wonder where you got those original ideas!?\n\nThey went for a retro feel with the intro cutscene, but they just look like flat line drawings in done in MS Paint.  Also, no one wants to read a wall of text before they play a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed platformer.  If you can't tell the story of a platformer through the gameplay, then the game doesn't need one.\n\nThe whole thing just feels like a really generic experience.  It's certainly not a *bad* game, but all it made me want to do was play Super Mario World instead.","May 6, 2014","false","0.2"," 74 of 160 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","74","160","0","4"

The great thing however about this game compared to other newer retro titles is that instead of trying to emulate and clone the content it aspires to be, it makes its own improvements and feels like a new game. Crisp sprites, loads of awesome hidden content for those that want to find it, will make you want to  stretch the most out of your limited time on each level. Often you find yourself in a tricky spot trying to determine whether or not to use precious time for that tantalising power up just out of normal reach.","November 20, 2014","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/androsphinx12/recommended/296910/","androsphinx12","AndroSphinx12","http://steamcommunity.com/id/androsphinx12/","621 products in account","I would reccomend this game if you like platformers like Mario. Some of the levels can be challenging and the boss fights at the end of each world become more challenging the farther you get into the game. The description says 16+ hours for the story I technically only delved straight to the level and world completion and not other aspects per level and once I beat the last world I had clocked in 7hr50min. I loved finding secret areas some of them caught me off guard and I was like no way could have sworn I was going to die. All in all I think once I go back and try to get everything in the game I will be at 20-30+ hours on record for Steam.\n\nPros:\nGood platforming challenges.\nHas a decent pace to each level did't feel rushed.\nNice boss fights with different mechanics per fight.\nGood progression of difficulty per world from level to level but doesnt hold your hand.\nController Support I love games that have controller support especially ones I don't have to rebind the keys.\n\nCons:\nI think the only issue I had which is very small was the music felt repetative(Like it was re-used level to level) and to be honest it isn't bad thing just some of the beats are stuck in my head haha.\nAnother thing that I would like to see in this game is achievements.\n\nAll in all I think the game was well designed and I appreciate the developer updating as much as they can to make sure you don't have preformance issues. For $4.00 you really can't say 16-30+ hours of gameplay isnt worth it alot of AAA titles that come out now are $60.00 and only last half the time. If the game goes on sale there should be no reason you don't purchase the game.","February 16, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't even gotten a response from the Devs yet about this problem. I'm not even sure if it's some rare problem or not, but honestly, this is ridiculous! So unless you're willing to risk it for a game that may or may not work for you, then go ahead! But for those who're careful with their funds, just forget this and grab something else.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/recommended/296910/","Nico-Kun","¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/","653 products in account","Right from the start, 8BitBoy feels like a Super Mario clone. You jump over enemies to kill them, hit blocks with your hand (not your head!) to get power ups; there's even warp zones! Now, is this really a bad thing? Well, I'd say that it's more of a homage than a rip off. Sure, the similarities are there, and are pretty obvious, but I think that's the point of the game; to bring us back to that magical time in our childhood, in which simple graphics and simple gameplay were wonders.\n\nNow, even though it has similarities to Super Mario, it also feels quite unique. Rather than having a single fireball as a weapon, you can get up to two berries (what a great difference, you might be thinking, while rolling your eyes), well, in this game, you have two firing modes: forward, and upwards (diagonally). This can add a bit of an advantage for dealing with enemies. There's also many secret areas in each level, some providing alternate routes, and I'd add that it has pretty good level design, some of them can be quite challenging, but, once again, they remind me of the "old days" in which games felt challenging in a special way, requiring me to learn the quirks of the different levels and execute them perfectly in order to beat them.\n\nWhen it comes to story, it isn't very complex. You play as this depressed guy who misses the "good old days", and while messing around with his old 8-bit console, he gets transported into a mysterious game. I'd say that, in this game, story isn't important, just like it wasn't important in games like Super Mario; we rescued the princess because that's what we were told to do (and, in fact, we weren't even told that we were looking for a princess until we beat the first world). It does add some background information, but, as I said, it's not really necessary for a game of this type. As for the soundtrack, it's pretty simple, since it keeps the 8-bit theme this game follows. Even then, it's pleasing to the ears, nothing too annoying or anything like that.\n\nWell, to conclude, I'd say that I recommend this game, especially to those of you who enjoyed platforming games like Super Mario Bros in your childhood.","March 27","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And clearly, I can tell you this game is just like a good 'old retro game (in terms of style), and it was clearly made by a retrogamer too.\n\nFirst, I see some people saying this looks too much like a flash game. Well, that aint true. Flash games dont play that smooth and well. This game plays so smoothly, and the controls are hyper-responsive. This game is much more superior to a Flash game.\n\nGraphics are good retro looking. Nothing much to say here.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to Super Mario games. While it doesnt play as well as normal Mario, it still plays damn well. The level design isnt the best I ever saw, but the way the levels are made makes 8BitBoy a very fun platformer to enjoy.\n\nThe music is enjoyable, and I would totally love to have the soundtrack for this wonderful game.\n\n8BitBit can be difficult in some places. So I cant say its the best platformer game for you, if you are a beginner. Like I said, this game was clearly made by a retrogamer, and old games were harder, and thus, this game is designer for better players. Its not a hard game, but not an easy one either. Just dont start with that game if you're a beginner.\n\n\n8BitBoy might not look like its worth 4,49$, but dont worry, it totally is worth the price. I dont regret buying the game. Not at all. If you love retrogaming, or 2D platformers, 8BitBoy is for you. Its a true hidden gem on Steam. Absolutely recommended!!","March 3","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to watch a 20 second cut scene every time you die at a boss fight. At the second attempt, you have no power-ups anymore, so you die in one hit. Unless you die several more times, in which case you game over and get to reload the autosave which restores those power-ups. You can't manually load the savegame; only if you game over.\n\nOther problems:\nThe levels have some "blind" jumps where you can't see where you have to land (and die if you guess incorrectly).\nBugs: activating a stored item sometimes fails. Also some sprites overlap incorrectly.As for the rest of the game, it's pretty mediocre:\nThe graphics, music and sounds are good.\nThe enemies are pretty standard; reminiscent of Donkey Kong Country (except they are birds instead of crocodiles).\nThe levels are not especially well thought out.\nYou get random power-ups. A shield (an extra hit point) and several slightly different berries that let you shoot.\nThere is an unnecessary fake "loading" screen, which gets annoying if you die a lot.\nIf you enter a level with one life left, you have to click "yes, reload the autosave" with your mouse every time you die.\nMany hidden areas, which are revealed as you enter them, but sometimes there is an enemy or lava one tile away, which is not well thought out.\nThe boss fights are all similar.\nNot very polished; many small things feel slightly off.\nOverall it's a mediocre platformer with reasonably good pixel graphics and music. There are much better games.","March 3","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EyesofthePhantom/recommended/296910/","EyesofthePhantom","Rex Phantasmata Decepturus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EyesofthePhantom/","72 products in account","This game could have been amazing. The graphics are nice, the levels are well designed, it feels like a retro game, all should be great! The problem is the controls, they ruined any enjoyment I got from the game at first. The maps require preciscion platforming a lot of the time, problem is jumping is extremely floaty and movement is stiff. There also seems to be an input lag, I'm using a wired Xbox 360 controller which works fine on every other game, especially on jumping. The bosses are lazy, the first three are the same boss with a different color pallet and play mostly the same but with a small twist, the fourth boss was more uniquely designed but is still just a big bird, last boss is another big bird but is the most creative and fun to fight of all. To see the true ending of the game you have to collect all of the coins which is where I'm at right now, some of them are easy to find others are not which I have no problem with. My issue here is with the map, you select a level and play it but if you run out of lives you have to return to the map and reselect a map. This can be annoying if you're stuck with having one life due to a level you're struggling with, especially when hunting for coins where you may be dying more. Lastly the hit boxes are just odd, yours is bigger than your character and you can take damage by landing on the edge, I mean top of the head but near the edge of it, of some enemies heads. Overall  it's a good game ruined by bad controls along with lazy boss design and a few bad design choices. 5/10 It's too bad there's no neutral option.\n\nEDIT: As I continue to play this game I found two bugs that keep popping up that are worth mentioning. First of all when you gather 100 coins you gain a spare item, it's hard to explain but basically you see the icon of the item in the bottom right of the screen and when you press Y (on a controller) you use the item, if it's a power up you gain that powerup, but the problem is it works when it wants to. So many times I'd lose my powerup and try to use my spare only for it to disappear from the bottom right of my screen and me not gain the effect of the item. Next up is conveyer belts, if you happen to run into one while sprinting sometimes you use the belt as normal, other times you just move forward at walking speed, unable to turn around, across them then if you try to jump you just give a normal jump forward.\n\nEDIT: There is one more issue I forgot to bring up, the springs. They are attrocious, the hitboxes are dead center on the spring and only a couple of pixels, which makes then a pain to use, these should be made larger in a future update, otherwise it's hard to judge exactly where I am about to be launched into the air which just makes it easy to misjudge a jump from one spring to the next, which happens many times in this game, unless you somehow have a perfect landing technique.","March 27","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mario.\n\n\n8 Bit Boy is a 2D platforming game developed by AwesomeBlade.\n\nPositives\n- Runs at 60 FPS\n- SFX = Reminds me of 2D mario games, especially the jumping sounds. Background music is mediocre though\n- Great artstyle = Colourful and reminds me of the super nintendo days...\n- Great Gameplay = Similar to 2D mario you need to reach the other side, whilst platforming and stomping on enemies along the way.\n- Secret areas = Lots of secret areas within levels with extra coins or power ups.\n- 5 stages with dozens of levels each\n- Power ups = There are 3: Red, green and black which change your projectiles\n- Boss fights = At the end of each stage\n- Items = Like the shield which protects you from one attack\n- Wide enemy variety = You will face birds, snakes, bats and different variations of them as you progress through each stage.\n\nCons\n- No checkpoints within levels = Each death causes you to respawn at the begining of the level.\n- LImited story = Basically you play as a guy who got sucked into your old game console and now has to get through the levels via platforming. Not really told during gameplay either.\n- Water trap = Wished  it was red (like lava) and didn't kill you instantly when you touch it.\n- Fidgety controls = Found it difficult to sprint in certain areas and kept falling off ledges.\n- Limited item variety\n\n\nIf your looking for a good 2D mario-like platformer game, this game is for you.","September 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to watch a 20 second cut scene every time you die at a boss fight. At the second attempt, you have no power-ups anymore, so you die in one hit. Unless you die several more times, in which case you game over and get to reload the autosave which restores those power-ups. You can't manually load the savegame; only if you game over.\n\nOther problems:\nThe levels have some "blind" jumps where you can't see where you have to land (and die if you guess incorrectly).\nBugs: activating a stored item sometimes fails. Also some sprites overlap incorrectly.As for the rest of the game, it's pretty mediocre:\nThe graphics, music and sounds are good.\nThe enemies are pretty standard; reminiscent of Donkey Kong Country (except they are birds instead of crocodiles).\nThe levels are not especially well thought out.\nYou get random power-ups. A shield (an extra hit point) and several slightly different berries that let you shoot.\nThere is an unnecessary fake "loading" screen, which gets annoying if you die a lot.\nIf you enter a level with one life left, you have to click "yes, reload the autosave" with your mouse every time you die.\nMany hidden areas, which are revealed as you enter them, but sometimes there is an enemy or lava one tile away, which is not well thought out.\nThe boss fights are all similar.\nNot very polished; many small things feel slightly off.\nOverall it's a mediocre platformer with reasonably good pixel graphics and music.

And clearly, I can tell you this game is just like a good 'old retro game (in terms of style), and it was clearly made by a retrogamer too.\n\nFirst, I see some people saying this looks too much like a flash game. Well, that aint true. Flash games dont play that smooth and well. This game plays so smoothly, and the controls are hyper-responsive. This game is much more superior to a Flash game.\n\nGraphics are good retro looking. Nothing much to say here.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to Super Mario games. While it doesnt play as well as normal Mario, it still plays damn well. The level design isnt the best I ever saw, but the way the levels are made makes 8BitBoy a very fun platformer to enjoy.\n\nThe music is enjoyable, and I would totally love to have the soundtrack for this wonderful game.\n\n8BitBit can be difficult in some places. So I cant say its the best platformer game for you, if you are a beginner. Like I said, this game was clearly made by a retrogamer, and old games were harder, and thus, this game is designer for better players. Its not a hard game, but not an easy one either. Just dont start with that game if you're a beginner.\n\n\n8BitBoy might not look like its worth 4,49$, but dont worry, it totally is worth the price. I dont regret buying the game. Not at all. If you love retrogaming, or 2D platformers, 8BitBoy is for you. Its a true hidden gem on Steam. Absolutely recommended!!","March 3","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm running it/steam on a MacPro, 12bg ram, 3.7 quad core, AMD graphics card. A stock entry level macpro. The game won't load up, I'm stuck on the loading screen. Seems to be an known issue.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EyesofthePhantom/recommended/296910/","EyesofthePhantom","Rex Phantasmata Decepturus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EyesofthePhantom/","72 products in account","This game could have been amazing. The graphics are nice, the levels are well designed, it feels like a retro game, all should be great! The problem is the controls, they ruined any enjoyment I got from the game at first. The maps require preciscion platforming a lot of the time, problem is jumping is extremely floaty and movement is stiff. There also seems to be an input lag, I'm using a wired Xbox 360 controller which works fine on every other game, especially on jumping. The bosses are lazy, the first three are the same boss with a different color pallet and play mostly the same but with a small twist, the fourth boss was more uniquely designed but is still just a big bird, last boss is another big bird but is the most creative and fun to fight of all. To see the true ending of the game you have to collect all of the coins which is where I'm at right now, some of them are easy to find others are not which I have no problem with. My issue here is with the map, you select a level and play it but if you run out of lives you have to return to the map and reselect a map. This can be annoying if you're stuck with having one life due to a level you're struggling with, especially when hunting for coins where you may be dying more. Lastly the hit boxes are just odd, yours is bigger than your character and you can take damage by landing on the edge, I mean top of the head but near the edge of it, of some enemies heads. Overall  it's a good game ruined by bad controls along with lazy boss design and a few bad design choices. 5/10 It's too bad there's no neutral option.\n\nEDIT: As I continue to play this game I found two bugs that keep popping up that are worth mentioning. First of all when you gather 100 coins you gain a spare item, it's hard to explain but basically you see the icon of the item in the bottom right of the screen and when you press Y (on a controller) you use the item, if it's a power up you gain that powerup, but the problem is it works when it wants to. So many times I'd lose my powerup and try to use my spare only for it to disappear from the bottom right of my screen and me not gain the effect of the item. Next up is conveyer belts, if you happen to run into one while sprinting sometimes you use the belt as normal, other times you just move forward at walking speed, unable to turn around, across them then if you try to jump you just give a normal jump forward.\n\nEDIT: There is one more issue I forgot to bring up, the springs. They are attrocious, the hitboxes are dead center on the spring and only a couple of pixels, which makes then a pain to use, these should be made larger in a future update, otherwise it's hard to judge exactly where I am about to be launched into the air which just makes it easy to misjudge a jump from one spring to the next, which happens many times in this game, unless you somehow have a perfect landing technique.","March 27","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/recommended/296910/","Nico-Kun","¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/","653 products in account","Right from the start, 8BitBoy feels like a Super Mario clone. You jump over enemies to kill them, hit blocks with your hand (not your head!) to get power ups; there's even warp zones! Now, is this really a bad thing? Well, I'd say that it's more of a homage than a rip off. Sure, the similarities are there, and are pretty obvious, but I think that's the point of the game; to bring us back to that magical time in our childhood, in which simple graphics and simple gameplay were wonders.\n\nNow, even though it has similarities to Super Mario, it also feels quite unique. Rather than having a single fireball as a weapon, you can get up to two berries (what a great difference, you might be thinking, while rolling your eyes), well, in this game, you have two firing modes: forward, and upwards (diagonally). This can add a bit of an advantage for dealing with enemies. There's also many secret areas in each level, some providing alternate routes, and I'd add that it has pretty good level design, some of them can be quite challenging, but, once again, they remind me of the "old days" in which games felt challenging in a special way, requiring me to learn the quirks of the different levels and execute them perfectly in order to beat them.\n\nWhen it comes to story, it isn't very complex. You play as this depressed guy who misses the "good old days", and while messing around with his old 8-bit console, he gets transported into a mysterious game. I'd say that, in this game, story isn't important, just like it wasn't important in games like Super Mario; we rescued the princess because that's what we were told to do (and, in fact, we weren't even told that we were looking for a princess until we beat the first world). It does add some background information, but, as I said, it's not really necessary for a game of this type. As for the soundtrack, it's pretty simple, since it keeps the 8-bit theme this game follows. Even then, it's pleasing to the ears, nothing too annoying or anything like that.\n\nWell, to conclude, I'd say that I recommend this game, especially to those of you who enjoyed platforming games like Super Mario Bros in your childhood.","March 27","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It pushes all my oldskool buttons, the good ones but sadly enough the bad ones too.\n\nThe good parts:\n- 8-bit graphics.\n- Nostalgia for older players like me.\n- Simple yet deep. Easy controls but secrets everywhere.\n- A save system!\n\nThe bad parts:\n- Hard.\n- Nothing that's not been done over a million times already.\n- Remember the frustration when dying and losing your upgrades/items/stuff? Be prepared to experience it again and again.\n\nThe conclusion:\nHonestly, the frustration got to me. I have gotten older and time has become a luxury. So, sorry, 8BitBoy, It was fun while it lasted. Lastly, gamepad recommended over mouse & keyboard.  I give it a 5/10.","January 2","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I mean early.\nThis is no beefed up rosy eyed retro remake.\nThe game runs fairly sedately relying more on good level design than trying to simply overwhelm the player.\nThe resolution is low but still feels right. The sound has that ad-lib feel of the early PC gaming days when shareware would have been the only source for this. Unless of course you owned a certain console featuring a certain italian plumber.\nThose are the plus points. One of the few criticisms I can make is that the levels are a bit short.\nThat aside we're talking about a very keen price and a 90mb download so essentially it is still well worth the money.

From huge levels with multiple routes to fun powerups, this title does a good job of saluting bygone greats while remaining an enjoyable game on its own. What 8BitBoy does lack is the Steam basics for a game of its price, like achievements, leaderboards, and trading cards, but if you enjoy retro 8-bit platformers, this game certainly delivers at a fair price.\n\nRead the full review for this game and many more at Budget Gaming Review!\nhttp://www.budgetgamingreview.com/2015/08/8bitboy.html","August 16, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In fact, even the character looks like Mario.\n\nBesides, the character looking like Mario, the gameplay is also very similar to Super Mario Brothers. In 8BitBoy, the character breaks blocks with its head, collect coins, jump on enemies and even shoot fireballs.\n\nThe game world also feels very much like Super Mario Brothers. Even some of the sounds are very similar, if not exactly the same, as those in Super Mario Brothers.\n\nI know, this review is for 8BitBoy but, unfortunately, the game just reminds me of Super Mario Brothers every time I look at it, every time I see it and every time I play it.\n\nOverall, I think 8BitBoy is a good game to get specially if you are into old-school retro-style platform games. It has that 80's look and feel, it's easy to play and it has a lot of secrets for you to discover.\n\nWith that said, my rating for 8BitBoy for this review is a very positive 7 out of 10. It's not perfect and it didn't blow me away but I enjoyed playing it.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0uTrIkXgSk","July 14, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It does what it says on the tin, which in this case is '8-Bit Platformer'. Admittedly it's an 8-Bit STYLE platformer, and the things it does well are not what makes it stand out.\n\nThis is - put simply - a polished platformer. My one and only complaint (which is rather a big one, thinking about it) - is the ending...\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nThe game gives you the option of choosing between two difficulties at the beginning, so - I plumped for the more casual setting, as I wanted to enjoy the game in a relaxed manner. One of the extras you must complete in the 'Hard' difficulty, is to obtain a hidden coin in each level before you can progress (and it turns auto save off, so... I guess you just do it yourself..?\n\nAnyway - come to the end of the game on casual mode, and the game informs me after the final boss that I need to go back and collect all the hidden coins before I can get the ending.\n\nNO EXCUSES, AWFUL GAME MECHANIC RIGHT THERE. I have no desire whatsoever to repeat each level and find a coin for some arbitrary reason (the button that takes me home needs power! Feed it coins to activate it!).\n\n[/spoiler alert]\n\nSo, with that in mind, I still recommend the game, since it was fun to play, but that ending does need tidying up, for I was not rewarded whatsoever for my effort, and have been turned off ever wishing to try. Maybe one day...\n\nNEW PLAYERS: PICK THE HARD MODE OR FACE CRUSHING DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\nI have produced a video series on this game, so - decide for yourself! (I even found no less than three of the hidden warp-zones, pretty pointless though, given my spoiler text!).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCwZpiJ0wAk","April 12, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

She had been looking for ages upon years and was no closer to the capture of her quarrying.\n\n"It has been many months why have you not found Osama Bin Laden?" Asked Joseph Bradley with frustration.\n\n"I am trying but it is hard. He hides from justice like moon hides from the sun." Maya responded with exasperation tears.\n\n"You must keep on the hunt and be ready for the pounce, America needs you." Said Joseph Bradley as he walked out.\n\n"Where are you Osama Bin Laden?!" Cried out Maya with fist raised to sky.\n\nMaya traveled all over world to but was no closer to the villain. She traveled to lands of desert and sand like Pakistan and Afghanistan but it was no use. Full of exhaustion and depression she went back to room to sleep.\n\n"It is no use I am useless." Said Maya as she cried herself to slumber tears. In her dreams of sleeping agony Osama Bin Laden was running from her but she could not capture. He was giggling like school girl and ducking in rabbit holes.\n\n"Heehee you cannot catch me." Said Osama Bin Laden as he leaped into rabbit hole. Maya jumped in after him and stumbled into twisting tunnel of spiraling chaos. When sliding finally ended she found herself in room at last cornering Osama Bin Laden.\n\n"Hoohooheehee." Said Osama Bin Laden as he split into 20 Osama Bin Ladens!\n\n"Nooooo." Cried out Maya in panic. Maya could not tell which Osama Bin Laden was Osama Bin Laden and her body filled with distraught. Then with suddenness Orange figure filled with manly presence appeared and breathed fire on the Osama Bin Ladens burning them all to cinder. After Osama Bin Laden burning, the figure of mystery stared at Maya with eyes of fiery fury. After looking, the figure disappeared into sunset and Maya woke up in her room. She was covered with sweating and was trembling at power she had witnessed.\n\n"Who was that awesome power and what could this mean?" Thought Maya to herself as she shook with amazement.\n\nAs Maya sat in thoughtfulness on her bed she heard phone ring with alarming.\n\n"Hello this is Maya who is talking?" Asked Maya with questions as she answered the phone.\n\n"This is Leon Panetta of the CIA we need you to come to CIA Headquarters right now for update." Answered the voice with authority.\n\n"Ok sir I am on my way." Responded Maya with obedience.\n\nMaya flew to Washington DC USA and walked into CIA building with anxiousness. She was full of nerves since for all of her searching she was no closer to the founding. Inside she went to the elevator and hit on the button for CIA Headquarters. When she arrived at CIA Headquarters Leon Panetta and Joseph Bradley were sitting at table awaiting reports.\n\n"Well Ms. Maya what is your status, have you found the fiend?" Asked Leon Panetta with inquisition.\n\n"Yes surely you must have succeeded after all this time only a total failure would have nothing." Scolded Joseph Bradley with jeering.\n\nMaya looked down at her feet and tears fell from her eyes like drops of sadness from pools of regret.\n\n"I AM A FAILURE." Cried out Maya as she collapsed on her knees.\n\n"If top notch CIA agent Maya can not find Osama Bin Laden than all hope is truly lost." Said Leon Panetta with sad resignation.\n\nThen in the hour of dire despair when all hope was gone to death and dust, a figure of awesome power burst through wall riding a Custom Harley Davidson Motorcycle and wearing cool poncho with lasagna insignia while Scorpions "Rock you like a Hurricane" played for all to hear. The figures eyes burned like searing orbs of roaring lasagna.\n\n"GARFIELD?!" Cried out Leon Panetta and Joseph Bradley in unison.\n\nMaya looked on in amazement wonder for it was the mysterious figure of her dreams.\n\n"Who is this marvel man?" Thought Maya as she stared at him.\n\n"I am here in country of America land of freedom yet I am hearing the whines of babies." Said Garfield with disgust.\n\n"But we are lost of hope. Osama Bin Laden will never be found we have looked everywhere." Cried Joseph Bradley with whimpering.\n\n"It is true it is impossible. I have looked world over with CIA expertise, no one can find him." Said Maya with doubting words.\n\n"Fools. I will find this Osama Bin Laden and bring justice to him like justice has never been brought." Garfield roared with knowing.\n\n"But you cannot you are not CIA super agent! Osama Bin Laden can be everywhere!" Protested Maya with defiance.\n\nGarfield stepped off Motorcycle with his masculine feet and walked over to model globe in the corner with strut of cool confidence. Garfield spun the globe and then stopped it with one finger.\n\n"OSAMA BIN LADEN IS THERE." Declared Garfield with his finger on the globe.\n\n"Of course." Said Leon Panetta in awe of Garfield.\n\n"Now that the prey is found it is time for the hunting to begin." Garfield said as he loaded his Desert Eagle for justice dispensing.\n\n"Garfield wait you will need Seal Team Six." Cautioned Leon Panetta with wary words.\n\n"This is my Seal Team Six." Garfield replied pointing to his toned abs.\n\nLeon Panetta and Joseph Bradley nodded in agreement and examined with envy while Maya admired Garfield's toned body with careful inspection.\n\n"Will you need anything Garfield? Entire treasury of the USA is at your disposal." Informed Leon Panetta with offers.\n\n"I will need Bachelor Pad Villa and weekend's worth of lasagna and refreshments. Before I am finding deviants for destruction I am going to be having one hell of a bash." Garfield replied with righteousness.\n\n"Sir this is most out of ordinary and can not be allowed!" Protested Maya in defiance.\n\n"Very well Garfield it will be done." Agreed Leon Panetta with wisdom.\n\n"That is more like it. Now if you are excusing me I have party to attend to," Garfield said as he began to walk out. Before Garfield left he turned to Maya and looked her up and down with approval. "Hey there my spicy spy. Why don't you come by later to see what life in the fast lane is all about." Garfield said with a wink.\n\n"Why you..!" Gasped Maya with appalling.\n\n"Think about it my CoveOps cutie." Garfield Replied with flirting as he handed Maya his address and walked out of room.\n\n"Sir we our professionals we cannot allow this recklessness! This is against all rules!" Maya said with insistence.\n\n"Garfield does not live by our rules. He follows a higher code." Leon Panetta informed with truth.\n\n"A real man like that respects only the law of lasagna and steel." Said Joseph Bradley with humble respect of Garfield.\n\nMaya shook her head in disbelief and left office in disgust.\n\n"One day she will understand." Leon Panetta Said with wise words.\n\nMaya was driving home in her car with angry steering. She could not believe the galling words that entered her ears that day. She was cool calm professional woman and had no patience for the manly boldness of Garfield. Although filled with the anger she could not stop thinking about his rugged manliness and was fascinated by him. She decided to go to his Bachelor Pad Villa and confront him with her thoughts.\n\n"I must find what makes the man tick." Thought Maya as she drove with agility to Garfield's Bachelor Pad Villa.\n\nOn arrival at Garfield's Bachelor Pad Villa she saw sight of splendor. Cool music was playing as hot ladies in bikinis were all around sipping champagne and eating fine lasagna. All around were decorations of highest cost. Exotic Erotic Art and Palm trees were all around for mood making. In courtyard Maya saw Garfield lounging by poolside with hot sexy ladies all around. Garfield was smoking lasagna cigarette as sexy bikini ladies rubbed suntan oil on his shirtless body. Garfield saw Maya approach and interest peaked at sight of new sexy lady.\n\n"Hey there my fiery fox I am glad to see you showed up." Garfield said with suaveness.\n\n"Do not be getting your hopes up. I am only here for discussion." Responded Maya with rebuffing.\n\n"Very well chicky baby, ask away."

Obviously is something wrong with the game itself. It is fun I will have to admit. THERE IS CONTROLLER SUPPORT. If there wasnt, i honestly wouldnt have this much time on it as i do now. A platformer like mario, without controller support is not worth it at all. So thank you Dev for making that possible. Even though theres only a need for 2 buttons and a Directional Pad. Good job there Dev\n\nI immediatly noticed the frame drop though. THis is obviously something within the program that you are using, or the build of the game, so it would be nice to actually play the game with more frames then the old nintendo itself :O\n\nOther then that the games pretty Decent. The monsters are nice, the music is nice, and everyhing else is good too. When using a controller though, adjust it so the speed at witch you move the cursor at the main menu is faster, seems very slow.\n\nThe game is nice, worth whatever price i paid during the holiday sale.

Throw it again without moving, goes on a completely different path.)\n-Tries to be 8-bit, but instead produces 16-bit graphics.\n-Auto-walks into the tutorial and forcing users into it.

Much like Giana Sisters back in the day, it's obvious where the inspiration came from - but something feels really off and the result is a bit rubbish. While it reminds me of Mario, the physics and responsiveness of the controls aren't quite the same - making 8BitBoy feel more floaty and less responsive than it should be. 8BitBoys hitbox is kinda big and occasionally I spotted hitdetection issues which somehow seem to be a common problem with all of these modern indie-retrogames. This behaviour combined with somewhat weird physics can turn some stages and especially the bossfights into real nightmares.\n\nFor whatever reason the game plays out Super Mario Bros. 1 style the first time around (all levels have to be completed in a row) before unlocking a World Map after beating the final boss, allowing you to revisit levels and look for collectibles that will unlock the true ending. The big problem here is that you can easily screw yourself over the first time around, entering certain stages "naked" - and making things a lot harder for yourself. This wouldn't be such a big deal if I was allowed to go to the world map, grab a power up or two or go back to an earlier stage or whatever.\n\nBe prepared for frustration as you enter death-loops until you find that room with enough coins to grant you a power-up or an item to up your chances for survival (you can always "git gud" as well ;)). Should you be stuck on a boss, have fun re-watching the boss intro each time as well as seeing the completely pointless continue-screen every couple of lives - (5-B in particular made me really mad). It really doesn't seem like much thought has been put into these aspects and they hurt the game - since you can't go anywhere else or stock up on items, frustration might happen.\n\nOn the plus-side, the levels aren't too bad in a late 80ies kind of way with lots of hidden areas and warpzones all around.   Pretty fair and easy for the most part, had like two or three levels where I struggled for a bit but the rest was pretty easy (didn't care going for collectables though, I hate that kind of stuff - rushing through the 50 levels took me a bit over 2 hours). 8BitBoy isn't complete trash, but could use a bit more polish here and there, especially in the "precision platforming"-department. Personally, I'd rather play an actual game from the era that 8BitBoy is mimicking than 8BitBoy itself.","January 3","false","2.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","3"

But that's not exactly a compliment. What I mean is, the controls are a bit clunky for a platformer, but once you get used to them the game is not half bad, considering I got it for $0.16 in those Steam auctions. I decided to finish it and review it anyway.\n\nUnfortunately the game is backwards! The first world is not really engaging, the sound track chiptune eats away at your brain and the first boss is unnecessarily frustrating. Admittedly the game does get better as you play in to it, as I will explain in detail in a second, but I have to ask why... why not engage the players early? Oh well. Probably why it was $0.16. I'll get all the bad things out of the way first.. but where do I start? Ok, let's start with probably my biggest peeve, the "secret" areas. I put secret in quotation marks because well they aren't really that secret. They're ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere! There are probably 5 or so secrets per level, 8 levels per world, 5 worlds. That's a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of secret areas, you kinda get tired of them after a little while. Mainly because the rewards in them are often petty or you are forced to risk your life or fight a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of enemies to get to a chance of a good reward. Yeah ♥♥♥♥ that. I learnt quickly to skip the secrets. But sometimes you can't skip them! There were times where you see a ledge, and you jump, and then, ohhh ♥♥♥♥ invisible wall - you're dead. Mother ♥♥♥♥er..\n\nWhat next? The bugs? After collecting a token and entering a secret world where sprint is disabled, when you get back to the main game, sprinting and shooting is still disabled. You have to quit the game and re-open your save file to be able to do it again. How did they miss that? Actually it kinda made the game more fun and challenging the first time it happened. I thought it was intentional, and played the level without shooting. It made me realize that the power-ups are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and overpowered. There's also a few collision detection bugs, which you do NOT want in a platformer. There were times where things did not even touch me, but they still killed me. Other times where I quite literally dodged a bullet, because the bullet hitboxes are so tiny, they can sometimes pass right through you and not hurt you. In parts where you aren't meant to control your character, you can still press the down and left key, making your character moonwalk or butt-slide. Not game breaking, more humorous actually.\n\nArtwork! Now this is gonna be a bit of a mixed answer. I loved and hated it. I loved the art style on the enemies and some parts of the map, they were really detailed. However, other parts of the map objects and the main character sprite were really lacking. They looked a bit rushed. If you take a look at this video I made of the world 5 boss fight you can see what I mean. The boss is really detailed but some other things like the player, the flag, the user interface are really poorly done. They just don't sit well next to each other and just give the overall look of it being put together a bit quickly. Some improvement here and with the clunky gameplay would have really improved this game substantially.\n\nAlright, better talk about some things that were enjoyable. A lot of the mechanics were ♥♥♥♥ing god awful like the inverse Mario style blocks that broke when you jump on them or cactus enemies that hide behind other cacti so you can't see them. They're also introduced so ♥♥♥♥ing poorly, you don't even know it's coming - it just hits you. You are meant to let players learn new ♥♥♥♥ before just throwing it at them! ♥♥♥♥! Ok, meant to be saying nice things. Some mechanics were cool.. I was really impressed with the sinking sand in world 2. I actually really liked where they took that. I was actually thinking "hey they should have a level where you race the sinking sand" and lo and behold, 2 levels later they did it! The snow world was a bit cooler too. Lots of new stuff implemented here, the guys throwing the snow balls were pretty cool, although if you had max power ups you could wreck them pretty easily. The boss fights got more fun as the game progressed too, which was nice because I nearly quit the ♥♥♥♥ing game after World 2's boss fight cause it was so infuriating.. The map design in the final world was really fun in a not-too-easy but still challenging way.Where the rest of the game was either easy, or ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Last world was right in the middle. This may have been because I was slowly getting used to the awkward controls, but hey, that's old school game progression for you, right?\n\nOverall verdict - it was worth what I paid? I guess?","April 14, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is a tribute to Giana Sisters, Wonderboy in Monsterland, Psycho Fox, Rick Dangerous, Megaman, Super Mario Bros and Sonic the Hedgehog as it has an element of all those games in one way or another, still it has a significant feel to it, to be an independent title.\n\nThe sound can be grating and the graphics slightly cheesy/corny, but that is the way it is designed, again giving homage to that era of gaming. The game's strength is it's game-play. There are five worlds, 56 levels, 300 hidden locations, and 50 secret coins to find in order to get the TRUE ending.\n\nThe game literally is what saved the designer Ramus from unemployment and gave him the ability to support his family somewhat, so this game is close to his heart. You can tell this as the designer is by no means finished with it and is still continuing to update it. He has redesigned levels and is planning to add achievements and a 'secret finder' tally.\n\nIt's the most fun I have had with a game for a long while. It's challenging and enjoyable finding all those secret places. If you love games like Mario and your one of those people who has to get every coin.

But that's not exactly a compliment. What I mean is, the controls are a bit clunky for a platformer, but once you get used to them the game is not half bad, considering I got it for $0.16 in those Steam auctions. I decided to finish it and review it anyway.\n\nUnfortunately the game is backwards! The first world is not really engaging, the sound track chiptune eats away at your brain and the first boss is unnecessarily frustrating. Admittedly the game does get better as you play in to it, as I will explain in detail in a second, but I have to ask why... why not engage the players early? Oh well. Probably why it was $0.16. I'll get all the bad things out of the way first.. but where do I start? Ok, let's start with probably my biggest peeve, the "secret" areas. I put secret in quotation marks because well they aren't really that secret. They're ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere! There are probably 5 or so secrets per level, 8 levels per world, 5 worlds. That's a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of secret areas, you kinda get tired of them after a little while. Mainly because the rewards in them are often petty or you are forced to risk your life or fight a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of enemies to get to a chance of a good reward. Yeah ♥♥♥♥ that. I learnt quickly to skip the secrets. But sometimes you can't skip them! There were times where you see a ledge, and you jump, and then, ohhh ♥♥♥♥ invisible wall - you're dead. Mother ♥♥♥♥er..\n\nWhat next? The bugs? After collecting a token and entering a secret world where sprint is disabled, when you get back to the main game, sprinting and shooting is still disabled. You have to quit the game and re-open your save file to be able to do it again. How did they miss that? Actually it kinda made the game more fun and challenging the first time it happened. I thought it was intentional, and played the level without shooting. It made me realize that the power-ups are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and overpowered. There's also a few collision detection bugs, which you do NOT want in a platformer. There were times where things did not even touch me, but they still killed me. Other times where I quite literally dodged a bullet, because the bullet hitboxes are so tiny, they can sometimes pass right through you and not hurt you. In parts where you aren't meant to control your character, you can still press the down and left key, making your character moonwalk or butt-slide. Not game breaking, more humorous actually.\n\nArtwork! Now this is gonna be a bit of a mixed answer. I loved and hated it. I loved the art style on the enemies and some parts of the map, they were really detailed. However, other parts of the map objects and the main character sprite were really lacking. They looked a bit rushed. If you take a look at this video I made of the world 5 boss fight you can see what I mean. The boss is really detailed but some other things like the player, the flag, the user interface are really poorly done. They just don't sit well next to each other and just give the overall look of it being put together a bit quickly. Some improvement here and with the clunky gameplay would have really improved this game substantially.\n\nAlright, better talk about some things that were enjoyable. A lot of the mechanics were ♥♥♥♥ing god awful like the inverse Mario style blocks that broke when you jump on them or cactus enemies that hide behind other cacti so you can't see them. They're also introduced so ♥♥♥♥ing poorly, you don't even know it's coming - it just hits you. You are meant to let players learn new ♥♥♥♥ before just throwing it at them! ♥♥♥♥! Ok, meant to be saying nice things. Some mechanics were cool.. I was really impressed with the sinking sand in world 2. I actually really liked where they took that. I was actually thinking "hey they should have a level where you race the sinking sand" and lo and behold, 2 levels later they did it! The snow world was a bit cooler too. Lots of new stuff implemented here, the guys throwing the snow balls were pretty cool, although if you had max power ups you could wreck them pretty easily. The boss fights got more fun as the game progressed too, which was nice because I nearly quit the ♥♥♥♥ing game after World 2's boss fight cause it was so infuriating.. The map design in the final world was really fun in a not-too-easy but still challenging way.Where the rest of the game was either easy, or ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Last world was right in the middle. This may have been because I was slowly getting used to the awkward controls, but hey, that's old school game progression for you, right?\n\nOverall verdict - it was worth what I paid? I guess?","April 14, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It reminds me of crystal caves, super mario bros, or mutant mudds.  I thought it was great.  The controls feel solid and precise, and there's a run button, but I don't think you even need it to win.  There's 50 levels, plus bonus levels.  In addition to that, there's also a special token you can find in each of the levels ala collecting star coins in NSMB, and that really opens up the game for exploration giving it more play time.  It's a very fair game, that's difficult at times, but when I lost I only had myself to blame.

For full review, please look below.\n\n8BitBoy is a 'retro' style game created to pay homage to the old 8bit platformers of yester-century.  Sound good? There are quite a few problems I have with this game:\n\n- By all means, pay homage to your childhood games. However, there's a line where paying homage turns into gameplay plagiarism/copying. And sadly. 8BitBoy crossed that line. The similarities to Mario are just way too much for this game to be enjoyable. Every level in this game made me feel like I've played it before - and I have.. on a better game.\n\n- 8BitBoy promises to bring nostalgia galore from the NES era with an 8Bit classic game. Oh wait... is it 8Bit? Hell no, the graphics more resemble a 16 video game and the colour palette is definitely not something out of the NES. It would really help to make your game 8 Bit if your game is called '8BitBoy'!.\n\n- The music is... okay. It does a decent job on providing a 16 bit (cough, cough) experience to the game. However, the sound effects are nothing short but painful. If you intent to play this, do not play with headphones unless you happen to like the smell of blood dropping out of your eyes.\n\n- The game.. well it lacks 'fun'. The controls are awkward, mapping the run button to the fire button was NOT a good idea. The hitboxes are off and the game leaves you wanted a better made, finished game rather than an uninspired mess.    I do not enjoy playing this game - it doesn't entertain me. That is not a good recipe for a video game.\n\n\nSo what then? What do I play, may you ask?\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/250760/\nThat's called Shovel Knight. It's a homage to old NES era platformers while bringing something inspiring and new to the table. I think Polygon put it best.\n\n"Shovel Knight is so much more than a love letter to the genre — it is, in fact, the kind of game people write love letters about." - Polygon\n\nAnd that's what 8BitBoy isn't. 8BitBoy is an unfinished love letter with terrible grammar - with classic lines as 'I wuv you' - and includes terrible references to other famous love letters but gets the references wrong every single time.\n\nI think that's how I'll leave this game. It's a 'terrible love letter' to retro gaming.\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E-46yHzkxg/","March 31","false","0.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","1"

It took me 3 months to consider this as good or bad and unfortunately, I cannot post a mixed review.\n\nGot this for free off of PC Gamer and was intrigued by the name.  "8bitboy".   I instantly got it, but grew pale when I saw "No Steam Achievements"....another game would taint my library...gathering dust due to the lack of incentive to play the game.   But the name kept intriguing me, whispering in my ear.  "8 bit....8 bit..."\n\nMuch like our depressing hero, I decided “what the hell” and booted it up.  I was instantly met with the hero of our story, a depressing individual who seems to be on the verge of suicide (sadly, his life seems similar to that of some real people with some feelings of self-disappointment we feel from time to time)…the music doesn’t help this mood either as the player gets the vibe that this guy really will kill himself.   After plugging in a mysterious game into his console, he’s teleported to a videogame world.  This begins our tale of this Mario/Giana Sisters game.\n\n\nPROS:\nGreat message for a true ending  (  What a great feeling it is to do something because you want to.  Believing in yourself gives your life purpose.  )\nDecent Mario/Giana Sisters clone\nRetro and nostalgic\n\nCONS:\nSuper depressing story (yet real to some people)\nRunning and jumping left is impossible\nJumping in general can be unresponsive at certain points.\nJumping is floaty (one level demands perfect jumping in an ice area right before the exit)\nLack in enemy variety (World-specific cosmetic clones in each world)\nBosses are all the same except with new gimmicks/tricks each world (so…5 big, fat owls)\nNot worth paying full price ($4)\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is essentially more like Giana Sisters than Mario as your fireballs don’t bounce, but fly and bounce off walls.  It’s a somewhat decent and difficult game (for the wrong reasons), but it’s not worth the money.  It's not terrible, but it's not great by any means.  I found myself depressed and frustrated during this game.   The ending was decent, but I don't think it was worth all the anger, frustration, and depression along the way.\n\nIf you already have the game, try it out.   If you don’t have it, you’re probably better off without this one in your library.  If you still want this game, wait for a sale, a bundle, or a giveaway (like PC Gamer).  Overall, I would prefer playing Mario or Giana Sisters over this.  (And you can find Mario anywhere now...just not on Steam)\n\n3/10  (Decent, but not worth the money.  Needs fixing.  Depressing)","January 7","false","7.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

But when you run, you carry far too much momentum and don't stop where you want to (which the dev could fix) but it just doesn't have the feel of the old platformer games (which the dev says inspired this game).\n\nJumping: The jumping in this game is just off, you think you would have to run further to get enough speed to jump further/higher right? wrong. You seem to have to jump almost as soon as you start running or else you wont make certain jumps, which is just stupid.\n\nOverall: I would not recommend this game to anyone, old school platform lovers, people wanting to try a platformer for the first time etc etc. Just do NOT buy this, I would get a refund but I got this for free so I do not have to worry about that.\n\nSave yourself money and disappointment, do not get this game.","September 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

It is called "8BitBoy" but the art style is that of a 16 bit game.\n\nSpeaking of art, the art design is uninspired and tacky. The levels and characters are the most basic enemy types with garish colors.\n\nLevel design is incredibly dull and at times atrocious (some secrets you can't get to or get out of, although if it's just me being terrible, I can admit that)\n\nMusic is repetitive and forgetable.\n\n"Story", a 20-some year old man who wants to just play his old video games again and gets trapped in an old video game console, is incredibly groan-worthy. Also, for furhter notes, if you are going to have a gaint wall of text over a static image on a black background, I would stay away from that (see what I said about the Art Design)\n\nAnd worse of all, some levels dropped to 19 FPS. Not because there are too many enemies or a lot going on in the level or enviroment (because you can go through all of world 1 with around 60 fps). It drops for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe one good thing I can think of is that it gave you a FPS counter. But that was a double-edge sword now wasn't it?\n\nSo, I wouldn't really recommend this game.","December 15, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While fairly competent as a platformer from a technical point of view, it quickly becomes very, very dull; after the first few levels, you have seen practically everything the game has to offer, and while new enemy types are added throughout the game, none of them really provide enough of a challenge to combat that boredom. The graphics and sounds are alright, nothing to write home about but neither are particularly offensive and they do their job well. The levels can be at times fairly elaborate and are overall quite well designed, with plenty of secrets and well-balanced difficulty, but the simplistic gameplay and complete and utter lack of innovation bury whatever potential the game might have had.","April 1","false","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Granted I didn't fight all the bosses (only 3 of 5), and I didn't play all the levels--which is a good thing in my opinion. Here's why I would recommend playing something else:\n\nCons:\nThe character movement is challenging and seems inconsistent\nThere are issues with collison detection, blocks don't break\nYou move faster walking on treadmills than trying to run--running is slower and will cause death\nMany times you'll die because you must drop down and you're unable to see what's below you\nIt uses controller, but then has you move a mouse like finger around in the menu with the controller\n\nAll this was experience on Mac version 1.50--which is supposed to be a great stable version.\n\nI bought it cheap, beat (first part) in a couple hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/296910/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Wanted to like this game, and gave it every chance in the book, but it constantly shot itself in the foot with terrible and repetitive level design, poor platforming mechanics, and bad game design decisions. Lets start with good like always. The game works for the most part, with only a few bugs encountered. It kind of reminds you of old NES platformers, and mario that it clearly rips off. Also there are many secrets to be found most levels and alternate routes to uncover. Then there is the bad. People are right the games hitboxes are some of the worst I've ever seen in a platformer, I've jumped on people and been killed by them so many times it's ridiculous. Someone pointed out how stupid the game design is in the fact that if you die and still have lives left, you begin with nothing you had at the start of the last life, which is super stupid and no other games does. Why would he think that was a good idea. So you just kill yourself to get back to your first life, because you want your power ups. This wastes time and makes no more than 1 life worthwhile. There are basically 2 powerups, a shield and shooting fireballs, thats it the entire game, which is super boring and uninspiring. Then there are the gameplay mechanics. The running and jumping doesn't work half the time, if you try it on a short length platforms for some reason it doesn't read it sometimes and you just jump half way. Other times it won't read you jumping even though you press it before you are off. Other times on the moving tiles you will press it perfectly and once again you won't jump...herp derp. It is almost like there is too much of a delay. On the moving platforms you will press it right away and it still won't read it. Sometimes when you land on platforms you slide, dont ask me why. The worst part is the game level design. Where as mario has interesting levels with varying things like pipes and riding ♥♥♥♥ and different levels of things to jump on, 8 bit has the same levels and they are dumb. They are all basically levels 2/3 of it with fire/water/spike that are instant kills, and you just jump onto single little platforms. This is stupid for many reasons. First off my having every level be mostly instadeath, with no checkpoints, all of your powerups you got are usually worthless because you just die and at any time if the game mechanics don't hold up, and you restart the level. Mario didn't do this, it had flat surfac levels because people don't want to have to jump over level every 2 seconds. Also by making every platform just single platforms it artifically raises difficulty and is just sloppy design. Mario and other platformers aren't all just single jumps over lava. Could have spent time and been inventive instead of making the same level. The final boss is stupid as you can't get any powerups and have to go through these 3 different attacking forms before you can hit her once, and you have to do that at least 4 or more times. If you get hit once its all over and you have to redo it all. Not worth my time. Just not that good of a platformer, obsessed with instant death and single platforms, and the wonky mechanics and hitboxes make it more frustating than fun that you have to restart levels over and over when its not your fault. 4.5/10","March 10, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

If anything, this game resembles Superfrog - a billion levels with very little to set them apart from each other, and every single one is filled to the brim with secrets of varying usefulness and satisfaction upon collection. The way the stages are mostly built from a sprinkle of narrow little platforms also spells Superfrog, or a lackluster Mario hack rather than the real deal.\n\nThe features that do make me think of Mario, such as hitting blocks repeatedly for multiple coins, seem to have been borrowed without much thought. It's questionable whether these blocks were all that fun to begin with, but certainly no new ground is broken by placing them willy-nilly in empty corridors, especially in a game where separate 10-coin pickups exist.\n\nAside from being a mess of tiny blocks, the level design is repetitive with a noticeable lack of interesting enemy placement and unique stage features. Low-ceiling instakill pits abound. Enemies, on the other hand, usually present no challenge due to the player character's super overpowered projectile attacks that bounce everywhere and kill most baddies before they've properly entered the screen. The projectiles are lost upon death and require multiple pickups to regain, though, contributing to a shifty game balance.\n\nThe basic movement mechanics are solid enough, so if you really like bouncing around and finding a coin stash from every block of land big enough for one in an environment where nothing leaves a lasting impression, you will probably love this game. If you've actually played the nonspecific platforming greats this game tries to emulate, I'll be surprised if 8BitBoy leaves you satisfied. Unless, of course, the untouchable classic you were thinking of is Superfrog.","February 20, 2015","false","7.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","3"

That will make or break your enjoyment of this game, because it feels like the difficulty is based around mastering those kind of controls (which I personally never liked in the first place).  In a game like Super Meat Boy or Mega Man, you never feel like you died because of the controls, but I couldn't get over the sense of frustration in 8BitBoy.\n\nThe music is fine but nothing memorable, and the level designs are pretty blatant knockoffs of Super Mario World and the Super Mario Land games for Gameboy.  Collecting coins?  A plant that lets you shoot projectices?  Springs?  I wonder where you got those original ideas!?\n\nThey went for a retro feel with the intro cutscene, but they just look like flat line drawings in done in MS Paint.  Also, no one wants to read a wall of text before they play a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed platformer.  If you can't tell the story of a platformer through the gameplay, then the game doesn't need one.\n\nThe whole thing just feels like a really generic experience.  It's certainly not a *bad* game, but all it made me want to do was play Super Mario World instead.","May 6, 2014","false","0.2"," 74 of 160 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","74","160","0","4"

The only moment this runs well it's when it's indoors. And I've played it on version 1.5.3, I can't even imagine previous versions.\n\nSecond, the design level is so slow, in comparison to a TON of other platformers. I mean, I have to stop a lot of times to get past through obstacles, which shouldn't be bad, but I recognize the effort you put into designing alternatives routes in each level. This means that you wanted to remember the good old Sonic games. But these obstacles kill the pace, maybe too much to be enjoyable. It doesn't happen very often but when it does you notice.\n\nThird, the controls. I landed on a spring of sort, and because i was in the edge of it, I didn't jump and fell off a cliff. I can't count how many times this happened. And in the late stages of the game the springs multiply in appearence, so I have to be accurate many more times than needed. This also doesn't help.\n\nAnd you could use a little more variety on the enemies, since you just put a couple of snakes, some blobs that jump between cliffs, the typical flames that jump over lava, and birds, lots, lots of birds.\n\nThe best thing was when I died on a level, you restart the level expecting to have 3 lives... but you don't. You just have the lives that you had when you entered the level. WHAT THE F***? and the scoring system kept the score when you died, so the high score is the longest sitting you had during the game. I think that's not how the platforming mechanics should work.\n\n\n\n\nEven though, I see all the references from the 8-bit era, from sonic to super mario bros (instead of turtles, birds, I see what you did there), and the music is fine. not the best in the world, but it's enjoyable and it helps to continue. And there are a LOT of secrets, so if you're a completionist you're going to use your brain to find them all.\n\n\nBut I don't recommend it. Better luck next time.","October 28, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Casual game that you can play. It has over 12 hours of gameplay and it really is worth the $4 pricetag. It gives nostalgic feelings and makes you want to re-visit the days of 8bit arcade games.

I love the retro feel, but I grew up with old PC games, not console games. The dealbreaker here is the ridiculous time limit which can't even be turned off. Why put all kinds of secret stuff all over the level which seems to reward exploration, then force players to break their fingers trying to get through as fast as possible? Like I said, I'm not a console gamer. Maybe this kind of thing is de rigeur in console games but for me, it ruins what could have been a very fun game.","December 30, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
