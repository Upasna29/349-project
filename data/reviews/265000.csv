"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/265000/","rankmenotplz","ReadingLies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/","2045 products in account","Do you like some fast-paced ARPG Action with unique mechanics and competitive ladder with incentives? Then look no further. FORCED Showdown has it all!\nGame Overview\nFORCED Showdown is a fast-paced, top down action role-playing game with the elements of a card game combined through the gameplay. The setting of the game goes with the player participating as a gladiator on a galactice game show that is hosted by an AI called "C-SAR" (which means Computer Simulated Arena Referee).\n\nInitially, the only character that is available for play is "Squire of Light" and the first companion, "Xiao Long". As you progress through the game by clearing quests, you will be able to unlock other characters like "Volco" who is a heavy-hitting melee character, "Stormbringer" who specializes in long-ranged combat, and "Ravager" who is an agile close-combat fighter.\n\nThe game currently has three "Programs" for you to play in which serves as the campaign modes available for the game. There are also daily contents for you to participate which is a seeded mode for players worldwide to compete in the ladder.\n\nIn every "battle", you will start with four cards and one mana (though it might vary depending on the rules), you gain one of each after every arena you clear, but the effect of the cards will not persist after the battle. Defeating enemies can also drop specific trinkets which can heal you or give you points or gold. Also, upgrades or "boons" are received if you have accumulated enough "points" after every battle, and unlike the card effects, these effects persist for the whole program.\n\nAfter every program, which could end in either victory or defeat, you can earn gold that can be used in the Wheel of fortune which can either give you cards (which is separated in three different tiers: common, rare, and supreme), gold or shards that you can use to make cards yourself.\n\nThe Pros\nHigh Replay Value - In my opinion, the game's perfect timbre in terms of replayability roots in two aspects. The first one is interesting nature of the game being complex (due to the card game element added) despite having a straight-forward fast-paced action gameplay which lures you into playing more and more. The second one is the interactiveness of the game's community. Freebies, leaderboard and ranking incentives, and frequent updates by the developers contribute hugely to this.\n\nPerfect Difficulty Balance - How do you know that the game has a good balance in terms of difficulty? It's quite simple. If you push through the game and still enjoy it after hours of failing to complete a single session, then that is what a perfect difficulty setting is like. And this game will make you feel that way.\n\nBeautiful Visuals - The game is pretty (and somewhat flashy), which is pretty much visible with the contents posted for it. Not much that I can really say more to this one, except that the game really loves explosion effects.\n\nGreat Audio - Brilliant voice acting is present throughout the game and fits the comedic setting of it. Even the background music and the sound effects used are on point to each part which sets an awkward-free experience to the gameplay as a whole.\n\nSeason Ranking Incentives - This factor's importance might vary depending on how devoted you are to the game, but nevertheless it is an incentive for you to play more and more whichever way you take it. Honestly, this is a great move from the developers to make its community more involved into the game. For more information, visit the game's site here: http://forcedshowdown.com/watch/\nThe Cons\nMinor Game Bugs - Upon playing the game, I have encountered a few minor bugs within the arena gameplay and even in the menu. An example of a bug that I encountered from the arena is when my character was knock-backed out of bounds for a second, though there wasn't any negative impact after that. Another bug that I got from the menu was when I was using the wheel of fortune. Since you can only get two copies of the same card, the next one you get will automatically become shards. Though unfortunately, the shards weren't added to my total amount.\n\nLimited Variation in Characters - Right now, the game has a total of four (4) playable characters, three (3) companions (with some additional ones that you can have through certain rules and cards) and about less than ten (10) variations of bosses. While the variations that the playable characters and the companions give more than enough complexity and versatility for the community to play with and adapt to, the case of repetitiveness will still be present in the game and this factor will affect the game's longevity. And also, since it looks like the developers are aiming to make this game a mainstream contender, additional options is a must.\n\nThe Verdict\nI'll make my statement short: GET IT NOW! and I'm sure you won't regret it. Frequent updates is surely a big plus, as well as the promoted incentives for their top players.\n\nIf you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","April 20","true","20.7"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","39","42","2","0"

Gameplay closely resembles Gauntlet, or a much differently themed Binding of Isaac. It feels fluid and fast paced. The rouge-like strategy comes in the form of the in game card system. You will feel right at home if you ever played Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering. If you haven't its not incredibly complicated, but provides many options and strategies. Now, BetaDwarf delivers a game which blends a in-depth card game and an easy to pick up but difficult to master rouge-like twin stick shooter.\n\n*What do I think of Forced Showdown?*\n\nI love this game! I have played many hours of The Binding of Isaac, Terraria, Ziggarut, Rouge Legacy, RIsk of Rain and other rouge-likes you probably havent heard of. I have to say this game is among my favorites and its brand new. If the in-game season mode is implemented correctly I have no doubts this will be my favorite!\n\n*Why do you like this game?*\n\nMainly, the card deck customization is so great because it makes this rouge-like feel more like its in my control instead of "I hope I grab the right items so I can play the way I want". Getting new cards is not as grindy as Hearthstone and is paced excellently. This way, the replayablility, theory crafing and experiences are all fresh every time. Next, this game is challenging, but not unfair. This is a very hard thing to get right in a game and Forced Showdown delivers. Most rougelikes become very easy for me once I learn the mechanics, this game tests me at every step. Of course, none of this would matter if the gameplay wasnt fun or interesting, its great.\n\n*Any problems with the game?*\n\nI havent had any issues at all with this game since I bought it and put about 15 hours into so far (very strong by todays releases). The game has some slowdown in between rounds (1-2 seconds), but it never effects the actual gameplay.\n\n*Other thoughts?*\n\nIf you like any of these games I would seriously consider at least trying this game:\nThe Binding of Isaac\nHearthstone\nMagic the Gathering\nThe Diablo Franchise\nPath of Exile\nGauntlet\nRouge Legacy\n\n*Overall*\n\nFun: 9/10 - I have a great time playing through, learning, and playing different styles.\nPresentation 9/10 - Hits the game show theme, graphics are servicable.\nMechanics 9/10 - Game flat out nails combat and the card system. Game isnt bare but would love more content.\nReplayability 9.5/10 - With the new cards you earn, new ways to play. Keeps me coming back.\nReliabilty 9/10 - Game doesn't crash, haven't seen any bugs. Though, I have a monster computer and it stutters when rounds are over.\n\n","April 4","true","14.7"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","42","50","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/recommended/265000/","Arrgeron","Morse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/","602 products in account","Forced showdown is a twinstick shooter rogue-like card game. Thats obviously a lot of descriptors, so the worry would be does it handle those things well. I would say yes, but it does have its problems. The core gameplay is very fun, at least with the 'main' character and the bow and arrow guy. The other two characters, in my opinion, aren't as fun to play with. They are, at least early on, difficult to play as because the game rewards a conservative playstyle and the two melee characters aren't really conservative at all.\n\nSo, the game is like an arena TV show. Your working towards the final boss and you have cameras following you around during every arena. You fight enemies, then you reach a boss. Two bosses, you fight a boss that opens a door. Do that a few times and you beat a show. Sounds like a lot, and it is. You'll probably die. Winning a run isn't easy. You have to be good/lucky, and just hope you survive and get the right cards.\n\nCards. So, you have a pre built deck and you can also build a deck out of cards you earn by earning gold, and spinning for them. The card building has a super Hearthstone vibe, but there are very few cards that reach that level of complexity, most cards are very very simple. +80 health, +45% damage. There are more interesting cards but these passive upgrades are what I usually build my deck around, because its a guarenteed upgrade unlike spells and consumables which usually have some condition.\n\nThis game, at least in the beta build I played, has some issues. It runs kinda like crap, it lags frequently at the end of battles and I had it crash on me once. Luckily, it doesn't often lag during a big fight, although it can happen. I hope there is a day one patch that fixes this, and if there is I will update. I also have an issue, but its probably just preference, where the games kinda last a long time. It can take 90 minutes to get to the end of a run, and then you just lose. Luckily there are quests and you get gold for cards so its not like you just got nothing, but doing a 90 minute run and losing can be upsetting. I would have preferred if a run was a bit shorter and not as drawn out.\n\nI discovered this game on twitch, and because of twitch the game will launch with a 12% discount(I'll get a higher one for getting a beta key). I would definitely recommend it at its base price if the idea of a twin-stick roguelite card game appeals to you. It definitely appeals to me. The game handles deck building, twin-stick shooting and its rogue-like elements very well.\n\nBuy At Full Price","March 29","true","13.8"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","42","51","0","0"

Not good, not great, but amazing!\n\nAnd here's why:\n\n1. The combat is enjoyable the way you would expect from an action rpg like torchlight. It is fast paced, but you have the time to think about your actions at the same time. It is simple, yet skillbased.\n\n2. 4 heroes, who feel different. They are different enough to make sure, that there is a character for every type of player. And on top of that, you can customize each one of them with a unique deck.\n\n3. Speaking of decks! This is not just a gimmick. Fans of deckbuilding games will have an incredibly enjoyable time with this part of the game. You can play each character in an unlimited number of ways depending on the deck you choose to take into the arena.\n\n4. Random stuff. If you like the randomness of Binding of Isaac, you will love this too. There are random arenas with random enemies with random buffs. The boss has a random effect on the arena, and you will get random boons along the way. There are so much random stuff that I couldn't write all of it here. The great thing is - You never feel helpless in the same way, Isaac makes you feel. The random stuff is there to help you (mostly), and it feels great.\n\n5. Cards... Come on - you get to spend ingame gold to buy a ticket for the  card-lottery machine. I imagine spending 100s of hours earning gold and spending it on more rolls in the lottery. Its like opening boosters, but with INGAME GOLD!!!!\n\n6. Cute pets. I don't need to say more about this... but I will - Some of them are called puffs, who give you a bonus if you make it through an arena without it getting killed.\n\n7. Interesting bosses. These guys are like vanilla WOW bosses. They are challenging and rewarding at the same time.\n\n8. Difficulty. The first hour of the game, I was like "Man, this game is too easy". Boy, was I wrong. At the second level of difficulty, the bosses also start drawing random cards against you. I got curbstomped haaard. And I loved it.\n\nThere are a few cons to the game though.\n\nThe servers aren't very responsive. I got kicked out in the middle of doing a daily, and couldn't connect back up to the server again :( This will no doubt get fixed, but its still annoying.\n\nThere seems to be a slight issue where the game almost crashes. Sometimes the game freezes in a loading screen and windows tells me that the program has stopped responding. It comes right back up a few moments later, but apparently windows detects a freeze which isn't good.\n\n\n\nAs you can probably read, I am already a fan. I will keep playing this for a long time to come (hopefully), and if I find more stuff worth mentioning, I will update this.\n\nBUY IT NOW!","March 31","true","9.0"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","35","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/265000/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","FORCED SHOWDOWN is an action indie RPG game, a successor to FORCED: Slightly Better Edition, a well-known co-op RPG game.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You are in some kind of a game show, where you are FORCED (see what I did there?) to fight enemies that are placed across the level. They get tougher after each stage, but you do as well.\n\nPros:    Graphics | The game truly looks amazing! Levels look great, they have a lot of little details that fill the screen and make everything look good. I'm talking about torches, flowers, barrels and so on. Variety is also a big advantage, as levels look different from one another. If you're interested about graphic settings, there is plenty of them.\nAmount of Gameplay | There is a lot of gameplay included in this game. You have different campaigns, but you also have many quests to complete. Since campaigns are very full of content, there is also a great replayability value in this game.\nCards | This is (to some degree) also a card game. Let me explain this. You get a card every level and you can choose whether you want to use it or not. Every level, you also get some mana, which you need for activating the chosen card. If you want to activate a card that is really good, you will probably have to wait a few levels to save up enough mana to be able to use that card. I think that cards are a nice addition to the gameplay and it's great that's the game's focus is not completely on the cards, but just uses them as powerups and bonuses. If you want, you can also build your own decks. And if you don't want certain cards at the beginning, you can choose to change some of them to different ones (you don't know which new ones you will get, though).\nWeapons and Abilities | You can have different weapons and also different abilities, depending on what character you choose. Abilities do help a lot, unless you forget to use them like me :P Weapons are kind of cool, since they behave a bit differently than they do in other games. For example, continuously firing a laser gun for a few seconds will result in a huge blast at the end of that period, which will deal a great amount of damage. This also makes sure that you time your shots right and aim at the strongest enemy just when the blast is about to occur.\nCutscenes and Voice Acting | The cutscenes are well-made and are also voice acted by an announcer♥♥♥♥♥♥ee called C-SAR. He acts with a really exciting voice and together with sound effects and music, he really makes cutscenes great.\nMenu Appearance | I know that this is not affecting the gameplay, but a game also needs to take care of how it appears when a person first launches it. The mix of purple colours and just the right lightning definitely leaves a great first impression. The menu is also intuitive and easy to navigate.\nAchievements | There are more than 60 achievements in this game, which is great for some people who like to be complimented by the game for their marvelous actions and advanced skills. The achievements are also equally divided between different difficulties. By that I mean that some games have all achievements fairly hard to achieve or the exact opposite, but Showdown is not one of those games.\nController Support | I don't play with my controller very often, but this seemed like a good game to try playing it with my Steam Controller. I tried it and, to my surprise, the game played better than with a keyboard. I like the control layouts\nRegular Updates | Updates are coming very often, approximately one every week. And they're not just some small updates! They all have tons of added content, tweaks, fixes, balanced enemies and weapons, performance improvements and more. The gaming community certainly needs more active developers like this one.\nCons:    Performance Issues | Even though there were many fixes and the situation definitely did get better, I still experience some frame drops and lags. My computer also struggles a bit when I launch the game. But, as I said, the situation keeps getting better with almost every update, so I'm looking forward to seeing this game issue-free in near future.\nLoading Times | Not a big issue, since there are not many loading screens, but the ones that are present take a long time to do their job.\nEnemy Variety | Sometimes I feel like there are not enough different enemies. You rarely have to take different approaches in order to beat them. You don't have to adapt too much, they just get a bit stronger and maybe a bit more aggressive.\nLack of Minimap | In certain arenas, you could use a minimap to see the stage layout and maybe even enemy positions. This is not a major problem, though.\nTrading Cards | Sadly, they are not present. The developers have this one their list of planned stuff, but apparently, they're more busy with other things.\nWindows Only | There is no Linux and Mac support right now, but this is supposedly planned as well. We'll see how that goes.\nThe final verdict:Overall, this game is really good. There are a lot of good things and some bad things, but there is really no doubt about this game's quality. In case you haven't read the whole thing: the quality is high above average. I really like how this game looks and how it plays. I'm not the biggest fan of card games, but Showdown has them integrated in an unusual way that is, in my opinion, much better than in most games.\nThere are some issues in terms of performance and a lack of some features, but the updates are so frequent that I don't have any fear that everything is going to be fixed sooner or later.\nIf you like RPGs and if you liked the original Forced, definitely give this game a try. It's worth it.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","April 9","true","8.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","0"

Instead of relying on traditional itemization your upgrades are based on the cards that you put in your deck. What this does is allow you to customize how you want to play your champion while still keeping some of the random nature of a rogue-lite style game. While I don’t think the card system is going to be redefining any genres, it works well and the game represents one of the most polished twin stick shooters in recent times. The solid gameplay and well developed aesthetic gives the game a feeling of quality, much more so than the original FORCED. The game is good, very good but it’s also a game that I believe needs additional content in the future to keep players around. So far following this game I’ve come to trust the developers are planning on supporting this game to a great degree, and hopefully more campaigns and characters help flesh out an already great addition to the twin-stick genre.","March 29","true","31.0"," 41 of 62 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","41","62","0","2"

There was a game lurking in FORCED, a game that was just itching to get out. One where Betadwarf just cut loose with the crazy, went "You know what? Stuff all that stuff which says games need to be normal and based around the usual cliched tropes, let's go all out nutty and take what made Smash TV a hit, and go from there"\n\nIn comes FORCED SHOWDOWN. A game that pretty much has the Smash TV format combined with the quick levelling and rapid power gain of a MOBA and the moment to moment quick decisions required from a top down shooter. In short, it's -brilliant-. It's also pants on head crazy in places, which is something that for a Smash TV game is a near requirement, but we'll get to that in a moment.\n\nIt should be pointed out that this game very nearly didn't make it out of the blocks as the game it could have been, initially it went through Early Access, and it showed a lot of promise there, then it went to Kickstarter (which is a bit backwards, but bear with me) in order to raise the remaining funds to get the game polished and up to spec to get over the finish line. I actually backed the game at the thirty buck tier having decided that yes, this is a developer I feel is worth supporting and is worth my moneys. People who bought into this game at various stages took a risk, that risk has been rewarded, for all the Early Access disasters, this one shows that just occasionally, you get a diamond from the coal.\n\nSo that's the context, how do you end up in a TV show then?\nThe premise is simple enough, you are a contestant in a far future TV show - Forced: Showdown, your aim, win fame and fortune by murdering everything that isn't you for the benefit of studio audiences across the galaxy. You'll do this across a broad range of randomly generated arenas fighting things ranging from aliens to mideval blokes with swords, you'll also cross swords with "minor celebrities" such as Ratbo, who form the minor bosses of the game, and work your way up to the named finales of each season, gaining boons, earning coins and so on.\n\nThe moment to moment gameplay is going to be very familiar for anyone who has played a MOBA in the last five years, as it broadly takes the MOBA formula and then puts a "lite" CCG element on the top, before you begin, you build a character deck out of cards that you feel will give you the best shot at beating the challenges ahead (a bit like hand of fate), as you enter each arena, cards will be drawn from that deck, and presuming you have the mana, you can then play them to gain MOBA style upgrades such as damage, crit chance, attack speed, consumable use items, proc chance effects and so on.\n\nThis gives you a very rapid power curve over the course of the arena, and in the space of a short time, say fifteen minutes you'll go from basic to powerful and ready to fight the boss. Once the boss is nailed, you'll be placed in the crucible, and you'll select another arena, and potentially a boon, a meta upgrade that applies to all subsequent runs for that particular "season" and you repeat the process. The moment to moment gameplay is very fast, very fluid, and for anyone familiar with MOBAs, will be intimately familar, however, as it's a singleplayer game, you won't have to deal with other people getting in the way, this is you versus the computer, and the computer gets cards and spells too, just to make your life interesting.\n\nWhen each season is resolved, win or lose, you'll gain gold that allows you to purchase cards to expand your deck, you'll also complete "quests" (or achievements) that unlock new bonuses such as persistent upgrades that apply to -everything-, or unlock entire new characters or companions, this keeps you coming back even if you lose, because no matter what, you're always generally unlocking something, or working towards something.\n\nGetting that mad atmosphere just right.\nThankfully the game doesn't take itself at all seriously, with a robotic announcer called C-SAR and posters telling you what to expect in each season, holographic ads around the playfield and little camera drones filming the action, it really sells the concept that you're a contestant in the arena, performing for the crowd. Good sound design and solid, if somewhat silly voice acting ensure that you'll always be suitably entertained, and whilst the graphics aren't going to blow you away, on a good rig they're decently pretty and they run at a smooth rate. There -are- reports of stutter on release, so Betadwarf are currently patching, but expect that to be resolved sooner rather than later.\n\nClosing thoughts\nAt the price point they've pitched it at, and for the love they've poured in, if you've any love for this style of game, and fancy a revisit to silly, Smash TV styled brawlers, this one is an easy sell. The game is well put together, highly polished, and has plenty of longevity, you'll easily rack 20-40 hours trying to unlock everything, and the CCG element can be mercilessly addictive for those who want to complete the card collection. For me, this is one Kickstarter I genuinely don't regret putting money into, and I wish Betadwarf all the best now that FORCED:SHOWDOWN is out.\n\nVerdict : Highly Recommended","March 30","true","24.1"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","1"

It's not a mindless grindy action RPG in the vein of Diablo 3 and the likes. Instead combat is challenging, tense and requires intelligent positioning and a well-planned use of your special abilities.\n\nThere are tons of cards to collect that, besides all the different characters, companions, monsters, arenas, modifiers and whatnot, add to the enormous variety that makes every playthrough feel completely fresh.\n\nBesides the single-player roguelike-ish gameplay, there are also daily competitions and leaderboards for those into multiplayer competitiveness.\n\nAnd last but not least, one of the most amazing things about this game is the dedication of the developers. They keep pumping out one great update after another, really caring deeply about balancing, polish and general improvements, while being directly fueled by their community's feedback. This is the kind of passion we need to reward in video games. Help create a future of good games by supporting this game!","May 14","true","8.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I didn't realize at first it was a rogue-lite and mostly bought it because it looked fun from what I saw on twitch. If you can figure out the game enough to make it not as frustrating it becomes a much more fun experience.\n\nBasically you collect cards to give your hero different abilities and use those to beat shows which consist of battles containing generally 8 arenas. You gain xp for each show which resets if you win or lose. Each level you gain grants a boon which does different things for you in the arenas. Boons are one of the most important parts to being successful in finishing each show.\n\nThe game will get repetitive, but if you like challenging yourself and enjoy rogue-like/TCGs and gameplay similar to Gauntlet you may want to consider this game.","April 3","true","19.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

HoF could really mess you up with one or two bad draws, while FS allows you to overcome even the toughest challenges by your own skills. Mind you, this game gets difficult very fast, as even the first major boss can really kick your behind if you don't pack some good cards. You'll die a lot, but that is expected with games like this one.\n\nAs for the deckbuilding part, it borrows some bits from Hearthstone. Your deck can contain 30 cards, up to 2 copies of each are allowed and mana curve goes up to 8 because that's how many arenas are in each ''dungeon''. The cards and heroes allow for varied play styles, so you can go full tank or DPS, or even play the rare cards that grant bonuses when your HP is low if you're in mood for risk with high rewards. The gameplay is very solid and you can really feel the weight of the punches and big spells, especially when lots of explosions happen and the screen ''thumps''.\n\nAll in all, a great game, that only lacks some sort of multiplayer and more character variety to become amazing. I see myself playing this for months to come. Well done, BetaDwarf!","March 30","true","6.3"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

Here you will find a three campaign , all have a different difficulty levels, so to the unlock a next one you should beat a previous.\n\nHere you will find four playable characters with different game style and skills, but at the start you can use only one, others you will unlock later.\n\nAll leves in a game have 8 different arenas, in first seven you should kill only minions and at the last you should defeat a boss. All levels has his own rule, also arenas always are random generated, so every time when you start play that again you will find a different environment, traps and monsters. Also you have a companion, what help for you in a battle with enemies. One thing maybe can be annoying for you, and this is that: if you die you should star all from the beginning. Only two things you will not lost after death. The coins what you can spend in a market to get random new card to our decks and the "quest" progress. The quests just just some tasks as kill 6 monsters in a 6 second , kill 200 monsters, etc.\n\nThe tactical part of this game: cards. You start a level at the first arena with 4 cards what you can use before start a battle if you have enough points to the chosen card. At the first arena you have one point, at second two, and this amount grow till eight point when you reach a boss battle arena, so you should think before use the cards, because sometimes maybe better to use two or three cheaper cards than one expensive. Also a cards has more types, some do instant action, some add a buff for little time and some are upgrades to your stats.\n\nThe game graphic looks nice, well fit to the game style. This can say also for the music, this well fit to the action-packed gameplay.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+ nice graphic style\n+ addictive gameplay\n+ random generated levels\n+ good music what well fit to the game action\n+ great atmosphere\n+ interesting mix of RPG, rouge-like and strategy\n+ steam achivements\n\n- optimization problem\n- bugs and crashes\n- long loading time\n- the companions AI can be better\n- not to much various bosses\n- when you die you should start all from beginning\n- no trading cards\n\nWell this game is an interesting mix of RPG, action, rogue-like and strategy, but all of this well balanced here and well complement each other. If you like any of this genre, i think you should try out this game, its will not disappoint you. However this is not an easy game, at first time can bring some difficulty for you and maybe can be annoying that fact, you should start everything from the beginning if you die. But besides a dark sides, a game have enough much good things and can bring for you hours of fun, so i easily can recommend it for you.","April 2","true","5.1"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","1"

In broad strokes the game is built on the mechanics\n\nintroduced in their first game, but adds a ton of replayability and overall gameplay as the genre  shifts to a single-player focussed game.\n\nThe gameplay is fast and exciting with tons of customizability you know from creating your own card decks in magic or hearthstone.\nYou get rewarded for completing arenas even though you don't complete the full run, giving you the feel that you are always progressing and creating better decks for the challenges at hand.\n\n\nThe artistic theme does not shy away from making a couple of jokes; like Ratbo, a minigun-wielding rat, or a pirate rat in a rocket spaceship. Which at first can appear out of sync, however reveals itself as an approach to keep the focus on the gameplay.\n\nI thouroughly enjoyed this game and it addresses some of the elements that was lacking in their first installment. (Replayability and customizability)\nI will definitely kick in more time in this game.\n\nThe relatable title is obviously FORCED, but if you are looking into game-mechanics you should also look to a combination of Hearthstone, Magicka, Diablo and the roguelike element.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Fast-paced non-stop combat\n- Deep customizability and strategic approach to fight within the arenas\n- Card-game-like pre-game customization\n- 'Perma death' or 'Progression reset' - Roguelike element\n\n- Oh and treasure goblins.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jab2565/recommended/265000/","jab2565","Jab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jab2565/","994 products in account","Forced by Betadwarf was an interesting attempt at co-op-based game design from the new studio. Following that game, the team went to work on a completely different game design and the results are Forced: Showdown. Featuring a combination of ARPG and CCG design, this is an impressive idea from the studio.\n\nOn with the Show:\n\nForced: Showdown only has the word, "Forced" as the only relation to the previous game. Taking place in the far future, Forced: Showdown is a popular TV show where contestants fight for glory and prizes against insane odds. You'll start as one hero with the ability to unlock three more as the game goes on; the heroes have different abilities and card possibilities (more on those in a minute.)\n\nPlaying the game is built around the following structure. You select a campaign to play, along with a champion and deck. Each campaign is broken up into several sections where you must play battles to unlock the boss fight to move on.\n\nEach battle is made up of seven arenas that you have to fight through with different conditions. Play through two battles and then fight and win against the boss to complete the section and move on to the next.\n\nWhile there isn't much of a story, Betadwarf has implemented a lot of ways to keep you playing and coming back for more, thanks to meta-game design and the CCG play.\n\nDecked Out:\n\nForced: Showdown is a great example of meta-game design used to elevate a game's design.  Beyond the four different characters, there are multiple ways of improving your characters and chances at survival. Let's start with the biggest one: your deck.\n\nYou can design a deck out of all the cards you have unlocked from the main menu. The cards you find are broken down by rarity, their type and if they are character exclusive. You can have a total of 30 cards in one deck, and as with any good CCG, you'll quickly have to make tough choices as to what to include.\n\nThe cards themselves don't change the characters in the sense of giving them new abilities, but they are used to modify them and the conditions of the arena fight. For instance, you can get a card for the squire of light that gives him an extra AOE attack when he uses his power. That card can also be stacked, allowing you to then triple the AOE blast if you get them both on at a time.\n\nCards are rated by their mana cost, and by default, you'll gain one additional mana point per arena over the set of levels. This prevents you from using your best stuff at the start and makes it so that you need to properly balance your deck costs. Unlocking new cards requires an in-game resource of gold.\n\nWith gold, you can spin the wheel of fortune to unlock new cards, or get shards that can be used to construct a random card of a given rarity. It's important to note that there are no microtransactions in the game; to get you more gold, you can only get it by playing.\n\nYou'll also find quests to do that are broken down by sets. Complete the set of quests and you'll get a permanent reward unlocked for your characters; usually in the form of stat increases and gold. In the campaign, you can pick up points that will be used to unlock boons which are another passive buff for your characters. These boons remain active for the length of the campaign, while the quest rewards stay active forever.\n\nBesides the campaign, you can also run daily challenges with different conditions and get ranked on the Forced: Showdown leader board.\n\nForced: Showdown's embrace of CCG mechanics does a lot to elevate the gameplay, which is very important, because the base gameplay doesn't have long legs in my opinion.\n\nMid Season Finale:\n\nForced: Showdown shows both the benefits and limitations of a CCG-based system. While the game offers a lot of flexibility and personalization on the player's part, the actual gameplay is pretty limited. The game at the moment has four heroes with four unique moves each. The actual controlling of them is very simple; you can't perform any advanced moves like dodging out of the way or unlock new abilities to slot in.\n\nBecause of the limitations in the characters, the game becomes very repetitive from the player's standpoint. The developers were smart to randomly select what battle conditions and even the enemy cards that can get played in a campaign, but it's not enough to avoid the feeling of repetition or change the goal of each arena. As with other CCG-based games, it's going to take a very long time before you can unlock a wide variety of cards and quest bonuses, and I'm just not sure at this point if there is enough here to keep someone playing for the long run.\n\nOne suggestion would be to give the player control of the campaign structure with cards that could increase or decrease the difficulty while impacting the rewards.\n\nSomething to mix things up after someone has down a campaign for the umpteenth time grinding for gold.\n\nAn issue that I ran into was how the game was skewed against melee heroes. Since there are no ways to actively dodge attacks, going melee puts you in range of enemies who can quickly attack you between swings, or bosses with strong attacks at close range.\n\nAlso, because of the random cards from the enemies and the modifiers chosen, the difficulty of a campaign can swing at the drop of a hat.\n\nFor instance, I lost an entire campaign run literally because of one modifier that completely went against my character. I would like to be able to see what the modifiers do ahead of time, instead of having to remember them.\n\nRenewal:\n\nForced: Showdown may be a complete departure from the first game, but it's an amazing foot forward and a much stronger foundation for the series. There are many ways for Betadwarf to continue growing things if the game does well. For another look at Forced: Showdown, you can check out my video spotlight on the Game-Wisdom YouTube channel.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, check out Game-Wisdom[game-wisdom.com], where I examine the art and science of games.","April 13","true","7.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

But don't let that gimmick make you overlook a game that's solid in the Action RPG genre. It's roguelite elements in the card deck building genre are pretty good: as there's good card variety here and a nice selection of heroes. Combat does strong at first, in particular in the challenge area, and yet the game is still fair. Now over time, the variety does start to get hurt if you don't keep unlocking new content, which can be a challenge with some of the stuff that the game throws at you at times. But that takes a lot longer then other games in this specific combination of genre elements, and I was still having fun at 10+ hours with no problems. The game delivers in a bang from buck perspective, even without the discount. Just be ready to deal with some performance issues (especially on the end of waves), that never hit game breaking, but are very annoying.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nGood Series of Heroes with different play styles that hit a good spectrum of typical Action RPG basics (melee, ranged, etc.)\nGood set of cards that don't hit just the typical stat boosts, but have significant boosts to abilities and some interesting side effects.\nEnemies present aren't cookie cutter, like the buggy that swing around a laser over and over again, or an enemy specifically designed for you to not kill.\nDifficulty is good with its roguelite elements. You have to pay attention to what the opponent is playing, or you'll find yourself dead as you charged in recklessly to take a ton of damage.\nLike the Twitch formula and taking the game show/spectacle format to a meta level.\nControls are where they need to be for a game like this. In particular with mouse/keyboard and the archer, which gives the precision you need to fire around corners.\nThe puns are strong with this game. And as a pun lover, I have absolutely no problem with that.\nIn game models do have some significant detail on them.\nNegatives:\nPerformance can be an issue, in particular with ending the round and the loading associated with it. Frame drops now and again.\nLacks any sort of strong narrative or story. While the presentation elements do work in terms of a game show, you have no real idea who these characters are. If this is important to you, this game may not be for you.\nExplosions/Lasers lack an oompf. This was tested by turning off the sounds and seeing their impact/hearing the lack of impact. Seems to me that it's mostly visual, and they really didn't feel different otherwise.\nOver time, the game loses Variety. Usually this is high on my negatives list, but Forced Showdown does a reasonable job of keeping that from happening soon, as after 10+ hours, you were unlocking new content and finding new stuff still. It's just as a rate smaller then I would like for a game like this.\nVery Minor: The game does at times lose a bit of its spectacle thanks to its isometric view. This is sorta unavoidable due to the genre.","March 29","true","15.1"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","22","36","2","0"

(If you're into rougelike games with a card game on top)\n\nThe challenging gameplay keeps you frustrated and addicted at the same time. The game has a decent introduction to the mechanics and overall rules of the game. When they are mastered it is off to do arena after arena to earn gold to buy cards to ultimately better your chances of winning more gold and more cards in the arenas. So an infinite loop of fun.\n\nHowever it can get repetitive to run arena after arena to get more cards and thereby grow stronger as a character. Since there is no end goal in the game, other than getting better at the game and growing your card stack.\nThis is the strongest and weakest point of the game. You get stronger for every card you earn, but if you lose sight of your progression you might lose interest in the game. This is not to say that the gameplay is not fun, challenging or exciting, because it is.... It definitely is. Every match is a new beginning and the frustration of getting a bad card or the relief of getting a good one has an emotional impact on you every time.\n\nIt is a game you can play for a short periods of time and still get something out of, which is a nice change of pace compared to longer games. You can boot-up the game and play for 10 minutes and have a blast in those 10 minutes. That makes this game a nice "let-me-just-clear-my-head" game. The only "downside" is that you might get hooked in those 10 minutes and unable to stop for the next hour or two. ( This happens to me all the time)\n\nTo recap: A really addicting and challenging game with a nice touch of randomness to it. You might lose track of the main goal in the game, but you will soon forget that when you are blasting your way through enemies and earning cards.","April 4","true","5.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

My advice? Pick it up and spread the word. Words, many of them (handle it), below.\n\nNOTE: This review was written during the private beta period before launch, thanks to winning a code in a stream (Twitch's RockLeeSmile, to be specific) from the developer's launch event. As such, I am reviewing a game that I received for free, more or less, from the largesse of the devs. Feel free to take that into account.\n\nI came into this game from a Polygon video review that didn't exactly show it off in the most flattering light (blame one of the worst members on Polygon's video team for that disfavor). From there I hit the Steam page and found the developers' unique little Twitch-fueled discount and giveaway pre-launch event. I found a streamer I recognized from YT and hopped in, expecting a decent Ziggurat / Isaac style arena roguelite with mild card-based elements. What I found was actually a slick, well-designed and visually exciting game with some serious chops on every level.\n\nThe world they're assembling is fun and interesting without being overwrought or ridiculous. The card mechanics go above and beyond the realm of "feature" and into this being a true deckbuilder with serious depth. The actual gameplay is frantic, well-balanced, nicely paced and not too hard yet not too simple. The pre-launch event is a really clean and well-designed piece of work as opposed to a contrived ploy for attention, and it organically builds a community in a really smart way. If I had to bring up any downsides, it's one of the most fixable: In its current launch state, the game doesn't have enough variety in terms of enemies, levels, and especially bosses. Given the devs' update plans? I doubt that will be a problem for long.","March 29","true","7.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Besides piles of cardboard still littered around my apartment, what I took away from my time with Magic was an appreciation for all the little moving parts of a game, whether that game is physical or digital. The interactions between mechanics, the thousands of permutations possible between two decks, the arcane rules that cause both excitement and frustration—it’s all fascinating to me. FORCED SHOWDOWN has a bit of that same magic, turning the power ups and items that fuel a roguelite’s procedural systems into cards you can place into a deck. It’s not perfect, but it is a neat twist on the genre that kept me engaged throughout my time with the game.\n\nWant to know more?

My first impression of this game was really bad, though I had a pretty bad set of arenas and I didnt like the starting character. CGamer commented on my review as seen here: http://i.imgur.com/AxIAbgy.png Massive props to him for going out of his way to get me another coupon (though refunding it did actually return it to me but its that he went out of his way to actually do it that counts). After reinstalling and conceding the first game to unlock a second character, the game became A LOT more enjoyable.\n\nSo first off let me explain why I didnt like the game the first time:\nThe squire of light is the character you start with. He's pretty basic and really easy to play. I'd first bought the game thinking it was multiplayer (Which was bad on my part) so I then started treating it as a single player game and wanted to see if I'd like it before the 2 hour refund time. The Squire of light was just boring to play to me. The game was so that I didnt know if I'd be challenged at all, I barely got hit after I'd played the first 2 arenas, everything died incredibly fast and the characters playstyle just didnt apeal to me. On top of all of that, I randomly selected the same 2 templates multiple times and didnt have any fun fights in them anyways.\n\nThe second time I played:\nI played Volcar (I think is his name, the hammer guy). He's melee, he's got a melee attack that you can chargre rather than just aiming a laser at people, his starting deck is really fun, and most importantly his playstyle was alot more what I was looking for. I never played him in the original FORCED because my friends would pick him, so I intially went in thinking I'd try to make myself really tanky, because that's what I enjoy normally. But I quickly found that stacking as much offense and playing like a berserker was what I really enjoyed about him. Not only that but I got different tile sets this time and actually had some close counters in combat that made me really enjoy it alot more. As well as encountering new, harder enemies on tile sets I'd seen before.\n\nAside from my personal experiences of the game, I've always thought that the whole concept of the game is awesome. I love roguelikes, and if you do too, you'll most likely like this game as well. There's heavy replayability in the way you can build your character between each game. You've got your deck which you can customize, you get delt different cards each individual arena fight. Across a single campaign you'll basically 'level up' and get a set of boons to pick from that can give you different buffs. So as per your typical roguelike, you can be delt a very bad hand that can make your run very hard. Luckily in this game you can most likely just outskill everything despite being weak from what cards/boons you're offered. Which is something I love. Challenge and replayability is important in roguelikes.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to update my review so this game has the rating it deserves. I'll probably update it as updates for the game come out and as I get further in the game.","April 1","true","1.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It’s a Galactic Gameshow where you’re the contestant competing in gladiator battles to become a crowd favorite.  But that’s not where the game ends.  They also found a way to cram Hearthstone into it.  It’s actually hilariously obvious how the devs are huge Blizzard fans, because the game even has Treasure Goblins, sort of.  Don’t take that for a criticism though.  They have done so in a creative way.\n\nSo where does the Hearthstone mention come in to play?  Well, each arena run is based on a deck of cards.  The match starts with a 4 card draw from a 30 card deck.  You can keep the cards or mulligan them.  You also have a mana bar which increases by one for each subsequent arena match in a particular gladiator battle you win.  The cards are comprised of upgrade cards which increase damage or other abilities directly, spells which have unique instant effects such as gaining mana temporarily or drawing a new card that costs less, and last consumables which give you for the most part single arena active skills temporarily like throwing a powerful bomb.\n\nThe gameplay is very satisfying with great effects, solid visceral abilities and nice quick action.  Where the game really shines though is in the audio.  I mean this in the nicest way possible.  This is an indie game and is the second title from Beta Dwarf.  It’s got no business having audio this good.  The voice acting is absolutely top notch with an amazing announcer introducing the lead up into the matches, great boss voices and an incredible blood pumping action heavy sound track.\n\nAs with any game there are some elements that aren’t so great.  To start with, there is a limited selection of 4 heroes and 3 companions.  This is the kind of game that doesn’t rely on the levels to be the unique element and as a result, I’d liked to have seen more player characters.  The cards do have some character specific variants, so I can see how that would complicate things, but I think it’s worth the effort.\n\nI’m not a huge fan of some of the UI choices.  The card wheel where you spend your gold on new cards feels janky and cheap compared to the rest of the experience.  The UI for building decks has a fair bit of visual overlap on what is clickable while filtering cards and I found it a bit awkward to use.  And the UI for showing quests also feels pretty bare bones.  For a game that is as flashy as this, these UI elements are boring.\n\nIt also has some very long load times in between matches which is not good.  They’re having some server issues too which essentially causes the daily and season structure to be non-functional.  As I understand it, this is a pretty high priority for them to fix right now, but it’s still a little broken.  I’ve also confirmed with the developer that the build I’m playing on is the release version.\n\nMy conclusion is simple.  Forced Showdown is a game that surprised me.  I went into the game expecting a crappy little brawler and what I got was anything but that.  Combat is responsive and fun.  The audio is hilarious and incredible both in music and voice-over.  The game looks great and plays great.  Yes some of the menu UI is boring and it’s got reasonably long load times but for $20, I think this game is great value and absolutely worth playing.","March 29","true","23.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

And daily challenges in the seasons result in you often having to tinker with your decks for the best possible result.\n\nThe game has no micro transactions or anything of the kind, and while I don’t know if the developers have any plans for this, currently once you buy the game you will be able to unlock everything without any Pay-2-win nonsense.\n\nThe arena combat is fast, intense, and colorful and the modifiers in each engagement keep it fresh time and again even when you are, in essence facing about a dozen enemy types in total. Those modifiers range from stronger enemies, benefits to you, and influence how a arena run pans out, meaning not just your deck needs a solid strategy but each arena requires you to think and plan ahead.\n\nA concern I had was RNG, and outside of some issues with explanations, most of that can be mitigated with experience in the game. RNG really isn’t a major concern.\n\nOverall technically the game runs great and has an acceptable options menu – do note, if you are colorblind, you can experience issues as the game uses classical color schemes of red, green and blue to indicate quite a few action elements. Some minor issues, I hope will be fixed ASAP in relation to bugs and crashes.\n\nOverall, I like this game a TON and the fact that I’ve yet to beat it and the various options and abilities I have yet to unlock give a lot of value for money. I wholeheartedly recommend this title.","March 29","true","21.6"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","13","22","2","0"

Difficulty seems to be at the right level, and it's always satisfying when you win. Never do you feel like you were given a win for free, you must work for your sauce here.\n\nIt feeds off of the successful deck archetype from Hearthstone (not in a negative way), which I think is perfect for this game. Every match you draw a set amount of cards, and can mulligan those you don't want. Your deck is 30 slots, and each character has 5 different deck slots.\n\nEach run will feel different, as there are modifiers that you can choose from during runs, called "boons", and also modifiers per level that will give you a positive but also a negative. (for example, you can start a dungeon that makes it so you draw 2 cards every round instead of one, but if you are over 5 cards at the start of the arena, you lose a certain amount of your hp)\n\nGameplay is satisfying, and the 4 different characters all feel different enough. I feel as though 4 is the perfect number for the games scope, and makes sure that each will have a distinct style, while not being all too similar to others.\n\nThere is no multiplayer, which is a little odd considering previous games in the series has had it, but it is not something that bothers me as I prefer to play these types of games solo anyway.\n\nI'm still learning more about the game as I go on, but I think that if you like\n-Roguelikes\n-Card games\n-Twin stick shooters (the game works well on both mouse & keyboard and controller)\n-Pleasing aesthetic\n-A challenge\n\n... you will love this game :)","March 30","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It really keeps you going. It's challenging but not unfair ever and the variety is decent, not perfect, a few more heroes might be fun but the daily challenges keep the game fresh.\n\nIt is not without it's flaws though, a few crashes here and there, as well as a memory leak it seems (game gets super slow and is more prone to crash the longer you play).

Too many. FORCED Showdown adds that "something" that makes itself not only stand out, but very addicting to play. The CCG aspects work (incredibly) and add a layer of planning, randomness, and distinction to an otherwise overdone genre. By adding in cooldowns (similar to MOBAs such as DOTA, LoL, and HotS), combat is more about timing. Cornering mobs so your abilities lay down damage with maximum efficiency, as opposed to spray and pray typical with twin sticks. Showdown is an intelligent man's action game. With an emblem system to increase challenge, boons that stack with your character, and battle rules that keep mixing things up so no two playthroughs are exactly the same. Building a deck is not a tacked on buff system, but a strategic element that must be planned for, and utilized well to survive in the arenas. This is an easy recommend, worth hours and hours of entertainment to gamers.\n\nPROs- CCG and top of twin stick action, with a hint of MOBA.\n- Great art design, particle effects, post processing, and nice soundtrack\n- Blended strategy elements, emblem system, battle rules keep it challenging\n- Great boss work, each boss has quotes and affect each round of battle\n- Deck planning doesn't get old as you anticipate another run through a campaign\n- 42 Updates? Are you serious? These devs love their game.\n\nCONs- Battles boil down to the same thing at times, can wear on you\n- Multiplayer in some fashion, could have improved variety\n","May 1","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Combined with the different rules set down for each battle, the different champions, pets and cards create a lot of variation. Sometimes it does make it a little to easy maybe, when the rules and cards combine to make it possible for some pretty OP builds, but most of the time it's nice.\n\nBeing a boring adult with kids'n'stuff I can also really appreciate the game being split up in manageble battles of abt. 10 minutes, which makes it great for short sessions as well.\n\nThe technical stuff seems fine.

The combat is a fun, fast-paced, Diablo-style slaughterfest, and the addition of strategic elements really makes the game much more enjoyable and gives a sense of progression in a very fun and unique way.  The difficulty is certainly high, especially once you complete the first show, but a little determination, a little luck, and a few new cards can be all you need to turn it around.  It's a big pile of fun that I've had difficulty pulling myself away from.\n\nThere are warts, however:  I've run into some crashing issues, and situations where the game will simply hang the entire machine for a few seconds, but these seem to be getting better with each patch, and BetaDwarf is pushing patches very quickly so far.  The only other issue I have isn't with the game itself, but rather with dicumentation:  It's almost impossible to find good information about the game online.  There is a wikia page, but it has outdated versions of cards, lots of incorrect information, and a new ad on every page (at least on mobile).  Some of it is that the game is so new it hasn't yet built up a community, but BetaDwarf has not done a good job up to now of seeding this information to the players & potential community-builders.  Hopefully, this is just another symptom of small team with a brand-new product; They're probably working like mad right now, and these kinds of niceties will come later.\n\nMaybe once they're done with that, they might work on a multi-player component, or Linux/OS X/SteamOS compatibility??  Pretty please??\n\nDespite these things, I still couldn't not recommend this game.  It's just that much fun.\n\n\n\n\n","April 9","true","75.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I do not let that effect my opinion of the game (not that anyone is likely to believe that)\n\nI'm still getting into this game, but you should too! They get you into the action quick and keep the tutorial short. It hits on all the points you need to know and doesn't drag it out for a long time. I've only played the first campaign and it is longer than I expected. You play through multiple matches of 8 arenas. Each one has it's own special rules making the different matches interesting and unique. The card system also helps each run be unique and as you collect more you get to create your own deck! :D\n\nI'm still getting into it and will continue to revise this review as I go on.\n\nMy current only complaint is that you don't know what the effect the arena will have before you enter it. It will say something like "Speedy Minions" (or something like that). Once you enter it tells you what effect it has and then you know it for the future, but as you see new ones you don't know what you are walking into.","April 4","true","30.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not really a big fan of card games, and I quickly gave up on mastering Hearthstone, but in this game I do not have to master the art of deck building to feel awesome. I might feel even awesomer if I could build the one deck to rule them all, but my "I think this should do"-deck is working fine, and I can explode things.\n\nThe graphical details are overwhelmingly amazing for an indie-team development. Everything in the arenas are well-made, from the randomized layout to the small critters and the billboards on the sides. With my attention span around pretty things, I really need to focus on not getting killed whenever I see a butterfly.\nThe humor and puns are everywhere in the game, and the detailed artwork of the cards is both awesome and hilarious. I still crack up when I think about the Hit and Run card with a dude on a one wheeled bicycle shooting some kind of laser backwards xD. I really look forward to getting more cards in that style!\n\nI love the voice acting and soundtrack, and I am exited to see what the team comes up with of new content next :D.\n","March 30","true","9.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

You're probably scrolling through the reviews wondering if this game is any good. Well you can stop scrolling, because everything you need to know is in this next sentence:\n\nThe game will be amazeballs, so buy it now.\n\n"Will be?" you might ask, and as you should! Right now, the state of the game is simply 'amazing.'

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Butterflymadeit/recommended/265000/","Butterflymadeit","Dancingstein","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Butterflymadeit/","170 products in account","I played the game from an really early version on, and experienced the "developement" of the game throughout the years.\n\nFirst of all: it is a nice game, but not worth 20€, imho. Why? Just read my Review about this game, you are interested in.\n\n\nWhat is this game about?\n\n-It is an game, which is about creating an Deck, consisting of 3 types of cards, Spells, Consumeables and Upgrades.\n|-> you can chose that deck to challenge an Program, there exists 3 Programs currently, with ranging "difficulties".\n\n-You can get new cards from challenging your luck on the lottery (for gold you earned from quests and finished battles).\n|-> if you are really unluck and get duplicates all the time, you will get "shards", which you can trade for an card you don't own at the moment).\n\n-There are currently 4 champions and 3 pets you can chose from.\n\n-Exceptions: Dailies, some of those will give you an deck+champion+pet, while others let you create your own deck.\n\nWell, that was the basic stuff, how about the gameplay you ask? Here you go:\n\n-Each Program consists of 9 Battles\n|-> each Battle consists of 8 Arenas (exception: if you got the "quick battle" rule it will be reduced to 4 Arenas for that battle)\n\n-In the first Arena of an Battle you start out with 1 Mana Crystal, for each successful finished Arena you gain an additional Mana Crystal\n|-> you play cards from your deck each Arena. Each card costs a specific ammount\n|-> you try to survive, gather scraps/experience and kill the boss at the end of an Battle\n\n-At the end of an Battle you will get rewarded with Scraps/Exp, after reaching a certain point (leveling up) you will gain the option to chose a bonus effect from a pool of your current unlocked bonuses.\n\n-Goal: Finish all 9 Battles, aka. Finishing off the Program.\n\n\nSo, why do i give it an negative review?\n\nThe game is too random, no real skill is needed because some elements will screw you over.\nA lot of Rules are creating an enviroment, you will not be able to do great in, with your current deck (you can NOT change it between battles, you HAVE to reset the Arena to do so)\nMost cards you have at the beginning are just bad, just outright bad, compared to those cards you should unlock as soon as possible. The advantage of those cards you get are just incredible, but it requires a lot of grinding, because the random factor in the lottery is just not enjoyable.\n\nAfter getting all cards, and looking at each card individual, i have to say that around 80% of those cards will NEVER see any play again, because those are no alternatives to those "top picks". Why? Those bonuses will create an enviroment where you have to go for some universal answer to every single disadvantage you get.\n\nI had to restart a lot of runs, because i was not getting certain bonuses (there are some which are just outright overpowered compared to others, why would i want 20% pet dmg, if i am able to get 35% pet health AND pet dmg at the same time, at the same point of the game? Just an example) and without those i had a LOT of issues finishing both the second and third Program with 3 out of 4 characters.\n\nWhat else do i have to rant about? The balancing is horrible. The strongest character is the Ravager and the Squire of Light comes second, but WAAAYS behind it, why? Invincibility, especially if you are a good player, you will have no issues with any Program if you are able to use the Ravager abilities to your advantage, it will just make it so you will never get punished for bad positioning or bad rules, while others will have some of the biggest issues just finishing a single battle...\n\nJust stay out of this game, it will not be a game most will enjoy for a long time, because once you get to a point knowing about the game mechanics and are able to use them, you will hate the game, for how poor designed it is.\n\n\nedit: something i forgot to write about is, how bad the boss fights are. Every single Boss encounter is nothing, compared to the arenas you had to fight in, to get there. I am not understanding why the hardest part in those fights are NOT the bosses, with their poor mechanics (once you know what they do, they will NEVER be any threat to you, so actually only the first ~2 encounters of each boss are difficult), but possible spawned/summoned enemies (and if you got any consumeable to destroy any of these, or even better: make them your allies, then it will get even more easy, then it already is).\n"Yeah let's make bosses scale bad, compared to the player, who will have a lot of upgrades, etc. on the 8th arena, so he will make it with ease" - no offense, but it was anticlimatic whenever i got to some boss again after the first time i fought against it","March 29","false","30.9"," 67 of 130 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","67","130","2","2"

There could be some longer battles with more mana occasionally I suppose, like with 2 extra arenas, which could be a battle modifier. Also I feel that the deck does not have enough variation for so many battles after another, if you are half or 3/4 in the stage, it starts getting a rather stale as you always get the same cards out of your deck as it only contains 30 with a bunch of doubles usually. Maybe occasionally getting a non deck extra card (jndicated by a different colored glow) when your hand only contains 2 cards or so could spice things up a bit from time to time.\n\nOr maybe a random card mode, where you just get random cards out of your posession would be very nice for a change of pace.\n\nSome other things:\nBoons could also offer more variatio and not be in always the same order.\nThe second pet feels a lot weaker than the first one, the lifesteal seems to do nearly nothing\nand it dies very fast\n\nAside very polished and nice visuals and audio","March 30","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It took a little while to get used to it, but once I got the gameplay down, I got addicted. LOVE the card system. It adds a LOT to the gameplay. I'm not great with games like Hearthstone. I like the IDEA of card games like Hearthstone, but I'm just not very good at card strategy. Forced Showdown is right up my alley. Just enough card building to scratch the itch, but the rest is a fun action game. Kinda Gauntlet meets Hearthstone. For you younger gamers, change that to Diablo meets Hearthstone. :)\n\nI'm even MORE impressed by the developers of the game. BetaDwarf has been Johnny-On-The-Spot dealing with any issues with the game. Just check out the discussion board. One player complained about V-Sync not being available, which would make their rig overheat. The dev actually grabbed a programmer and took care of it.\n\nBetaDwarf also has an amazing origin story. It’s amazing what they’ve accomplished. Check out their story here: http://imgur.com/gallery/4fsfR","March 30","true","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In many ways, it offers the same type of longevity as games like "Binding of Isaac" or "Nuclear Throne", with the added mechanics of a CCG to add a level of customization and controlled experimentation.\n\nEach character offers a different approach to combat, both in terms of their basic attacks as well as additional abilities (damage avoidance, secondary ability, etc), and this is reflected in the character specific cards as well.\n\nAdd to this the modifiers applied to each "Battle", and you get a system where each new run is likely to be at least somewhat different from the last.\n\nPresentation:\nThe games artstyle is good, with a clear sense of direction and a good representation. Likewise, the game is also presented with a good amount of humour, but not to such a degree that you could possibly find yourself "playing for the laughs".\n\nSupport:\nThe Devs have been very open and forthcoming, and you get a strong feeling that they're intent on seeing the game through not just until launch, but well after launch as well, and that they have no issues with listening to feedback (either negative or positive), opting to be transparent in their answers rather than giving a standard-formula reply to questions that could potentially scare away some players if the answer differs from what some people feel should be the answer.\n\n\nAll in all:\nA game that offers longevity so long as you find it fun seeing where the next battle takes you; how far you can make it, what cards you're dealt, what modifiers you're given, and trying to beat your own best score - something that can keep you coming back just to see how the next run will go down.\nLikewise, with the dedication and openess of the Devs, it's easy to imagine this game evolving beyond its launch state.","March 29","true","15.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I had some fun with this even if it ended up not really being my thing.\n\nThe stages are simple and tiny, but for the type of game where you're running through a dozen arenas with each arena having ten fights it makes sense for them to be so small; I just wish they weren't so repetitive. The random arena affects try to help with that but most of the time you never want to choose any of the positive ones since it increases enemy numbers, which is usually worse than the negative effects you could instead pick up to lower enemy numbers. There doesn't seem to be a very good balance between effects of arenas, the cards, or the characters themselves.\n\nThe cards can be a bit fun though, especially the consumables.\n\nThe only thing I can truly complain about though is the companions. Dear lord they are dumb. They will walk into fire and bombs, killing themselves faster than the enemies do. At first I just thought the low HP of your first companion was the trouble, as it was meant to be just the lil' glass canon sort of deal. But when I got the brawler type it was unbearable and I switched back to the little one cause at least he teleports away from things that damage him so he actually lasts longer than the companion meant to be a meat shield.","April 5","false","4.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

I read a review before buying this game that talked about the randomness of the game ruining the experience.  I would agree it ruins the game along with the difficulty.  I must have made 60 runs on the first boss of the Crucible and still nothing.  I received a few cards to help me out, but no success.

Whenever you manage one challenge there is another to beat you up with your own arm. There are also Hidden challenges in the later arenas so you can end up in a battle with things that will make your deck  useless. GOOD LUCK!!!\n\nSo far the game has felt like:\nToo much Farming.\nUnfair due to card draws.\nUndeveloped Card game compared to certain card games.\nSome challenges are just too hard or a bit too challenging for what you get.\nToo few levels, bosses and choices.\nGoes from basic to hard too fast with little in-between, and most unlocks can only happen in the "normal" campaign.\nLacks some things like a quest-list to keep track of what you're trying to achieve and if you've failed or not,\nThe multiplayer scene could be better, challenges are somewhat fun but wish I could play with someone.\nToo many cards to choose from with little choice in what you get from the "lottery".\nRewards are low.\n\nYes it's mostly negative, and some things can be proof of something you love. If you like challenges and options, this may be a game for you. It feels unfinished however and it's good that it's new, because if the game stays for 20€ and is this short (Farming does NOT make a good game, only repetetive and this game does not have the right to be this repetetive). Lately I've also started to realise that after a few quests done in the 2nd campaign just go back to the first and farm gold, you'll earn a lot more, loose less and have a better time until you have every card in the game, because that's what it comes down to, farming farming farming without ever getting any permanent growth except for completed quests, some who have way too difficult conditions, some are too extreme too, "use 150 consumables" doesn't work in the easy campaign.\n\nSo I hope to see some changes for the better and will update this review as it goes.","March 31","false","45.7"," 7 of 29 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","7","29","0","0"
