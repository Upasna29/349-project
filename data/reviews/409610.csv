It's hard to stop chasing records! :)\n\nThink the game is quite well executed, the graphics is simple and tasteful, the controls feel solid and the gameplay is fun. Nothing to complain on really.\n\nWell worth the money!\n","October 21, 2015","true","3.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I feel incredibly epic whenever I play it. It has so many close call moments that make the player feel so awesome for surviving. The controls are great and responsive enough to make sharp, split second, lazer dodging turns in midair so every death seems fair. And with only two buttons: jump and change direction, it's really easy to master what you're trying to do.\n\nThere are many different modes that cover basically every aspect of the gameplay that can be changed. My favorite being Zen because you get to go super fast and there aren't many hazards.\n\nI found this game better with a friend, taking turns after deaths. This made it a lot more fun to chase records, get achievements, and share in those epic moments.\n\nI got this game on sale for 5$ and it was 100% worth the price! I'm so happy I found this game.\n\nAlso this is the first game that I've ever been able to make "All Time" leaderboards and that is surreal! Must be because the game is a new release, but just a note that if anyone else wants to know what that feels like, get this game ASAP.","October 29, 2015","true","10.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
