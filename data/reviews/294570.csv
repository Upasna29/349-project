Was that good or bad, though?\nWell, this one's much more like a traditional adventure game; instead of collecting macguffins to do one specific thing it's more one main quest and lots of subquests. It's also longer than the rest of the series, though also a bit slow-paced; there are a lot of screen transitions, enough that I started skipping them halfway into the game.I think that's the main problem; the hub town area is a long string of screens that would've been more effective as one large map with all the submaps attached to it. The randomization here is also not much more than the level of the last game; a few more puzzles change than last time but it's still much more linear than the second or third games were. All in all though still pretty solid, though not the best in the series (maybe because of my nostalgia bias for the ones I had played as a kid.)","July 30, 2014","true","2.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedysnail/recommended/294570/","speedysnail","SpeedySnail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedysnail/","50 products in account","The Freddi fish series is one of the most critically acclaimed, and greatest series of all time. Freddi Fish 5: The Case of the Creature of Coral Cover, being the most acclaimed game in the series. The graphics, artwork, music, voice acting, plot and more are all perfect, they are better than freddi fish 3! How can you perfect perfection? Freddi fish 5 does just this! I would not recomend buying this game first as it will BLOW YOU OUT OF THE WATER (Hilarious freddi fish reference/general ocean joke) And make the other masterpiece freddi fish games look pale in comparison. However, if you simply want the best of the best, buy this game. The replayibility is great and for 6$ it is a HUGE STEAL. This game is chocked up full of humor, tragedy, suspense, horror, mystery, and MORE! what more could you ask for? The only thing lacking is Multiplayer but that is no issue as the characters almost feel life-life, they became your best friends from the get-go. Freddi and luther have been some of my best pals since I was a child, I feel happy to support such a great game, hopefully you do the same.\n\n-SpeedySnail","February 25, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harkugan/recommended/294570/","Harkugan","Otto von Bismarck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harkugan/","244 products in account","Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?","April 8, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","1","7","2","0"

This game was a lovely part of my childhood and it's great to be able to re-play it on Steam. What I loved about these kinds of games is how the story occasionally changes so the objectives are different, although the outcome is always the same, but that's the thing that made me keep playing this game. Such a fun computer game back in the day and still is.","March 31, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is one of several games that made me into the PC gamer that I am today. As an adult, the gameplay still holds up and is still a fun point and click adventure game. Although I managed to beat it in less than 2 hours, it's still nice to be able to play it again. For a kid growing up today, this would make an excellent introductory PC game for them to play; after all, it is both fun and educational.","February 22, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
