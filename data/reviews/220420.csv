Requiring some help on puzzles will most likely be necessary. Definitely a favorite of mine, not as good as Blackmoor Manor.","January 26, 2014","true","5.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

That being said, I was excited when I saw there were ND games compatible for Mac on Steam! Playing Deadly Device was very fun. There were additions that I don't remember being in the previous (old, old) games (Task Bar, Hints) that made it slightly easier when stumped on what to do next. I found the game to be long, definitely your money's worth, although if you were to play it again in the near future I feel you would remember the order of events and solutions to puzzles. It may not be a game you can play mutltiple time without an adequate break in between play throughs.\nThe graphics were great (this game is one of Her Interactive's more recent releases) and the story line well thought out. I am a science person, so I was pleased when there were a few elements of physics/computer code needed to complete puzzles. That being said, the puzzles might not be the most fun (compared to other Nancy Drew games) if you don't like sciency things. (Not to be interpreted as if you don't have any knowledge of science you can't play this game and complete the puzzles).\nOverall I enjoyed the game and I'm looking into getting another ND during the holiday sale.","December 28, 2014","true","10.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I mean if you're a fan, then buy it, but if  you're not sure of buying this game or not, don't. Unless it's on dramatically big sale.. Personally I like the old Nancy games tbh but it's just a matter of taste. Ghost of Thornton hall is a nice game\n\nPros:\n*Tbh nothing but the voice acting\n\nCons:\n* Bad graphics (worse than other nancy games in my opinion)\n*Too hard (had to cheat to just get through with the story)\n\nCONCLUSION:\nBuy only if you're a fan and it's on sale\n","January 5","false","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They are informative and fun (and a couple might require you to cheat and look up the answer). There are two levels of difficulty to choose from which is nice since it makes the game accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThe mystery itself that Nancy is solving takes a little while to get interesting, but the second half of the game ramps up the intrigue to a satisfying conclusion.","May 1, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
