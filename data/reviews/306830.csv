Despite it being a very early version of the more updated chinese version, it still has enough modes to keep you comin back to at least complete the daily missions, everything you remember about Gears of War is here and you'll feel right at home if you're a fan. Sadly this game has several downsides that really make it difficult for me to recommend it to anyone, and we'll start with:\n\n1) the revive system - although it's a minor gripe, I still hate the fact that even if you're in the middle of reviving someone or getting revived, if they arrive just a tad too late then you will die because the bleedout timer does not stop as you are reviving someone/being revived, and because of the high numbers of enemies on screen in this game, you WILL die a lot, luckily this is counter balanced with how many lives you can earn a day, which brings me to my next point...\n\n2) the weapon unlock system - (the word system is censored in this game for some unknown reason btw...), sadly this one's a big minus for me, this game has a rental system which I really despise in games, and the only reason I gave it a chance was because you can pick up weapons in the field and try out new guns that way, however it's honestly not enough to save it, and this is why... there is a total of 21 Basic weapons you can unlock permanently for free with in game currency at the moment (they may or may not have added more gold coin guns to unlock as of this), and like 3/4s of the rest of the arsenal can only be unlocked with EMP (premium currency) or by gambling your life away with bullets (Silver for common and uncommon items, Gold for uncommon and rare, and Platinum for Unique and legendary items...), sadly like any RNG based game, it's set to give you the least chance possible to get stuff for free and 75% of the time you either get lives or temporary equipment (which blows), this honestly kills any sense of achievement and is only there as an excuse to say that this game is fair because it gives everyone equal chance to obtain stuff for free, but let's face it, the RNG is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t~!!! There seriously needs to be better free to unlock guns like in Planetside 2 or Blacklight Retribution, to at least make the player feel more rewarded for working for perm guns instead of gambling away in hopes that with some Dumb Luck he can get the stuff he wanted to get for 10,000 years... This next point saddens me the most...\n\n3) the game heavily caters to whales and compulsive gamblers - though this game isn't very Pay 2 Win, I can definetly say with confidence that it's heavily Pay 2 Advantage which isn't much different really if you think about it. With over 60% of the arsenal locked behind pay walls and RNG walls, anyone who wishes to have a remotely good arsenal to grind in PvE is heavily encouraged to either open loot crates, buy EMP guns (and half of them are unreasonably priced, I mean 20 bucks for a P90... HOLY ♥♥♥♥ MAN~!!!) or buy premium turrets which make such a major difference in Nightmare mode (don't let anyone fool you, I've run several nightmare missions on BDH and I've had a far FAR easier time when 1/2 my team is stalked up on gatty, flame and shield turrets...), because of the lack of proper guns that free players are capable of getting, this makes it such a chore to obtain reasonable enough gear to grind harder difficulties with. Also, when I say this game caters to whales and compulsive gamblers, is because, as I said, with the unreasonably priced weapons and gear (and having to spend 10 bucks at a time to open 4 loot crates, just 4 RNG BS LOOT CRATES), 20 bucks in this game doesn't get you ♥♥♥♥! So unless you plan on spending $100s-$1000s of dollars on this game to reveal lots o' targets n' loot crates and obtain soo many advantages over every other free player, just do yourself a favor and look for a more reasonable F2P game like Warframe, Firefall or Airmech... As I've said before, don't let anyone fool you that the bullet system is perfectly fair and that they used their first plat bullet in the first 10 hours of playing the game and got a perm Neutrino Rifle or Arc Cannon for free, as Dumb ♥♥♥ Luck doesn't happen to everyone, and it may take you 1000s of tries before you obtain what you want...\n\n4)Lag, Lag everywhere... - This point is mostly for PvP as PvE doesn't suffer as much from lag as PvP does, and this is mostly because more than HALF the population consists of Brazilians. I have nothing personally against them, I love hispanic people, I am one... but I really REALLY hate Brazilian latency as the ping just... causes sooo much lag, between the warping and the Lag Armor(it could also be poor server optimization as well), it's just Unbearable to play PvP. One reason people avoid it like the plague is this, the other is...\n\n5) no anti cheat system in place = Hackers, Hackers, HACKERS~!!! - This is especially true in PvP, there are 1000s of videos showcasing snappy aimbotters in this game, they have a HUGE advantage with aimbots in this game because of how high bullet magnetism is, you can literally headshot people with a sniper from 1/2 way a cross the screen without even scoping in, the Bullet magnetism is so high that I can play with a controller and do good, so imagine how many kills an aim botter could get, and sadly PvP is full of them, I've even had a couple of run downs with em, and the countermeasures to eliminate the botters at the moment is completely sub-optimal (to those who play the game, I just made a pun there...). The worst part is, like every other korean/chinese MMO released in NA out there, the american publisher acknowledges there are hackers, yet they do nothing about it, which sucks...\n\n6) a few missions have extremely cheap enemies - As I've said, this game is hard and you WILL die a lot, but most of the deaths will feel like they were cheap and not your fault with some enemies, espeically when a bunch of exploding zombies or nade spamming zombies spawn right next to you, it will feel like playing in the arcades again with enemies that would kill you in 1-2 hits just to incentivize you to feed the machine more quarters, worst of all is the starter weapons are complete ♥♥♥♥ in PvE, so unless you have the proper anti weapon (ZK, Assault, Thresher) you will get your ♥♥♥ handed to you a LOT...\n\n7) Horrendous spawn System- Holy ♥♥♥♥ this one is just really really bad here, the game for both PvP and PvE has preset spawns, and sadly in team based PvP this heavily promotes spawn camp rope which does happen a lot, especially in MvM and TDM, in PvE it's even worse for a lot of the zombie maps, imagine spawning right smack in the middle of 20 zombies with nowhere to run because you're stuck, BOOM, dead in 5 seconds because there was literally nothing you could do! For the most part this game doesn't have a Safe Spot spawning system or ongoing map rotation spawn which is total BS... and honestly a few seconds of spawning invincibility do nothing to fix this issue...\n\nAll in all this game is good fun for a few minutes despite being as generic as it gets, but the downsides along with it's heavily incentive on paying ♥♥♥♥ loads of money just to obtain things quicker, the lack of free to unlock (not RNG earn) weapons, and overall fairness just makes it impossible for me to recommend this game to anyone yet, If you can find a better and more Fair F2P game then just stick to that and avoid this one for now...\n\nTL;DR version:\n\nGame is good fun but pretty much sucks at everything else, caters too much to heavy spenders, has too many flaws in the mechanics especially the spawning, Lag and PvP hackers...","October 15, 2014","false","121.4"," 341 of 406 people (84%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","84","341","406","19","27"

It's actually developed by the same Chinese company, YingPei. It borrows the same chest-high cover mechanics and over the top melee executions but adds a lot more variety of PvE modes that run from classic Horde-mode maps to maps that pit you against gigantic T-Rexes with rocket launchers on their backs.\n\nThe game recently underwent a massive overhaul that rewards new players way more than the old system did. Where the harder maps were difficult to get into without spending money to accelerate your progression or being lucky at RNG, now the level rewards provide you with all the basic gear you need to get started on Nightmare content. Drones have been added to the game and allow you to customize and level them up to get them new abilities.\n\nBullet galleries have been overhauled again and thankfully all the temporary guns besides Epic weapons have been removed from the game completely. Buying VIP access for yourself gives you a chance to try out high-teir weapons for free and the selection changes every two weeks. There are lots of ways for free-to-play players to get access to the best weapons without having to do much more than invest some time into grinding, just like every other game on the market.\n\nThe PvP in this game has a pretty high skill cap in it so it can be difficult for new players from NA to adjust. Unfortunately the game has been out in other regions for years so a lot of the foreign players have a pretty significant advantage in terms of skill level. Hackers appear occasionally like most other online shooters, but EME is pretty quick to ban them as long as the community submits proof to EME's website.\n\nAs the oldest remaining player in the community, I would definitely recommend you pick this game up and try it if you're a fan of PvE-based online shooters. It's f2p so there's no harm in trying it yourself and none of the content is gated by a paywall. There are lots of helpful corps in the game for PvE and PvP who can help you get started regardless of your nationality.\n\n8/10 would recommend to a friend.","April 17, 2015","true","737.3"," 90 of 100 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","90","100","7","5"

You're barely out of the tutorial before you find out that your starting equipment has a timer on it. From what I could tell most of the equipment bought with in-game currency could only be rented, which wouldn't be so bad if the weapons didn't average something like $15 of real money. Admittedly I didn't play for long, but that has more to do with the terribly bland level design and cheap enemy spawns than any in-game storefront.\n\nThis is a game I might have been willing to buy on sale for $10 but there's nothing about it that makes me want to 'rent' it.","September 19, 2014","false","2.1"," 533 of 806 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","533","806","5","28"

By that I mean if you wanted to get good gear/weapons at a reasonable speed you were best off paying.\n\nThis has been changed, for the better IMO, since the Games of Drones update.  You can now buy decent weapons in the gold money market (in game currency) and the rewards from bullets has also been made much more viable for free to play minded players.  I can't stay this enough, it is ALOT better since this patch.  Levelling rewards are so much better now.\n\nThis game is worth a shot.  Be warned that you might like it quite a bit and end up throwing some money to en masse anyways :)  I'd say it's done a good job of offering a great free to play experience now.\n\nIn all fairness some are still likely to not like it but that's ok too.  Try it out and find out for yourself.\nThere are still some elements where spending money gets you basically more chances at winning items you desire but that's basically it.  It's RNG and money just gives ya more "chances" at something or gives you the option to buy faster XP / money gain percs.  I've prolly missed some more specifics but that is the gist of it.\n\nThanks for reading.","April 17, 2015","true","911.1"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","39","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zhernebog/recommended/306830/","Zhernebog","My name is not important","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zhernebog/","525 products in account","Yet another horrifying port of the "freemium" RENT-to-win craze that infects eastern shooter mmo developers.\n\nMovement is horribly clumsy, aiming is crap, you receive two timed guns that expire within a certain timelimit, dodging an attack lands you within melee distance of the guy whose attack you just dodged, leaving you open, stunned and without a dodge move.\n\nI played a dinosaur match where I had to hold over for a minute or two while a scientist (who mysteriously teleported right after) set up a self-destruct. Dinosaurs and dinosaurs with guns popped out of nowhere -and here's what bothered me the most- and, apparently, every single one of them aggroed the exact same guy. 3 of us were happily shooting at the mobs while one sorry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was running for his life. He got killed, the mobs all went straight for the same other guy. After him, it was my turn. Having died a third time, I entered dead state (vs down state, in which you can be revived) and noticed that the game threatened to kick me out after two minutes! I would've lost all progress, exp, money, etc... that I got from playing the mission.\n\nMy only option was, you guessed it, a respawn token.\nWhile they are "cheap", the only apparent way to get them is with real money.\n\nPurchased weapons disappear unless you pay again? I think I already mentioned that.\n\nAnother big problem I had with it is that, in a 4 player match (FOUR PLAYERS) we had such massive lag that I rubberbanded from one edge of the map to the other.\nWhich, ironically, wasn't so terrible, since the maps are so small and reused so badly.\n\nMission, first part, rescue a scientist in the center of the map.\nSecond part, go west, rescue a scientist, then east, rescue another.\nThird part, go west (same area), repair a node, then east (same area), repair another.\nFourth part, go west (yes, same area), defend the node... The group split, so I can't tell if they were screwing around or if there were indeed two defense objectives.\nFifth part, defend the central area. TOO MANY MOBS!\nSixth part, run to the area that was unused. One of us sprint past every enemy and reached a cinematic, which triggered the boss.\nFinal part, T-rex with missile launcher and an undodgable minigun in an area with no cover.\n\nOh, and in case you're concerned, yes. All female outfits sport massive cleavage.\n\nAll in all, it's a lazy "mash everything everyone likes" idea poorly put together. The only two things this game is missing are ninjas and pirates.\n\nCan't recommend.","September 20, 2014","false","1.2"," 273 of 434 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","273","434","9","14"

Check!\nIn various modes; with multiple difficulties? Double check!\n\n*Assault Ops pits you against mobs of enemies as you and your team fight through sections of levels, building up to a big baddie!\n*Paranormal Ops sends you into undead infested areas--following along the lines of Assault Ops to a big ol' Raid like boss\n*Extinction Ops is currently one of the newer mission-esque runs...but with dinosaurs! RAWR! Who doesn't want to gun down prehistoric creatures? :P\n\nThese three modes are perfect for those who prefer to work as a team.\nThat said; despite being a team, often times there is little communication between players; often fighting for ammo boxes, and the lack of objectives in these missions that require the team to split up. But overall still very fun.\n\n*Threshold Defense is similar to tower defense where angry mobs of various enemies come in droves, and you're tasked to set kill-kill-kill-earn points and set up various turrets to subdue the opposition with said points! Advanced and above difficulties increase the number of waves and add a boss at the end!\n\nA mode for the Tower Defense obsessive. ;D\nDon't have many issues with this mode; other than points are hard to come by sometimes when you have a team who can murder things before they get two feet out of their spawn points, and you definitely need points to pick up ammo, set up turrets, use traps, etcetc.\n\n*Kill Everything throws you into a map where the whole point...literally is to just rekt all the things, earn points and use them to unlock doors to other parts of the map; replenish ammo; pick up various guns and special weapons to demolish all the things! There's also traps throughout the maps to help even the odds, and you can rebuild windows/doors to slow the increasing numbers[see: give you breathing room].\n*Kill Everything 2 is just a bigger and badder version of the previous with advanced and higher difficulties throwing a Boss at you; sometimes with limitless mobs to keep you on your toes.\n\nThese two modes are perfect for those who need to get their gun off like a sociopath. :P\nAnother point based set of PvE maps; so if you're not quick to kill the baddies, you might find yourself running around without ammo for a little bit until the waves get bigger.\n\n*Assault is a competitive PvE set up where waves of enemies come try and make life difficult, they think they're Assaulting -you- but in reality, -you're- the one Assaulting them.\n*Massive Assault is just a bigger version of the before; with more players, so you can Massively Assault the enemy's face. ;D\n\nMore or less a shooting gallery in which you compete with others to get the top score; who's the bigger, badder Assaulter? GET SOME!\nNo real problem, only that spawn points are predictable, so it's sometimes comical how fast a wave can be cleared if everyone camps specific spots.\n\nDO YOU LIKE PVP? OF COURSE YOU DO! (But I sure don't...)\n\n*Free-For-All one of the breads; and just as it sounds! You against ER'RY BODEH. I..I've got nothing else.\n\nI am not a huge fan of this mode, it's very common to spawn into a middle of a firefight and get chewed up in the crossfire. Players will spawn in behind you after being caught in said crossfire and put you down in a vicious cycle. Though that said; lots of players DO LIKE the manic playstyle it provides.\n\n*Team Death Match is the butter of PvP, Red vs Blue, Team A slap-fighting with Team B, etcetc.\n\nI personally enjoy this mode of PvP, especially if the teams are balanced...otherwise, you can be, and will be...mercilessly spawn camped until the end of the round. "Git gud, son!" Is easy to say, but there are players who are literal Career PvP in this game, and if by some stroke of bad luck a group of them end up on the same team, good luck; you'll get mauled if you step out of your spawn(if they're not running around IN your spawn area), spawn camping is real and is a struggle. I hope this is fixed in the future, nothing is more discouraging than spawning in and realizing you're not leaving your spawn because Team Whoop yo'Booty/Trololol Spawn Campers Inc is blocking your exits with shotguns and P90s.\n\n*Elimination is the other piece of bread to this toast sammich (what? You don't enjoy a toast sammich? Wrong wit'chu?!) and is another Team A vs Team B, with each player having one life per round. The mission? Curb stomp the other team before they curb stomp you!\n\nProbably the most balanced; more so if everyone works as a Team, no big issue unless you find yourself on the business end of a Clan/Corp team.\n\n*Demolition is...the hash-browns with an explosion of Tabasco sauce somewhere in it. Teams take turns exploding and defusing. The bomb is randomly assigned to a player. And sometimes this player...\n\n...with the bomb will throw it away because they don't want it. (HOT POTATO! 1-2-3 NOT IT!) And this will be overlooked by team mates(and you), leaving you defending Alpha/Bravo point wondering why the bomb has not be planted yet.\n\n*King of the Hill I tell you what, it's that Over-Easy egg you have sitting on your plate and you're like... "Mm, could be good." Red vs Blue; hug that small area and hold onto your britches while you try to obtain points to win; it's hectic, it's fun, but it suffers from...\n\nSPAWN CAMPING! How so? Unfortunately very easily; if the opposing/your team gets a strong foot hold on the middle of the map and keep pushing, you/they can literally box you into your/their predetermined spawn point and if these are Career PvPers, you'll have the most rage inducing time trying to get to any form of cover outside of your spawn.\n\n*Mercs vs Monsters is one of the more unique modes ZMR has to offer; it's like when you order that Red Velvet pancake, totally unexpected, but fun(delicious; if you like red velvet). One team plays as the Mercs, and the other as Undead/supernatural creatures. As you kill players(or get killed) you earn points that you can use to upgrade yourself to other Mercs/Undead, you start at the bottom as a pistol wielding merc/slap happy zombie and work your way up! There's a twist though! Halfway through the match the Teams switch; Zombies become Mercs and Mercs become Zombies.\n\nIt's a fun mode, and definitely different from the usual suspects; spawn camping is generally non-existant in this mode, but the Mercs definitely have a ranged advantage over the undead, but nothing game ruining.\n\n*Blood Diamonds I didn't get a chance to play, could never find a game in progress or one that had an open spot; it was event related.\n\nOther tasty little niblets:\n\nThere are daily missions you can complete for extra gold, experience, rep. IE: killing XX amount of players in PvP on a specific map.\n\nThe Shooting Gallery: this is where you can use all those shiny bullets you've been picking up--the galleries contain various pieces of loot, these come in the form of Revive Coins, Weapons(Perm versions and week long rentals), Nightmare Tickets for PvE(if Expert difficulty is too easy for you).\n\nI think that covers pretty much everything, overall the game is a ton of fun if you like a game that's tongue in cheek, doesn't take itself seriously; the last update before October was called T-rekt, I mean come on; if that didn't make you snicker just a bit, you need to loosen up.\n\nThe team behind the game do live streams on Twitch and they're a lot of fun to watch, you can tell this game has people who enjoy what they do, so it's in good hands.\n\nThe updates get bigger and bigger every month, and with a 'strict monthly content update' schedule, so expect more maps, more modes, and more weapons than you can threaten a zombie with!\n\nGreat game, HUGE potential, something for everyone.\n\nNow go and KILL.EVERY.THING!","October 21, 2014","true","860.7"," 49 of 64 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","49","64","4","2"

Silver is the lowest and most common tier (normal.advanced), expert gives you a gold and silver, and nightmare gives you a platinum and two golds.

Since my review the game declined to such a state that it can only be called, dying.  The development staff has been cut to one person in lieu of the current slate of mobile games that EME is working on.\n\nThe lag issues still persist, anticheat has been abandoned and given up to a current solution of just not allowing PvP by anyone under level 25 (the thinking was that bans would actually mean the loss of some time invested, but the problem is, bans arent actually happening any more ( read one developer on project), this leads to a very small PvP community and much animosity between the factions (brazilians vs turkish vs the remaning english speakers).\n\nThe game continues to get content updates direct from Yingpei, but at a much slower pace, and almost solely new over powered guns and PvE content.  Still not pay to win since it is still very RNG heavy, but the amount of time put in is not equal to the thrill of shooting off 300 bullets or opening up 300 packages to no avail.\n\nIt's become obvious to the community (as toxic as it may be) that the game is about to get disconnected, and the ones who stay are for the most part PvE centric and are only staying till their friends leave out or they all transition to a new game.\n\nThe only way I could still recommend this is if you are a brand new player and excited to see something a bit different. I can not in good conscience let you spend money on this though... do not invest in the game as I believe once the lease on the server runs out, it will be gone as most of the other ZMR versions in other countries have gone.\n\n\n:End Edit:\n\n\nI have played many a Free to Play game, and in doing so have seen some of the worst pay 2 win models, abandoned projects and just generally the worst aspects of this genre of gaming.  I originally went into ZMR with the same expectations that I would play for a few levels, find the free to play wall that almost every game of this type has and move on to something else.... that was in November during the Steam launch.\n\nI can honestly say this is the absolute model for how I expect a Free to Play game to work from here on out.  The development staff is honestly involved with the game via the reddit and during weekly streams as well as in game. The paid transactions are scrutinized before release in order to maintain a free players ability to compete and have fun. The updates are regular and add new content and items (and not just reskinned or cosmetic skins, but actual new things to collect for free players) and there is no free player cliff via gated content or any other sort of have to pay to advance shenanigans.\n\nI will break the rest of this review into a simple pros and cons.\n\nPro:\n-Regular Updates\n-Lots of content for PvE and PvP\n-Actual mod developer interaction that actually effects the direction of the game\n-Tons of guns\n-Nice art style with a decent frame rate and graphics\n\nUnfortunately there are still cons even after the "Game of Drones" Update:\n-Some mystery lag issues that only effect certain players at certain times (Being worked on)\n-Still no anti-cheat (But report feature actually works and players are remvoed quickly)\n-*ahem* Aggressive.. community (Not all, plenty of helpful players, but they are not the loudest)\n-smallish population\n\nAll in all, this has been a great find, and after the "Game of Drones" update more stuff to do and more fun to be had.  Overall I'm glad to be a part of this community and I hope it stays alive for a good while longer.  If you enjoy shooters, give it a try you will be pleasantly surprised after playing crap like APB Reloaded, Super MNC, and Loadout.","April 18, 2015","true","58.0"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","29","36","0","0"

It has PvE for people who got tired of PvP oriented games focusing towards e-sports, and you can fight everything from zombies to monsters to clones to robots so you get some variety. Guns are relatively easy to earn (some luck and grinding involved) considering you can earn lottery ticket type items (called bullets, range from silver, gold then platinum) to earn guns normally bought only with actual cash.\n\nIt's fun, it's free and you can't call it truly pay-2-win when you can earn the same guns just with more effort involved.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtdeath/recommended/306830/","dtdeath","DevilTorture","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtdeath/","137 products in account","I started playing this during steam release, and i gotta say, cant believe i havent tried it prior!  Reminds me of the blasts i had in killing floor!  It's all out WAR against everything you could think of! (well, almost!)  It has PvP... but that is not where the focus nor selling point is, its the coop!\n\nI must also say that while there is easily a wallet sink in this game for those who have tons of dosh to throw away, that since i have started playing, i have enjoyed every minute of being a Free player.  I'm not at a disadvantage because i dont subscribe or spend money on equipment, and the time spent acquiring new gear/levels also gives you a chance to figure out all the cool nick-nacks/secret things that have to do with movement, weapons, and surviving all around, and i highly recommend NOT spending money on anything in the game for at least your first 40 hours, so you know what everything is, what you unlock at certain levels (which is pretty much everything u can buy when u start),\n\none thing that turned me off when i started but is not an issue at all once you've dropped a few hours in and done a few of the missions, is the fact that weapons/gear that you obtain for the most part have a limited time of use, IE have a timer.  most things range between 3 days, 1 week, and 1 month.\nHOWEVER\nthis does not mean you are forced to spend money on the game either, especially not to acquire permanant weapons/gear;  you unlock permanant gear just for ranking up your character, and using silver/gold/platinum bullets at the shooting gallery.\nAfter every match on normal/advanced u get a minimum of 1 silver bullet, which u can take to the 'shooting gallery' to take your chances at permanant gear.   the shooting gallery is a simple mini-game with no real challenge to it, u just pick a target and click to reveal the item behind the target.  i have already obtained 3 permanant weapons from the shooting gallery, (and that does not include the other 3 permanant weapons ive got from just leveling my character so far).\n\nanother thing people might be worried about starting off, is the revive system.  its pretty basic, but has a little to understand.   Pretty much, u get 3 revives per map free, IF you die.  You can be picked up while bleeding out, if you go down from taking too much dmg.  but if you bleed out, a team member can not revive you.  once this occurs you are forced to either use one of the free revive tokens to revive yourself, or u can team revive everyone.  if u team revive everyone while u have one of the 3 free revives left, it uses 1 of those free revives to revive you, and uses the other players free revives to get them back into the game, so it doesnt use yours.\nIf you run out of those 3 revives per map, u have a choice to use "Revive tokens" which you obtain for completing missions, opening completion packs (for completing advanced modes), and from the shooting gallery using all 3 types of bullets (silver/gold/platinum).  As long as you dont go into an extrememly hard map, undergeared and undermanned, and waste all your revive tokens, you should ALWAYS be in the positive on this,  so reviving in a PVE match if you lose your free ones, should not be an issue.\n\nthe only real pvp mode that is worth playing is the "Mercs VS Monsters"  - 1 team of players plays as zombies/monsters, the other team plays as mercenaries/dominion soldiers.  after 1/2 of the time runs out for the match, or if one team reaches the score limit, the teams switch sides and the roles are flipped.  very fun game mode for PVP which helps root out aimbotting/cheaters with third party programs by adding roles to each merc/monster u choose.  ALL other pvp modes are very 'iffy' because you keep all your gear and guns... and likely to find more cheaters in the regular pvp as opposed to MvM.\n\nOverall great game with tons of replayability and challenge.  quite a bit of content (and tons more promised that i personally am looking forward to).  if you got time for a coop oriented, think on your feet, almost twitch-like third person shooter then give this a go, and get some friends to join you, you wont be dissapointed!","October 1, 2014","true","89.3"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","33","46","0","0"

It doesn't take itself seriously, but looks like it could. The graphics are pretty good, the action is fun, the controls are tight (Gears of War cover mechanics and Iron sights). I have rarely had problems with lag, or server crashes, and the community is pretty cool. People yab.\n\nThe only downsides of this game is a lack of content. Yea, there are some audio bugs, certain NPCs are mixed way too high and will destroy your eardrums. The DX11 setting (or was it 10) causes shadow glitches. Sometimes DOF causes your whole screen to blur out.

On the PvE side, there are several different game modes ranging from wave-based survival to more elaborate multi-stage missions that end in a boss fight. During these missions you get to fight everything from guys with guns to Asian zombies (and regular ones) to Egyptian god-monsters to dinosaurs. These are not hour-long twenty-person raids where everyone has to do exactly his part, but I've only played the lowest of four difficulty levels. Besides, I like the ease of just dropping in even in the middle of a mission. Everything tells you not to take the game too seriously and just jump in to have fun. I am not into PvP, but the Merc vs. Monster mode is quite fun; I played one match as the monsters. There are like a dozen classes each with a special ability; I tried out invisibility and suicide bombing to good effect.\n\nThe movement in the game feels slow (I think the devs tried to make it tactical but I initially found it sluggish), and you may not like it. You have to try it for yourself to see if you can get used to it. It's the same with graphics, sound, controls, shooting, so on. Good thing it's free.\n\nIt is true that the weapons, weapon mods, other gear, and cloth in this game are mostly rented or bought with both real and in-game currency. However, contrary to the criticisms I've read, they don't adversely affect the game.  You start with some decent timed gear for free, but you also get a set of permanent basic gear so you never not have guns to shoot. There are easily completed misisons that reward you with additional timed gear. These missions, as well every match you complete, also reward you with in-game currency; you can use that to buy or rent guns. Permanent guns are very expensive, so don't expect to do it in ten hours; twenty maybe. Oh, and as your character levels up, and you get some timed and permanent guns as rewards in the process. So, while it appears greedy when you go into the store and everything is either cheaply rented or very expensively bought, you are still competitive with what you can get using in-game resources.\n\nWhile we are on the subject, there are a good number of game modes and maps where you can either pick up guns dropped by enemies or trade them with points you earn during the match (like CoD Zombies). If you ever run out of free timed guns and have no currency to rent any, and the thought of using the basic gun offends you, those modes are still very playable.\n\nThe other major purchasable resource that I've noted is the Revive Token. Every match you get 3 free Revives, when you run out, you are out of luck and have to quit or use your stash of Revive Tokens. You get 50 in the beginning, and after every completed match you get a lottery "bullet" that frequently gives a token as prize (gear otherwise). You don't die right away when you are down, you get a bleedout period when your mates can help you up, so that's another layer of protection for you. I've personally used Revive Tokens only rarely during the longer missions (most bosses are not Token reapers); I hardly even use the free Revives on the survival and hunting maps, but again, I've only played on the lowest difficulty.\n\nI've spent a lot of time talking about the economics because that seems to be the biggest criticism. I find it unobstructive, so far, and hopefully my info removes enough worry for you to give it a try.","October 20, 2014","true","38.1"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","26","34","0","0"

However, just a few hours into the game, one will find glaring issues:\n\nThe engine is unoptimized as hell, and prone to crashing at the slightest irregularity. I've crashed while alt+tabbing numerous times.\n\nThe game has no class system, which is normally a big plus for me. Bit it also has no real party roles, either. Everyone is a lone wolf, looking out for his or herself. The only way to play a medic, for example, would be to equip the medic pack in one of your equipment slots which raises the rate at which you can revive wounded comrades. But the rate increase is minor, not worth the usage of a slot, and you rarely have the opportunity to revive party members anyway.\n\nIn order to unlock new equipment slots, you have to pay. This puts an instant, inalienable cap on the capability of free players.\n\nThe arguably best weapons are behind a pay-wall, or a ridiculous RNG whack-a-mole style shooting gallery where the function of tokens is fulfilled by bullets of various grades that you recieve for accomplishing tasks. The chance of a good weapon is abysmally low, even in the highest grade shooting galleries.\n\nEven on the easiest difficulty, which is by no means hard, enemies who do manage to down a player will almost instantly execute them; leaving no chance for other players to come help. This is part of the reason that the game is so generous in the doling out of revive tokens; after several hours, you will have between 70 to 100 revive tokens. But a battle in which you must use a revive token is much less satisfying, especially when the token is used to patch up a cheap kill.\n\nThe difficulty hike from the first to second stage of difficulty is mind-bogglingly insane. Enemies that you could take down with a few body shots on the first difficulty will require at least three quarters of a magazine's worth of non-stop head-shots to bring down. It's insane.\n\nThe number of one-shot kills is insulting. One-shot kills and fast TTKs have their place in other genres of game. But in an over-the-top action hero game like this, where the bosses include 1980s DinoRiders references and Swiss Army Knife submarines, your character ought to be able to take a little bit of a beating before he goes down. Even with the +50% health buff equipment, which costs exclusive currency gotten specifically for completing some tasks, you will be one shot by obese remedial kids who I swear have the sound effects of some creature from a Godzilla film I once saw.\n\nThe Co-op missions are strung together in a haphazard fashion, with mission segments being broken up by frequent (far, far too frequent) cutscenes of a door opening. Or the camera panning over an array of enemies, spoiling the obstacles up ahead rather than allowing you to explore.\n\nThe game is now balanced around a metagame of players optimizing ridiculous looking 'drones,' which in effect turn everybody into a pet class. While this may appeal to some, I myself am not a fan of being pigeonholed into a feature which looks silly while having it play the game, even if it's just in part, for me.\n\nSadly, Zombies Monsters Robots is a game that was on the right track to be simply epic, but fails too hard in too many ways for it to be worth my continued attention. I would not be able to, in good conscious, suggest it to anyone. Wonderful, BEAUTIFUL concept, with a horrible execution in monetary model, presentation, and game-play. A huge let-down in every measure, and a depressing example of yet another failed co-op game.\n\nFinal verdict: Go back to Warframe.","May 28, 2015","false","38.0"," 75 of 122 people (61%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","61","75","122","14","7"

Of course it has it's marketing scheme, they want you to buy their product.\n\nYou start with a Heavy MG that lasts for thirty days and a Famas that last for seven days, as well two permanent guns; the 1911 and a Scar rifle. If you do a couple co-op missions you will unlock several decent weapons that you can hold onto for three days. So, you have a time frame for which you need to earn enough in-game credits to purchase another permanent weapon, which I would estimate to be around twenty hours of gameplay to afford. Also, there are maps you can play where you can pick up guns(Like the COD zombies modes). You could just do those until you had enough to afford a permanent weapon.\nAnyway, enough about the weapons.\n\nTHERE ARE DINOSAURS WITH ROCKET LAUNCHERS ON THEIR BACKS!\n\nThe are of course some minor glitches;  movement frustration can happen but you should easily figure out the simple issues, wall cover is a little iffy, enemies can spawn glitched sometimes, and allied player revive is a little clunky. Yes, sometimes monsters will all follow the same person attacking them and somewhat stunning them in place. That person being followed needs to roll, and quickly begin sprinting hoping their teammates will 86 any pursuing enemy.\n\nThe good things I've noticed in PVE mode - haven't played PVP - ;Registration on the NPC's heads seems nice, plenty of game modes to keep you interested, and plenty of game types melded together.\n\nThe voice acting is meh and the sprinting panting noise is annoying, but the sound effects aren't so bad.

I'd give it a 9!\n9.95\n\nThis was a game I was hyped up for and I must say it lived up to my expectations and surpassed them.\n\nI have to say I think this game is better than the new Resident Evils and the Gears of War series. The monsters and map designs are definitly better.\n\nThat is ultimatly the main appeal to ZMR and it knows it. People want to shoot Zombies, Monsters and Robots and it delivers. The thing that really suprised me was the Mummies and dinosaurs. T-Rexs with rockets attached to them.\n\nThe maps are simply some of my favorite in all of gaming, notibably the aztec pyramid, and tropical map.\n\nMy only main problem in this game is the movement. Character animations are okay, and movement is good, but not as good as Gears, Uncharted or Resident Evil.\n\nI say this because if they fix that one problem this could be one of the greatest thirdperson shooters of all time. As of now the character movement is good, but not as amazing as the maps and monsters\n\nReally once I find a game I love, and I do LOVE ZMR I seek out ways to improve it. So here are my suggestions.\n\n\nMore Focus on Soundtrack, I mean this game would be a lot better if it had a great soundtrack to go with it.\nForget realistic boring guns, give us unique badass guns.\nAnd Aliens.\n\nMy final suggestion is just to add more character to the game, like have more awesome things for the character to randomly say durring battle, maybe an announcer that says DOUBLE KILL or crazy effects, something like pyrovision in TF2 as an example.\n\nBut really character animations/movement and soundtrack/announcer would greatly improve this game.\n\nAlso a haunted mansion and school map would be awesome.\n","September 23, 2014","true","122.3"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","28","40","0","0"

Im not againsted the whole pay for guns and keep them for a few days thing, but it does kinda suck but hey, its f2p how else are they gonna make some money?

The game has so much to offer for such a wide variety of players, it's silly not to at least give it the benefit of the doubt for a couple hour play session.\nit plays like Gears of War had a lovely Ménage à trois with Call of Duty zombies and a culmination of every horror creature within common knowledge. Which stresses my initial point even further. "This game is designed to appeal to a huge audience of players." And yet I know 6 out of 5 of you haven't played it yet and are looking for a review to sway your feeble assumptions from whatever path the games reviews ratings were. So let me put it to you straight, the game is good, not great, but good. It's a great game to sit down with for a handful of rounds, mixing it up between the various copy pasta'd PvE game modes, to the FPS staple PvP game modes that we already know like the back of our hands... or is that just me?\n\nIf anything, let me just say this, there wasn't a lot of loot yield in beta, and the devs are basically holding your hands at this point with level reward unlocks, so get your fun in now folks.","April 28, 2015","true","42.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

THE ONLY thing u can't get without money (that's actually worth anything besides just cosmetic) is emp costumes. Everything else is or will be avalible. Yes you can pay money to get stuff sooner. The game is free to download and play. Most games cost $50-90 just to bring it home then god knows how much to keep playing it online... If you want an example of P2W for this game google "Hazard Ops".\n\nPR0S:\n- Free dlcs that get released every so often.\n- No P2W methods in this game.\n- Fun game modes such as Threshhold Defense, Kill Everything, Kill Everything 2, Assault, Assault Ops, Massive Assault, Paranormal Ops, Extinction Ops, Team Death Match, Patient Zero, Elimination, Defuse/Plant the bomb, Free for All, and lastly Mech Battles PvP.\n- You can earn "bullets" in a difficulty for each game mode such as "silver bullets", "gold bullets", and lastly "platinum bullets". These bullets can be use in the shooting gallery of your inventory menu for a chance to win permanent guns to advance through the game.\n- Huge amounts of weapons and gear can be obtained via bullet range or in-game store.\n- Corporations or Guilds (with no bonuses except for another chat tab) can be made or joined.\n- Ranked Matches (event only) are hosted once in a while.\n- Players or AI can get downed and be executed by an enemy unless revived by another player.\n- Has a reloading bar mechanic from Gears of War (mainly because one of the producers of Gears worked on this game).\n\nC0NS:\n- About 40% (more or less) of this games population is made out of Brazilians from another version of this game called "Hazard Ops".\n- Ping can constantly go over 50+ .\n- 95% of your hits will be on target.\n- Few Cutscene are a bit bugged.\n- No anti-cheat is implemented ... yet.\n- Horrible balancing system if PvP settings are set to balanced (ex: 6v1)\n- Players that pay for gear and weapons can gain a slight advantage to players who play for free.\n- Snipers and Shotguns can be one hit kills.\n\nTL;DR: This game is fun, but the high ping can be a nuisance. Also there is no anti-cheat which makes it a playground for hackers (although players can record these aimbotters and hackers using the in-game recorder).\n\nEdit: A drone update just came out and it has improved a lot of the gameplay and store mechanics. Players are now able to buy permanent assault and zk weapons via store for gold and emp as well as equip drones. Players are now able to unlock more stuff by leveling up (guns, drones, etc.).

While silver bullets from games  are easier to get (finishing normal/advanced games, gold ones require y ou do to expert games. ) Also besides that stuff there are some exclusive weapons and things you get solely from platnium bullets  and those come from completeing the nightmare difficulty of games.\n\n\nIf you are into shooters I would have to say you really should give this game a try and at least give it enough time to get used to it, you might find you really like it just like I did\n\n\nI will give this game a 8.6 out of 10, reasons being why not 10 out of 10 is because\n\nRun take cover and roll are the same key, sometimes making you do something else instead of what you wanted to do if to close to cover or used to being able to tap run.\n\nGame gets repetiviave but if you used to playing lobby shooter games then this would not be much an issue ( I personaly have no issue with it but its listed for those who thinks its a open world mmo or something lol, cause its not its a lobby room based shooter game. )\n\nControls are easy to learn but the game itself is hard to master and  be prepared to die a lot and takes a while  getting down the playstyle ( again for me not a real issue but this day and age  lots of impatent people. )\n\nAs you will notice up there  some of these issues I do not really care about but it was listed in seeing that ussaly some of them will get called out but for what this game is     it does it pretty darn well.\n\nSo instead of taking reviews words for it though, why not give this game a shot and see if it is something you like, what  could you possibly lose  other than maybe you like it and it eats up your free time.","November 30, 2014","true","164.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I looked at all the troubleshooting stuff and none of it worked. I put in a ticket after about 2 hours going through the forums on my own and they actually responded by the next morning. Giving me the standard troubleshooting advice, however one thing they said I just humored them on, and it turned out it was the problem.\n\nSUPER IMPORTANT PART: I have AVG anti-virus and it was blocking the game without giving any type of notice at all.

Probably doesn't need the whole folder exempted, but I'm not computer savvy enough to know EXACTLY what does need exempted because the Launcher.exe wasn't enough to get it to work.\n\nSo anyway, that conflict problem seems to be the root of several complaints I've seen. Once you get past that, I"ve been having a blast. I've logged 22.6 hours in 2 days. 9pm-4am with friends, then 3pm-8pm solo and 8pm-3am with friends. Back to Back, More Gaming than Sleeping! I recommend it!\n\nOh, and I don't see any reason to get the DLC. The free Game is plenty good, and from my experience you can spend the same amount of money to get exactly the guns and equipment piecemeal. Just play some Assault Maps first and pick up enemy weapons to try out the guns before you drop real money or in game gold on them!","May 22","true","97.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The pve is really great and fun, and challenging. From taking out a zombies in china, to storming egypt, killing anubis and the other egyptian gods. Pvp...well I saw a bunch of ptw guys. I just payed to dress up. The guns arent that bad, they seem okay, the ptw guns do have a bit more stats than the normal ones, but I used to be one of the ptw guys. Now i just wanna beat those ptw guys, and prove that skill can't be bought. Sure there are problems. For one: the lag. It hits you every 5 minutes but lasts about 10-20 seconds. And the bugs. one bug is the hit detection. There are times Ishoot and the hit wouldn'd register, but good thing I have a LMG. And i see this in pvp sometimes: enemy players shooting through cover.  Not every game is gonna be perfect at launch. People are sitting here slapping bad reviews,"oh it's a GoW ripoff". To me its great, I loved the reloading from gears of war. I think ALL shooting games should have them. "Its a 3rd person shooter version of CoD: Zombies." Yes, only difference is that ZMR is free and CoD is about 30-40 bucks. Overall it is not a bad game, besides the lag(which the devs are fixing, so it is not, repeat, NOT Steam's fault.), and cannot wait as this patches on to go from okay to pretty good.\n\nOverall I give this game a 7/10. This game has mixed elements of gears of war, killing floor, CoD:Zombies and such, only with new additons such as pvp's merc's vs monsters, a pve with little campaigns and cutscenes, along with the difficulty from normal to nightmare. As for it being a ptw: meh. I mean you DO get rewarded with the guns as you level and complete little side missions, and the gear provides little defensive bonuses or xp bonuses. The lag has been fixed so people can stop slapping it a bad review because of the lag.","September 21, 2014","true","430.9"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","2"

It's "RESIDENT EVIL" in full 3D, nuff said!!!\n\nSure there is/are items to buy, but you win items as loot as you progress, find coins as loot, (IDK if you find clothes yet, or not, but not every game has to be a costume ball ya know), & pick up guns/ammo inside of the levels, so as I see it, you don't ever 'HAVE' to buy anything...\n\nThe game's movement/aiming is a LITTLE wonky (not a FPS/Lag issue either), but it actually adds to the charm of the game... Kind'a reminds Me of when the 1st mostly 3D resident evil came out on Sega Dreamcast... it controlled like you had 5 lbs of chewing-gum stuck to your' boots ☻ Some stuff's REAL hard (I'd imagine being a higher level eases that, or having a big team/The game gets WAY easier when a few more players join), yet some stuffs fairly easy... there's killswitches you can use VS the mobs around the maps too that are entertaining, & work WELL.\n\nThe maps, lighting/shadows/glares, textures, FPS, everything in this game is top notch looking/sounding! (IDK about the music, I ALWAYS turn that off 1st thing on new games so I can hear My music) If you don't care that other players have more junk then you do, or better "looking gear" (cause even the free guns kill JUST fine), and love an awesome good time online with friends playing "Resident Evil X3D" (My petname for this game now) then Download this one now, it's 100% free to download/install/make a profile/make a character [goto options & setup a password to delete your' char after you make one] the only stuff that costs money you do not need, & frankly the players in My game who were higher levels/ranks, & some with neat gear, didn't really noticably kill mobs any faster then I did (Shotguns rule if you aim with a mouse), oh yeah 1 last thing... I hate to do it but this gets a 9-10 *s it gets -1 because no matter how you set it up, the aiming stick on the X360 pad is so jerkity it's amost unusable, so plan on aiming with your' mouse. ♪","January 28, 2015","true","14.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

However, this game has given me a lot to do and is rather fun and interesting just based on how much there content there is to do. For lower end computer users like myself this is one of the better overlooked F2P that's came from somewhat pay to win a year ago to now you can get just about anything you can buy in the store. Just doing all the maps will take you a fair amount of time. The only real downside of this game is\n\n1.Ping: If you live outside the states you will have higher ping which can be frustrating with pike spikes lately.\n\n2. PvP: There have been hackers(Not as many as people think) but unless they have pure aimbot they just have a bit more of an edge, but there isn't too many people I would say are unkillable as I normally come out positive playing whatever mode I'm doing as it should be played and still do fairly well 70% of the time. There is a learning curve to pvp for newer people but like every game it will just take you a few tries to learn the do's and what you should not do. Lvl 15 is also a bit of a turn off but that was to prevent return of aimbotters though it is a lot more rewarding and easier leveling up then when I joined. Playing a Nightmare map was rarely ever seen nor possible unless you payed for turrets or were lucky enough to get the assault crossbow which they basically give you now in a mission you can do daily. But, to some up this is more fun once you are higher leveled due to doing everything else.\n\n3. Players: Player count is somewhat low because people are going to latin zmr due to better ping since there are a lot of BR's that play this game along with a lot of missions they just give you all at once instead of doing it a handful at a time to unlock the new ones I don't know all the details, but that's what I was told. Second is players can be rather toxic and say hacker at everything because SMG's are overused and normally always have a 40+ Clip and act as laser guns with very little recoil which can feel cheap at times.\n\nOverall: This game will give you hours and hours of things to do, it looks pretty damn well if your computer has a decent graphics card, and is a very fun game if you join a corp and make a few friends to help you out. The game has changed and become a lot easier for people starting out you get a drone starting out and this this will become a lifesaver later one when you get higher leveled ones. Anyone who is trying to find a game to kill a few hours that's free I would say give it a shot, you have nothing to lose knowing it's free and has a lot to offer until you get around the upper 30's if you are trying to get to level 70 good luck you'll be in a grind forever unless you use double xp religiously which  I don't and as of writing this I am roughly mid 40's  but all in all give it a shot it's a fun game and I wish more people would give it a chance.","January 28","true","812.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can spend real money to get guns permanantly but that cost money, the one other downside is customization. Its not very broad.

Mods and Tech items are available in the shooting gallery as well as rental items and some mods or tech aren't available in the store, making some quite rare and maybe useful. One exception to this is that the Sentinel Gear is currently available as a random drop reward from Loot Cases, but that's about it.\n\n- Revive Tokens\n\nYou can earn a lot of revive tokens by simply playing and do a bit of farming in the PVE modes. So obviously, this means you do not have to buy them at all. And also, don't forget to check your Locker for some free revive tokens upon making a new character.\n\n- Do costume/gear stats work in pvp?\n\nNo, cosmetic items with stats that lower damage or grant immunity to something only applies to PVE modes, in pvp, it's purely cosmetic only. Costume/gear that gives an exp or gold boost work as intended.\n\n- What's up with the spacebar?\n\nUpon playing ZMR for the first time, you will notice that the spacebar does roll, hold to run, to take cover is awkward to you and some other players. It just takes some getting used to and adapting, there's no way around it.\n\n- Playing from Europe?\n\nIf you're being blocked from playing this game that's published for NA and you're from EU, there's a version of this game for you guys available under the name, Hazard Ops.\n\nhttp://www.hazardops.com/en/\n\n- Yingpei Games\n\nThey're pretty much the same guys that made "Gears of War: Judgement" and probably have worked and made the previous GOW titles before GOW: J.\n\nSome links:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games\n\nhttp://www.yingpeigames.com/\n\n\nOther than the above wall of text/information, this game is definitely fun to play,","September 20, 2014","true","0.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

You can buy the weapons and equipment permantely if you just play long enough. Also the game rewards you with more weapons and equipment as you play.

What's unique about this one is that its an RPG shooter, which means you get a bunch of collectible weapons, mods, and accessories, as well as npc pets to make yourself stronger. And you'll need them, because the hardest difficulties are absolutely nervewracking and require lots of teamwork and strategy, as well as good aim.\n\nPaying gives you certain conveniences - it's like pretty much every "decent" f2p game system nowadays where you "pay to grind less". Not the best, sure, but not blatantly pay2win like some games. One important thing to note is that you can get everything needed to finish the hardest difficulties without paying, but if you actually wanna not look like a generic redneck you're gonna have to pay some $$.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game, EME (the company that runs this game) is one of the better f2p operators who actually listen to the playerbase.\n\nIf you played this before the April update, then give it another chance, the update fixed almost everything wrong with the game in terms of F2P progression.","April 20, 2015","true","96.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Everything is obtainable buy farming bullets from any mode\n\nNow it's talk about PVP. Someone who is new to 3rd person shooting, get ready for your ♥♥♥ to get kicked multiple times by veterans.

Lots of headroom for strategy and some really big plays, clan functions and all. The game has some serious potential, I'll definitely be supporting this one. It's a total rip off of gears of war but I wouldn't have it any other way, I understand that there was a few developers from Epic games which is the team that made gears of war. The playerbase is growing fast and watching gameplay doesn't do too much justice, just try it for yourself, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly addicting. This is the best F2P shooter I've ever played, the graphics are nothing special which is okay because that just means it will run on more peoples computers. :) I give the game a 9/10, it's missing a point because the name is extremely tacky and repulsive, it sounds like a kids game, but really it could grow to be one of the top competitive games if more people start playing.

Free players can only get PERMANENT weapons (the other option used to be rental, but they got rid of that) through the shooting range which gives the chance to get weapons, exp, money, etc. But the odds of you getting anything good is so low that they actually have ways for you to pay real money to boost your chances buy paying into higher trier galleries. The graphics are poorly optimized (I can run the battlefront beta at max in HD and still get better fps) and the pvp is just who payed more for their guns. Empty rooms everywhere and all that is left is people who have never played cover based shooter, die in a corner surrounded and ask me to team revive them.

Oh, wait, they sort of did... that's why we have Horde Mode as a term...\n\nSO...uh... Ever wish you could play a less visceral and more bland-ish Gears of War Horde Mode type game on the PC? Well, it's your lucky day.\n\nFunctionally. The game works. It just feels bland. None of the guns feel like they have their own identity. Enemies, while there are a lot of reskins, seem to be just that. The environments look dated. In co-op most ai enemies either exist to run at your face as quickly as their relative size can carry them, or to stand at a distance and peck at you from outside cover. There are a few cheap enemies (Looking at you Mr. Barrel Toss) but dominate strategy seems to be just to trick the AI's pathing to confuse anything slightly dangerous. Most of the Co-op enemies basically come straight from either Gears of War, or Nazi Zombies. You have Tickers, Flamers, Boomers (even with the same type varity, grenade launcher flavor and shield flavor)... You probably get the idea. I understand that a lot of those work to punish different tactics and to keep you on your toes, It just feels a little...cease and desist-y...\n\nAs far as controls, it's just an average (an arguement could be made for slightly below average) third person cover shooter. The running, dodging, and cover controls feel a little... laggy... for lack of a better term. In Gears, Roadie Run and Roll were the same button as Cover. Whick worked in Gears, and added a signature 'weighty' feel to the controls. And a lot of it may have been the devs working with the controller limitations. But I'm sure a better control solution could have been worked up for this game, as opposed to "Hey, people were OK with it in Gears of War, let's just do that." In Gears it made more sense, given you were these huge, hulking dudes, and later in the series, dudettes. But in this, you look like some various skin-toned Nolan North character, and whatever they were going for with the female character. The weight that the Gears characters handled with makes less sense in this game. I'm not saying it needs Mirror's Edge or Warframe agility, but in the short time I've played, I've rolled too many times when I wanted to run, and run way too many times when I wanted to grab cover.\n\nSUMMARY: It's a third person cover shooter with fairly bland gameplay, graphics that might have been impressive a few years back, and sprint/dodge/cover all on one button. A Rent-A-Gun system, and pay-per-use consumables add a bit of frustration to the experience too. Yea it's going to be fun if you play it with friends, most anything is though. It just doesn't bring anything refreshingly unique to the table.","September 19, 2014","false","1.5"," 36 of 70 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","36","70","0","2"

It has something for everyone, including PvP and PvE. Some of the game modes are easy to compare to other multiplayer lobby shooters, but when you get the best modes from several different games all in one package and said package is free? That's awesome, if you ask me.

Could call COD a copy of other older FPS Games. Or A SImple idea of an rts game is a copy of the very first original ones. Seriously people. Same thing all I hear. No offence.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hudsonm1a2/recommended/306830/","hudsonm1a2","T-Bone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hudsonm1a2/","246 products in account","This game is truly a flashback to my early gaming days, simple graphics (comparing to some AAA titles), absolutely no physics and outrageous prices for the permanent weapons (if you use "free" in-game currency). If you don't mind playing against (or with) players with far more "advanced" weapons, then this game might suit you. My grades for the main features:\n\nGraphics: 60/100 - The animations are kind of jerky, they try to make them look "natural" but they switch up and kind of don't transition properly with each other (a sign of an older engine being used here). The cutscenes with on-screen characters lack lip-syncing with the voice acting (not the best I've seen as well). Also, the low-polygon count makes it faster and lower-spec machines are able to run it, but it doesn't make it any prettier.\n\nGameplay: 75/100 - They make good use of a feature used in the Mass-Effect series, the context-sensitive spacebar. And, surprisingly, it does the job quite well. The enemies are numerous and have health points that reflect well their size disparity. In average, the humanoid enemies are the weakest (the regular zombie against the special ZK weapons) while the dinosaurs have the largest health using the same base of analysis. The controls are quite responsive and precise, even when I was playing it for the first time, without customizing the sensivity for the mouse, they didn't let me down. But the lack of physics is disappointing, even trying to go down from a small ledge or downstais from unguarded steps is impossible. Your character is glued to the ground, and, using a situation that I faced personally, when you are surrounded by dinosaurs, you can't escape down to the river from the slightly elevated part of the shore because your character simply can't jump down.\n\nF2P business model: 40/100 - This game is basically an infinite grind. To grind the first levels I had to play for more than 2 hours. I sense a lack of a feeling of actual progress. This F2P model is old and several other games have met their doom because of it. I don't plan to invest any real money in this game. While some games are hard to grind, they allow you to keep the equipment forever, it's yours. In this game though, there are several weapons that you can only buy for the maximum time of 30 days, this kind of forces you to keep playing (or paying) to keep the weapon with you, and when they let you keep the gun, they charge an enormous ammount of either premium or free currency. To just cite one of these games that went under because of this model of business: Landmass (by Gunsoft).\n\nAfter all this text, I recommend this game with caution. While requiring low-end computers (for today's standards) and being fun to play with a small group of friends (even cheap laptops will run this game) and topping it with an above-average gameplay seems pretty good, avoid spending money on it.","October 7, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(not counting certain other weapons which are unlocked w/a combination of silver bullets/currency/etc... which I haven't even encountered yet)\n\nA list of pros and cons (which are slightly biased)\n---------------------------------------------------\nPros:\n- Lots of variety for both PvP and PvE modes; sometimes completely changing the way the game is played\n- You CAN get permanent weapons with ingame-earned currency. It just takes a while; I would estimate a shorter grind than even Blacklight, however. (and definitely shorter than Warframe)\n- NOT P2W. (as far as I know)\n- Starts you off with a fair amount of gold and a gold increase booster, etc etc etc...\n- So far the community seems nice enough. Or quiet if nothing else.\n\nCons:\n- Servers seem to disconnect once in a while- though then again this game is new to Steam so this might only be a temporary thing, hopefully.\n- Get stomped in classic Team Deathmatch mode by snipers. (though in all fairness, most of these snipers are using weapons purchased with ingame currency, not P2W... just a bit of a grind)\n- Have to pay (or grind/wait) to revive more than 3 times in PvE, otherwise losing progress/rewards as it counts as a "leave." In all fairness you DO start off with 50 additional revive points, but still...\n- Permanent weapons unlockable with ingame currency are pretty basic (though nonetheless viable) and relatively few. (not counting random chance for bullet ones)\n- (personal opinion only) not enough customization options, even costumes/customization options that are for cash would be appreciated. On the other hand the game's still new.\n\nStill would reccomend ZMR so far. It's not amazing or anything, but it's fun and has lots of things to do... which is good enough for me.","September 21, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has a feeling to it that I can't explain. It has a rather serious side to it if you wish to get into that much, but it has such a funny and nonserious side to it that I think everyone can really grow to love! This is one of my favourite tps's out there by far, and I can't seem to want to play anything else but it!\n\nLets run through the pro's of this game:\nHit registration is absolutely amazing! I can actually tell when my bullets should hit and miss and it does a very good job of making that happen! If I see a bullet hit a wall, it's obviously missing anything, and if i see my bullet hit their head, I get a headshot! (Looking at you CS:go)\n\nThere's tons of inventory space, like right from the get go you can buy 100 guns if you want to and you'll have the space for it.\n\nTons of achievements. That's right, the game has a ton of ingame achieves that you can bring yourself to the test with. The game even displays how many points you've earned with your achievement progress which is pretty awesome!\n\nGet back in the game! The game has a revival system if you didn't exactly do too well on your last life. For most missions you get a few free revival tokens that you can use before you start dipping into your revival tokens. You can get these back by completeing some missions so it's rather win win!\n\nItem combination, If you have 2 of the same gun because you progressed really fast or mistakingly bought one, you can combine the weapons together or items to get a longer duriation on that item! I only had about 2 hours left on my ak but i had one with a few days on it and managed to get it up to like, 8 days. That made me pretty happy honestly.\n\nPVE, the pve is absolutely awesome and I keep coming back for more. I honestly can't describe how addictive it is to play some of the modes on there. Theres so many difficulties and levels that it's really hard to not want to keep trying and keep advancing!\n\nPlayercards, Yea this isn't really a big deal but it's pretty cool that you can get a nice shiney card to display your achievements with along with it showing you your dps and what not. It's rather impressive going into a lobby and flaunting off a really high dps to everyone else without even having to say it!\n\nPVP, there is ranked pvp on this game which is pretty cool! I haven't went into myself because i'm still new to the game but it's rather impressive that you can have a competative side to this game that seems so silly and care free! So there's a bit of everything for everyone who wants to play!\n\nSilven/gold/plat bullets, The game gives you some bullets depending on the achievement you unlocked, level you just got or whatever else. These bullets give you a chance at some really awesome items! I got a permenant gun out of one of these and a playercard, along with a ♥♥♥♥ ton of coins and turrets and trial weapons. The list is so wide of how many items you can get through this little minigame  that it's really fun! You can get some really awesome t hings out of it and I don't even know the full list currently.\n\nI can't currently think of anymore pro's but the cons list is going to be rather short. So lets start.\n\nTemp Items, Now now I know most of you look at this and want to go away but stay a while and listen. This is a con for most people because it's like "i don't want to have to keep getting my guns over and over" but honestly, the game gives you such a high amount of cash that it doesn't even really matter. I honestly have like, 10~20 guns sitting around in my inventory with weeks on them. And I just started playing! The game gives you so much money that the  temporary item system doesn't really matter all that much,  seeing as you get about 2000+ coins every match.\n\nTemporary server lag, due to steam flooding the servers are currently a little overwhelmed because there's a lot of us players on here, but honestly they've already worked out the kinks so far so the servers are already running smooth as all hell!\n\nPassed that I honestly can't think of anything else except some people may look the same since the customization has a rather small  selection, but even then you can buy yourself some gear to look different from the rest. The voices can be a bit silly if they don't match your character but that goes with every game with creation, so this is kind of a pro and a con.\n\nSo yeah, that's about it for my review of this game! I seriously recommend this game to anyone! I think you'll find it's sillyness and gameplay will be absolutely enjoyable. Oh, I also forgot to mention you can get some sick ♥♥♥ sword to use for completing a certain mission! It's really fun to use!\nThanks for taking the time to read my review, please rate it how you feel I did, lets try to get more players for ZMR!\n\nTl;dr\npros,\nLots of guns\nreplayable\nranked\ncompetative/noncompetative\nrewards\nachievements\nfun\n\ncons,\ntemp server lag (already being worked on/fixed)\ntemp item system (read up before looking away)\nSlightly limited initial character customization.","September 23, 2014","true","18.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

This game has a feeling to it that I can't explain. It has a rather serious side to it if you wish to get into that much, but it has such a funny and nonserious side to it that I think everyone can really grow to love! This is one of my favourite tps's out there by far, and I can't seem to want to play anything else but it!\n\nLets run through the pro's of this game:\nHit registration is absolutely amazing! I can actually tell when my bullets should hit and miss and it does a very good job of making that happen! If I see a bullet hit a wall, it's obviously missing anything, and if i see my bullet hit their head, I get a headshot! (Looking at you CS:go)\n\nThere's tons of inventory space, like right from the get go you can buy 100 guns if you want to and you'll have the space for it.\n\nTons of achievements. That's right, the game has a ton of ingame achieves that you can bring yourself to the test with. The game even displays how many points you've earned with your achievement progress which is pretty awesome!\n\nGet back in the game! The game has a revival system if you didn't exactly do too well on your last life. For most missions you get a few free revival tokens that you can use before you start dipping into your revival tokens. You can get these back by completeing some missions so it's rather win win!\n\nItem combination, If you have 2 of the same gun because you progressed really fast or mistakingly bought one, you can combine the weapons together or items to get a longer duriation on that item! I only had about 2 hours left on my ak but i had one with a few days on it and managed to get it up to like, 8 days. That made me pretty happy honestly.\n\nPVE, the pve is absolutely awesome and I keep coming back for more. I honestly can't describe how addictive it is to play some of the modes on there. Theres so many difficulties and levels that it's really hard to not want to keep trying and keep advancing!\n\nPlayercards, Yea this isn't really a big deal but it's pretty cool that you can get a nice shiney card to display your achievements with along with it showing you your dps and what not. It's rather impressive going into a lobby and flaunting off a really high dps to everyone else without even having to say it!\n\nPVP, there is ranked pvp on this game which is pretty cool!

I remember playing like spec ops or something on combat arms back in the day and this game kind of reminds me of that with the twist in gears of war horde mode or something like that.  It doesn't take long to get the jist of things.  Whether you do pvp or pve server, there are tons to do and with that said, always be a team player and your squad will somehow survive.  I know the devs still have ♥♥♥♥ tons to do with the game, and with it being free to play as well, I don't expect it to be perfect and I expect some net code errors to surface.  If you are unable to launch this game from steam from the launcher, the fix is very simple.  Go to the root of steam and get into steamapps and ZMR.  Find the ZMR launcher on the very bottom of the list and execute.  It will patch the game, give you a few errors, and then you do the same process and click on play.  When I ran the game under steam, the launcher would not patch nor would it execute to the loading screen it just stayed blank at the launcher.  This little workaround should help.

Companies have to make money somehow compared to other reviews that have come before this, which is way there is pay now or earn it avenues, so the game caters to life nicely. Plently of modes to choose from in PvE and PvP, nice selection of weapons and overall a fantastic time of satisfying your battle fever. The game  has come a major step of the way in terms of past reviews, and again, this is due to a supporting team listening to its fan base.\n\nOverall ZMR, with its supportive team, has accomplished and still remains to this day, true to the shooter genre, and acheives what some shooters have failed to think and act upon.\n\nTutorials - On key, directional, and at your own pace.\n\nGameplay - Very Nice, fluid motion, handful of action, sensible balance of challenge\n\nGear - Pay for it or Earn it, Buy some nice gear or work for it and have chances to earn additional items in the shooting gallery.\n\nAI - A bit unfair at times, however, with skill and luck you can overcome the odds.\n\nOverall Charcther Shaping - A few hours everyday for a casual player will net them substatial rewards and good experience.","December 29, 2014","true","462.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Why?  A lot of them complain about issues that have long since been addressed by the publisher and therefore are meaningless. These reviews, needless to say, have not kept up with the content that has been added since they were originally written.\n\nFurther, ZMR is a game that takes time to get into. If you only play for 30 minutes to a couple hours then you have not spent nearly enough time to experience the variety of maps and game modes available. You have not spent the time to achieve even one level for your character or complete any of the daily missions.  You have not had the chance to play enough maps to earn the rewards that help your character.\n\nZMR is definitely not P2W.  Even your starting weapons work just fine in all the PvE modes.  PvP is a bit harder but plenty of my PvP opponents use the basic starting rifle to kick butt just fine.\n\nZMR has its issues like any other game but the publisher is very responsive to the community.  The game continues to undergo changes to make it better.  I've played it daily for 3 months now and I'm not bored yet.","December 29, 2014","true","605.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Yes, it's a rent this weapon, spend a ♥♥♥♥♥on of time grinding for a permanant version, or pay real money game. While it may put you off and it puts me off, it's still a pretty good game. I'll recommend it for people who don't mind these types of games but if you're not a fan of the renting system, ignore it.

By steam nowdays, population isn't much, mainly because most people  prefer to log in by own enmasse client, but steam is a god way to put EMP when you is from outside USA, a thing who i see as a excelent caracteristic in ZMR, because here in enmasse server you can find people of entire world, what is verry interesting and funny, the major caracteristic of ZMR is that is a funny game.\n\nIf you is in doubt about ZMR i can say that i play this game have almost 4 years and only playing by steam i have more than 1859hours of gameplay here, and i'm not a player who uses steam much and i can say with security that i have near maybe even more than 5000hours of gameplay in this game.\n\nThanks and i hope that the new players enjoy the game. :)","February 17","true","865.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","5","9","4","0"

It has both its ups and downs, some content more frustrating than most but overall it is definitely a game worth trying out.\n\nFirst of all, ZMR is both PVP and PVE, so those who want a good natural fight against others or want to team up against the world will expect a good choice. PVP offers a great variety of modes and maps to play on and PVE does the same. Gear and customization of the character looks amazing.\n\nThe only downside I have to ZMR are about two things: PVP balance and Revival.\n\nIn most PVP oriented games, there are usually servers with levels caps such as levels 1 - 10 can only play on a certain server. This works out great for new people, as they can grasp the concept of the game and CQB, however it is extremely unfair and very much a slap in the face when you hit level 11. You go from babysteps, to ill-join-a-game-for-10-seconds-and-then-get-shot-in-the-head-by-a-sniper-because-thats-all-everyone-is-using matches. I don't wanna call any sniper players out, but this is really is pathetic of ZMR to suddenly kick a newly fresh player who may stilll not grasp the game fully out onto a field where players that are 50X their level will swoop in and feed on them. I honestly felt like target practice for pro players after not being able to go into the newbie servers. You can't even do your PVP missions anymore at that point because everyone is deep in their base in cover acting like Assassins Creed and then quickly shooting one bullet that kills you with a sniper.\n\nThe other bad thing is revival. While it is very nice to save your teammate and being able to get them up, the system is ridiculous. Whenever a teammate goes down, they drop their weapon, and if a teammate is near enemy bodies; they are near other weapons as well. See, when I try to revive my teammate, im directly over their weapon as well. I basically end up picking up their weapon instead and they die in front of me as if i didnt even try. It is honestly frustrating there isnt a different button for revival or a different system.\n\nOverall the game is great, if you are seriously a competetive pvp and pve oriented person this is a game you should try, espicially with friends.","November 7, 2014","true","105.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One mode is pretty much the Zombie survival stuff from the Call of Duty series, while others play like classic Arcade-style shooters where you're advancing through a place stage-by-stage and end with a big boss battle.   PvP is also varied with its game modes, though it doesn't seem to be played as often as the PvE side of things.\n\nIf you don't mind the annoying cash shop practices (temporary guns, long grinds to get a few permanent ones unless you're lucky with RNG, etc.) then this is a pretty fun shooter that takes elements from a lot of different games and throws them all together into one package.\n\nAlso wtf random Contra Stage 2.","November 14, 2014","true","58.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can play a round of Demolition on a map similar to de_dust from Counter-Strike one round and then switch to a spinoff of Call of Duty's Nazi Zombies survival mode. ZMR operates like Gears of War mechanically but offers a plethora of game modes in both PvP and PvE that mix things up enough to keep interest.\n\nThere is a weapon rental system similar to a lot of Korean Shooter MMOs, but permanent versions of guns are readily available and obtainable without spending money (granted some take a lot more grinding than others)\n\nRewards from PvE are received through a system similar to Payday 2 while PvP rewards are a chest system like CS:GO has. Doing both will earn in game currency and chances at gear through completing quests, which could include objects like "Kill 5 enemies with a shotgun" or "Complete X PvE scenario" and other similar quests.\n\nMy biggest concern stepping into a free shooter is whether I have to pay money or grind for hours to stand a chance against established, and this isn't the case.

The game is full of video game references. For example a costume of Leona and Ralf from the King of Fighters (NeoGeo). A little Contra (NES), and Call of Duty Zombies. There's probably more, and it makes the game a bit more interesting and fun to play...until the repitition gets boring\n\nRight off the bat you'll notice the graphics looks a bit dated. Textures aren't photo realistic, and the models are low poly by modern gaming standards. But if that spoils a game for you, you might as well jump ship now.\n\nControls could probably use some tweaking..and you cant crouch even though theres a button setting for it. Running, rolling, and taking cover is all one button, and while this makes it easy to play, it also makes it frusturating when youre trying to take cover, and instead your character rolls. There seems to be no way to jump either...which would make the game a bit more fun if you can get onto different platforms....or jump over obstacles etc.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the guns are all pretty much the same, in terms of damage output, and tweaks. If anything, there are slight differences, but not much to favor one gun over the other based on performance. Best thing to do is to get something that you think looks cool. And speaking of cool, it seems that thats what they are going for when it comes to the guns. Blue camo paint? Yellow? wtf? Where's my Caution Tape camo then? These are the guns that are supposed perform best!\n\nThere's also weapon pickups, if you run out of ammo, and there arent any crates or anything...Cool! But then when you realise you cant even buy most of them, its not so cool.  And then there's the heavy weapons that you can only pickup on the battlefield, which is a real treat if you want a BFG with a ton of bullets. These guns can overheat and stop firing, which balances things out...but why cant LMG's overheat then? As it is, the only weapon you REALLY want to get the most kills is an LMG.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, I still play the game. It's a nice refreshment if you're bored of Battlefield or COD....Or if you're a retro gamer looking for a game full of cameo♥♥♥♥♥♥ences.","October 3, 2014","true","163.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can play a round of Demolition on a map similar to de_dust from Counter-Strike one round and then switch to a spinoff of Call of Duty's Nazi Zombies survival mode. ZMR operates like Gears of War mechanically but offers a plethora of game modes in both PvP and PvE that mix things up enough to keep interest.\n\nThere is a weapon rental system similar to a lot of Korean Shooter MMOs, but permanent versions of guns are readily available and obtainable without spending money (granted some take a lot more grinding than others)\n\nRewards from PvE are received through a system similar to Payday 2 while PvP rewards are a chest system like CS:GO has. Doing both will earn in game currency and chances at gear through completing quests, which could include objects like "Kill 5 enemies with a shotgun" or "Complete X PvE scenario" and other similar quests.\n\nMy biggest concern stepping into a free shooter is whether I have to pay money or grind for hours to stand a chance against established, and this isn't the case. Starting guns and guns earned through quests are extremely capable and I've never been killed because someone else had a bigger gun than me.\n\n\nOverall, this game is a competent, above average shooter that is definitely worth a try (it's free, right?) so long as you don't hate Gears of War's mechanics","October 3, 2014","true","26.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Combine it with competitive PvP/PvE action, largely detailed maps and objectives, with a lot to choose from, and you have a short synopse of ZMR.\n\nI've grown bored when it comes to shooters these days. They just don't appeal to me as much as they used to. ZMR, however, has added a bit more to the table. Much like other shooters though, there's a currency system that can be used to purchase mods for weapons, outfits that you can accessorize your character with to make him/her stand out from the rest, and a few other minor things that slowly add up that make ZMR that much better.\n\nNow I will admit, just like any other shooter, it can get a bit repetative. So make sure to switch things up a bit and try out different maps and modes.\n\nI say, that if  you're unsure about wanting to invest the time to see if it's a good game, just try it out for maybe 30 minutes to an hour and see how you like it. I mean after all, it is free to play. What do you have to lose?\n","September 30, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a PC Gears multiplayer clone, with a faster pace. Which isnt a bad thing. As seen during the lag issue accompanying the steam launch, the developers are quite transparent and have so far been rather active on the forums, which is always a plus.\nIt does fall prey to the usual foul-ups that f2p games have, where there is an absurd grind for free players to purchase permanent weapons. This is allieviated by a free one every 10 character levels, and the lottery system, which rolls the dice and can give you a perm weapon, although that is somewhat rare.\nThe 'Revive-Token' system would be fine if it didn't kick you in coop matches 105 seconds after death if you don't use your limited amount of revive tokens. As it is, I would wait until it's got like 5 seconds until kick, and then use one.","September 26, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TauntTheOstrich/recommended/306830/","TauntTheOstrich","[N]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TauntTheOstrich/","542 products in account","I'll be honest at first the reviews had me concerned about even downloading ZMR, but I'm glad I went for it anyway because I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. Granted I did have very low expectations going in, the last game I played like this was God Mode and anyone who bought that knows how it turned out.\n\nI don't see how people say its P2W, regular guns can be either rented or permanently unlocked with either EMP or Gold you earn in game. Special items like ZK and Assault guns do have added benefits like larger magazine sizes, which you could get mods for you regular guns anyhow, but any significant damage buffs with those weapons are restricted to certain PVE modes.\n\nA decent selection of the clothing can also be unlocked with Gold, the better looking stuff will cost you money through EMP though these are "Outfits" so they're complete sets that it doesnt seem you can mix and match. However that does bring me to an issue I have with the game.\n\nThe way EMP is priced in comparison to the Store. The minimum purchase you can make for EMP is $10 USD, there is no $5 option, this usually wouldn't be a problem except for the way some items are priced. Take one of those Premium skins for example, they cost 1195 EMP, so if you wanted a Premium skin you'll be expected to pay out $20 with points left over. I absolutely hate when games do this, if you can't make it a flat price for a skin at least add a $5 option in the game so players won't be left with a large amount of point's left over especially if there's nothing they want but one skin.\n\nThe game uses Revive Tokens in PVE which originally I didn't like the idea of but the more I played, the more I became use to it and at the rate they're given out in this game you honestly won't have to worry about having to pay out for them.\n\nI'll admit I haven't played much of the PVP but there are quite a few modes, the three I played are two standard modes, Team Deathmatch and a Sabatage (plant the bomb) mode. The third mode I played is called Mercs vs Monsters, where you are put on two teams One playing a group of mercenaries and the other a group of Monsters/Zombies. you start off with basic characters which cost 0 points to spawn as, as the game goes on and you get kills you earn points which yo ucan use to spawn as more powerful characters with different abilities. You play one round as the Mercs and one round as the Zombies, whichever has the highest at the end of the game or reaches the score cap wins.\n\nThe maps could be better designed but for a game that involves running around and shooting everything, it does the job. My hope is that in the future they go a bit more out there with level designs, things that pay tribute to arcade games like House of the Dead or Metal Slug which is a lot of what this game reminds me of, an arcade game.\n\nOver all I don't understand the hate the game has gotten and calling it P2W in my opinion is silly, the game isnt perfect but it isnt the worst thing ever either, and it definitely isn't as bad as God Mode was. Perhaps the problem is that is trying to grab the attention of too many types of people with the zombies, dinosaurs, ect but at the end of the day its fun and that's what's important in a game to me.\n\nEDIT: After a night of sleep I remembered one thing I wanted to touch on that I would like to see the devs fix. When you create a lobby but want to switch modes, you have to leave the last lobby you made and make a new one. While this isnt game breaking and doesn't take long, it sure is annoying, hopefully they manage to fix it.","September 29, 2014","true","128.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Your initially presented with a set of permanent newbie stuff that never goes away, but before you can really use it much you do the tutorial and subsiquent tasks netting early temporary gear.\n\nZMR uses a combination of gambling (through 'bullet' tokens you earn playing or buy), Gear Rental and Limited revive tokens to allow you to play but also encourage you to spend money in some fashion. You get three freebie revives every match you play and then earn silver premium revives you can burn after that (iv played a day and a half and have like forty of those as they are the primary reward from gambling with bullet tokens)\n\nYou also can pick up weapons from enemies or spend score points you earn ina  match to pick up specially spawned weapons (depending on the map type) in a very CoD zombie fashion which means you dont really NEED a special weapon to just pick something up and start wooping ♥♥♥ (TommyGun how I love thee). The graphics are nothing special, not ugly but nothing 'next gen', this also means it runs fairly well on low end machines, perfect for you poor slobs in college that cant afford real video games eh? Most of the enemies, bosses and maps are very entertaining, though dinosaurs get annoying fast.\n\nGameplay wise its something like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Gears of War horde mode, Mass Effect 3 multiplayer and call of duty zombie ops with the comic humor from Loadout, all in all I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys any of those.\n\nEDIT: Few days later still enjoying the game and remarkably, enjoying some of the pvp as well: the monster vs mercs is a riot (especially the exploding dog). The gambling system is still, well gambling and I hate gambling: so far with only the silver/gold bullets iv only turned up INSANE amounts of revive tokens(100+) and a handful of rental mods.  Also looks like they use a Loot Case somewhat like Star Trek's boxes that you need to buy keys from the cash shop to open, so gambling with real money...not a big fan of that idea got burned by star trek that way. They do feed you a steady supply of rental weapons and as you level, perma ones  (AR at lvl1, SMG at lvl10, shotgun at lvl20, ect) but the fancy paint job weapons have extra damage in certain map types while the permanent lvl guys dont have this boost.","September 24, 2014","true","64.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ugh.\n\nThis game is beautiful, the graphics are crisp and beautiful, the character design intriguing.

The AI is so laughably braindead and non-threatening that boss battles usually consist of the entire team emptying round after round into boss in a straight line till it drops. The exciting premise of fighting hordes of zombies, monsters and/or robots is completely lost when in a single mission you run the same small map back and forth to either way for an objective, or do a pickup and drop mission whie mobs run straight at you.

So many "LOLOLOLOLOL RENT GUNZ THUMBZ DOWN" comments lead me to believe these people didn't bother to actually look deeper into the system.\n\nYes, many of the guns can be rented with in game currency, and real money, but there are also a LOT that can be purchased permentaly. After my first 3 hours I was already 1/5 of the way to my favorite gun-permenantly unlocked. This also doesn't take into account the higher cash earnings on higher difficulties. 15 hours on the easiest difficulty for a good weapon does not seem bad to me for a F2P title.\n\nThere are also a plethora of other ways to buy permenant weapons. Rep from completing objectives and achievements, and bullets to use in the games RNG item game - a la Mass Effect 3. The best guns aren't even purchased with real money, instead, they're awarded from the highest tier of the RNG item drops. You want the best guns? Play the hardest difficulties with a good team and start earning the chance to get them.\n\nTo those complaining about the "Revive Tokens" - Early difficulties give you 3 free tokens per mission, and only after those 3 are used do you start comsuming those in your stash. Within a couple hours I was awarded a box of 50 tokens, and more than 1 per sucessful mission. Until the highest difficulties, I cannot see how anyone could possibly go empty, the game practically throws them at you. All this, and team mates can even use their own tokens to revive other players. Only the most terrible players would have an issue with this. Play as a team; lone wolves at low levels will get overwhelmed easily. Intelligent players will not have a problem.\n\nGameplay itself is good. Crisp gunplay and the solid mechanics from Gears of War lend itself well. The game is a direct rip from Gears, which is well known beacuse the developers helped make that game. It's not going to win any awards for individuality, but its been tried and works well. Why change a good thing?\n\nThe missions are well varied with tons of different enemies. Everything from a Nazi Zombies mode, to classic Gears horde. The game even has a version of tower defence with deployable turrets and traps. Story type missions with up to 8 players give new obstacles in almost every encounter, and the hazards in each mission change with difficulty. To unlock the next difficulty, you must beat the mission on the difficulty below.

Effort was put into it by the developers, and it shows.\n\nThere is a PVP aspect to the game, but I honestly don't know why anyone would bother. Just like the Gears of War franchise, I never cared for it because I never felt the gameplay mechanics let itself to that. All the work here has been put into the PVE game modes, and its obvisous. To complain about the PVP and downvote the game on what is essentially a tacked on mode seems silly to me. I downloaded "Zombies Monsters Robots" to shoot zombies monsters and robots, not other players.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a great third person shooter thats easy on the wallet (read-free) and offers a ton of variety and a co-op experiance that builds on the foundation of Gears of War and improves it.

First off, let me say that these people are entirely misguided. It is, unlike what they say, actually quite good. Sure... there's a large amount of "Pay 2Play" stuff, but the game itself is entirely free, and is also fun. I got this in the day where every shooter was starting to become a rip-off of Call of Duty, Halo, or Grand Theft Auto, but it, instead, has a lot of fun involved...\n\nWhich brings me to the downsides. As I mentioned, even your starter gear is on a timer. Fortunately, you still have a lot of good stuff, so that makes it entirely irrelevant. Next off, you NEVER NEED TO BUY THE WEAPONS. The naysayers  act like you need to BUY everything in the game, but you can get weapons on the battlefield to use. Sure, it's just for until you die, but that doesn't make it BAD. But there IS quite a bit of real money involved, and NOTHING is buyable with your standard in-game money.\n\nAlso, mild lag, and kind of un-original gameplay. Otherwise, it's fantastic. The people will say I'm a n00b who never actually PLAYED the game, but I very much did.\n\n\n9/10. Awesome. Maybe people should try the game for a while and not just look at their gear and say "It's on a timer, so the game's bad."\n","February 22, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is not a Pay2Win title. The game offers so many ways to earn new gear, mods, items and guns with out spending a dime! The player base is relatively good but still with some big lag issues if you happen to get into a room with "around the world" players. ZMR, uses a cover system much like the GEARS OF WAR series-this is why i feel there should be full controler suport, sadly there is nothing yet. The game can feel repetative at times, jump  in a room and "kill everything" or join one of the many assault ops missions...and "kill everything". The Story Mode does not offer any sort of campaign aspect, but rather just another way to earn diferent items. There is a few PVP options that are not as active as they use to be. This is where some players can seem very O.P   I have heard of many Hacking issues among players but not so much lately. You are giving the abilitly to start a CORP of you`r own for in-game Gold or request to join another players group-this is good as some folk offer to help new players reach higher levels and obtain better load outs.   I have a lot of time spent on this game and i can tell you that it is worth it.","December 15, 2014","true","629.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

So many "LOLOLOLOLOL RENT GUNZ THUMBZ DOWN" comments lead me to believe these people didn't bother to actually look deeper into the system.\n\nYes, many of the guns can be rented with in game currency, and real money, but there are also a LOT that can be purchased permentaly. After my first 3 hours I was already 1/5 of the way to my favorite gun-permenantly unlocked. This also doesn't take into account the higher cash earnings on higher difficulties. 15 hours on the easiest difficulty for a good weapon does not seem bad to me for a F2P title.\n\nThere are also a plethora of other ways to buy permenant weapons. Rep from completing objectives and achievements, and bullets to use in the games RNG item game - a la Mass Effect 3. The best guns aren't even purchased with real money, instead, they're awarded from the highest tier of the RNG item drops. You want the best guns? Play the hardest difficulties with a good team and start earning the chance to get them.\n\nTo those complaining about the "Revive Tokens" - Early difficulties give you 3 free tokens per mission, and only after those 3 are used do you start comsuming those in your stash. Within a couple hours I was awarded a box of 50 tokens, and more than 1 per sucessful mission. Until the highest difficulties, I cannot see how anyone could possibly go empty, the game practically throws them at you. All this, and team mates can even use their own tokens to revive other players. Only the most terrible players would have an issue with this. Play as a team; lone wolves at low levels will get overwhelmed easily. Intelligent players will not have a problem.\n\nGameplay itself is good. Crisp gunplay and the solid mechanics from Gears of War lend itself well. The game is a direct rip from Gears, which is well known beacuse the developers helped make that game. It's not going to win any awards for individuality, but its been tried and works well. Why change a good thing?\n\nThe missions are well varied with tons of different enemies. Everything from a Nazi Zombies mode, to classic Gears horde. The game even has a version of tower defence with deployable turrets and traps. Story type missions with up to 8 players give new obstacles in almost every encounter, and the hazards in each mission change with difficulty. To unlock the next difficulty, you must beat the mission on the difficulty below. The next time you play, it's a litle bit different, from enemy placement, to environmental hazards, to boss strategies. Effort was put into it by the developers, and it shows.\n\nThere is a PVP aspect to the game, but I honestly don't know why anyone would bother. Just like the Gears of War franchise, I never cared for it because I never felt the gameplay mechanics let itself to that. All the work here has been put into the PVE game modes, and its obvisous. To complain about the PVP and downvote the game on what is essentially a tacked on mode seems silly to me. I downloaded "Zombies Monsters Robots" to shoot zombies monsters and robots, not other players.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a great third person shooter thats easy on the wallet (read-free) and offers a ton of variety and a co-op experiance that builds on the foundation of Gears of War and improves it. Wether you're into classic WW2 weapons, modern day guns or futuristic death rays, this game has all of it covered.\n\nI think I've found my new favorite F2P game.\n\n8/10","January 18, 2015","true","50.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I got this in the day where every shooter was starting to become a rip-off of Call of Duty, Halo, or Grand Theft Auto, but it, instead, has a lot of fun involved...\n\nWhich brings me to the downsides. As I mentioned, even your starter gear is on a timer. Fortunately, you still have a lot of good stuff, so that makes it entirely irrelevant. Next off, you NEVER NEED TO BUY THE WEAPONS. The naysayers  act like you need to BUY everything in the game, but you can get weapons on the battlefield to use. Sure, it's just for until you die, but that doesn't make it BAD. But there IS quite a bit of real money involved, and NOTHING is buyable with your standard in-game money.\n\nAlso, mild lag, and kind of un-original gameplay. Otherwise, it's fantastic. The people will say I'm a n00b who never actually PLAYED the game, but I very much did.\n\n\n9/10. Awesome. Maybe people should try the game for a while and not just look at their gear and say "It's on a timer, so the game's bad."\n","February 22, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is basically Gears of War Horde mode with zombies, monsters and robots with huge maps.\n\nPros:\n- 5 player co-op\n- varietry of enemy bots to shoot - small (dogs, small insects), medium (normal zombies), big (Left4Dead boomer type zombies), and huge bosses. Also each map has their own unique models for bots..\n- revive yourself after you die - If you get killed, you can use a token to revive and get back in the game. How many tokens you can use depends on the gamemode. Usualy it's 3 tokens.\n- refill ammo with crates - Each map has ammo crates that you can open with points you get from shooting bots, and they re-appear at the same spot after a short time so you can refill your ammo again.\n- head shots kill enemies quicker - makes gameplay better IMO\n- Nice selection of firearms - pistols, SMG, LMG, snipers. Some require a lot of points grinding and some you can only buy with IRL money. You don't need to use IRL money to get a good weapon though. get a LMG with points and your good to go.\n- don't need to use IRL money to buy good weapons to enjoy the game. The weapons you can unlock with points are great.\n- decent ammount of clothing selection - nice selection of tactical gear and clothing\n\nCons:\n- lots of grinding to get a weapon - SMG,LMG and snipers range from 250,000 to 375,000 points. This will be about 3 to 4 days of playing non-stop to buy these weapons. This game is F2P so it's expected.\n- some weapons can only be bought with IRL money\n- Some weapons can only be rented for a limited time, then have to re-new again - just ignore these weapons ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nTips:\n- Use an assault rifle and LMG (M249) in your loadout. Having a LMG is important if you don't plan on dropping any money on this game at first. Don't waste points on anything else and get an LMG (M249) first or else you'll have trouble surviving waves, even on easy difficulty.\n- aim for the head to kill enemies quicker\n- in small-medium maps, use long hall ways to kill bots","February 25, 2015","true","40.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is in between pay 2 win and grind 2 win. You can win every item in the store by playing the missions. A lot of games like this don't offer that. It is fair in a lot of ways. The only problem I really find annoying is when you run out of revives during a game. I started up a boss rush and got to the very last boss.. I ran out of revive tokens and I couldn't join the game. Eventually I got kicked. So all that hard work was for nothing... I think the free revive tokens you get should be increased per difficulty. At least increased to 5 on expert mode. Another tedious thing is when you constantly have to see the same cut scenes everytime you play a map on PvE. Maybe it would be wise to limit the cut scenes to only boss entrances and major details. Instead add quest markers. Add quest markers for when you have to activate a switch or something beause it gets really annoying... Thats one of the MAJOR things that turn me off from playing. I would play a lot more than I already do if it wasn't for all the cut scenes.. Just the thought of grinding another map with the thought in the back of my mind "I really want to grind this map again but I really dont want to deal with all the cut scenes".. Like really. Its super annoying. This game is good! The boss fights are awesome and tough! but those damn cut scenes kill it hard.","March 18","true","157.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

It plays alright, the shooting is responsive, but movement is a little sloppy. Graphics are fine, and enemy variety is actually pretty good.\n\nThe progression system actually feels rather quick for a free to play game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uniscious/recommended/306830/","Uniscious","Uniscious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uniscious/","46 products in account","My official review at ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes\n(~25 hours clocked on non-steam client)\n\n--\nTwo years ago, En Masse pitched its first game, TERA, to the public promoting a "revolutionary" MMORPG combat system that has not been seen prior. Through personal experience I would have to agree that it lived up to its claims and is now free to play with a stable community. With this in mind, I happily gave ZMR a go. Besides, who isn't a fan of zombies monsters and, or robots, anyway?\n\nTo create an abundantly unique persona, carefully select one of seven faces, your skin color, a painfully common hairstyle, and one of five virtually similar voices. After which, you may proceed to enter the game and, against your will, accept a five to ten minute tutorial explaining the basics of weapon swapping, movement mechanics, target practice and… You guessed it, ZOMBIES! All narrated by your typical cocky military sergeant who respectfully prefers to be identified as, “The Boss”.\n\nIn ZMR, you are a soldier for a corporation primarily involved with running missions and making monies. If you don’t read much on their website, you may not realize that you are actually battling dimensional forces that all seem to want Earth for some unexplained reason. Beyond this, there is no plot whatsoever, most likely to save you the headache of another redundant apocalypse theory. It’s best to keep in mind that this game is very arcade.\n\nBeing the seasoned PvP gamer that I am, I immediately jumped into PvP where I got to rock it out with a few other lowbies. I loved juking around corners and the ability to shoot my gun from cover without actually aiming down sights. This is not common in games that utilize these types of movement mechanics and allows you the element of suppressive fire as your team mates attempt to flank and gank. I also enjoyed the reload feature which allows you to speed up (or fail to) reload times. But be careful of weapon jamming!\n\nThere is no matchmaker in ZMR. Instead, players host lobbies and lobby control is passed in succession as players come and go. Most often, a game lobby will last about three to five games. This can get a little irritating, but at the same time you may find yourself switching between game modes quite often as the gameplay in each gets to be a little redundant. One positive (and sometimes negative), however, is that you can invite entire lobbies to your game. So be ready for the mass invitation spam.\n\nFree for all / Deathmatch / Team Death match / Elimination\nThe primary objective of each of these modes is to eliminate the opposing team. In deathmatch, team deathmatch, and free for all, there is a respawn function with a time limit and or a number of kills to reach before the game ends. In elimination, there is a set of rounds and one life per round. Friendly fire and weapon restrictions are optional to the host, and you may also choose to have set teams or balanced teams.\n\nDemolition / King of the hill\nDemolition features your typical plant/defuse scenario where one team plants a bomb and the other attempts to defuse it within the time limit. King of the hill, of course, is point control. Don’t expect to find many of these games on the list.\n\nDepending on your experience in shooters, you may realize that Call of Duty made a baby with Gears of War. In the majority of the modes, the movement mechanics and camera functions of ZMR are nearly a carbon copy of GoW while in PvP modes, you remain as fragile as glass. All in all, the arsenal of modern day weapons to select from is pretty well balanced considering the practice needed to master each of them. Plus, you will find yourself adopting numerous tactics to stay alive. If you happen to be up against an experienced player during your first few hours, prepare for the rage.\n\nMercs vs. Monsters (MvM)\nIf you're playing PvP but still want to get your zombie on, there is a game mode called Mercs vs. Monsters but let’s be honest, it should be called Undead Vs. Cyborgs. In this mode, there is a point system in place that rewards you for kills which you may then spend to spawn stronger monsters, or mercs after you die. This mode is very popular among the unfortunately miniscule PvP community and stands out as a signature characteristic of the game.\n\nZMR features a set of PvE lobbies, separate from PvP, that offer up a plethora of game modes each with four levels of difficulty ranging from normal to nightmare and rewards appropriate to their corresponding difficulty. First off, it’s best to categorize the six original game modes as three that pertain to zombie invaders, and three to the alien “dominion” forces. Finally, a recently added mode called “Threshold Defense” has to do with both and functions as a point defense against zombies and dominion forces invading simultaneously.\n\nAssault & Massive assault / Kill everything & Kill everything 2\nWhile the website may try to make each of these modes look different on their website, they are, in reality, all the same. But in different sizes! In these modes, you fight against multiple waves of either a small or large dominion or zombie force depending on the game mode you have selected. If you are a fan of survival, this is definitely the game for you. In assault/kill everything and massive assault/kill everything 2, you’re objective is to make it to the final round. You don’t have to eliminate all of the waves, although you get a better score and therefore a better payout.\n\nAssault Ops / Paranormal Ops\nInstead of preventing impending establishment by dominion/zombie forces, you are now doing the opposite and removing establishments of said forces. In this mode, you will move through a series of areas in a sort of “campaign” fashion from start to finish. Switches, weapons, ammo and point currency are all inclusive. However, in this mode, you will find one or more mini-bosses followed by a final boss. “Land of the Dead” (Illustrated above) features Anubis, Horus, and the “Shadow Queen” (Hatshepsut...?).\n\nThreshold Defense\nThis recently added mode is a point defense where you battle waves of both dominion forces and zombie invaders. I’m not sure if this means that their dimensional rifts got mixed up? This mode can be rather challenging at higher difficulties and most do not attempt it without an organized group and specific load outs. As far as design structure, this mode was confusing to me because it is the only one with flying enemies which you generally aren’t even aware of until you’re getting attacked by them. Furthermore, a lot of the spawns will simply ignore you and charge toward the threshold as though you aren’t even there. This is a very botchy gameplay mode to say the least, and very well may change in the future.\n\nBy this point, you’re probably thinking, “Hey, it can’t be too bad, right? Let’s give it a try”. Well, before you do that, finish reading this last bit. ZMR uses three kinds of currency, EMP, gold, and rep. Rep and gold are achieved through just about anything, and EMP is achieved through the cash shop. Most weapons that you will expect to buy, such as desert eagles, AWPs, and combat shotguns, are timed purchases only until very high levels. Weapon mods cannot be purchase permanently. And there are only a handful of outfits you can purchase without EMP.\n\nFurthermore, there are very few players during the week and at night with a high load of about 50 during the weekend. With 5 PvP lobbies, and 6 PvE lobbies, only one of each is ever active. There is no community, considering people don’t talk in-game. If you so happen to be unlucky enough to get matched up against the “Hentai” or “Demon” corporations, you will wonder If the game was popular or actually active at one point.\n...\n...","September 27, 2014","false","0.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

That’s what I said as well, but I hate myself, so I downloaded the game anyways. There are a lot of points about this game I could criticize, but I like to be brief when possible:\n\n-The cash shop isn't pay to win, but it is incredibly expensive. You'll need to either grind a tremendous amount to unlock any gear permanently, or pay wads of cash.\n-The whole game feels really cheap and flimsy. Right away, as the character creator kicked on, I could tell the game was running on Unreal Engine 3. UE3 is capable of making some fantastic looking games (like Borderlands), but the "default" style of textures that Epic uses for the engine have this weird greasiness to them. ZMR sticks to the default Epic style of texturing. The end product ends up looking a bit like an Unreal Tournament 3 mod as a result, even down to some remarkably similar fonts and reused textures.\n-Really bad humor that's written to appeal to the lowest common denominator on the internet.\n-A variety of game types, but nothing that feels new or interesting.\n-Combat feels like a basic Gears of War knockoff, down to the active reload system that uses a suspiciously similar reloading bar...\n\nOut of morbid curiosity, I did a bit of research and found out that the original developer for ZMR was Chinese. This didn't surprise me, given the asian-esque cash shop. What's more interesting is who the developer is: Yingpei Games, the developer formerly known as Epic Games China. So to make this clear: ZMR is Gears of War turned into a F2P game by a branch of GoW's original developer.\n\nIf you have a raging hard on for GoW style combat on PC, you can probably look past all the faults I’ve mentioned. If you’re just looking for a good, non-restrictive F2P shooting game, I would recommend Quake Live and/or Team Fortress 2 over this. The latter even has a PvE mode, albeit with robots instead of zombies.\n\nCorrection: Yingpei Games is no longer a part of Epic Games.","October 12, 2014","false","2.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

But thats where the problems start. You can do a few quest like the Daily quest and get some cool gear, But the gear; weapons, clothes or booster will only last 2-30 days 30 days being the MOST, but a 2 day expiring item is the MOST COMMON. Oh it get worse, on the Minesweeper map in co-op my teammates and me had the faced great foe like none other...a minecart. NO REALLY!! we had to duck and dodge a minecart while get hit by an range zombie that when u took damage your HUD got blurry and usually the minecart got you. Also ZMR trieds to be original but uses the Gears of War formula, which isn't useful against zombie...Futher more if u get knock down you have to spam the SPACE bar to slow down the bleeding you can move but that causes you to bleed out more! But on the upside ZMR was serious about the enemy fractions, but i don't understand why the dinosaur have the same behavior to the zombies yet the dinos have turrets and machine guns on their bodys? Oh and it gets down right ugly to get a permanent weapon u need to be a millionare (not a joke) i have no problem grinder but 100,000 gold just for a sidearm?! and it the cheap version that only last a few day?!?

First, it opens up in a stupid windowed mode that isn't fullscreen. Second, it starts off with ridiculously loud music (so loud it completely drowns out the voices you're trying to select from at the character creator) and you can't access any settings until you've created your character and loaded into the tutorial. Extremely annoying, but ok, I can deal with that. Next, apparently humans can't jump. (A big WTF, but still, not a total deal-breaker.) But the thing that completely killed it for me was the keybinds for shooting and weapon scope. LMB = shoot, pretty standard. RMB = hold to aim, also pretty standard. Mouse wheel = activate scope and adjust zoom, which you can only do while holding down the aim button. So to use a scope you need 3 fingers where there's only room for two on virtually every mouse ever made. And the best part? You can't change these keybinds. Deleting this garbage was an easy choice.","October 12, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The pretty much move towards you and shoot. All the excitement and stress comes from you trying to avoid getting overwhelmed. But if you stay calm and play well there is no sense of urgency or strategy.\n\nIt pains me when gamers enjoy games like there which are dumb unimaginative everyone runs in a straight line at you. Too be fair this formula can be well done. Take the same premise and for some reason Killing Floor succeeds with flying colors.\n\nPerhaps it's just the gunplay that feels dull and the encounters. The reloading feel like an annoying mini game which I could do without. I admit it was a cool idea in gears of war, but I preferred it in Halo 1. If you hit the melee button just at the right moment when reloading your pistol if would reload slightly faster due to the different animation change, but at least it wouldn't Jam your whole gun and slow down the whole gun play just because you weren't paying enough attention to the little line on the screen syncing up instead of paying attention to the battlefield.\n\nI always refer to FEAR 1's AI, just play that game and compare the AI of this game.\n\nYes the game looks good, it's sexy the controls are tight, the sound is decent.

While it's true that most weapons and cosmetics cost real world money, they can also be earned with in game gold. Prices for renting seem to be fair and cheap, and you can permanently purchase 90% of items in games with in game money alone. The few that are restricted to premimum cash are all cosmetic, with the only stat boosting items being gloves and boots, which merely increase XP and gold by 3-5%. Not a large difference over all.\n\nThe combat is your standard third person shooter fair, but it seems to be trying to make it fun at least. With a "Sticky," cover system akin to Gears of War, an active reload that is an exact copy of GoW's, and well designed weapons, it at least plays well. Most weapons are moddable, with things such as steel barrels for longer range, or bayonets for vastly increased melee damage. So far, all the mod slots have only had one option, meaning you don't have to pick and choose to make the perfect build. This can be annoying to some people, but I personally prefer upgrading a weapon to be a straight linear path.\n\nAs for the weapons themselves, they are mostly well designed and based around skill. Though there are some weapons that seem over powered (Damn you, Uzi blind fire) for the most part they all work in their respective niches. Further more, they are very skill based. If you have a steady hand and are patient enough, it's entirely possible to snipe across maps with the starter sidearm, though very difficult. Weapons can be reloaded while sprinting and rolling, preventing you from being locked into long animations with no way to counter.\n\nThe cover system has a few flaws. Most notably, if you vault a cover piece and continue to hold sprint, you will merely jog forward, which is sometimes the difference between life and death. Sometimes you will get stuck on wall polyogons, or ping wildly across the the wall, sometimes even through it... Which brings me to my main complaint. Any amount of ping above 50 will massively affect your gameplay. I regularly am forced to play with ping in the upper 200s, and it's damn near unplayable at times. Every person who kills me does so with flawless headshots through walls, while I can only score kills on ambushes or direct instant kill headshots.\n\nDespite all the issues just mentioned however, the game at it's core remains fun. I've had a blast, sprinting with six others through an Egyptian pyramid while fleeing from mummies and dogs with bombs strapped to them, desperately mashing R to reload in time to unload on the horde just around the next corner. Sitting in the top of a tower with two friends, holding a choke point in the middle of a PVP match so our team can regroup and push forward up the middle of the train. Sprinting down a shortcut and ambushing the highest scoring enemy player just before he can execute my sniper buddy, then reviving him and laying a claymore trap that takes out three enemies at once. Desperately dancing through a horde of giants with battle axes, fleeing from Anubis himself while my teammates dump hundreds of pounds of lead into him, then turning and finishing him off with a last ditch headshot.\n\nI started this game on a whim, half wondering just how bad it would be. And in truth, there's quite a bit of bad to be had here. But the sheer fun the game over shadows that. I've had more campy, cheesy, silly fun with this game than I've had in months. And the fact it's free just makes it better.","October 13, 2014","true","33.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But everyone has already talked about the Pay To Suck Dev C**k aspect of this game.\n\nPro's: Nice little Desktop icon on your Desktop.\n\nCon's: Ohh Lordy where do I begin, well, first off the game Tutorial is for if you have never played a Game in your life and treats you kind of like a five year old with Daddy's gun. The control's feel slow as well, making your evasion of gunfire hard and then pointless when all the Grenade Launcher carrying S.O.B.'S come out in the Co-op aspect. Zombies felt like a good idea til you realized it was a super Cheap version of that one made by COD's Dev's.\nI didn't try Jurassic, I got kicked from the first Zombie attempt and The Second seemed even more worthless attempt as it was all a bunch of LMG's cause every other gun is damn near useless.\n\nPVP is most likely something that you want to avoid, I didn't try it as PVP in these Game's tends to come down to who Paid more of their hard earned cash to get Shiny Sword Mk.69, that or Aim bots and Super Speed hack with Infinite Explosives to kill you without trying.\n\nOH! I almost forgot the most Horrendous Idea that I have ever seen in a Co-op mode, if you die, rather than have a respawn timer and some points taken away, you get Auto-kicked in 120 Seconds if you do not have a token, which you can get from Silver bullets at the shooting range or Pay with Even MORE of your money! Co-op is more just Co-Flop, cause unless your like everyone else and have some Payed for weapon, your not going to be doing much more than being The Camera man, aka your watching but not doing.\n\nAltogether, I suggest taking your Time, Money and Possibly Lovely as The Night Sky filled with Stars PC and Go to some other Online Third Person Shooter, or maybe just go play an MMO, or FPS, or something Two to Ten times better than this Turd.","September 24, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its a third-person shooter in which players fight Zombies, Monsters, or Robots.  ZMR, get it?  Simular to Gears of War, with the ability to cling to cover, blind fire, and finishing moves for downed opponets, ZMR has different sized maps for PVE or PVP play.  As players defeat oponents and maps they are rated on how well they did and are rewarded with experience and items that level up their characters.\n\nHaving only played PVE, I find the CO-OP fun, but I feel the game gets unfair at times.   Some maps have  tough areas were players will die repeatedly because they didnt line up perfectly behind cover.  Heaven help you if there is only one item to use as cover in a room.  Now you have to watch as your allies get downed and you cant help them without dying yourself.  You can spend your respawn tokens to return only to die again and again.  Respawn tokens are plentiful but its a pain to go thru this over and over.  Also, some boss fights can be very cheap with instant kills abilities.  Sure you may see the attack comming but there may only be one safe spot on the map and your character is just too slow to get there. Or there is only that one cover item in the room.  This all matters because you are rated on how well you did on a map and that affects the experience you get.\n\nThe worst part of ZMR is the rent-a-item system.  Few of the best weapons, clothing items, and weapon mods are permanent.  After a purchase with gold earned in game the items will expire after a number of days.   I understand why developers would create such a system but this only turns players into junkies.  Here take this weapon, when it expires, come back to me for another hit. Maybe I am being a little dramatic but in other Free-to-Play games,  weapons and items dont have to be rented. They can be earned or bought and I have done both. Real cash can be used in ZMR but I have yet to spend any.\n\nI like ZMR but the unfairness in the battles on some maps and the rent-a-item system are a big turn off.  I like a challenge but get frustrated with dying multiple times over bad gameplay designs or looking at all the cool stuff that will expire after I obtained it.   However, I really like what  this game offers and will try to stick with it.  I just hope the game developers can fix some of the issues before my patience wears off.\n\nI give ZMR a hesitant Like, Thumbs UP,...you get the idea","September 23, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Second, character customization... if can even call it that, you know how there are presets for what you want to look like in games? Well that is all there is in this game as well as male being very buff the females are over sexualized... because sexism for the win question mark? When I looked around the main menu I noticed the only way to get an item and keep it was through real money, sigh, do I even have to say what is wrong with that? I also noticed that any weapon not bought from the real money store was also very bad in comparison. Oh! while I am talking about weapons lets get the maps, first most of them are very badly made such as Garry' Mod Deathrun types of traps even in the tips it says you will have to give someone up to move on... like... who does that?! The only thing I had found good about the game was the cover system and the reaload system.\nI would not consider reccomending this for anyone if you are reading this I would consider some other shooter PvP or PvE game instead like Team Fortress 2 or even Defiance would be better than this. Though if you really want to play it, go right ahead if you look past the very bad features it is an OK game, something that you would play when you have nothing better to do, and as a finally closer I will be playing this now and then though not as often because the game has a good concept... not so good of an execution.","October 1, 2014","false","9.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's basically a GunZ 2 sequel/ripoff...\n\nIt's the same graphics, the same basic enemy and player types. Of course there are absolutely NO usefull explanations as to how the more complex game features work, and no explanations as to where you can use each player type (specifficaly Mechs). I played 3.5 hours and by the end I still had no idea where I could play as a Mech. And not a single person replied to my questions in the chat.\n\nThe missions are boring. And almost impossible on your own. The voice "acting" is ridiculous. There is no depth to any of the characters (just boobs, and those can only keep you interested so long...). It's basically just another... I'm so bored after playing this game I don't have no power to think of an ending to that sentence...\nAnd the game itself is pretty unstable. It crashed twice on the first launch, and I think it even crashed my LAN card at one point. I'm not even sure how that's possible (first time it EVER happened to me).\n\nNot to mention the whole Pay 2 Win system... So in PvP you go against these "gamers" that have some insane gear and they just F**K you up the a*s (pardon my French) the entire match.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have a couple of hours to kill then sure, why not.

But everyone has already talked about the Pay To Suck Dev C**k aspect of this game.\n\nPro's: Nice little Desktop icon on your Desktop.\n\nCon's: Ohh Lordy where do I begin, well, first off the game Tutorial is for if you have never played a Game in your life and treats you kind of like a five year old with Daddy's gun. The control's feel slow as well, making your evasion of gunfire hard and then pointless when all the Grenade Launcher carrying S.O.B.'S come out in the Co-op aspect. Zombies felt like a good idea til you realized it was a super Cheap version of that one made by COD's Dev's.\nI didn't try Jurassic, I got kicked from the first Zombie attempt and The Second seemed even more worthless attempt as it was all a bunch of LMG's cause every other gun is damn near useless.\n\nPVP is most likely something that you want to avoid, I didn't try it as PVP in these Game's tends to come down to who Paid more of their hard earned cash to get Shiny Sword Mk.69, that or Aim bots and Super Speed hack with Infinite Explosives to kill you without trying.\n\nOH! I almost forgot the most Horrendous Idea that I have ever seen in a Co-op mode, if you die, rather than have a respawn timer and some points taken away, you get Auto-kicked in 120 Seconds if you do not have a token, which you can get from Silver bullets at the shooting range or Pay with Even MORE of your money! Co-op is more just Co-Flop, cause unless your like everyone else and have some Payed for weapon, your not going to be doing much more than being The Camera man, aka your watching but not doing.\n\nAltogether, I suggest taking your Time, Money and Possibly Lovely as The Night Sky filled with Stars PC and Go to some other Online Third Person Shooter, or maybe just go play an MMO, or FPS, or something Two to Ten times better than this Turd.","September 24, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While it's true that most weapons and cosmetics cost real world money, they can also be earned with in game gold. Prices for renting seem to be fair and cheap, and you can permanently purchase 90% of items in games with in game money alone. The few that are restricted to premimum cash are all cosmetic, with the only stat boosting items being gloves and boots, which merely increase XP and gold by 3-5%. Not a large difference over all.\n\nThe combat is your standard third person shooter fair, but it seems to be trying to make it fun at least. With a "Sticky," cover system akin to Gears of War, an active reload that is an exact copy of GoW's, and well designed weapons, it at least plays well. Most weapons are moddable, with things such as steel barrels for longer range, or bayonets for vastly increased melee damage. So far, all the mod slots have only had one option, meaning you don't have to pick and choose to make the perfect build. This can be annoying to some people, but I personally prefer upgrading a weapon to be a straight linear path.\n\nAs for the weapons themselves, they are mostly well designed and based around skill. Though there are some weapons that seem over powered (Damn you, Uzi blind fire) for the most part they all work in their respective niches. Further more, they are very skill based. If you have a steady hand and are patient enough, it's entirely possible to snipe across maps with the starter sidearm, though very difficult. Weapons can be reloaded while sprinting and rolling, preventing you from being locked into long animations with no way to counter.\n\nThe cover system has a few flaws. Most notably, if you vault a cover piece and continue to hold sprint, you will merely jog forward, which is sometimes the difference between life and death. Sometimes you will get stuck on wall polyogons, or ping wildly across the the wall, sometimes even through it... Which brings me to my main complaint. Any amount of ping above 50 will massively affect your gameplay. I regularly am forced to play with ping in the upper 200s, and it's damn near unplayable at times. Every person who kills me does so with flawless headshots through walls, while I can only score kills on ambushes or direct instant kill headshots.\n\nDespite all the issues just mentioned however, the game at it's core remains fun. I've had a blast, sprinting with six others through an Egyptian pyramid while fleeing from mummies and dogs with bombs strapped to them, desperately mashing R to reload in time to unload on the horde just around the next corner. Sitting in the top of a tower with two friends, holding a choke point in the middle of a PVP match so our team can regroup and push forward up the middle of the train. Sprinting down a shortcut and ambushing the highest scoring enemy player just before he can execute my sniper buddy, then reviving him and laying a claymore trap that takes out three enemies at once. Desperately dancing through a horde of giants with battle axes, fleeing from Anubis himself while my teammates dump hundreds of pounds of lead into him, then turning and finishing him off with a last ditch headshot.\n\nI started this game on a whim, half wondering just how bad it would be. And in truth, there's quite a bit of bad to be had here. But the sheer fun the game over shadows that. I've had more campy, cheesy, silly fun with this game than I've had in months. And the fact it's free just makes it better.","October 13, 2014","true","33.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I did notice a striking Resmeblence in gameplay to G.O.W. It has fun and Challenging Game modes for both Co-op Play, and PvP, i really enjoyed the Mercs Vs Monsters PVP mode, would like to see more then one level for it though with different types of baddies for ech side (like for example make it a eygytian level and use the anubis zombie, and the other types from that level). Another thing is maybe some more levels for all the ops modes (assault ops, Extinction ops, Paranormal ops) Id also like to see a capture the flag style pvp game! OH another thing id like to see to make it more challenging is the threshold defense, ontop of already having waves of Zombies, then Domninion soldiers, id like to see waves of the dinosaurs or something, which might be hard if grouped together, but throw in a few raptors or saber tooths with groups of soldiers, and further on, heavy soldiers with SPinos or triceratops! I think that would be cool. Another Idea im just throwin out there is maybe a ultimate op mode for PvE, make it a mission to get though hordes of zombies, fight a boss, then moove on to doinion soldier's, then a domninion boss, then move on to a dinosaur combat, then the t-rex, then after that, one final wave of all Zombies, DOmnion Soldiers, And Dinos, then maybe one ultimate boss (Badass Zombie T-R.E.X with same equipment, and maybe a lil boss guy riding on top firing a big lazer or something lol)","October 14, 2014","true","245.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So far, all the mod slots have only had one option, meaning you don't have to pick and choose to make the perfect build. This can be annoying to some people, but I personally prefer upgrading a weapon to be a straight linear path.\n\nAs for the weapons themselves, they are mostly well designed and based around skill. Though there are some weapons that seem over powered (Damn you, Uzi blind fire) for the most part they all work in their respective niches. Further more, they are very skill based. If you have a steady hand and are patient enough, it's entirely possible to snipe across maps with the starter sidearm, though very difficult. Weapons can be reloaded while sprinting and rolling, preventing you from being locked into long animations with no way to counter.\n\nThe cover system has a few flaws. Most notably, if you vault a cover piece and continue to hold sprint, you will merely jog forward, which is sometimes the difference between life and death. Sometimes you will get stuck on wall polyogons, or ping wildly across the the wall, sometimes even through it... Which brings me to my main complaint. Any amount of ping above 50 will massively affect your gameplay. I regularly am forced to play with ping in the upper 200s, and it's damn near unplayable at times. Every person who kills me does so with flawless headshots through walls, while I can only score kills on ambushes or direct instant kill headshots.\n\nDespite all the issues just mentioned however, the game at it's core remains fun. I've had a blast, sprinting with six others through an Egyptian pyramid while fleeing from mummies and dogs with bombs strapped to them, desperately mashing R to reload in time to unload on the horde just around the next corner. Sitting in the top of a tower with two friends, holding a choke point in the middle of a PVP match so our team can regroup and push forward up the middle of the train. Sprinting down a shortcut and ambushing the highest scoring enemy player just before he can execute my sniper buddy, then reviving him and laying a claymore trap that takes out three enemies at once. Desperately dancing through a horde of giants with battle axes, fleeing from Anubis himself while my teammates dump hundreds of pounds of lead into him, then turning and finishing him off with a last ditch headshot.\n\nI started this game on a whim, half wondering just how bad it would be. And in truth, there's quite a bit of bad to be had here. But the sheer fun the game over shadows that. I've had more campy, cheesy, silly fun with this game than I've had in months. And the fact it's free just makes it better.","October 13, 2014","true","33.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I did notice a striking Resmeblence in gameplay to G.O.W. It has fun and Challenging Game modes for both Co-op Play, and PvP, i really enjoyed the Mercs Vs Monsters PVP mode, would like to see more then one level for it though with different types of baddies for ech side (like for example make it a eygytian level and use the anubis zombie, and the other types from that level). Another thing is maybe some more levels for all the ops modes (assault ops, Extinction ops, Paranormal ops) Id also like to see a capture the flag style pvp game! OH another thing id like to see to make it more challenging is the threshold defense, ontop of already having waves of Zombies, then Domninion soldiers, id like to see waves of the dinosaurs or something, which might be hard if grouped together, but throw in a few raptors or saber tooths with groups of soldiers, and further on, heavy soldiers with SPinos or triceratops! I think that would be cool. Another Idea im just throwin out there is maybe a ultimate op mode for PvE, make it a mission to get though hordes of zombies, fight a boss, then moove on to doinion soldier's, then a domninion boss, then move on to a dinosaur combat, then the t-rex, then after that, one final wave of all Zombies, DOmnion Soldiers, And Dinos, then maybe one ultimate boss (Badass Zombie T-R.E.X with same equipment, and maybe a lil boss guy riding on top firing a big lazer or something lol)","October 14, 2014","true","245.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's basically a GunZ 2 sequel/ripoff...\n\nIt's the same graphics, the same basic enemy and player types. Of course there are absolutely NO usefull explanations as to how the more complex game features work, and no explanations as to where you can use each player type (specifficaly Mechs). I played 3.5 hours and by the end I still had no idea where I could play as a Mech. And not a single person replied to my questions in the chat.\n\nThe missions are boring. And almost impossible on your own. The voice "acting" is ridiculous. There is no depth to any of the characters (just boobs, and those can only keep you interested so long...). It's basically just another... I'm so bored after playing this game I don't have no power to think of an ending to that sentence...\nAnd the game itself is pretty unstable. It crashed twice on the first launch, and I think it even crashed my LAN card at one point. I'm not even sure how that's possible (first time it EVER happened to me).\n\nNot to mention the whole Pay 2 Win system... So in PvP you go against these "gamers" that have some insane gear and they just F**K you up the a*s (pardon my French) the entire match.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have a couple of hours to kill then sure, why not.

All of this lore that the creators put behind it, even though it's all stuff that's been done before, surprisingly makes the game feel unique.\n\nHowever, the gameplay itself is rather bland. There's no happy medium for the game in terms of challenge: levels are either too hard with players dropping every ten seconds and having to spend another Rev Token (which are easily obtained, thankfully), or the levels are too easy with players scrambling all over the map to try to find something to kill before someone else gets to it. The scenarios don't appeared to be scaled to the number of players, either, so the rofl-stomping of enemies by players gets reversed when one plays alone. The devs should either put a smaller player cap on some of these missions or scale the number and toughness of enemies to the number of players, because once you have 8 people on a single server with only 8 enemies at a time, it gets real boring real fast.\n\nKnow that I'm only talking about the PvE bits. I didn't try the PvP due to the wonky game controls and the inconsistent framerate. It's free, and there's no pay-to-win as far as the PvE goes, so check it out. You may very well like it. It feels like the creators were just as upset about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of GunZ: The Duel by the makers of GunZ 2 as I was, and so they made their own weird, out-of-its-mind anime-esque 3rd-person-shooter shooter with dungeon missions. I may go back to it after they fine-tune it some more, as this is one game that certainly isn't lacking in variety of content.","August 26, 2015","false","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has a few shining, fun moments but they are heavily buried beneath bad game design and uninspired mechanics that most gamers should already be familiar with.\n\nBesides that, there are the small but very irritating details that contributes to my negative outlook: there are intrusive cutscenes that show up when you or your teammates reach the end of a room (i.e. every other minute); the graphics of this game in an aesthetic sense is jarring and has absolutely now flow (imagine cardboard cut outs fighting other cardboard cuts, because that’s EXACTLY how it feels); This game should change its name to Zombies, Monsters, OR Robots because each stage/mode is separated as such, I expected a huge epic fight down in a large map where you hold your own (or with a team) against a variety of fearsome beasties and other terrifying monstrosities but all you get is “go into this room and slowly reach the end of it on this pre-adjusted conveyer belt/gondola/platform while fighting the increasingly difficult albeit same wave of cardboard enemies.”\n\nI’m sorry but this game simply does not hold my interest and it doesn’t do anything new that I haven’t already played in other video games. The only thing this game has going for itself is that it has a nice extensive tutorial, it’s FREE 2 play, and (as a result of the previous) you can easily get a bunch of your close gaming buddies and have some fun together. But otherwise you’re probably not going to stick around for very long. The only people I can see still playing this though are those who put money into this, find these types of modes appealing (go fight a wave in one room and the same in the next room, fight several waves in the same room, and PVP), or people who like the random loot drop nature of F2P games. Apparently you can level up at a reasonably quick pace, as opposed to the extremely slow crawl of level progression found in most F2P’s, so it has that going for it but again I didn’t play long enough to get past level 3 because it wasn’t enough to hold my interest.\n\nEven though I wouldn’t want to touch this with a digital ten and half foot gun, I still highly recommend that you at least give it a try and find out for yourself if you’re one of the few who might get a kick out of this game, you never know.\n","May 14, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has a few shining, fun moments but they are heavily buried beneath bad game design and uninspired mechanics that most gamers should already be familiar with.\n\nBesides that, there are the small but very irritating details that contributes to my negative outlook: there are intrusive cutscenes that show up when you or your teammates reach the end of a room (i.e. every other minute); the graphics of this game in an aesthetic sense is jarring and has absolutely now flow (imagine cardboard cut outs fighting other cardboard cuts, because that’s EXACTLY how it feels); This game should change its name to Zombies, Monsters, OR Robots because each stage/mode is separated as such, I expected a huge epic fight down in a large map where you hold your own (or with a team) against a variety of fearsome beasties and other terrifying monstrosities but all you get is “go into this room and slowly reach the end of it on this pre-adjusted conveyer belt/gondola/platform while fighting the increasingly difficult albeit same wave of cardboard enemies.”\n\nI’m sorry but this game simply does not hold my interest and it doesn’t do anything new that I haven’t already played in other video games. The only thing this game has going for itself is that it has a nice extensive tutorial, it’s FREE 2 play, and (as a result of the previous) you can easily get a bunch of your close gaming buddies and have some fun together. But otherwise you’re probably not going to stick around for very long. The only people I can see still playing this though are those who put money into this, find these types of modes appealing (go fight a wave in one room and the same in the next room, fight several waves in the same room, and PVP), or people who like the random loot drop nature of F2P games. Apparently you can level up at a reasonably quick pace, as opposed to the extremely slow crawl of level progression found in most F2P’s, so it has that going for it but again I didn’t play long enough to get past level 3 because it wasn’t enough to hold my interest.\n\nEven though I wouldn’t want to touch this with a digital ten and half foot gun, I still highly recommend that you at least give it a try and find out for yourself if you’re one of the few who might get a kick out of this game, you never know.\n","May 14, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonicmole/recommended/306830/","tonicmole","tonicmole","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonicmole/","224 products in account","Imagine Gears of War as a free to play online shooter.  ZMR isn't as polished or smooth as Gears, but ZMR was definitly designed in that template.  Though it is free to play, it currently offers equal amounts of content to purchase with in game currency, so you could easily never spend a dime, and still feel rewarded.  I primarily played PVE, because by nature all PVP free to play games are pay to win.....it's just the nature of the beast.  Best way to put it is that if you thought, "I might like this game?" Than you probably will.  It is, what it is.  A fun indie cover based shooter, with microtransactions.  Now, if you're the type of person interested in paying for content, thats where things get iffy.  This game is wicked expensive.  $15 for a costume, $5 for a shirt, $20 for a gun.  Now keep in mind, there is tons of content that can be purchased with the fake in game currency, so it's up to you.  One major issue I currently faced was that the launcher for many does not work through Steam, so you have to launch it directly from the games exe.  It's annoying, and the reason why so many people appear to only have played the game for a few minutes at most.  In the end, if you don't abhorently hate the idea of free to play, and like cover based shooters than.....play it.  Cause it's free.","December 17, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really like it, but the downsides to it are massive, and make the experience not as fun.\nI love the gameplay, first off, and I especially like the duck and cover system that the game has. It makes you feel like you are straight inside an action movie. However, the game requires you to spend a TON of money. For example, if you "buy" a gun, you really just rent it, it doesn't stay in your inventory forever. Some guns do, but most don't. All the good guns, you must buy with real money, making this game a great F2P, and also a massive P2W","October 19, 2014","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I never was really into the whole online FPS/ renting weapon theme that goes around on games like this, and when I first looked at it and saw videos of it I just thought "a bunch of useless and extravagent shallow ♥♥♥ content in a pretty package".\nI was dead wrong. Every game mode feels unique and seperate from the other in PvE, and PvP to me feels like its pretty balanced even with the cash shop weapons and items. All I've really noticed from cash shop users is that they get a larger variety of weapons sooner, none of them are uberpowered killing machines and you actually have to be competent to use them.\nOh, and on the subject of weapons, you DO have to rent weapons. You can buy them permenantly but it takes a pretty hefty amount of gold. But this game has several saving graces that make it a lot easier to just stockpile all your gold and save it for whatever weapon you want;\n1. Shooting gallery\n-The shooting gallery is a mechanic that lets you earn "bullets" of differeing tiers *silver,gold, platinum* from doing missions or playing matches in either game type. These bullets can be used in the shooting gallery to earn multiple prizes. Now the majority of the time you're going to end up with REVIVE TOKENS, which is the generic consolation prize, but a decent amount of times you'll usually get a decent or different timed weapon for 7 days, which I like since it means I can ratpile my gold even more and still get to use different weapons, but you can get REALLY lucky and get a permenant weapon out of it. Yes, a free permenant weapon. Not to mention the free permenant weapons you get every 10 levels.\n2. Rep\n-The game has three types of currency. Gold, Rep, and EMP. Gold is..well gold. Basic shop fodder earned from doing just about anything. Rep is the sort of inbetween of cash shop and regular shop. You earn it from doing dailies, and certain missions reward it too. EMP is the microtransaction currency. Now that you know what rep is, I'll let you know why it helps with stockpiling gold. I cant remember with 100% accuracy how much a gold boost is but I think its around 350 rep? You average around 400-450 rep a day from the dailies they give you, and that means you can afford a gold boost a day, which boosts gold earned from matches. Personally I haven't used it yet, but its a pretty huge boost, 50%. For a whole 24hrs. Thats pretty nice of them I'd say. It also says for ALL GOLD REWARDS. I'm not sure if that means it works for completing missions too, but if it does you'd be able to easily stock up 100-150k gold in a very reasonable amount of time.\n\nSince we're talking about rep, lets talk about it as a go between cash shop and regular shop. You can buy a load of nice goodies with it, from the aforementioned gold boost to special card art to special weapons and VERY helpful gun turrets. I REALLY like the rep store. I think its incredibly helpful and useful to be able to get a free gold/exp boost a day if you wanted to spend on that, or even the gun turrets that are usually cash-shop only. Right now I'm sitting on 3500 rep and I'm saving up for a permenant Thresher SMG (20k). It blows my mind they even offer a permenant weapon that is that good without having to pay actual money. Yes, it takes investment in time, but its not a huge grind for Rep, the dailies are a cinch and easy money/exp.\n\nNow, onto the grind. You might be someone who can't invest a lot of time, or maybe say, like an hour or two tops on a good day to play a video game. ZMR respects and understands that. Every day they give you missions for logging time just playing and they reward you. They aren't counted as dailies, but they're given to you each roll over period. They give you a solid amount of gold, some free bullets, some free exp, and some free gun turrets. For just playing 60/120 minutes on any game type, as long as you see the match through. Its awesome. And for people who DO have a lot of time to play but get tired of the "grinding", ZMR challenges the typical grind for resources by offering such a ridiculously vast amount of content. Getting tired of PvP? Go do some paranormal ops in a *great looking on higher graphic settings* large egyptian themed mission. Tired of shooting zombies all day?  Go get your feet wet in the intense PvP modes. Tired of BOTH of those things? Play some Mercs vs Monsters, where you get to play as Zombies AND Humans with class tiers unlocked by getting more kills and surviving, its great.\n\nAll in all, ZMR is an incredibly decent game. One of the few FPS's I'd invest any time or money in. I see a bright future ahead for it.\n\nedit: Just read that they added  support for steam trading cards. Gotta love it.","September 26, 2014","true","196.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While their are better guns in the game, the starter weapons are more than enough to do the job and you earn in game money to rent anything else you want and that is if you don't unlock anything free from the shooting gallery. I have already earned the best hand gun in the game from the gallery.\n\nThis game has a lot to offer and good servers too.

Can't complain much considering it's free to play, but in my opinion it's not worth the space on my hard drive. They're main selling point was coming off as a wacky save the world shooter, but it is very poorly executed. Gameplay is easy and repetitive. Obnoxiously repetitive. You're continuously moving in a clear straight line with enemies generally coming from one direction, and levels can be completed by simply spamming fire down the players line of sight. Also, out of bounds areas appear as large empty rooms that a player would assume is full of some kind of loot, but inches away a wall appears informing you you can't pass. Reloading is poor on machine guns. Rather than having the bar longer and a smaller window for the quick reload bonus, they simply slow the moving bar, making the reload bonus a near guarantee on LMG's. Running while moving left or right is a nightmare.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/transientpoe/recommended/306830/","transientpoe","TransientPoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/transientpoe/","402 products in account","TL;DR:  It's a lackluster Gears-of-War-style game that has mediocre-to-bad mechanics and does virtually nothing to stand out from the crowd.\n\nFull Review:\n\nMan, where to start.\n\nI will admit to not playing this game for very long.  If that means this is a bad review, take it for what it is.  But I only stopped playing it so quickly because the little of it I DID play left SUCH a bad taste in my mouth that I wasn't willing to force myself through any more of its mediocrity.\n\nBasically Gears of War with an actual color palette, ZMR is a third-person cover-based shooter that utilizes the "active reload" mechanic from GOW and has you fighting a variety of skins draped over generic enemies.  In general, the mechanics were below par; running and rolling was a little sticky, you have to scroll the mouse wheel to use the scope for the sniper rifle, the cover mechanic didn't work most of the time, and I never really had a good feel for how much health my character had.  Really, though, the mechanics are serviceable enough that the problems could be ignored if the rest of the game was good.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nMy problems with this game began from the main screen.  The game requires a separate account with En Masse to play, but it wasn't immediately apparent, because it said that my steam account's auto-log-on had "failed".  It didn't fail, it just wasn't connected to an account.  Making an account was a little annoying due to the forced email verification, but I've had more painful experiences on Steam with multiplayer games and MMOs before, so it's harmless, if a little backwards and bizarre\n\nI don't know exactly what they put in the code, but it feels sloppy from a user perspective; just the launcher took a couple of tries to get working, and the game took a while to launch, and started by going into the minimized window that you usually see when you alt+tab out of the game.  It wasn't BROKEN, but it's indicitive of the lack of polish in the rest of the game.  Oh, and the game started windowed for some reason, and I couldn't change that option until I got into a game.  More on that in a minute.\n\nWhen the game finally started, I was immediately shunted into Character Creation.  It was a little jarring, but I'd seen games do this before, and to be honest, this was the best part of the game.  There weren't a LOT of options, but there were more options than most games had at launch, and they were evenly distributed between males and females.  They even had twelve distinct voice actors; six for each gender.  For some weird reason, they give you multiple character slots in the game, too.  I didn't check, but I'd be surprised if your cosmetics and weapons carried over between characters, so I was a little baffled as to why they gave you extra options, but it's certainly not a BAD thing.\n\nNow things get a little MORE frustrating.\n\nFrom the Character Creation screen, you're FORCED to go through a tutorial.  There is no way to put it off and no way to ignore it.  It's one of THOSE tutorials, too; the ones that assume you're too stupid to know that the WASD keys move you and the mouse looks.  It was pointless, but mercifully short.  It's also the first time in the game you can change your settings... from the pause menu.  There's no way (as far as I could see) to set them up peacefully, outside of a match.  Anyway, you set your options and finish the tutorial without trouble only to find the game has assigned you ANOTHER, MANDATORY tutorial.  During this one, you're assigned to fight zombies (since the last tutorial didn't bother to include any enemies) and you're assigned an AI partner with one of the most overcompensating aimbots I've ever seen.  She mows down almsot every enemy, making this section almost pointless, and making me feel incompetant.  Yet even here, I could feel the specter of the problem that dominated my playtime with the game.\n\nOnce you make your character and finish the two mandatory tutorials, the game gives you a "mission" (like challenges in other games):  To finish a game of a specific type.  If I remember right, it was called Assault.  You are then dumped onto a serverlist that's a chaotic, unnavigable mess (as most server lists tend to be).  It probably had sorting tools, but I didn't see them and didn't know how to use them even if I'd found them.  Luckily, one of the tabs (the third one over for some reason) was a "mission" tab that let you select a mission, hit "go!" and it would automatically put you into the appropriate match.\n\nThen I got into the match, and my problems were immediate.  The issues with gameplay I had in the tutorial were magnified a hundredfold in actual combat.  My enemies this time were the "Robots" of Zombies Mosters Robots.  The game starts you off with an assault rifle, an LMG, a pistol, and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grenades.\n\nThe biggest, most elephant-in-the-room issue with this game is the enemies.  No matter what enemy type I faced (the robots had several, most of which were reskins of zombie enemies with guns), they went down like little ♥♥♥♥♥es.  The LMG is insanely overpowered, and it's a perminant unlock, meaning that you always have it.  It might be different on higher difficulties (we were playing on normal) but usually the first difficulty in a multiplayer game like this is somewhat challenging.  Here, enemies were dull sacks of blood (yes, blood.  from robots.) who popped when you looked at them funny.  Ammo was somewhat scarce, but once I knew I had to manage it, I had no problems with that, either.  The only hard part came when all my teammates went down and left (I'm still not sure how or why) and I was the last person on the server.  At that point, I was under attack from all sides, and the cover system was virtually pointless, as there weren't really any choke points I could funnel enemies down.  I went down a couple of times.\n\nMy real, overarching issue with this is that the unlocks in the game are almost entirely new weapons (usually on a timed limit for some reason), but while new weapons would have given the damage bonus I needed to tackle harder waves, they wouldn't have made soloing that mission any easier.  I was basically killing anything I looked at anyway; it was just the ludicrous amount of targets that brought me down, more via attrition than anything else (and there wasn't a single health pickup in sight, by the way.  Not that I know for a fact how health worked, since, unlike walking with WASD and pressing mouse 1 to shoot, that was deemed an unimportant thing to teach the player).  When a few other players dropped in at the end, we mopped up the rest of the enemies, and I felt less like my occasional low killcounts were because I was low-level or bad at the game and more that enemies just spawned closer to the other guy.\n\nBottom line:  When a multiplayer shooter based around unlocks fails to provide unlocks that are useful to the player, is there even a game to play anymore?\n\nAlso, for a shooter in this day and age to do so little to set itself apart is criminal.  Comparing it to, say, Titanfall, that game at least provides some unique tools like the giant robots and vertical movement to make matches interesting.  This game wallows in mechanics that were overused when Gears of War 3 came out and does absolutely nothing to provide a unique gameplay experience.\n\nFinal Score:  5/10 by most game journalist standards.  It's boring, unoriginal, and it doesn't even work well enough to be called "average".","September 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You don't necessarily unlock guns by leveling up, you unlock them by purchasing them with gold you get from games played. Now that doesn't necessarily sound bad, but in PvP you'll get spawn camped like it's going out of style. Also the bulk of the weapons that you can get are EXPLICITLY for players who pay.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun game to play then look away. This game is pay to win down to the core. Such a shame.","October 31, 2014","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its great to get a big group of friends togehter and start waves of zombie survival. Or, Play a fair game of PVP and vs. each other.\n\nBADS:\nI personally hate this game, mostly because its is completly copying Gears of War. Everything is the same, All the animations, Active-Reloads, Maps, Environments, Characters and even enemies. You play this game for 5 minutes and tell me that some of the enemies don't look like Locusts from Gears. And finally, I think the thing I hate most about this game is the gamplay, Yes its fun online with big groups of friends. But alone its just SO BORING. There are only 8 waves per game and the enemies never seem to get harder. More enemies come, but they all have the same amount of health. So there is never any challenge to the game. This game may be free, But don't waste your time downloading it. Go buy a game thats worth your time.

Compared to some other free shooters out there, ZMR has a pretty solid CoOp experience going for it provided you've got a buddy to tag along. Otherwise it devolves rather quickly into a grind, which is made more frusterating by most weapons being rentals (I'm looking at you, Blacklight).\n\nNow when I say ZMR is short on content I mean that there are only a few maps, and the enemies range from full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that can only walk a straight line and mech-hitler that will one shot you and your family if you look at him wrong. That aside, this game is Blacklight: Retribution's superior at least because its grind is nowhere near painful and it does not appear to suffer P2W at all.\n\nAlso reminds me of Bulletstorm because it has that reloading mechanic Gears had.\n\nSpeaking of mechanics, the game gives you 3 free respawns each game. After those have been used you must use your own permanent respawn tokens (which are won from completing missions). This makes wave spawn gametypes a little more difficult because every mistake in a match can affect you in the long run. It's really a clever way to make their stupid zombies a little more threatening.\n\n\nPros:\n+Little to no pay-to-win\n+Free\n+Unique enemies\n+Easy grind\n\nCons:\n-Can get repetitive\n-Rental equipment\n\nRating: 7/10 "Played once then uninstalled."\n","February 8, 2015","true","19.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was willing to put up with the cheaters and the high pings from players outside NA.  I made a couple comments today about the increase in hacking that I have observed in the past little while and I was called numerous names over megaphone and whispered to by people who thought they were the games elite.  They said I was ruining the game by making comments like that.  I never hackusate people specifically but I have been playing video games, and this game, long enough to know what you can and cant do...or whats possible and what is just luck and what is simply botting or whatever.  This game is no longer worth it.  Its free to play, and even void of a lot of pay to winness I've seen in other games.  I have even been tempted to pay real money to buy outfits and other things in the cash shop.  They say they are doing what they can about the hacking....but there is no anti-cheat system or any way of reporting cheaters.  I will still play this game from time to time, but I will never spend money on it or really ever put much time into it.  Spare yourself some anger and frustration....play something else.","October 4, 2014","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The movement feels stiff and clunky but the combat feels alright aside from that. Character creation is limited to only a few wipe sweeping options, and the game itself is lobby based where you jump into a map with a specific objective.

Compared to some other free shooters out there, ZMR has a pretty solid CoOp experience going for it provided you've got a buddy to tag along. Otherwise it devolves rather quickly into a grind, which is made more frusterating by most weapons being rentals (I'm looking at you, Blacklight).\n\nNow when I say ZMR is short on content I mean that there are only a few maps, and the enemies range from full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that can only walk a straight line and mech-hitler that will one shot you and your family if you look at him wrong. That aside, this game is Blacklight: Retribution's superior at least because its grind is nowhere near painful and it does not appear to suffer P2W at all.\n\nAlso reminds me of Bulletstorm because it has that reloading mechanic Gears had.\n\nSpeaking of mechanics, the game gives you 3 free respawns each game. After those have been used you must use your own permanent respawn tokens (which are won from completing missions). This makes wave spawn gametypes a little more difficult because every mistake in a match can affect you in the long run. It's really a clever way to make their stupid zombies a little more threatening.\n\n\nPros:\n+Little to no pay-to-win\n+Free\n+Unique enemies\n+Easy grind\n\nCons:\n-Can get repetitive\n-Rental equipment\n\nRating: 7/10 "Played once then uninstalled."\n","February 8, 2015","true","19.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here's a skin-deep analysis of the game.\n\nPros:\nEasy to understand\nFun*\nFree-to-Play\nEach mission feels different\nEach enemy feels different\nCover-based mechanics*\n\nCons:\nFinding a party of equivalent level people is hard solo\nCover-based mechanics*\n\n*See mechanics\n\nGraphics: Acceptable. While not visually stunning, they get the point across efficiently and passingly. 4/5.\n\nMechanics: Well, this is a fairly average shooter game. It doesn't add anything new or exciting to the formula of cover-based shooters if you've been through enough of them. Each character can hold two weapons, a sidearm (Pistol or Melee Weapon), and several modifiers (think of these as like MMO traits, +5-10% movement speed, etc.) You can take cover and blind-fire, which interacts interestingly with some of the enemies in PVE. There are certain enemies (Flamers, Chargers, etc.) which will try to drive you out of cover, while certain enemies (snipers, heavies, etc.) do better against you when you are out of cover. So, teamwork and prioritization is important. This makes playing without a set group risky: you may find that your group is mostly incompetent, playing under their skill level, or just right for you.\n\nMy only mechanical gripe so far is that there is no "Assist" points in PVE, meaning that players who use high burst damage (Shotguns and snipers) will score higher, even if they only finish off an enemy. Should this be fixed, I'd be more than willing to say this could be a 5$/Month game.","April 26, 2015","true","17.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has great replay value and it brings gametypes from a lot of different shooters. Im not too hot on the whole renting gun systems and stuff, but the silver/gold etc bullets offer permanent items i beleive (gotta be lucky though). For a f2p game, i think it looks pretty good and plays pretty smoothly. The enemies are basically reskins, but that didnt bother me all that much. I just kinda wish it was easier to get better gear and stuff without paying real money for it, but hey thats f2p for ya. The rental system is a cash grab kind of idea, but they gotta make money somehow. I just hope they will tweak somethings in the future, but so far the PvE has me hooked.\n\nPros: Smooth, pretty, remniscent of other shooters like gears, bosses are kinda fun, awesome for something that is f2P, and its smooth i think. Oh and radar saves my life, and my teammates, so many times in PVE. PVP seems ok, ive only played a couple, but i think thats where pay-to-win kind of rears its ugly head, not in an insane way though. I was an intern and played a couple rounds and actually won them...so yeah. It is really easy to die though. Also health regen when not getting attacked is nice.\n\nCons: enemies can get repetitive as well as the game types (but what do you expect, it is what it is, most every game can get a little repetitive), the rental system is bleh, and, to me at least, some of the guns just kind of blend together. What i mean is one assault rifle will feel just like the other ( at  least for some). Also, i only really started enjoying myself and killing a bunch of stuff when i passed one of my missions to get this SMG-ZK (surpirse its a rental), idk something ZK, that gives me extra damage in certain PvE game types. I feel like once that limit is up, im gonna find myself not really doing much damage.","September 20, 2014","true","26.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has great replay value and it brings gametypes from a lot of different shooters. Im not too hot on the whole renting gun systems and stuff, but the silver/gold etc bullets offer permanent items i beleive (gotta be lucky though). For a f2p game, i think it looks pretty good and plays pretty smoothly. The enemies are basically reskins, but that didnt bother me all that much. I just kinda wish it was easier to get better gear and stuff without paying real money for it, but hey thats f2p for ya. The rental system is a cash grab kind of idea, but they gotta make money somehow. I just hope they will tweak somethings in the future, but so far the PvE has me hooked.\n\nPros: Smooth, pretty, remniscent of other shooters like gears, bosses are kinda fun, awesome for something that is f2P, and its smooth i think. Oh and radar saves my life, and my teammates, so many times in PVE. PVP seems ok, ive only played a couple, but i think thats where pay-to-win kind of rears its ugly head, not in an insane way though. I was an intern and played a couple rounds and actually won them...so yeah. It is really easy to die though. Also health regen when not getting attacked is nice.\n\nCons: enemies can get repetitive as well as the game types (but what do you expect, it is what it is, most every game can get a little repetitive), the rental system is bleh, and, to me at least, some of the guns just kind of blend together. What i mean is one assault rifle will feel just like the other ( at  least for some). Also, i only really started enjoying myself and killing a bunch of stuff when i passed one of my missions to get this SMG-ZK (surpirse its a rental), idk something ZK, that gives me extra damage in certain PvE game types. I feel like once that limit is up, im gonna find myself not really doing much damage.","September 20, 2014","true","26.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure it has a cash shop like most games of the same genre, but most of it is unnecessary as with a little bit of luck you can get some of the best weapons for free using in-game gold and rep tokens, as well as a reward system with bullets that you get from completing any PvE map to use in a shooting gallery to get plentiful and helpful rewards. It may be a bit repetitive at times, but En Masse has shown that they are still providing updates with new maps, missions, guns and costumes. On top of that, every 5 levels you gain, you will earn a free Thresher weapon, which will do 1.5x damage in ALL PvE modes.\n\nIts not without faults however. There are many glitches that En Masse still has not fixed, but nothing that will take the enjoyment out of the game.\n\nThe player base however is another story... 90% of the population is Brazilians and Russians that don't speak a word of english, even though the servers are based in North America. They constantly slow down the game, be it them acting completely stupid or lagging the entire server.\n\nI give it a solid 8/10, fun to play for small periods at a time, but not really worth putting all your effort (and money) into.\nBut hey, if you want to buy the packs and costumes, be my guest, they will certainly give you an advantage.","June 23, 2015","true","217.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The name and the game being free is something that would seem like a game not that popular. When my cousin convinced me and literally dragged me into this game, oh boy... Lots of fun! It's basically a Gears Of War type thirdperson shooter. Spacebar to jump and many tactics for ducking, and many movements. My favorite gamemode in this game is Monsters vs. Mechs. Man this is a really cool game, not only do you have the option to do pve and fight monsters, but you can also do pvp and play as the monsters or play as the humans that advance to bigger robots.

There are Missions (complete X map on X difficulty, kill X amount of players in pvp,etc) that give you cosmetics, weapons, items, XP, etc if you complete them, but the items you get are not permanent and following my statment about in-game currency, the fact that you have to wait soooooooooo long just to get enough money for a weapon you want to be permanent, makes the game a chore instead of being fun.\n\n-PVP respawn mechaninc its just completly stupid, i played 10 or more matches in pvp, were you spawn and you are invincible for 3 seconds in a random pre-set spawn point (unlike other multiplayer games were the game spawns you away from the fight to avoid spawn camping)  and those 3 seconds go so fast, to the point were playing any kind of 16 player match, either free for all or team based its basically who can spawn camp better.....hell you may spawn withing seconds of another guy who spawn on the exact same spot and just kill him. 4 free for all matches in a row were the winner was spawn camping.","September 20, 2014","false","7.3"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

Pathetic that they even try to use that.\nBought respawns...this reminds me of GunZ 2 in this way and the last. You have to buy some respawns that cost real money so you can progress on Co-Op missions that you worked hard on only to get auto-kicked if you don't respawn after you die.\nReally? Is this considered a super good shooter? These two things are total buzzkills for me. It claims to be super fun and addictive, but the two pts. that I mentioned totally lowers the bar for total play time and fun while playing it. Call of Duty, which is good for a dead game in my eyes, has this right every time and leaves players addicted and free of being so flinchy because you won't be kicked if you die in Co-Op and you can respawn as much as you want.\nSince you buy both, I guess it's just one of their schemes to gain money becuase you're tempted to respawn and keep items. It's a weak way on buying money. If you don't have the game yet, don't fall for this little scheme of getting you desperate so they can squeeze you down to a pulp on money. Don't fall for how they make you think that you can spend a lot of time trying to get something because it's a useless attempt. Now I'm going to play a game worth my time.","November 22, 2014","false","0.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

This is perhaps the best F2P FPS game out there that I have played. The graphics are godlike when turned max and the game runs smoothly. The reloading mechanics is my favorite part. It makes reloading more realistic and even people in real life can make mistakes when in stress. The game's animation and character mode are good. Characters creation is creative and does not lock stuff like female characters. The animation in game looks realistic. Your character will stutter when bombarded, will duck or nearly fall down when enemies fire at you. The smoke and explosions are amazing to watch. Missions have well designed cut scenes and quests have good variety of AI. This game also have PVE PVP so the playability is increased by alot. Weapons and everything is pretty much obtainable F2P and most weapons are balanced. Items are given out when you level or do mission which is great if you want to try out new weapons before buying them from the store. This game is very nice and I have been spamming my friends to get them to play with me.

You will probably get killed trying to take cover or get away from cover just because the controls are iffy and the game's responsiveness is even more questionable.\n\nFun concept, poor delivery.

On top of it all you can choose from tons of different weapons and customizations to make your zombie hunting, monster slaying, robot destroying adventure even more epic. The only problem with this game is... that none of that is actually there.\n\nWhen I first watched the trailer for this game the above was exactly what I thought, I was expecting some sort of wave survival game were you were pitted against all these different and unique enemies with your own unique weapons and loadout, but after I played my first game my opinion quickly changed. There is only one PvE mode where "all" enemies can appear and you fight them and it's a wave survival but it feels more like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tower defense mode and with "all" the enemies appearing I saw maybe at most 30-40 different enemy types, and as far as I saw there were no "monsters" aside from maybe these weird flying things that didnt do anything. For a game called "Zombies Monsters Robots" it was seriously lacking in terms of the "Monsters" and thats only in comparison to the other two. If it's compared to a game that actually has a decent amount of enemies then even the zombies and robots are seriously lacking.\n\nWhat I was expecting for enemies was a mix of Left 4 Dead, Monster Hunter and Mass Effect, what I got was a mix of Gears of War, CoD and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ suburbs of Indie games.\n\nNow on to the "Unlimited Weapons", when you start you get some basic weapons, an AR, an LMG, a Pistol and a Grenade, not to bad for a starting loadout until you realize 3 things:\n\n1) To get any more weapons you need to play possibly 30-40 rounds just to unlock your first "cheap" gun, which is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ handgun.\n2) Once you have grinded to the point where in most games you have the best gear you could ever get you now can buy your first ♥♥♥♥♥♥ handgun and it only lasts 7 days... yes you read that correctly 7 days, no it is not a typo.\n3) There are only 6 different types of weapons: ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, Snipers and Pistols or Handguns. Oh and remember that grenade you got as a starting loadout item? Well there are only two types of grenades in the game anyways frags and flash (flash only being semi-useful in pvp)\n\nIn game you can earn at most 1000 gold per round if you are extremely lucky and have a gold boost (that can only be obtained through real money). Or you play Threshold Defense to earn more but the amount you earn is based on how many waves you survive and it doesn't increase with a curve its a linear increased amount of gold per wave (meaning surviving 1 wave 8 times will yeild the same amount of gold as surviving 8 waves once, only difference is that surviving 8 waves is more "difficult"). If you choose not to play Threshold Defense you can earn at most 1000 gold as stated above, and any given mode can take anywhere form 20 minutes to 4 hours to 15 seconds depending on how bored you and your team are. now these numbers aren't all that bad except for the fact that the cheapest thing in the store, I repeat the CHEAPEST thing is the flash/frag grenade for 15000 gold and no one is ever going to want that so whats next? Oh you want that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ handgun I was telling you about? Well that 30000 for 7-days or 150000 permenant. Everything else in the store is far more expensive than that. Also each weapon only has about 6 mods you can buy and most of which require real money.\n\nNow the best part, the PvP, here is what I have to say: why? Why the hell is there PvP in the first place? The game is all about killing zombies, monsters and robots not people. But with that point aside I now have to ask: What PvP? The entire game is lobby based meaning that there are lobbies for players to join however there are no official lobbies meaning that all lobbies are player made, except for the VIP PvE lobbies (which on a side note I'm still trying to figure out what VIP does), this player made lobbies only premise cause the issue of no one creating lobbies then everyone getting fed up and creating lobbies and then we have 20 lobbies with 1 person in them each. And now I say if only that were the case, the real probem is that there are no players to make said lobbies.\n\nI don't really have the patience to go on any more, I could list over 1000 things wrong with this game but I might as well say the what is good about it cause it only has 2 things going for it, an interesting and very good IDEA and pretty decent gameplay mechanics, thats it.\n\nP.S. One last thing that I suppose I should touch on is the difficulty of the game. In terms of the PvE, the game is so painfully easy that you could beat any mission with one hand, blindfoled and drunk and thats still with minimal effort. The PvP on the other hand, well it's as good as CoD mixed with GoW then turned to ♥♥♥♥ and crushed up by a Pay-to-Win system, not much else to be said there.","April 16, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This game is a cut-and-paste version of Gears. ALL of the mechanics of Gears remained intact, from active reloads to taking cover.\n\nWhile it has a lot of potential, there is zero ability to customize your character with skills. This sounds fine, after all, for decades shooters didn't have RPG elements, right? What is left is "either you gave us money, or you didn't". You can change your outfit/costume, some of which act as "armor" and absorb bullet impacts. There are also customization "slots" that you can equip items in. While the game claims they help round out your character, there aren't many items to pick from, and only maybe half of those are viable. Would you like 50% more health? We would like a dollar.\n\nThe weapons, while numerous, suffer from balancing issues. Some guns are "must haves" (Vector, P90) while others feel like they were clones of one another with different skins (AK, XM8, SCAR-L). If you do not have all of the prementioned armor, health boosts, and guns that vomit torrents of bullets from a bottomless magazine, then you're looking at one-hit deaths. If you want any hope of killing a target, you need to put SIX bullets in them before they whip around with a wall of bullets, any one of which will instantly down you.\n\nAimbotting is rampant in this game. This was admitted by the devs. So if facing down an entire enemy team that has armor, extra health, and a spray-to-win weapon that never loses its bead on you is your thing, then you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!\n\n\n","November 13, 2014","false","101.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_regis/recommended/306830/","_regis","Regis l>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_regis/","191 products in account","The Screenshots and Videos of this game? Show great promise until you are struck by the nasiest and worst pay-to-win/pay-to-play tatics in the book (Hence their E3 reward by Cursefire, now you understand why). The first game I would compare this to is Combat Arms though Nexon is more lenient on their game as they have similar elements.\n\nCustomization Options & Content:\nYou receive 2 timed weapons after completing tutorial and I suspect most equipment will be rented or overpriced.\nI know this is a fairly new game, but it by far is very limited and pushing players to rent things or buy overpriced equipment is very unacceptable of En Masse. The fact you find the first equipment you earn to also be rented!\n\nGameplay & Graphics:\nNow lets go onwards the game. I seriously thought the graphics would have been good, the level design is as anything you seen before; dull. Gameplay was one of my main reasons I just couldn't feel I could play this; For example sometimes you will never suceed as the mobs can overflow you and T-Rex Boss match. (Good luck with that)\nThe mob spawns are unreasonable and cheap. I also have been kicked out twice along with few matches being very laggy. Movement will make your gameplay feel bad along with aiming.\n\nControls\nI should have never picked up a Sniper rifle in the first place because its not easy to use because of this game's already had to understand & chunky controls (Aiming is not easy). In the tutorial I could not understand how to even follow instructions with such idiotic controls they given along with their restricted movement on the character. For a Third-Person shooter I expect the most from this category then any other part, because of the different view it has from a First-Person shooter. I also find that getting out and going into cover is the hardest thing to do.\n\nRespawn tokens also cost money if you need more with horrible enemy AIs, bad customization systems, horrible controls, and not as promising as what it looked like. I'm just not sure if I want to play ZMR ever again if it reminds me of Combat Arms and other Pay-to-win games.\nNow I can't do a full accessment of the game because I have not played it for a fair amount, but ZMR is just full of advertisement and promises that you won't actually get to see.","October 13, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Every round at points you will get extreme rubberbanding lag, and it is pretty terrible when you die and are trying to hit revive and the lag prevents you and the auto kick timer is going fast then normal and then kicks you before the timer is even close to up.

The mechanics are just totally buggy and not even close to be good! When you sprint (shift) You get a 2 second delay...

Even on the double or triple gold days it feels depleted because you don't necessary obtain gold on every mission run that you do.\n\nBecause of this you are left with pedestrian weapons to use, unless you got lucky with the RNG Bullets or the 3-7 day Weapon of the week, which could either be something nice, or one of the least useful weapons available, however those are rentals, not permanents.\n\nNow if you got a steady flow of Gold that could be obtained with consistency through out every mission then this could be remidied somewhat however that isn't even the case either.\n\nThe cost for Stock weapons should seriously be around 50k to 100k A the MOST only, not triple to quadruple that amount, because in the End they are the most basic weapons and are for the most part, almost useless in the Expert/Nightmare Modes.\n\nIf they at least cost only as much as what they are really worth in-game for missions then more people would still be playing.  However Lack of accessibility unless you got luck or Grind at the beginning completely detracts many from wanting to continue.\n\n\nRep Cost - I wanted that Thresher so badly...however I basically gave up, because although I had around 14k of rep, I was nearly 6k away.  Completely ridiculous, especially when I was told that, that Modified was only okay and not even that good.\n\n\nRNG Bullets - Sitting there grinding for Golds or Plats etc to try and hopefully obtain one good weapon (stock even!) really detracts away from this game.  In fact almost the entire game of progression in ZMR is completely and utterly tied to RNG.  You could spend 3-5 bullets, get lucky and obtain a phenomenal weapon, or you could blow through 50-100 bullets and get nothing good out of it.\n\nIt's basically like playing the lottery and "hoping" you can win.  Not only is RNG horrible with the bullets but also with the Loot Boxes as well.  I've seen players spend over $100 and obtain nothing but garbage modifiers, 7-day garbage items and turrets.\n\nI've even heard stories from other fellow members on ZMR who tried to obtain the full Sentinel set and had to throw in nearly $500 for it.  $500?!?!?!  It's complete nonsense, especially when those who said obtaining the Sent set on average for the majority who tried it cost them around $250.\n\n\nDuplicate Weapons -  Seriously, how can you NOT fix this already?  If one cannot use Two of the Same Weapon then why in the world would you STILL allow duplicate weapons to occur with Bullets etc?  I had purchased the M4 (which took forever btw) through gold, however upon spending my Bullets I ended up obtaining another M4, and 5 more weapons that I already HAD in my inventory.\n\nThe RNG should have duplicates removed unless it is another *Modified* version of the weapon.  So if I had my Stock M4 but somehow got a Modified M4 that does bonus damage to Zombies or whatever then that's different.  However Two M4s, Two AKs, 3 of the same stock snipers?  Definitely a problem that could've easily been rectified.\n\nStock Weapons Costing nearly $20 -  This is complete Thievery by EnMasse.  The fact that they would even do such a thing makes sick to my stomach.  Because of the cost, if one were to spend $100, they would in fact only obtain 5 Stock weapons of choice.  Not even a Modified incarnation, but Stock counterparts.\n\nThese Weapons are nearly Useless for Expert to Nightmare Modes because enemies have an insane amount of HP, so having Modified Weapons is a MUST.  The cost of Stock should Equal to what they are in usefulness in Game.\n\nLevel Limitations on Weapons - Still don't understand this, and although it's less of a problem, the fact that I can't even purchase a Perma M-16 unless I'm lvl 50 I believe is crazy.  Sure, I'm at the levels where I could get a 30-day one...however that's still nearly 70k gold.\n\nOverall, the game is fun, but the Cost, RNG, Grind just completely detracts away from the game, and reasons why their is not a platter of people playing this game any longer.  It's certainly gotten less play from when I first joined, and none of my personal friends bothered with this game after a month..they were the smart ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 19, 2015","false","328.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

Period. If people would stop trying to pick apart every last line of data on weapons that you can get here or there, in a silly attempt to prove P2W, then there might actually be some enjoyment to be had with this gem.\n\nTruth with P2W is this: You're all leeches. You're a waste of space in the gaming community. Nobody cares if you're a teenage twit with no money and want everything spoon fed to you. People that make these games deserve to make money. What they Do Not deserve OR need is the atypical ♥♥♥♥♥ ranter crying about a game he has to invest a few bucks in to be 'competitive' with everyone else that does.\nTo make it clear; replace every instance of 'P2W' with 'limited free trial' and gtfo with all the 'gimme' crap. I hope dev's finally get tired of all the baby whiners and kill off free to play gaming all together, get us back to the days of paying for what you get, instead of uneducated internet children trying to justify ->robbery<- against the wonderful programmers that decided our enjoyment was a way of life for them.\n\nFree to play... if you enjoy the game good. If you feel you need to pay to enjoy and have a problem paying into a game, then leave. Simple as that. You're not wanted anywhere in gaming. You don't contribute in any way.\n\nZMR is great for a lot of hours, community isn't bad, lot of people that aren't 'pro' yet. Expert level can be done just fine by free gamers, nightmare you will want to have a Lot of hours invested (or lucky hits on bullets) or drop $20 and make it easier, up to you. It's primarily a PVE game but the PVP is good fun too. You get to kill a T-REX while he launches rockets at your face and hammers you with a gatt.

For what it is, this is not a bad game.   But it fails to be innovative enough to last. The cash shop is obismal at best and the maps are way too small.  However it is well optomized and not many bugs and for that I will give them credit.  I will not be playing this game because I'm not much into wave based gameplay.  Had this been either much larger maps I might have played a little longer but still would have lost interest.  I would love to see these developers make an MMO with the same game mechanics. Take Secret World setting, add these shooting mechanics, add a decently diverse class system and there you might have a game. I'll throw it a thumbs up just for the kudos at it being a solid game with little bugs.

Overall though I like ZMR, it gets alot of stuff right, It plays like Gear of War, probably because it is made by Yingpei games, formerly Epic Games China. In the game there are a variety of game modes, both pve and pvp, the pve parts of the game have you fighting various types of badguys, the aforementioned zombies monsters and robots, in a variety of game modes including objective and horde survival styled game modes.
