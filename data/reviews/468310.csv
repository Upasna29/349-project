You play as a guy called Max\nthat has annoyed his cat with the normal things cats gets annoyed about (Pushed of the bed, Sprayed them with water when they misbehaved ect.. ect..)\nand now the cat is out for revenge and wants to put an end to Max by placing loads of traps to stop you throughout the level you have to complete\n\n\nHow Does The Game Play?\nThe gameplay is very fun and ultra addicting! It´s a short game with only 10 levels but does get harder and harder to closer you get to finishing it!\nThere is good replay value too since they have added a feature that if you complete a level without dying you get a golden frame around your precious cat photos! (Who wouldn´t want that??)\nThe game can be played with both Keyboard and Controller so you can use whatever you feel comfortable with!\n\n\nPros & Cons\nPros:\nVery addicting Gameplay!\nNice graphics considering the game style (Side Scroller Platformer)\nExtremely awesome music that intereacts with the game is a really nice way! (stops playing when you die ect.. ect..)\nController Support if you have one.\nA really fun character customisation that you unlock parts to everytime you complete a level (You can be everything from a cat lover to a badass killing machine with a skirt!)\nTakes no time at all to download/Install so the minute you buy it you pay it pretty much! (Currently only 30Mb)\n\n\nCons:\nCurrently there is no options menu so you can´t turn down the music (Headphones warning)\nCan be really fustrating at times so there´s a real hazard for a broken keyboard.\nMight be a bit pricy for some people\n\nConclusion & Gameplay\nShe Wants Me Dead  is an overall really good game that really makes you feel like you achomplished something even when just getting to a new checkpoint.\nAs said in the  Pros  the game doesn´t require that much space on your harddrive and could even fit on a flash drive so you can take it with you to other PCs (Requires you to log into steam ofc)\nAnother really nice thing is that this game is one of those games you can start and stop whenever you feel like it! So it´s the perfect game for when the class gets boring or if you have a few minutes to play.\nFor the guys that find this game a bit of the pricy side i would really recommend picking it up when it goes on sale!\nOverall i would give it 8/10 for what it is.\n\nIf you want to see some hands on gameplay before you spend your hard earned cash then check out my letsplay of it down below!:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=686162377","May 16","true","1.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","18","19","3","4"

She's placed a load of traps and other things to stop him progressing through the levels.\n\nHow The Game Plays\nThe gameplay is very good, it's a short game which took me less than 2 hours to complete from start to finish. There's 10 levels in total and if you're good enough to complete a level without dying you'll get a golden frame for that level. You can use either keyboard or controller (it's a lot easier with controller) you start off with a very easy level which is more like a tutorial and then it becomes more and more challenging as you progress through the game.\n\nPros & Cons\nPros:\nController support (you can't use controller in the menus)\nGood music and the game actually plays to the beat of the music\nVery addicting\nGood graphics\nCool character customisation (you can dress Max up in a tutu and\nhigh heels and have him hold glow sticks)\n\nCons:\nNo way to turn down the game sound\nA little bit overpriced for what the game is in my opinion\nThis isn't really a con but this game can be very rage inducing, you\nneed to be patient with it\n\nFinal Verdict & Gameplay\nOverall this is a cool game that's quite short so it shouldn't take long to complete and you feel accomplished when you do complete it, it could be used as a game to play when you have 10 minutes spare. You must be patient with it because it becomes very frustrating when you struggle on a level. I would say pick this game up when it's on sale, I personally don't think it's worth the full price and even on sale still seems a little bit overpriced.\n\nIf you're stuck or just want to see some gameplay before you buy the game, check out my walkthrough on YouTube:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LbDe-Juk92s","May 15","true","1.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

There is a legit 1 second delay to each command including just moving forward, which in inexcusable in a game that is asking for precise jumps and timing with fast moving spikes.","May 17","false","0.5"," 3 of 20 people (15%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","15","3","20","2","1"
