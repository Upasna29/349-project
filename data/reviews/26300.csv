The enemies also have zero AI and their tactics consist of either standing still and shooting or charging at you like kamikaze soldiers.\nIt's as if someone remade a low budget FPS game from the Playstation 2 in the Cry Engine.\n\nNot very good.\nBuy a sandwich instead.\n2/10.","March 9, 2014","false","0.9"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","25","28","4","0"

I booted up a server to try it but it wouldn't let me start without a secound player. I don't know another person who owns this game luckily but at least I got a good glimpse of the nice textures that were flashing white and stretching into the sky all across the map.\n\nThere are seven weapons, none of which feel satisfying or fun to use on any of the bullet-sponge enemy varieties (there are two; the big dudes who take about three times too many bullets or punches to kill and have awful hitboxes and then there are the armoured kind of those guys). Some weapons lack the functionality they are described as having (looking at you, "Radio Frier"). The single-player campaign ends in an unwaranted cliffhanger and has three maps in total, all of which are near-impossible to navigate because everything looks the same and it's like the developers went out of their way to make sure that the way you're supposed to go is placed in the LEAST intuitive place possible.\n\nThe voice-acting is atrocious, the story is awful, the graphics are admittedly not terrible (aside from character models and character animations) but they're buggy instead. The framerate is horrible and inconsistent. The game crashes both regularly and irregularly.\n\nThere are maybe four songs in total that repeat throughout the entire game (when it isn't being completely silent aside from that one enemy that fell through the floor and is now shooting you from outside of the map) and yet if you asked me to hum one of them, I couldn't. They figured out how to put the least possible effort into creating the songs while making sure they still qualified as music somehow. Many things in the game lack sound effects entirely and the existing sound effects will only play at random occasions. An enemy can walk up to you from behind and start beating/shooting you in your back and you will have no idea until your screen turns red because no sound is playing at all.\n\nDon't buy this game for any reason except maybe if you're a hardcore masochist, in which case you'd still have more fun wedging hot needles under your thumbnails.","January 11, 2014","false","2.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","5"

When it launched, it was titled 'Merchants of Brooklyn.' They actually changed the name months later in an attempt to hide from the word-of-mouth the game had generated.
