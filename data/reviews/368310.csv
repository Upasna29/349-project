The levels are very well designed and creative, the difficulty is moderate but fair, and the challenge modes are actually challenging. Definitely recommended for fans of marble games and I think most casual gamers would find it fun as well.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead my full review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","August 18, 2015","true","2.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Once you've obtained them all, you need to then roll into the final giant star to complete the level. The game has decent replay value due to the fact that you earn different medals according to how fast you complete levels.\n\nYou can rotate the levels completely freely in any direction with the mouse button, which makes for some really funny moments. If you want, you can flip the entire level upside down, and roll around. Many times secret marbles are hidden here, that once collected, you can use in future levels.\n\nLevels are pretty varied, and have a lot of fun obstacles to overcome. The music also fits the game well, and is a nice accompaniment to the rest of the game.\n\nOverall, a really fun, simple game!","August 14, 2015","true","4.7"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

The marble barely responds to the mouse moving the platforms; it's absolutely embarrassing how hard it is just to make the marble collect one star. I also disliked the full 180 degree turn the camera makes if you make an attempt to look at the levels better, so essentially you only get two distinct angles of view. And even then when you flip the camera it spins around so quickly that you barely have any time to re-adjust the angle of the floor before the marble goes careening off the edge. The marble itself is painfully sluggish, and with how strict the medal times are it grates on you very quickly and you just want the marble move faster.\n\nOverall there's just no fluent control of the game; it doesn't feel the least bit polished in comparison to games like Monkey Ball, and it succeeds very well in ruining the immerson of the game completely. This game set a personal, land-speed record for me of "Fastest Game Refunded." I cannot recommend this game, at all.","August 21, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I like all the textures and the marbles are cool. Collecting them all is really fun. The music is enjoyable and adds to the gameplay too. The levels have a progression that teaches you how to control the ball so that if you fly off the board you can save the ball by landing back on the course.","December 29, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The price by default is a little steep, so if you get it I'd recommend getting it on sale. The gameplay reminded me of Marble Saga: Kororinpa for the Wii, and that pretty much sold the game for me. Controls very similar to that game as well, gave some nostalgia. After you clear all the levels, you get a level creator that I think could benefit a lot more from Steam Workshop integration. Lots of fun mechanics and levels, especially the last world.","May 4","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
