In fact, it's the same MacGyver-esque plot device that Valve resorted to when they created the Perpetual Testing Initiative story for Portal 2. Mere coincidence????\n\n... Okay, setting aside the fanman sarcasm, Peggle Extreme is really fun, mildly replayable, and worth trying if you're ever... bored, I suppose.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/3483/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Peggle Extreme is a variant of Peggle (Deluxe) from Popcap Games. It was offered with the Orange Box and it's not really a surprise: Popcap Games is also using Steam (mandatory when playing the Orange Box on PC) for broadcasting games made by them.\n\nThe story of Peggle Extreme is simple: you have to defend the Peggle Institute from invaders during 10 levels. Let me explain the gameplay. You have peggles on your screen. Peggles are these points or rectangles with different colors. Blue ones are the basic peggle, the orange ones are the ones you have to eliminate, the green ones are the speciality from your guide (in PE, it's only Bjorn the Unicorn and the fact that he can show the trajectory of your ball) and the rose one are point boosts and are chosen randomly when launching a new ball. The goal is to launch a ball and eliminate a maximum of peggles. I mean, with ten balls, you've had to eliminate every orange peggle, others being point bonuses. You have a bucket moving at the bottom and you can earn a free ball if the one currently launched falls into it.\n\nYou can also earn free balls by reaching a certain score with one ball during its play. The first step is 25.000 points. Also, you have the fevermeter. When reaching the X2, X3, etc., it increases the points tied to peggles: for example, a blue one that brings 10 points when touched is bringing 20 points when touched when your fevermeter indicates X2. And it's valid during all the level. There are also special bonuses like the long shot (touching two peegles far away from each other) or the lucky bounce (the ball touches the bucket, is bouncing and then falls into it. If it don't fall into it, the lucky bounce is missed). If your ball falls into the void without touching a peggle, you will have a coin with Free Ball or No Ball appearing. It's randomly, so, you can only pray that you'll have a second chance. That's only a view of the bonuses existing (you have extreme slide, orange attack, etc..). When finishing a level, the bucket disappeared and five special bonuses appear: 10.000 at the far left and far right, 50.000 for the two others and for the middle, it's 100.000 points. Note that if you clean your screen of all the peggles, you're unlocking Ultra Extreme Fever and all the five voids bring 100.000 points.\n\nYou have also special features for the duel mode: -25% of your points if the ball doesn't touch a peggle and falls directly in the void or in the bucket for example.\n\nThe backgrounds are customized to the Orange Box games with Peggle Masters appearing in it. Half-Life 2 Episode 2 is represented by a Vortigaunt attacking a Peggle Master, a Headcrab, a Hunter. Team Fortress is symbolized by an Heavy with a Peggle Master, a sentry build by an Engineer, a Pyro pursuing a Peggle Master and a BOOM! probably taken from a trailer. Portal is more interesting by the fact that you have portals that change the location of your ball. You have the lovely turret and the Weighed Companion Cube. Every game is featuring the voice of characters appearing in it. For HL2E2, it didn't really let a trace in my brain but for TF2, you have the voice from the Heavy, like the "You did well!". For Portal, it's our dear psycho Glados.\n\nAs you can suppose, graphics are simple, not really complicated and very cartoonish for the Peggle Masters. Backgrounds are more similar to the original graphics of the game than being cartooned. Soundtrack is also perfect.\n\nThe different modes are also challenging. Duel Mode is made for playing alone against the computer or for playing with a friend. Adventure Mode is the solo campaign. The Quick Mission is for playing unlocked levels and the Challenge Mode is for people liking Challenge. It's a sort of Bonus Map like in Portal: you have to beat the challenge for gaining the title of Peggle Master for the level: clean all the peggles, reach a certain high score: 300.000 for example, eliminate all the orange peggles (the classic gameplay). I can guarantee you that reaching a high score is easier than trying to clean your screen. Currently, I'm a Peggle Master in each level, the last title is the cleaning of the first level with the Vort.\n\nPeggle Extreme isn't suffering from flaws, apart the shortness of the game, being a product designed for the Orange Box and the fact that you will not beat every level at your first try. Believe me, you'll find the BOOM! and the sentry levels very challenging. And wait to see the level from Portal and its three parts you can only access by taking portals.\n\nAnyway, for me, this game is really enjoyable, if you don't try this, you don't know what you're missing. I mean, if you can afford the Orange Box or if you can buy on Steam. Peggle Extreme is probably one of the best casual games I've played and I'll admit it: seeing G-Man as the sun or Bjorn with a Headcrab is something that HL fans can't miss. Anyway, I'll recommend it. It's fun, very easy to understand and enjoyable.","November 25, 2010","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I assumed that it would be something like Glados mocking you, or the unicorn staring at a head crab. But instead I saw background with the Peggle Masters being set on fire! You'd imagine my surprise at the title screen! I actually got scared. I thought you would be able to play as Glados on a Portal themed level, maybe even the offer of cake. But, I seriously can't look past that title screen. Was the gore really necessary? Couldn't you have  the unicorn stand next to a companion cube or the characters be allies rather than intruders. The gameplay is the same as Paggle with the only change being the backgrounds and using Portals for 2 or 3 levels. Anyway, it's worth a try just expect SOME surprises and not an actual team up. More like a cameo apperance. Anyway, thats my 2 cents","December 4, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not helping matters is this free ten-level version, Peggle Extreme, released in 2007 to promote both Peggle and The Orange Box.  Previously, only people who purchased The Orange Box had access to Extreme, but now this darkly hilarious crossover on the happy-go-lucky world of Peggle is free for everyone.\n\nAnd if that's not enough for you, they also made a free version of Peggle to promote World of Warcraft (specifically, Wrath of the Lich King).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpthecursed/recommended/3483/","jpthecursed","JP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpthecursed/","59 products in account","Ever wondered what Peggle would be like as an action game? Now's your chance.\n\nFor those who don't know, Peggle is an arcade-style game, by PopCap Games, in which the player shoots balls at pegs littering the screen, the goal being to hit all the orange pegs. It's a very easy-going game, with simple graphics and music. Which is why it's surprising that Peggle Extreme exists.\n\nPeggle Extreme takes the classic Peggle gameplay and juxtaposes it with imagery and sounds from Valve's The Orange Box. It's kinda weird to see such a laid-back game crossing over with the likes of Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, and Portal, especially since the music is the same easy-listening cheese found in the original Peggle. But the gameplay remains intact, and it's well worth downloading, since you don't have to pay for it.\n\nIt only comes with 10 levels and one instructor (Bjorn the unicorn), but there are also five challenges that you can try out. It's a pretty short game, but if you're already a fan, or you've never played any game in the series, this is a great little spin-off to get, especially for free.\n\n7 out of 10.","December 9, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a way it is like a demo, with only 10 levels and 5 challenges to complete. On the other hand, a demo features gameplay from the actual game, whereas 'Peggle Extreme' features never-before-seen gameplay, not seen in the original 'Peggle'. Keep in mind, of course, that this game, 'Peggle Extreme' is free so you won't pay a cent, but with so little amount of gameplay, you can be done in possibly  around 1 hr 30 min, and the only way to get more gameplay is to buy Peggle (which I also recommend, if you like this game). Even though, at some points, it feels like a giant advertisement to the original game 'Peggle', you can still get free entertainment with content that isn't in Peggle, and the cross-over with Valve is very interesting.","March 30, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a way it is like a demo, with only 10 levels and 5 challenges to complete. On the other hand, a demo features gameplay from the actual game, whereas 'Peggle Extreme' features never-before-seen gameplay, not seen in the original 'Peggle'. Keep in mind, of course, that this game, 'Peggle Extreme' is free so you won't pay a cent, but with so little amount of gameplay, you can be done in possibly  around 1 hr 30 min, and the only way to get more gameplay is to buy Peggle (which I also recommend, if you like this game). Even though, at some points, it feels like a giant advertisement to the original game 'Peggle', you can still get free entertainment with content that isn't in Peggle, and the cross-over with Valve is very interesting.","March 30, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/3483/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Peggle is one of those shareware games that were quite a big thing few years ago, with wacky likeable graphic and simple gameplay, all to fit for the tastes of the wide audience of casual gamers (For example, your mom). And Peggle Extreme goes even more wacky, being a free promotional demo-version with levels taking place in universe of Valve's Orange Box games, with unicorn being the only available character. (who has his head being eaten by headcrab at title screen, scaring some part of casual audience away)\n\nIt's a completely free single player game that includes 10 exclusive levels, as been said, as well as hard 5 challenge levels for people who mastered peggle gameplay, as well as duel, with local multiplayer, where players take turns in shooting ball out. Nope, no Internet multiplayer there.\n\nIt should give you a good taste at what Peggle games are about. The gameplay was inspired by Pachinko games and been made just a bit more skill-based, while still having to guess where the ball will ricochet off. You take control of the cannon on top of screen and shoot uncontrollable ball in direction you choose, after which you are left hoping to get lucky to hit more orange pegs than just one.  You still can try to measure the timing, to get lucky to have your ball fall into basket, giving it back for free, or get one more ball by scoring a as many pegs and bonuses as possible. Out of all the pegs, orange ones, that are randomly chosen each time, are the only ones that you are required to hit to beat the level.\n\nGraphics are random simple 2D cuteness and just randomness, and music is forgetable, aside from use of classic here and there.\n\nAlso, I don't think that it uses any of Steam features, I couldn't even bring up the Steam Overlay. Good thing this game is alt+tab friendly.\n\nPersonally, I think that this game is too much based on luck/guessing/measuring-like-a-robot, but since it's free, you should try it and decide for yourself.","January 5, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And Peggle Extreme goes even more wacky, being a free promotional demo-version with levels taking place in universe of Valve's Orange Box games, with unicorn being the only available character. (who has his head being eaten by headcrab at title screen, scaring some part of casual audience away)\n\nIt's a completely free single player game that includes 10 exclusive levels, as been said, as well as hard 5 challenge levels for people who mastered peggle gameplay, as well as duel, with local multiplayer, where players take turns in shooting ball out. Nope, no Internet multiplayer there.\n\nIt should give you a good taste at what Peggle games are about. The gameplay was inspired by Pachinko games and been made just a bit more skill-based, while still having to guess where the ball will ricochet off. You take control of the cannon on top of screen and shoot uncontrollable ball in direction you choose, after which you are left hoping to get lucky to hit more orange pegs than just one.  You still can try to measure the timing, to get lucky to have your ball fall into basket, giving it back for free, or get one more ball by scoring a as many pegs and bonuses as possible. Out of all the pegs, orange ones, that are randomly chosen each time, are the only ones that you are required to hit to beat the level.\n\nGraphics are random simple 2D cuteness and just randomness, and music is forgetable, aside from use of classic here and there.\n\nAlso, I don't think that it uses any of Steam features, I couldn't even bring up the Steam Overlay.

This version does not hold as many levels as Peggle Deluxe offers but the replayability more than makes up for it. This is a game that can easily be played for a few minutes on the backburner while other tasks take the forefront of your attention. The graphical options are substandard, while the control in gameplay is top-notch.
