Plays much like the Panzer General/Panzer Corps series, but with much thought and improvements to naval and air power.  Anyone familiar with Slitherine's Afrika Korps expansion to Panzer Corps will see similarities in the linear campaign pathing and mid-scenario events.\n\nGameplay is tactical in an operational environment, meaning your units do not represent combined arms brigades, rather pure all-tank, all-infantry, or all-artillery type units.  This is for fun and has a "beer and pretzels" aspect to the gaming.  On the macro picture (strategically), the game is pretty realistic, however.\n\nThe player must strike a balance between caution and deadlines to reach objectives.  Move in too fast and you will encounter ambushes.  Too methodical and you will run out of time.  This is not the cakewalk of the Panzer General series, and every scenario can be lost if the player is reckless.\n\nAlso, scenarios are long, as in epic.  Some are 60 turns, I think one may have been 100 turns.  100 turns!\n\nOverall, a great game with solid replay value.","June 5, 2015","true","251.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Supply lines play a very important role. Navy battles are a lot of fun and look great. Artistocrats have done a great job improving upon Panzer Corps. If you like Panzer Corps it is safe to say you'll like OOB: Pacific. Oh and the graphics look really nice for a turn based wargame. I usually wait for games to go on sale before I buy. Not with OOB: Pacific. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you Artistocrats! I look forward for your next project.\n\nUpdate: I just posted a tutorial video on YouTube.

There are some really cool new features that make the feeling very different. For instance supply is based on a general system of controlled towns and supply ships, not individually anymore. Combined with "borders" of your territory a quick push into enemy territory feels and plays much different now.\nPlus units now have command points (bigger units more command points) and you have to choose which units to bring to a battle - divided into land-, sea- and air-units. That makes it impossible to play killer-airplanes all the time.\nI personally like the bigger share of naval units and major sea battles.\n\nOn the downside the AI is still struggling with human intelligence. Carrier based bombers fly without fighter cover (often the fighter plane is there, but two hexes apart), enemy offensives are easily stalled by cleaverly placed mines etc. To benefit the AI it seems that FOW does not really apply to its units. So enemy planes will most often kill off heavily damaged squadrons in the fog and the AI never walks into mines.\n\nThere are two campaigns - US and Japan - with only one path. No more major and minor victories which change the course of war, but secondary war goals that generate boni like commanders, extra-resources and weaker enemies in the future. I like that approach cause I played for decisive vics anyways. Especially the US-campaing plays quite easy in the end - maybe turn the difficulty up.\nCommanders (heroes) are less powerful than in "Panzer Corps" and can be re-assigned, injured and made POW.\n\nI like the little black-and-white photos of events during battles and on the campaign map. Gives the game more feeling.\n\nI can recommend this game to every fan of turn-based grand-strategy games. There are some minor bugs, but these donÂ´t feel to bad. Curious to try out the multiplayer mode. Semper Fi!","January 19","true","73.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I went back to Panzer Corp and after adjusting to some of the rule changes again just rolled there. The PzC/PG games that I enjoyed seem quick and less fun. There is no blowing up 7 plus strength in one shot, well except for a nuke at the end! It take more thought to break through. Supply/efficiency is very important. One scenario in the campaign will easily take an hour or two. The Battle of Britain free mod was fun. I highly recommend it. 9/10 now.\n\nORIGINAL\n\nIt has the base in the old panzer general/panzer corp with some new concepts of supply, commanders and efficiency. It is fun for what it is, a beer and pretzel game. I am probably biased because I loved the Pacific theater. I would love a deeper campaign tree, but I really can't argue with the unit database. Choosing which units to buy when they could possibly be not able to be used in other scenarios makes you think twice at times.\n\nAre there some issues? Sure, but it is a solid start. I look forward to the next patch or two to tweak some things and future DLC.","May 7, 2015","true","191.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Graphics are precise and attractive without being the reason for the game entirely.  The AI does a suitable job so far (only a few hours played, it may get stickier).  I've enjoyed the turn based but still pacey gameplay, and the mechanics are simple and effective.  This manages to combine different branches of the military together well, and I find the control point mechanic - which limits the number of units you can have on the map by military branch - very effective in forcing different strategies upon you but not leaving you feeling railroaded.

Instead I will review this game based on its own merits.\n\nTL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Order of Battle: Pacific is a Turn-Based Strategy Game (TBS) developed by The Aristocrats and published by Slitherine Ltd. It features the classical hex-based gameplay with a dynamic campaign mechanic and technology system that changes depending on player choices and game style.\n\nPlay either as the US-led Allied Powers in their desperate attempt to fend off the invading Japanese Empire and liberate the lost Allied territories or, on the other hand, play as Imperial Japan and alter the course of history as you lead it to ultimate victory over the Pacific theater of World War II.\n\nPROS:+ Graphics and art style is well suited for the genre\n+ Streamlined gameplay but with enough complexity on the game mechanic to give it depth such as, but not limited to:\nSupply Chains\nFlanking\nTerrain difficulties\nUnit Fatigue\nUnit Experience and Reinforcement mechanic\n'Digging-in' / Unit Fortification\nRange Penalties (for ships)\nManeuvers and Evasion system (for ships)\nFuel system (for planes)+ Lengthy campaign time for both the Japanese and the Allies\n+ Dynamic campaign with secondary objectives that yields both benefits and consequences on the up-coming battles\n+ Unit variation with different skills and attributes\n+ Satisfying naval combat\n+ Relatively accurate historical campaign scenarios\n+ Hotseat multiplayer support\n\nCONS:- AI has suicidal tendencies such as, but not limited to: (Note: I played on Difficulty 3 on my first playthrough and 4 on my second)\nForcing 1 health units back to into battle where perfectly healthy units could have taken its place\nNot reinforcing wounded units\nAbandoning tactically advantageous / well entrenched positions- Bug that causes substantial FPS drop after the AI's turn (solved by simply saving and loading)\n- Limited hotkeys\n- Multiplayer is limited to 2 vs 2\n- Tutorial is a bit lacking in information (though it was presented in a really good fashion)\n- No Godzilla unit if you're playing as Japan\n\nNEUTRAL:-/+ No undo button (the game will require you to think before you act. 'Touch-move' as it is called in chess)\n-/+ No voice acting during the campaign briefing.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes highly RECOMMENDED for strategy fans and World War II game fans.  Order of Battle: Pacific is a deep hex-based strategy game that features a lot of strategic and tactical complexity that results in a satisfying experience.\n\nI can RECOMMEND this game even at full price since the $39.99 or your regional equivalent price tag is well worth the game time it gives you, however, if you feel that the price is too steep, then wait for a SALE and purchase it if the price goes down to $29.99 or your regional equivalent.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike our Reviews?

For fans of that series, please do read those other excellent reviews. In my review, I'll attempt to cater to World War II history buffs out there, who have not tried any of the Panzer General titles, but are likely fans of the more mainstream Sid Meier's Civilization V.\n\nAs  a Civ V fan and someone who has always been fascinated by World War II, I love Order of Battle: Pacific because it takes the best elements of the excellent combat system in Civ V, and enhances that experience further with certain mechanics that we all wish we could have had in Civ V. By the way, did I mention that this game focuses on WWII? And did I mention that this game is set in the Pacific Theatre of Operations -- a theatre largely (and sadly) ignored in the World War II game genre?\n\nHere is a list of some of the major, familiar combat mechanics common with Civ V that contribute to this excellent simulation:\nHex-based (making maneuvering and placement an important element of your strategy)\nEffects on terrain on movement, cover, defense, efficiency, line-of-sight, etc.\nUnit stacking rules\nFlanking bonuses/penalties\nSimulation of embarkation, disembarkation, river crossings\nSupporting fire from nearby units\nZone of control...and here is a list of some of the major combat mechanics we wish we had in Civ V that further enhance the overall experience:\nHEXES CAN BE CAPTURED! (true Civ V fans know what this is about)\nA well-simulated supply mehcanic/system (and unique rules for land, air and sea to boot)... and caputred hexes come into play here as well!!!\nThe effect of supply accesibility on units' combat efficiency\nMines can be laid (and can affect everyone, even the original mine-layer)\nMore evident effects of entrenchment\nMovement affects efficiency\nA service/combat history log for individual units!\nUnit renaming and personalization\nSpecial rules for special forces/recon units\n...and many more!In summary, for those of you who loved the combat system of Civ V, but have also been craving a game where you could just focus on combat strategy (and World War II strategy at that), this is the game for you. The added combat elements and mechanics enhance the overall experience even further, and make this game a must buy for World War II history buffs and turn-based strategy game fans out there.\n\nDon't get turned off by the (seemingly) steep price tag on this game, it is well worth the money you will pay.","September 20, 2015","true","8.2"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","42","45","2","0"

I have been playing war games for a very long time now, {over 25 years} and I can honestly say that this gamr, Order of Battel: Pacific, is the pinnacle of turn based strategy games for the WWII era. All of the best features of the Panzer General/Pacific General series can be found here all rolled into one nice little package. I have always loved turn based war games, but found that you usually got your choice between great land battles with awesome units, and a smattering of small sea skirmishes with wimpy naval and air units {Panzer Corp/Steel Panthers} or you go heavy on the Naval units with token land battles and very basic infatry/tanks {Pacific General}. In Order of Battle:Pacific you get both: great land combat representation AND a killer Naval/Air Corp to compliment your force of ground fighters. With over 550 units represented, fans of Army, Navy, and Air corps war games are sure to find something to love.\n\nAll core units level up and stand a chance of gaining a commander through a random chance generator {ala Panzer General}. I like that, I always have where war games are concerned. It gives you a feeling of story and a real attachment to certrain units as they level and gain heroes/commanders. It's the hallmark of good game design and programming like this that really puts you into the game and makes you feel like you are a part of the story and not just watching it unfold. OoB:P really shines in this area. Also, they have made some long over due improvesments to TBS wargaming.\n\nFor one thing, after you have clicked on a unit and ordered it to attack an enemy unit, you no longer need to wait for the graphic of battle to play out before moving onto another unit and another battle. Simply click and battle as fast as you like! And the sound FX are AMAZING! They will maintain the current battle noises AND incorporate all other ongoing battle noises as you go! At one point, i had artillery, tanks, infantry AND a dog fight involving a Navy Wildcat vs. Japanese Zero all being rendered at the same time! It truly sounded like a battle was taking place. Also, the sound FX for each type of unit are different according to the seperat specs of the unit. An allied Bearcat sound different that a Wildcat, and a Zero sound different that a Corsair. Even the bomber sound different than each other. so do the engine sound of a destroyer, cruiser, and battleship. They are all different! I dont know who did this, but it must have been a massive effort. And it is just another reason OoB:P draws you into the story so completely.\n\nFinally, there is one really nice touch that will appeals to WWII historians like myself: anniversary DLC. On the dates of some important WWII events, OoB:P will release anniversary campaigns to be played comemorating the event. The most recent being the Battle of Britain. At this time, I have not played this expansion, but feel confident it will be up to the same high standards as the rest of the games content.\n\nOverall, as I have already stated, Order of Battle: Pacific is the pinnacle of WWII turn based strategy gaming. A true Grandslam homerun for The Aristocrats and Slitherine Ltd. Well done my friends, well done indeed.\n","September 29, 2015","true","321.9"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","36","38","2","3"

It wasn't until I saw the Morning Sun expansion, which involves the Japanese invasion of the Chinese Mainland, that I realized I need to play these games. I have not regretted one, single hour. Order of Battle is a wargame in the same vein as the Panzer Corps games so veterans will feel right at home reqqing in troops and trying to overcome superior AI to complete objectives that vary from Defend these Points, Wipe out this many units or simply take these cities. You have control of an absolutely ludicrous amount of units for each faction which allows you to customize your force, from battle to battle, in whatever way you choose. Are you more of an Air General who likes to command squadrons of aircraft to bomb enemy positions and maintain air superiority or are you a more aggressive general who focuses on overwhelming tank assaults to capture objectives? I'm personally the latter. In all seriousness, the unit variation between each playable faction is downright impressive. If you've played WH40k: Arma, you're probably familiar with what I'm talking about and it should be said, the unit variation is one of this game's best features. I also love the focus of the expansion being in the rather ignored Japanese Invasion of China before and during WW2. This allows the devs to really bring a more unique view to WW2, especially since you play as the Japanese.\n\nOrder of Battle: Pacific also features a completely new and updated graphics engine that is full of great animations, burning tank/plane carcasses as battles drag on. This is a huge improvement for me over Armageddon because the animations really bring the battles to life. What's better, if you're not a fan of it, you can even switch to a more classic 2D mode through the options menu. There is also a campaign in the game which is were you'll be spending a majority of your time. The campaign doesn't really allow you to choose where to fight except in a few rare occasions, it's more of a mission to mission set up. However, units are persistent and units depleted at the end of the last mission will be depleted at the start of the new mission but will also be more effective than just requisitioning inexperienced units.\n\nI only have two complaints in regards to the game. The first being, some of the missions feel like they drag on for far too long. For example, the first mission in the American campaign was kind of drag and it might be because Pearl Harbor isn't exactly untread territory. It also feels like that the AI calculations can eat up large portions of time inbetween turns and this feels like it lengthens a missions required completion time to double. Some may find that to be a negligible complaint but for me, it's a really nagging one.\n\nIn summary, this is a blast of game and I'm glad I got the chance to experience it! I truly cannot wait to see what other expansions are released for it. I wouldn't mind seeing some more "What-if?" scenarios either.\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-lgQjaRzKU","February 4","true","12.5"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","36","41","8","0"

It's basically Panzer General in the Pacific with better graphics AND:\n\n-Generals with abilities that affect the unit it is attached to and those around him. You can switch which unit he is attached to at the beginning of each scenario.\n-Specializations that you can unlock\n-More random events\n-choose which objectives to pursue from a predetermined list at the start of each scenario. You can gain cool abilities from some of them and cripple the opposing army, but   you won't always be able to complete them all. You will have to make tough choices as to which objectives you want to (or can) complete.\n-Much needed supply line mechanic\n-More strategic air and sea battles. I'm just diving in, but can tell you that there are slight variations in the mechanics of different units and situations that add to the strategy.\n\nI was initially concerned about the length of the game, but can happily report that I'm only into the third mission of the training campaign and already have enjoyed several hours of play time.\n\n\nIt really is a nice game and right up my, "point and click/ strategy" alley. It keeps to a successful formula and builds on it. Like Panzer General and Panzer Commander before it, you can:\n\n-carry over units from one mission to the next (including their damage/kill stats).\n-gain veterency and upgrade units\n-attach generals with special abilities (in Panzer General you gained a random hero, which would attach himself to a unit who gained veterency. But the hero would be stuck to that unit. You couldn't reassign him like you can a general/captain/ace in this game).\n\n\nThe only downside is the price for a game like this. While other Indie houses are charging around 20 bucks for similar titles, The Artistocrats are partnered with Slitherine. This means a chunk of the profits have to be split with another party; thus the higher price point. Unfortunately, this means that this really solid game won't reach as many people who haven't played this type of game before...at least anytime soon. They will all wait until this dips to about 20 bucks.  By then, development on a new game will be underway and the funds needed for future updates and dlc won't be as great.

I'm a super fan of Panzer Corps with over 400 hours of play.  This game on the other hand, which should be similar is not very good.  The AI is ridiculously non-existant and should be called artificial non-intelligence.  The enemy litterally dosen't respond to weak points in your lines, it just plods on to objectives and does so poorly. You can easily just sit out of sight range and destroy carriers and ships with little reaction by the enemy. The game does allow you to change the difficulty level, but that doesn't change the AI, it just give them better combat multipliers to cause more and take less damage.\n\nOther issues I've encountered:\n- The amount of battles to gain any XP to improve your units has little effect through most of the campaign.\n- Recon units don't gain XP.\n- Tactical bombers lay waste to ships, but do little to nothing against just about everything else.\n- You are placed in situations where they have a large amount of slots for units to control, but you have don't have the money to buy even close to enough units to use the slots (early on in the campaign).\n- damaged ships dont fight at reduced capabilty, ie why should a BB or CV with 1 hp, be able to perform everything a ship at full health can?\n\nI have only played the campaigns as thats what I bought the game for so maybe the AI is better in the scenarios.\n\nBugs:\n- US engineers destroy a bridge and the game locks up. I've actually had the Japanese campaign not respond after winning scenarios and it requires you to restart the whole campaign, only to have it do the same thing later in the campaign.\n- Land planes on ship and when they take off the unit is flying around, but a ghost of the unit takes up a spot on any carrier it lands on taking up aircraft space.\n\nI really want to love this game, but it seems to me like it's still in Beta.","September 19, 2015","false","72.5"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","40","53","0","0"

From ships sinking to planes going down, it's the little touches that are icing on the cake in this game.\n\nThe game itself stand strong on it's strategy elements, taking your army to war it's up to you on deciding how to spend your resources to get the job done. Do you spend more and build up a strong tank force, or do you put those resources into your air force - you decide.\n\nAs with the likes of Panzer Corps you take your army from one scenario to the next in the campaign, with the benefit of the unit will have increased its veterancy through combat experience. So when you lose a unit it feels like a real loss and not simply cannon fodder (which arguably is closer to the actual WWII treatment of the common soldier).\n\nThe interface is clean and friendly, the devs are responsive and actively fix bugs and if you are willing to put some time in to play through the tutorial you will be rewarded with a fun and satisfying gaming experience.\n\nThis game is fantastic if you are a fan of the genre, but even better if you are new and just looking for a great strategy game - Order of Battle: Pacific will scratch your itch.\n\nOverall Score:\n9.5/10\n\nThe Good:Great visuals for the genre\nStrong tutorial\nInteresting setting (Pacific War) not often explored in games\nDeep gameplay but it doesn't over complicate thingsThe Bad:\nAlthough visuals are great for the genre, newer players may find them bland\nSteep price tag (which tends to come with the genre and niche market)The Ugly:\nN/A","January 5","true","66.3"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","30","38","5","0"

I brought Panzercorps but this is way better.  I'm playing OOB nonstop. Where with Panzercorps, I play only in short burts. I especially like how Order of a Battle implemented supply. Think Unity of Command. Gone is wasting a turn to resupply in the middle of a fire fight like in Panzercorps.  It's abstracted out. As long as you keep your lines,  you are good to fight. The animations are wonderful too. You will be suprised how much enjoyment a well animated unit brings to the game over a static one. The sound is very good as well. The background ambience is well done and mixes well with the great sound effect of the battles. The two knocks are, it is light on content compared to Panzercorps (But  they just  released free dlc and more is on the way).

I played and still play a lot of fantasy turn based strategy and tactical games and was looking for some more tactical and strategical depth in my games. That way I found Slitherine's website and I warn you if you love the genre and visit their site they have much to offer.\nProblem with some of their games is that you can't start them right from the box (the digital box in my case) because they have some complex mechanism which you only learn by doing a lot of reading in their manuals.\n\nHonestly I think this title have most of the depth like in the other Slitherine games. Lot's of units stats. Lot's of different stats depending on the terrain, type of unit and flanking support. Lot's of choices not only in land units but in air and naval units as well. Commanders which you can attach to your troops and core units you can take over from mission to mission.\n\nAs I said I'm a noob with this kind of games so this review is certainly not a good review for the more experienced wargamer. But because I'm new to the games and it was so easy to get into this game I decide to write one.\nI really hope that other people like me looking for a Slitherine title and want a complex game start with this title.\nIt's really not easy. It's not a downgraded version or a casual game but it comes with a really clear tutorial and an interface as clean as the one in Panzer Corps. So it's somewhat easy to pick up for starters.\n\nThe bright map, the nice unit models and the informative interface are helping a lot to discover the depth of this game. From start you can choose two campaigns (3 actually if you choose to buy the new DLC Morning Sun released today) and can download a free offical mod DLC from within in the game if you choose to only buy the base game.\nBesides of that you find a boot camp which is a small tutiorial campaign. In this campaign you get all the advice that you need but you are free how you play the game. This is nice because you can try to do the secundary missions or just the main mission and it's not only reading and clicking but actually playing while you learn.\n\nPerformance is ok on a mediocore PC on Windows 10 (dual core, 8 GB and 2 GB AMD graphic card) when I set the graphics to normal/good. You can even use high graphics and bloom effects etc. but I found out that after finishing the mission the game lags in the menu and some textures on the unit models dissapeared when I pull the settings too high.\n\nYou can grab the first DLC for free within the game and the second DLC with a campaign where you play as Japan is between 10/15 euro which I think is acceptable because it offers a lot new units and designed (no skirmish) scenarios to play.\n\nAs the first Slitherine game I get into I'm happy with this choice and I hope they keep working on the game in the future.\nThank you for reading.","January 28","true","12.2"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","18","25","3","7"

Ok, let's talk about OoB:P. It's simply the best example of a Panzer General-type game since the original (and it may be better than those revered titles). The game is rock-solid and the production values are high (love seeing the troop animations when fighting). But that's not what makes this beer-and-pretzel wargame great. There's three things going for OoB:P that make it the gem it is.\n\n(1) Combined warfare - sea, air and land. There are so very few games that combine all 3 of these together into a workable package. Most games of this type focus on Barbarossa or Normandy where your Navy has no real application. OoB:P's focus on the Pacific allows them to focus on all 3 and they do this very well. Some scenarios are navy/air only and some are land/air only but most incorporate all 3 into one large package. As such it offers you some wonderful opportunities to work some combined arms scenarios which other games of its ilk do not.\n\n(2) Units - Not too many and not too few. Some games have an overwhelming number of units where it's difficult for the player to keep up. Others have very few units where the game is too limited. This game has a pretty fair number of units and thus you can select the ones that work with your style. My inability to effectively use anti-tank units correctly mans that I don't have to deal with those and instead I can use heavy infantry or light tanks.\n\n(3) Scenario Construction - I saved the best for last. Dear Reader, you probably already know there are many games that play similarly to OoB:P. Panzer Corps, for one, is widely recognized as a very good game. In my opinion, this is where OoB:P beats the competition. I always had a difficult time in PC because I felt the maps were too small for the number of units present. The game turns into a giant slugfest with no room for manuever and thus the scenarios become very much a puzzle and less strategic. Conversely, OoB:P's maps are quite large and there's room to move. The opportunity to flank and even attempt wide encirclements are possible. I have yet to play a scenario that felt constricting. It's the careful crafting of the scenarios that make OoB:P the great game it is.\n\nThe only real complaints from my standpoint is the lack of a branching campaign structure and no voice-overs to introduce the scenario (boring text).\n\nSimply put, go look at the hours played in the other reviews. It's not uncommon to see 100 or 200 hours played and thus the game represents a massive value for your money. I'm currently over 20 and I'm not even done with the first campaign. I could easily see myself putting in 100 hours into this great game. So if you're still reading, it's time to get off the pot - go buy this one because you won't regret it. The price may be higher than other games but what's another few bucks if you get double or triple the value (and gaming time) out of it?","December 5, 2015","true","70.1"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grimmblut/recommended/312450/","Grimmblut","Grimmblut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grimmblut/","162 products in account","Order of Battle: Pacific (OoB:P) has one advantage and one advantage alone over competing titles like Panzer Corps, Panzer General and all the other hex strategy games: The revolutionary supply system. The hex field where a unit is or moves through belongs to the player of that unit. That way you can establish areas that are under your control. If a supply source (a town or a supply ship) is within that area, then the units are in supply and can fight at their full strength. When you cut enemy units of from their supply source by moving one or more of your units through the area, that connects their area with the area of their supply source, then their effective combat strength drops radically. This gives tanks e.g. their realistic operational combat value to cut off enemy units and start a battle of encirclement and annihilation. This is great. This is what I had been waiting for in a game for decades. It opens a completely new dimension of strategy.\n\nSadly, this is the only advantage OoB:P has to offer and there are so many disadvantages that wear this great feature down.\n\nThe waiting time during the enemy's turn:\nMy PC is using an OC i5, 8 GB RAM and an SSD, along with a pretty good graphics card. The waiting time during some turns can be up to 7 minutes. Attention: I'm not talking about a situation where the enemy has 20 units in close combat with mine and needs to figure out a good tactic. I'm talking about where I can see ONE enemy unit on the map and the AI takes 7 minutes for hidden movement in the fog of war. I've read about other player's who claim to have waiting times of 20 to 30 minutes during each turn. A typical battle lasts about 25 turns, but 50 turns and more is not uncommon. To be fair, 7 minutes is, in my case, the absolute maximum. Most times the AI needs maybe a minute. But when these spikes happen, then they come in a row.\n\nPredefined tactics:\nThis is - by far - the worst. It's what made me uninstall the game. The developers obviously don't trust the players. They have a very narrow idea of how a battle should be played, e.g. in which order strategic objects should be captured, where a player should send his units and where he MUST NOT send them (or else he will be punished by, and I â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not, SPAWNING huge amount of enemy troops right before his troops to bash them back where the developers think they belong). Other means how this is enforced are, that the player may not bring specifc CORE units into battle or that he's limited to a very small force until he captures a specific location. There are very often AI controlled units in battles, that fight on your side, but which move at scripted events or times to directions that you can't influence, e.g. they wait for 15 turns and do nothing and then move to attack a small island on the map even though you've already cleared that one out. Result: You've waisted time to clear that island (which was supposed to be attacked by the AI controlled allied units - without telling you before) and now you don't have enough time left to complete the rest of the (secondary) objectives, so you have to restart the battle. Because of this, I had to restart about 3/4 of the battles that I've played. It's extremely frustrating.\n\nStupid and cheating AI:\nI could put up with the extremely long waiting times during the AI's turn if the AI was smart. But it isn't. I had moments like "Oh no, if this unit moves two hex to the southeast, then it will cut of my units." But no. Never have I witnessed one single smart move of the AI but A LOT stupid ones. The AI does two things: A) Attack the weakest unit or the one that has already taken the most damage and B) move to the closest victory location. That's it. A higher difficulty level doesn't mean a smarter AI, it just means better combat multipliers for the enemy (more damage to your units, less damage to theirs). The AI also cheats like hell, e.g. an enemy planes uses its maximum range to fly right next to one of your planes, which is at a location where it's guaranteed that the enemy has had no vision, to attack said plane. Fog of war exists only for the player.\n\nExit points on battle maps:\nThis is really the last straw. At some border locations of the map are "exit points" where you or the enemy can move units to and remove them from battle. That may sound like a good idea at first, when you have spend all your supply points but realise that you actually don't need a certain unit, so you move it to an exit point and then bring in a better unit from the reserves that helps you more in this situation. But in the campaign, these exit points are exclusively used by the AI to remove - without any need or warning - units from battle that are part of secondary objectives. Like "Shoot down 5 air plane squadrons" and after 15 turns or so, all enemy planes are suddenly "gone". The most absurd situation was when an enemy carrier literally vanished at open sea in front of three of my torpedo bomber squadrons. Secondary objective: failed. WTF??\n\nAmmunition resupply:\nThe resupply system that I've mention in the beginning is good, but it's very, very oversimplified. Your units are either in supply, or they're not. This decides whether they can fight at full strength. You don't need to supply your troops with ammunition, like in Panzer Corps or - heaven forbid! - like in Battle Isle, where you had to control supply units to bring ammo and fuel to the front. The only exception are torpedo bombers and submarines that work in a very strange way: Their torpedos simply "respawn" after a few turns. I adore the feature that let's you cut off enemy units from supply, but the rest of the supply system is oversimplified.\n\nBugs:\nI had no crashes, but several very serious bugs that forced me to reload a scenario up to eight times. I've read that other players encountered even more bugs and had several crashes.\n\nBad modability:\nIt was promoted that the game would be open to modders, but as far as I've read this isn't true. Several critical game files are only editable with unusual special software and there isn't any interface to activate mods in the game except for mods that are distributed directly by the developers.\n\nAll in all OoB:P was a huge letdown. Some problems may be fixable but the humiliating spoon-feeding regarding "what should the player do and how can we force him to do exactly that"-attitude of the developers seems to be something that can't be fixed with a patch.","May 3","false","38.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

It's a great package with depth but not crazy in-depth cryptic detail that requires you micro-manage mundane details. It has enough "stats" under the skin of an easy to approach GUI that make it a good wargame as well. No ugly or abstract counters to represent your units, either. The graphics here are quite pretty for the scale. Think of 6mm scale wargaming. It's a huge step up in terms of scope, polish, and feel from other Pacific-focused turn-based wargames I've tried over the years. I feel a bit sorry for the competition. It's also approachable even for players of RTS titles - and not just grizzled grognards (who may find this game a bit TOO pretty and approachable!).\n\nIt includes a scenario editor which I am sure I will use for Japan v. Commonwealth scenarios, though DLC is promised by the developer, we'll see. I think they made a solid game to start here, though. The campaign I've played for the Japanese so far is great, though I did dial up the difficulty one notch after the 3rd map.\n\n1. The turn-based system/engine is engaging and fun, the graphics up to par for a game of today (which is not always the case for turn-based wargames), and the sound effects are great.\n\n2. This is one of the very few games you will find that let you play Imperial Japan with actual ground invasion scenarios, not just Japan on its heels after it lost crucial battles. The perk system makes playing them unique as well - and there isn't an exact match for every vehicle in-game for the other side, keeping things realistic.\n\n3. The Japanese troops are well done, as well as US troops and stay true to the era, allowing you to upgrade equipment as years go by. The initial US forces look much like they did after the US was pulled into the war.\n\n4. The variety of vehicles is great, and the pace at which they are introduced by year avoids vehicle overload. They have a very good representation in the game, and several that may be new to people who think Japan is only about Ha-Go's and "Zeros." There is a cool one - the Type 91 Sumida armored car, that can convert for rail or road use just as the vehicle did historically.\n\n5. The scenarios and objectives are what makes this game shine, along with the "doctrinal abilities" or perks and "special events". A turn-based game where you have no time-based objectives can be a real slog and a bore as you slowly grind it out -- but add in "you must capture bridge X in 10 turns" then add a reward for achieving that objective? Great stuff and adds tension. Also, since units go from campaign to campaign and gain experience, you will want to keep them alive and keep them from losing too many men (replacing with greens). One more thing - while you can deploy many vehicles, you need to watch how you use your money - you can't just keep pumping out troops like Company of Heroes or something.\n\n6. Another VERY cool feature is that your enemy's vehicles - like Battleships - that were not taken out in a prior scenario will come back to haunt you. So the scenarios are dynamic like that.\n\nNitpicks:\n\nSome of the controls are not intuitive at first - a few buttons for the 'next active unit' and how to purchase untis for deployment - but once you get the hang of the menu / UI those things are really all that's not immediately obvious. Again, this is not Hearts of Iron!\n\nAirplanes need a place to land - so don't blindly buy non-carrier aircraft before you are certain you can take an airfield.\n\nSummary:\n\nAll in all this is what I wanted when I envisioned a game that let me play and change history as Imperial Japan - or as the US to try things from a very different angle. Playing pre-determined maps of Guadalcanal is not my bag, but you could also play as historically accurate as possible as the US or Japan and see if things work out the same!\n\nI do recommend turning the difficulty up one notch as I mentioned above -- I found it a bit too easy in the defaullt setting, but it can be changed between scenarios in the campaign. Will be interesting to see how many optional objectives I can hit with it dialed up a bit.","May 1, 2015","true","381.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","2"

As a computer war game, I'd say this is an enjoyable, somewhat light offering that does a good job with what SPI used to call chrome back in the days of paper and cardboard gaming.\n\n\nThere are quite a few elements that make the game feel almost like an arcade offering, such as having torpedo planes "reload" in flight, and getting rewards in the way of upgrade/reinforcement points for capturing objectives.  To my eye, the simple 1 through 10 step ratings of units seems un-grog,\n\nTo balance this, traditional concepts like zones of control, bonuses for supported attacks, and supply considerations are present.  It's an odd balance, but with the relatively pleasing graphical presentation that does a good job of imparting the right PTO flavor, it works.  It feels enough like a serious war game to give it a little heft, despite some of the lighter elements.  No one is going to mistake this game for a Grigsby monster, but it's not a History Channel offering, either.\n\nReplayablilty seems a little suspect, but there are secondary objectives that will allow for slightly different outcomes.  It could be argued that between the boot camp, US and Japanese campaign and multiplayer options even a once through would give enough game for the asking price, but without knowing how moddable the basic package is I can't say it's going to give endless hours of service without growing stale, but that's asking a lot of any game.\n\nI'm having fun with it, the learning curve isn't too steep for the casual wargamer, and it's substantial enough to make you feel like you are playing a "real" wargam while being light enough to keep things moving right along.\n\nReccomended  as good casual fun for the serious grognard, or as a dip into deeper waters for those who think of Risk as being pretty complicated.\n\n","May 2, 2015","true","12.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

So, if you enjoyed Panzer Corps, you will like this one as well.\n\n\nPROS:\nThere are some serious improvements over "that" game:\n+ Experienced units have advantages, yes, but nothing too overboard, so forget about killing off a horde of enemies with a single 5 stars Tiger tank.\n+ Supply! oh yes, supply is very well done in this game, almost its finest point. You don't just need a clear line to be in supply, but also enough supply to keep your units up and running.\n+ Air and Naval combat is vastly improved (yet still very simplified).\n+ Units have several distinct abilities that make all of them useful at some point (not just limited to engineers building bridges, but also commandos not needing supply, some tanks hunkering down and so on).\n+ The AI does a decent job at hunting down weakened units and is not an utter fool when on the attack.\n+ Maps are detailed and terrain is critical to plan ahead\n+ Some unique events happen during scenarios that force the player to change its strategy along the way, making it for a more dynamic experience.\n\nCONS\n- The hypotetical scenarios (like, invading Tokio by sea) are a bit too unrealistic.\n- Unit balance is not there yet: Japan built 300 tanks during the entire war, mainly deployed in mainland China. Considering each tank "unit" represent a number of tanks (how many, we don't know) I'm positive I've destroyed three times the entire Japanese WW2 tank production in 12 battles.\n- Some units are in dire need of an overhaul: you just cannot reload torpedoes on torpedo bombers while flying (plus Devastators were a total disaster, as Midway showed).\n- The nice "dynamic path" (one scenario outcome changing the next scenario that was so critical in Panzer Corps) is gone, now everything is very linear.\n- Commanders are far and few in between, allowing for little diversification.\n\nThe potential is there for a great platform to be used for pretty much any scenario from 1940 to 1977, some game mechanics are really nice, and most of the things that need ironing (an "undo" button, unit balance, a way to get rid of the animation, magically reloading torpedo bombers in the middle of the ocean, AI constantly attacking infantry entranched in the jungle and so on) COULD be easily fixed (if there's a will to do so).\n\nAll in all this could become a standard for simple wargames with very minor changes.\n\nI would not suggest the DLC way to expand it as everything important about WW2 in the Pacific is already here, but I could definitely see the same platform used to cover the Mediterrean in WW2 (pretty much absent in the 200 scenarios of Panzer Corps), Korea, 'Nam.","June 20, 2015","true","269.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","5"

If you liked that, you'll very likely enjoy Order of Battle: Pacific. The inclusion of air and sea units really mixes up your tactical options and makes it feel like a whole new game. You can soften up land units with your ships before doing a beach landing. The addition of supply also adds another new layer and something to be considered. You can't just charge ahead into enemy territory without risking being cut off. So, a bit more of everything without tipping over into being bogged down by too much detail or too many dry and unnecessary mechanics.\n\nI'd say this is very much a game for those who like the idea of wargames but are put off by the larger scope of the more traditional and more 'serious' type of wargame. When you get right down to it, it really is just a medium weight puzzle game with a military coat of paint.\n\nWhile I like Panzer Corps, I always felt a little intimated by it. Strangely, while being slightly more complex, OABP feels much more accessible, more varied and more immediately fun. Strongly recommended to those who like the idea of wargames but don't want to cross over into the deep and serious territory. Easily worth its full asking price.","May 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It  updates a classic game to a more robust and rounded game. There are a few things that seem odd at 1st but once you learn the system it works well.\nPros:\nUnits are different with different capabilities. Engineers can  place mines, remove mines, demo bridges, repair bridges. These may seem like trivial things but in some games they are vital to your success.\n\nDifferent air units are capable of different things . IE there are 3 types of fighters, each excels at one thing  but can do all 3 just not as well as the unit that is made for doing it.\n\nUnits gain experience and can be upgraded as new equipment is usable. You may add a  Heavy cruiser to your force pool in 1942,  and then as the game progresses upgrade it to a retrofitted model. This is very historical as the TOE  changed drastically as the War went on. At the start of the war the main AT gun for the US is the 37mm  by the end of the war that gun was far outdated.\n\nLeaders. These are gained by doing certain things in a mission. They may be  for naval, land  or air units. Some are for just the unit they are attached to, and some for units  in an area.\n\nSupply is vital. Units are effected by being out of supply or under supplied. Learning to use your supply ships in an invasion is vital.  you cannot just run all your units ashore and have them functioning as normal. As you capture ports and  cities  it allows you more supply, but it takes a few turns to  be full effect. Some units are Supply resistant   or  ignore supply (recon)\n\nReinforcements are triggered by completing certain things in the game.\n\n\nCons:\nNo undo button. Yes this is true BUT. The game auto saves at the start  and the end of each turn. So if you really goof up you can always reload the game and do it over. ( I know a lot may not like that but it is an option)\n\nGame needs more content. There is the training tutorial which is 4 missions. And 2 campaign games  Allied and Japan, each with 12 missions that must be played in a set order.\n\nGame has some flaws, but the Developers are very active and respond to posts in the Steam Forums. They just did a patch  on the 15th that fixed a lot of the flaws.\n\nOverall\nOverall I agree that the game is well worth the price. I have war gamed since about 1970. This game has a lot to offer.\nI have played Panzer General, Pacific General and Panzer Corps. This game is the best of them.","May 24, 2015","true","187.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's very good to see that there are people out there who like, program and promote this kind of games. I just wish my macbook pro 2010 was more powerful for me to play the game in a better resolution and with more fast AI. I suppose that can interfere in that too. An advice for the developers and people of Artistocrats: do use the lua programming language for AI. It's fast and very easy to use that way. I think it was made on Unity, so the AI must've been made on top of Unity's common languages. That's more CPU demanding, I think. Yeah, I'm a programmer and I love games that are tactical like that.

There is an improvement in case of performance with 2.4.0 patch BUT (unfortunatelly, I really wish to say the opposite..) the game is still not playeble unless you play another game at the same time. AI plays some turns really fast but some turns still take 10-15 mins. (it was 20-25 mins before patch)\n\nI also restarted the campain in case of any save game issue, but 7th turn of the pearl harbor mission took 12 mins for the computer turn. (this is the smallest map of the game) I am using a new mac book pro so it couldn't be a performance problem. And the game crashed enentually after playing 1 hour which is a new case.\n\nSo if you are not really crazy about WW2 games, I still can not recommend the game.

Tried a fan-created scenario first and it was "ok."  Then, I thought, I'd try out my 1st campaign as the Imperial Japanese.   I can't believe how puny and undramatic the opening battle of WWII for the U.S. vs. Japan was portrayed here.  Seriously.  I had about 6 planes TOTAL, plus 1 I bought.  The U.S. Navy had 3 battleships and 3-4 smaller vessels in port in this scenario.  Sorry, but I expected something more historical, along the lines of what inflamed the fires of American patriotism that day.  TONS of enemy planes sinking/damaging TONS of unprepared/ill-equipped US vessels and property.  This scenario was a BIG disappointment.\n\nMAJOR HISTORICAL ERROR:  Surely by now, someone else has noticed how the 40's-era commercial announcer says, "Once a Marine, Always a Marine.  Semper "feeee."  That made me puke just a little bit.  It's FI/pronounced "FYE," as in Semper Fidelis, "Ever/Always Faithful!"  Semper "feeeeee"?  Almost a deal-breaker, folks.\n\nThe opening panel artwork is atrocious as well.  I saw what I believe was intended to be a Colt 1911 .45 U.S. military-issue side arm with some rounds to the side of it?  The artist's conception made it look more like a cross between a Browning High-Power 9mm (especially the anaemic bullets to the side of it) and an emaciated Desert Eagle.\n\nI'm guessing that most players will be comparing this to the offerings in the Panzer Corps line and/or Battle Academy.  Of the 3, this comes in dead last so far.  It reminds me of WWI type games where it takes way too many moves to accomplish anything.\n\nOnly one real game into a "campaign" that cost $40 and I'm having doubts about what kind of military research was done other than to feature true battles that actually occurred in history.\n\nI DO appreciate the fact that SOMEONE has taken on the conflict in the Pacific over the European theatre for a change, though.  5 Stars for that!  Sadly, STEAM will only allow you to +/- this game with no wiggle room so I must say that, at this point in time, I would not recommend this game....unless you willing to take the only offering of WWII Pacific Theatre action out there.\n\nHopefully, I'll be revising this review in a more positive light soon.  I just wish you would have asked me some questions before this went to market.  I've not been involved in Beta testing but I have to wonder if it's limited to playability alone or are testers allowed to comment/suggest ideas.

Got my first computer at the age of four in 1995, played games with my old man, and I've just never stopped playing the genre.\n\n\nDuring the years, there's been additions to the not-so-huge genre ( what do we call it? Turn based hexagonal world war two strategy?). Most have all just been pretty much just remakes of Panzer General / Allied General, without bringing much new content.\n\nOoB:P does.\nThe setting in the Pacific! Finally!\nIt does not feel like a remake mechanics-wise, everything is a little bit smoother and smarter than it used to be. It does feel like a "lite" version sometimes, but it works and it's fresh. The graphics look nice for the genre. I also like the unit abilites (mine-laying, bridge-blowing/repairing, Banzai-charging, Torpedoes etc.).\n\nIf you ever have liked the genre, you should buy this game. It's excellent. And if you are feeling interested about this type of games, this could be an excellent starting point, as the tutorials and tips help you out a lot if you need it, and everything is smoother and easier to get into than in previous games. Only had time to play 8.8 hours so far, but I've enjoyed every second of it!\n\n\nAnd just to mention, there is probably a few bugs still here and there, but the only one I've noticed is one where when attacking with the Japanese, some allied units (defeated ones) do not disappear but instead get bugged into the hex, sort of. VERY rare (two times in 8,8h), and has not been a real problem in any way as the unit is in fact, defeated, or at least almost destroyed. Both times it's been Dutch AT-cannon units. I do expect this to be patched, and in general the game runs very well.\n\n9/10, I rarely give out 10/10's :)","July 26, 2015","true","70.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It has all the historical units and the turn-based tactics from the original game, but with more modern graphics and a nice overall feel to the combat.\n\nThe game features many fun scenarios that approximate the famous battles of the Pacific war. However, one glaring ommission from this game is a true sandbox campaign where you're given command of the entire war effort from start to finish. This games' idea of a campaign is to string along a series of individual missions and carry over some units from one battle to another. That's pretty disappointing to a fan of games with an actual strategy layer like the old PTO.\n\nOverall, it's a very promising game, but the lack of a true campaign limits replayability and dampens my enthusiasm for playing much more than a few missions.","October 2, 2015","true","16.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At first I liked the little animations the men do on the board but it got pretty old fast. I was dissapointed in that there was no way of skipping the AI turn and just showing me the events the occured against me. A lot of the time the AI's turn would take a long time because it HAS to move all of it's troops.\n\nI didnt understand the hit and miss kills in this game. It clearly shows that it will hit and it has bonuses attached to it and it still misses.\n\nI guess I want a strategy game that's a bit more interesting and has decent AI.","April 21","false","1.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Playing through the American campaign, the difficulty seems to come from the large amounts of enemy untis placed on the map, rather than deciphering a solid strategy.\n\nIt's a nice looking game that utilizes the Unity engine. However, some of the animations appear odd and aren't synchornzied very well.\n\nThere was miscommunication between the developers and the playerbase in terms of moddability and cooperative multiplayer, which I'm personally frustrated with.\n\nModding - All of the graphics/sounds/values are packed into non-openable resource files. It would require a 3rd party tool to open any of them. The developers have said that they wanted the game to be easily moddable - that is not the case. Panzer Corps and Panzer General have survived the time due to mods - I dont see this game lasting very long without mod support.\n\nCooperative Multiplayer - The developers have pushed this one hard, but the reaility is that there are only two cooperative multiplayer scenarios. The developers have claimed that producing cooperative multiplayer scenarios is easy - but there is no way to distribute player-produced scenarios. Additionally, relying on the player-base to produce content is always risky. I dont anticipate that we'll see much from the community.\n\nThe campaigns / scenarios are extremely EASY, with the only challenge being in secondary objectives. Even on the hardest difficulty, primary objectives are relatively easy to accomplish - and require little to no strategy.\n\nEdit - Made it to the US Midway scenario. Game stops working on turn 20.  Reading the Slitherine forums, there seems to be an issue across the board with AI freezing during their turns. The developers released a hot-fix, but it doesnt seem to work for me.","May 1, 2015","false","38.2"," 28 of 64 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","28","64","3","9"

Huge improvement. Now the AI turns typically take 2-3 mins. Nice job! Now I definitely recommend this game.\n\n============================================\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI have never written any reviews before, because I feel most things I want to say have already been said in existing reviews. But this time I think I really need to write something about this game: I simply can't stand watching a game with such outraging performance getting so many positive reviews.\n\nTo be honest, this game can be fun sometimes. The wide variety of units, the supply management system, the unique specilization feature, and some more subtle designs provide the game great promise to be one the best in its genre (I particularly like the design that when a ship maneuvers closer to or farther away from its target, damage output from its artillery will drastically reduce, because in real life in order to fire a full broadside a ship has to move parellel to its target).\n\nAll the good sides, however, are irreparably ruined by its abysmal performance (ironically, all the pros of the game make the cons all the more aggravating). Specifically, the AI turns usually take way too long during large scale engagements, which, making matters worse, actually constitutes most part of the campaign. While it typically takes me 3-5 mins to finish my turn, it can take the AI 10-30 mins, making the game virtually unplayable. I'm simply tired of the gaming experience-play for one turn, wait for a long time, play for another turn, decide to get something to eat, play for one more turn, read some news, play for another turn, take a nap, and wake up furious because the AI still hasn't finished its ridiculous turn.\n\nI don't think its my computer's problem, since when I play Civilization V or the Total War series things are always velvety smooth, and since I have seen many people in the forum complaining even the most high-end computers cannot stop the AI turn from taking forever.\n\nI understand that the developers were on a tight budget (that's why I'm not very critical of the game's lack of voice acting or its hideous music), but I think the AI problem is due not so much to insufficient budget as to downright irresponsiblity. The developers are obviously not as concerned with making the game more playable as with making more money: instead of fixing the problem, they devoted their limited resource into making one DLC after another and shamelessly ask you to pay more cash.\n\nTherefore, the verdict is simple: DON'T BUY. The developers do not deserve your money.","May 3","true","178.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There are some really cool new features that make the feeling very different. For instance supply is based on a general system of controlled towns and supply ships, not individually anymore. Combined with "borders" of your territory a quick push into enemy territory feels and plays much different now.\nPlus units now have command points (bigger units more command points) and you have to choose which units to bring to a battle - divided into land-, sea- and air-units. That makes it impossible to play killer-airplanes all the time.\nI personally like the bigger share of naval units and major sea battles.\n\nOn the downside the AI is still struggling with human intelligence. Carrier based bombers fly without fighter cover (often the fighter plane is there, but two hexes apart), enemy offensives are easily stalled by cleaverly placed mines etc. To benefit the AI it seems that FOW does not really apply to its units. So enemy planes will most often kill off heavily damaged squadrons in the fog and the AI never walks into mines.\n\nThere are two campaigns - US and Japan - with only one path. No more major and minor victories which change the course of war, but secondary war goals that generate boni like commanders, extra-resources and weaker enemies in the future. I like that approach cause I played for decisive vics anyways. Especially the US-campaing plays quite easy in the end - maybe turn the difficulty up.\nCommanders (heroes) are less powerful than in "Panzer Corps" and can be re-assigned, injured and made POW.\n\nI like the little black-and-white photos of events during battles and on the campaign map. Gives the game more feeling.\n\nI can recommend this game to every fan of turn-based grand-strategy games. There are some minor bugs, but these donÂ´t feel to bad.

Graphics are precise and attractive without being the reason for the game entirely.  The AI does a suitable job so far (only a few hours played, it may get stickier).  I've enjoyed the turn based but still pacey gameplay, and the mechanics are simple and effective.  This manages to combine different branches of the military together well, and I find the control point mechanic - which limits the number of units you can have on the map by military branch - very effective in forcing different strategies upon you but not leaving you feeling railroaded.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grimmblut/recommended/312450/","Grimmblut","Grimmblut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grimmblut/","162 products in account","Order of Battle: Pacific (OoB:P) has one advantage and one advantage alone over competing titles like Panzer Corps, Panzer General and all the other hex strategy games: The revolutionary supply system. The hex field where a unit is or moves through belongs to the player of that unit. That way you can establish areas that are under your control. If a supply source (a town or a supply ship) is within that area, then the units are in supply and can fight at their full strength. When you cut enemy units of from their supply source by moving one or more of your units through the area, that connects their area with the area of their supply source, then their effective combat strength drops radically. This gives tanks e.g. their realistic operational combat value to cut off enemy units and start a battle of encirclement and annihilation. This is great. This is what I had been waiting for in a game for decades. It opens a completely new dimension of strategy.\n\nSadly, this is the only advantage OoB:P has to offer and there are so many disadvantages that wear this great feature down.\n\nThe waiting time during the enemy's turn:\nMy PC is using an OC i5, 8 GB RAM and an SSD, along with a pretty good graphics card. The waiting time during some turns can be up to 7 minutes. Attention: I'm not talking about a situation where the enemy has 20 units in close combat with mine and needs to figure out a good tactic. I'm talking about where I can see ONE enemy unit on the map and the AI takes 7 minutes for hidden movement in the fog of war. I've read about other player's who claim to have waiting times of 20 to 30 minutes during each turn. A typical battle lasts about 25 turns, but 50 turns and more is not uncommon. To be fair, 7 minutes is, in my case, the absolute maximum. Most times the AI needs maybe a minute. But when these spikes happen, then they come in a row.\n\nPredefined tactics:\nThis is - by far - the worst. It's what made me uninstall the game. The developers obviously don't trust the players. They have a very narrow idea of how a battle should be played, e.g. in which order strategic objects should be captured, where a player should send his units and where he MUST NOT send them (or else he will be punished by, and I â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not, SPAWNING huge amount of enemy troops right before his troops to bash them back where the developers think they belong). Other means how this is enforced are, that the player may not bring specifc CORE units into battle or that he's limited to a very small force until he captures a specific location. There are very often AI controlled units in battles, that fight on your side, but which move at scripted events or times to directions that you can't influence, e.g. they wait for 15 turns and do nothing and then move to attack a small island on the map even though you've already cleared that one out. Result: You've waisted time to clear that island (which was supposed to be attacked by the AI controlled allied units - without telling you before) and now you don't have enough time left to complete the rest of the (secondary) objectives, so you have to restart the battle. Because of this, I had to restart about 3/4 of the battles that I've played. It's extremely frustrating.\n\nStupid and cheating AI:\nI could put up with the extremely long waiting times during the AI's turn if the AI was smart. But it isn't. I had moments like "Oh no, if this unit moves two hex to the southeast, then it will cut of my units." But no. Never have I witnessed one single smart move of the AI but A LOT stupid ones. The AI does two things: A) Attack the weakest unit or the one that has already taken the most damage and B) move to the closest victory location. That's it. A higher difficulty level doesn't mean a smarter AI, it just means better combat multipliers for the enemy (more damage to your units, less damage to theirs). The AI also cheats like hell, e.g. an enemy planes uses its maximum range to fly right next to one of your planes, which is at a location where it's guaranteed that the enemy has had no vision, to attack said plane. Fog of war exists only for the player.\n\nExit points on battle maps:\nThis is really the last straw. At some border locations of the map are "exit points" where you or the enemy can move units to and remove them from battle. That may sound like a good idea at first, when you have spend all your supply points but realise that you actually don't need a certain unit, so you move it to an exit point and then bring in a better unit from the reserves that helps you more in this situation. But in the campaign, these exit points are exclusively used by the AI to remove - without any need or warning - units from battle that are part of secondary objectives. Like "Shoot down 5 air plane squadrons" and after 15 turns or so, all enemy planes are suddenly "gone". The most absurd situation was when an enemy carrier literally vanished at open sea in front of three of my torpedo bomber squadrons. Secondary objective: failed. WTF??\n\nAmmunition resupply:\nThe resupply system that I've mention in the beginning is good, but it's very, very oversimplified. Your units are either in supply, or they're not. This decides whether they can fight at full strength. You don't need to supply your troops with ammunition, like in Panzer Corps or - heaven forbid! - like in Battle Isle, where you had to control supply units to bring ammo and fuel to the front. The only exception are torpedo bombers and submarines that work in a very strange way: Their torpedos simply "respawn" after a few turns. I adore the feature that let's you cut off enemy units from supply, but the rest of the supply system is oversimplified.\n\nBugs:\nI had no crashes, but several very serious bugs that forced me to reload a scenario up to eight times. I've read that other players encountered even more bugs and had several crashes.\n\nBad modability:\nIt was promoted that the game would be open to modders, but as far as I've read this isn't true. Several critical game files are only editable with unusual special software and there isn't any interface to activate mods in the game except for mods that are distributed directly by the developers.\n\nAll in all OoB:P was a huge letdown. Some problems may be fixable but the humiliating spoon-feeding regarding "what should the player do and how can we force him to do exactly that"-attitude of the developers seems to be something that can't be fixed with a patch.","May 3","false","38.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

Huge improvement. Now the AI turns typically take 2-3 mins. Nice job! Now I definitely recommend this game.\n\n============================================\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI have never written any reviews before, because I feel most things I want to say have already been said in existing reviews. But this time I think I really need to write something about this game: I simply can't stand watching a game with such outraging performance getting so many positive reviews.\n\nTo be honest, this game can be fun sometimes. The wide variety of units, the supply management system, the unique specilization feature, and some more subtle designs provide the game great promise to be one the best in its genre (I particularly like the design that when a ship maneuvers closer to or farther away from its target, damage output from its artillery will drastically reduce, because in real life in order to fire a full broadside a ship has to move parellel to its target).\n\nAll the good sides, however, are irreparably ruined by its abysmal performance (ironically, all the pros of the game make the cons all the more aggravating). Specifically, the AI turns usually take way too long during large scale engagements, which, making matters worse, actually constitutes most part of the campaign. While it typically takes me 3-5 mins to finish my turn, it can take the AI 10-30 mins, making the game virtually unplayable. I'm simply tired of the gaming experience-play for one turn, wait for a long time, play for another turn, decide to get something to eat, play for one more turn, read some news, play for another turn, take a nap, and wake up furious because the AI still hasn't finished its ridiculous turn.\n\nI don't think its my computer's problem, since when I play Civilization V or the Total War series things are always velvety smooth, and since I have seen many people in the forum complaining even the most high-end computers cannot stop the AI turn from taking forever.\n\nI understand that the developers were on a tight budget (that's why I'm not very critical of the game's lack of voice acting or its hideous music), but I think the AI problem is due not so much to insufficient budget as to downright irresponsiblity. The developers are obviously not as concerned with making the game more playable as with making more money: instead of fixing the problem, they devoted their limited resource into making one DLC after another and shamelessly ask you to pay more cash.\n\nTherefore, the verdict is simple: DON'T BUY. The developers do not deserve your money.","May 3","true","178.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Scenarios are typically not so much a race against the clock as in PG, but reward more careful planning to keep units efficient and avoid unnecessary losses (I've only played US campaign, and this is especially true in later scenarios)\n\nNegative aspects are some stability and performance issues. As to stability, I've had some crashes, although few and far between.

If you liked that, you'll very likely enjoy Order of Battle: Pacific. The inclusion of air and sea units really mixes up your tactical options and makes it feel like a whole new game. You can soften up land units with your ships before doing a beach landing. The addition of supply also adds another new layer and something to be considered. You can't just charge ahead into enemy territory without risking being cut off. So, a bit more of everything without tipping over into being bogged down by too much detail or too many dry and unnecessary mechanics.\n\nI'd say this is very much a game for those who like the idea of wargames but are put off by the larger scope of the more traditional and more 'serious' type of wargame. When you get right down to it, it really is just a medium weight puzzle game with a military coat of paint.\n\nWhile I like Panzer Corps, I always felt a little intimated by it. Strangely, while being slightly more complex, OABP feels much more accessible, more varied and more immediately fun. Strongly recommended to those who like the idea of wargames but don't want to cross over into the deep and serious territory. Easily worth its full asking price.","May 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It  updates a classic game to a more robust and rounded game. There are a few things that seem odd at 1st but once you learn the system it works well.\nPros:\nUnits are different with different capabilities. Engineers can  place mines, remove mines, demo bridges, repair bridges. These may seem like trivial things but in some games they are vital to your success.\n\nDifferent air units are capable of different things . IE there are 3 types of fighters, each excels at one thing  but can do all 3 just not as well as the unit that is made for doing it.\n\nUnits gain experience and can be upgraded as new equipment is usable. You may add a  Heavy cruiser to your force pool in 1942,  and then as the game progresses upgrade it to a retrofitted model. This is very historical as the TOE  changed drastically as the War went on. At the start of the war the main AT gun for the US is the 37mm  by the end of the war that gun was far outdated.\n\nLeaders. These are gained by doing certain things in a mission. They may be  for naval, land  or air units. Some are for just the unit they are attached to, and some for units  in an area.\n\nSupply is vital. Units are effected by being out of supply or under supplied. Learning to use your supply ships in an invasion is vital.  you cannot just run all your units ashore and have them functioning as normal. As you capture ports and  cities  it allows you more supply, but it takes a few turns to  be full effect. Some units are Supply resistant   or  ignore supply (recon)\n\nReinforcements are triggered by completing certain things in the game.\n\n\nCons:\nNo undo button. Yes this is true BUT. The game auto saves at the start  and the end of each turn. So if you really goof up you can always reload the game and do it over. ( I know a lot may not like that but it is an option)\n\nGame needs more content. There is the training tutorial which is 4 missions. And 2 campaign games  Allied and Japan, each with 12 missions that must be played in a set order.\n\nGame has some flaws, but the Developers are very active and respond to posts in the Steam Forums. They just did a patch  on the 15th that fixed a lot of the flaws.\n\nOverall\nOverall I agree that the game is well worth the price. I have war gamed since about 1970. This game has a lot to offer.\nI have played Panzer General, Pacific General and Panzer Corps. This game is the best of them.","May 24, 2015","true","187.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's very good to see that there are people out there who like, program and promote this kind of games. I just wish my macbook pro 2010 was more powerful for me to play the game in a better resolution and with more fast AI. I suppose that can interfere in that too. An advice for the developers and people of Artistocrats: do use the lua programming language for AI. It's fast and very easy to use that way. I think it was made on Unity, so the AI must've been made on top of Unity's common languages. That's more CPU demanding, I think. Yeah, I'm a programmer and I love games that are tactical like that.

Tried a fan-created scenario first and it was "ok."  Then, I thought, I'd try out my 1st campaign as the Imperial Japanese.   I can't believe how puny and undramatic the opening battle of WWII for the U.S. vs. Japan was portrayed here.  Seriously.  I had about 6 planes TOTAL, plus 1 I bought.  The U.S. Navy had 3 battleships and 3-4 smaller vessels in port in this scenario.  Sorry, but I expected something more historical, along the lines of what inflamed the fires of American patriotism that day.  TONS of enemy planes sinking/damaging TONS of unprepared/ill-equipped US vessels and property.  This scenario was a BIG disappointment.\n\nMAJOR HISTORICAL ERROR:  Surely by now, someone else has noticed how the 40's-era commercial announcer says, "Once a Marine, Always a Marine.  Semper "feeee."  That made me puke just a little bit.  It's FI/pronounced "FYE," as in Semper Fidelis, "Ever/Always Faithful!"  Semper "feeeeee"?  Almost a deal-breaker, folks.\n\nThe opening panel artwork is atrocious as well.  I saw what I believe was intended to be a Colt 1911 .45 U.S. military-issue side arm with some rounds to the side of it?  The artist's conception made it look more like a cross between a Browning High-Power 9mm (especially the anaemic bullets to the side of it) and an emaciated Desert Eagle.\n\nI'm guessing that most players will be comparing this to the offerings in the Panzer Corps line and/or Battle Academy.  Of the 3, this comes in dead last so far.  It reminds me of WWI type games where it takes way too many moves to accomplish anything.\n\nOnly one real game into a "campaign" that cost $40 and I'm having doubts about what kind of military research was done other than to feature true battles that actually occurred in history.\n\nI DO appreciate the fact that SOMEONE has taken on the conflict in the Pacific over the European theatre for a change, though.  5 Stars for that!  Sadly, STEAM will only allow you to +/- this game with no wiggle room so I must say that, at this point in time, I would not recommend this game....unless you willing to take the only offering of WWII Pacific Theatre action out there.\n\nHopefully, I'll be revising this review in a more positive light soon.  I just wish you would have asked me some questions before this went to market.  I've not been involved in Beta testing but I have to wonder if it's limited to playability alone or are testers allowed to comment/suggest ideas.

At first I liked the little animations the men do on the board but it got pretty old fast. I was dissapointed in that there was no way of skipping the AI turn and just showing me the events the occured against me. A lot of the time the AI's turn would take a long time because it HAS to move all of it's troops.\n\nI didnt understand the hit and miss kills in this game. It clearly shows that it will hit and it has bonuses attached to it and it still misses.\n\nI guess I want a strategy game that's a bit more interesting and has decent AI.","April 21","false","1.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Playing through the American campaign, the difficulty seems to come from the large amounts of enemy untis placed on the map, rather than deciphering a solid strategy.\n\nIt's a nice looking game that utilizes the Unity engine. However, some of the animations appear odd and aren't synchornzied very well.\n\nThere was miscommunication between the developers and the playerbase in terms of moddability and cooperative multiplayer, which I'm personally frustrated with.\n\nModding - All of the graphics/sounds/values are packed into non-openable resource files. It would require a 3rd party tool to open any of them. The developers have said that they wanted the game to be easily moddable - that is not the case. Panzer Corps and Panzer General have survived the time due to mods - I dont see this game lasting very long without mod support.\n\nCooperative Multiplayer - The developers have pushed this one hard, but the reaility is that there are only two cooperative multiplayer scenarios. The developers have claimed that producing cooperative multiplayer scenarios is easy - but there is no way to distribute player-produced scenarios. Additionally, relying on the player-base to produce content is always risky. I dont anticipate that we'll see much from the community.\n\nThe campaigns / scenarios are extremely EASY, with the only challenge being in secondary objectives. Even on the hardest difficulty, primary objectives are relatively easy to accomplish - and require little to no strategy.\n\nEdit - Made it to the US Midway scenario. Game stops working on turn 20.  Reading the Slitherine forums, there seems to be an issue across the board with AI freezing during their turns. The developers released a hot-fix, but it doesnt seem to work for me.","May 1, 2015","false","38.2"," 28 of 64 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","28","64","3","9"

Huge improvement. Now the AI turns typically take 2-3 mins. Nice job! Now I definitely recommend this game.\n\n============================================\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI have never written any reviews before, because I feel most things I want to say have already been said in existing reviews. But this time I think I really need to write something about this game: I simply can't stand watching a game with such outraging performance getting so many positive reviews.\n\nTo be honest, this game can be fun sometimes. The wide variety of units, the supply management system, the unique specilization feature, and some more subtle designs provide the game great promise to be one the best in its genre (I particularly like the design that when a ship maneuvers closer to or farther away from its target, damage output from its artillery will drastically reduce, because in real life in order to fire a full broadside a ship has to move parellel to its target).\n\nAll the good sides, however, are irreparably ruined by its abysmal performance (ironically, all the pros of the game make the cons all the more aggravating). Specifically, the AI turns usually take way too long during large scale engagements, which, making matters worse, actually constitutes most part of the campaign. While it typically takes me 3-5 mins to finish my turn, it can take the AI 10-30 mins, making the game virtually unplayable. I'm simply tired of the gaming experience-play for one turn, wait for a long time, play for another turn, decide to get something to eat, play for one more turn, read some news, play for another turn, take a nap, and wake up furious because the AI still hasn't finished its ridiculous turn.\n\nI don't think its my computer's problem, since when I play Civilization V or the Total War series things are always velvety smooth, and since I have seen many people in the forum complaining even the most high-end computers cannot stop the AI turn from taking forever.\n\nI understand that the developers were on a tight budget (that's why I'm not very critical of the game's lack of voice acting or its hideous music), but I think the AI problem is due not so much to insufficient budget as to downright irresponsiblity. The developers are obviously not as concerned with making the game more playable as with making more money: instead of fixing the problem, they devoted their limited resource into making one DLC after another and shamelessly ask you to pay more cash.\n\nTherefore, the verdict is simple: DON'T BUY. The developers do not deserve your money.","May 3","true","178.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I have also spent some time on the developer forum and so far my impression is that they are really involved with the community and are active in discussions. They also seem to be frequently fixing bugs and adding new content which is cool too.\n\nI can say that if you like this kind of game, you will love this game in particular.

Scenarios are typically not so much a race against the clock as in PG, but reward more careful planning to keep units efficient and avoid unnecessary losses (I've only played US campaign, and this is especially true in later scenarios)\n\nNegative aspects are some stability and performance issues. As to stability, I've had some crashes, although few and far between. Performance wise, the AI turn can be very slow, particularly with older PCs and in large scenarios.\n\nAll in all, this is IMHO the definitive PG-alike game that falls short of perfection due to the stability and performance issues.","May 15","true","56.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As well, the Power Ups awarded after some scenarios didn't really help as much as I'd hoped, but perhaps I chose poorly for my gaming style.\n\nIn fact, the only gripe I have is the last power up for the Japanese - the Kamikaze. Don't pick Kamikaze. They do only ONE damage at most to any unit regardless of the situation.
