"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenshi_a/recommended/27800/","tenshi_a","tenshi_a","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenshi_a/","2012 products in account","This is the greatest game that Jeff Minter ever made. And hardly anyone realises this because they don't know how to play it, because they try to play it like some other game.\n\nLet me tell you how to play Space Giraffe, and let that explain why this game is so good.\n\nYou need to relax, and pay attention to the game. Give it your full focus. What you do in this game is you don't shoot the basic enemies much, just enough to keep the power zone going, and then ram into the side of them as they reach the rim of the grid. That's the basic idea.\n\nWhen you ram into enemies like this, it's called "bulling". Try to ram through as many as you can at once. It builds up your score, the multiplier, gives you extra lives... it's the main thing you want to try to do.\n\nThe power bar is the horizontal line that keeps coming towards you. You want to keep it away from you, otherwise you can't ram into enemies side-on and they kill you instead. The space between the power bar and you is called the power zone. You can also briefly make the power zone get big by collecting a "pod" power-up and jumping.\n\nYou can use the right stick of your joypad to aim your bullets through the power zone - just wiggle it a little and you'll probably hit a few enemies, enough to keep the power bar going. In later levels, you'll be specifically trying to aim for flowers, or spheres, or the other annoying enemies.\n\nNow, this game throws a lot at you. So much that you can hardly see. But the thing is - that is what makes this game so amazing and different. This is a shooter that you don't play by shooting, and this is a game with visuals so intense that you need to play it by ear. Turn the volume up if you need to! Wear headphones if it helps!\n\nEach enemy, each bullet, each power up, each collision has a different and distinct audio sound. Pay attention, listen to the game. Record the sound of each one in your brain.\n\nTurn down the music and turn up the SFX if the music's getting in the way. You can't play this game without sound effects.\n\nFor levels where there's too much distortion on screen, you're going to feel your way through the level by sound. Listen for the announcement of each enemy, each bullet. You are endlessly auto-shooting, so you can hear when you've hit a flower, how far away it is, and when it "pings" off its stalk to come towards you.\n\nThe overall effect of playing this game with heightened sonic awareness, semi-blinded by the lights, racking up high scores, is that you end up with a feeling that is the nearest thing to "using the Force" you have ever, and possibly will ever feel. At least, that's how it is for me.\n\nThis is why this game is so good, so important. It is completely different, but it totally works. You just need to be receptive to the game and let it teach you how to play it, how to improve.\n\nAnd good luck when you get to level 64. It's going to really mess your brain up and you're going to love it for that. :)","May 22, 2015","true","6.9"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","0"

While it may invoke those older games on the surface, the bulling and Power Zone mechanics really make Space Giraffe feel like more of it's own game than the rehash it's often accused of being. The shooting and dodging are tight and satisfying and the risk vs reward elements make for some crazy intense shooty action. When all that comes together with the visuals and audio in the way that it's supposed to, Space Giraffe is simply astoudning to play and you can almost feel like you're in a trance when you're on a roll.\n\nWhen it doesn't work however, the game just feels plain unfair and frustrating. Far too often, the emphasis on eye-searing visuals over gameplay can and will cause many unnecessary deaths due to how obscured the playfield can get. A large chunk of stages also to alter the game's rules subtly without telling the player, which just seems like a cheap and sloppy way to prohibit progress.\n\nThere will inevitably be frustration with this game, but I highly suggest at least trying the demo. It's something I've stuck with since its release and if you can manage to get over its initial quirks and don't mind some frustration later, Space Giraffe feels about as satisfying as Portal can be once you finally "get it."","February 27, 2013","true","6.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Sure you can blitz through the levels and enjoy the insanity, but you need to master 'bulling' (ramming enemies) if you want to be top of your leaderboard.\n\nThis is a game I so desperately want to see re-discovered and become the success it deserves.\n\nIf you know what Tempest 2000 is, if you played Centipede and enjoyed it.

The game begins by quickly going through the two decade’s worth of intensive education which Elfie must first undergo before he can become the first space giraffe. Completing many assignments and even making a few friends along the way. At the end of the first level, Elfie is awarded a space giraffe diploma, and there is a beautiful shot where the player can see Elfie’s parents in the audience at the ceremony. Since the game is made with the same graphics engine that powered Sony’s Afrika on the Playstation 3, the level of emotion that Elfie’s parents are able to display was quite impressive at the time. Elfie finally boards a rocket in level 2 and is shot into the vast vacuum of space, wherein for the first time in his life, Elfie comes to the realization that he will have to spend the rest of his life alone. Over the course of a year, the player gets to witness Elfie’s descent into madness, and as he loses his mind, the universe around him starts to change in colour.\n\nThe rest of the game just rips off the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but instead of a space baby, we get to see the ghost of J. Allard.","July 6, 2013","true",""," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stepchild of Theurer's Tempest jettisoned into the Doctor Who title sequence. Which Doctor Who title sequence? All of them. At once. At the same time. Except it's not Tempest. Don't play it like Tempest. I mean, you can play it like Tempest but you'll end up with a really, tremendously rubbish score and look a bit silly missing out the clench-everything-hope-for-massive-score of a bullrun, throwing enemies off the web en masse for all the points, all the lives, all the things, the bullet juggling, the flower containment and on.\n\nProgressive, smart, incredible to look at when all manner of hells shuffle forth onto the screen. Webs spin, explosions explode, things scream at you. Your giraffe sneezes into space. How many games feature a flying abstract giraffe that sneezes into space? Just this one? Thought so.\n\nDon't touch the NUXX, take it raw as nature intended and it's a beautiful piece of futurism made game. I Adore My 64 is the stuff of legend and rightly so. You know you've nailed it when you can just shut your eyes and listen, knowing that the game gives you everything you need to survive in sound alone.\n\nJust get it. It's incredible. Minter's masterwork and the sort of vision of videogames that so few have the technical ability to pull off, never mind the sheer gloriousness of the arcade-of-the-future design. Such a thing.

I think it was in a bundle of some kind. But I got reminded of its existence through a weird set of events and wanted to give it another go.\n\nThe tutorial is alright - it tells you how things work, which is quite essential for something like this, and the playing field on which you experience things lets you mess around with things for the sake of practice. I came away from the tutorial with a vague sense of how to play - run into basic enemies, shoot flowers and bullets. The gameplay is rather interesting, with a neat premise that can prove rewarding if you can put the time into it.\n\nThe main issue I have is that the entire game's aesthetic is a god damn mess. Visuals are psychedelic, which might be some folks' cup of tea, but I found myself dying more often than not due to one of the things I was meant to shoot getting lost in the overwhelming visuals. And this is coming from someone who can play Beat Hazard on Suicidal. The audio makes me think I'm shooting up some bizarre children's toy that communicates in barnyard animal calls, random phone noises, and the occasional phrase repeated to the point of annoyance. Not to mention the weird kid at the start screen reading out numbers in Welsh. The text of the game is just as "wacky" and "random", with references to older games dotted around, intentional misspellings, and the word "goat" being shoved into other words for seemingly no reason.\n\nThere's certainly a good game to be had from this, but the nonsensical art direction and reliance on random humour can easily grate if you aren't into that sort of thing. After ten levels (which I understand is less than a tenth of the actual game) I had to turn the game off for fear of giving myself a migraine. It's got a niche appeal, and unfortunately it's not for me.","April 26","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's very chaotic and serves better as a learning experience for game developers. Main mechanics are explained in the help menu and provide you with the most basic information. Other things you have to figure out by yourself through many deaths. At first you won't even understand what's killing you. Some bullets can be avoided, some bullet-like bursts serve as powerups, some shapes can kill you even when bullying, but other can't - it's not clear at all why. Rules are just rules, you have to figure them out and try to follow them. Complexity curve is not consistent - some levels are hard and take 10-20 tries, while others are first try easy mode. Some level names seem meaningful while others are just for fun. Some angles and geometry introduce interesting behaviour which is never developed into consistent whole.\nNever understood why people praise this game. Because it's funny? It gets old very fast.

It is perfect at what it tries to be, an abstract visual experience. The gameplay is fun, but the graphics along with the sound/music is what makes this game an absolutely surreal experience.","July 18, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps more suitable to play if you want to blast your eyes with colour. Nice enough for a play through, but I didn't really see much here to play beyond a few forays into the weird light mechanics of this slightly awkward shoot-em-up.\n\nI imagine more effort would unlock what this game really could do - I didn't want to give that effort. X-Type is my heritage!","February 1","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't own a PS Vita and can't enjoy the glory of Jeff Minter's TxK, then this is as close as you'll get on PC. It's a great time.","April 14","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
