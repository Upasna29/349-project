In game however you have to be flying along at full speed before you get any amount of manoeuvrability, backwards and a silly oversight.\n\n---ORIGINAL REVIEW 12 Dec 2015---\nI'm struggling to find the game here.\nI couldn't find the single player mode at all and the multi-player mode lobby was completely empty.\nThat said, I was left to roam multiplayer maps alone, finding the odd power up and then getting stuck on terrain a few times . Once you're stuck you stay that way, so quit back to lobby only to find yourself roaming another empty multiplayer map.\n\nNo Single player (that I found) = No Game.\nNo Multilayer community = No game.\n\nI'll check back later to see if there is a growing community, but as of now it's a Tank without tracks and in need of some community love.","December 11, 2015","false","0.6"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","0"

There is no single player game.  There's not actually a multiplayer game either, considering I was the only one in the world playing when I tried it.  Steamcharts says the most people ever playing this game at the same time has been two.  There is no tutorial, and no menu.  So you can't even see what the controls are.  The icon in the game that looks like it's for settings is actually just a link to their web page, which takes you out of game to your browser.  The Steam link in game actually still links to their Greenlight page, so they couldn't even get that right.  This is just complete junk.","December 28, 2015","false","0.1"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"
