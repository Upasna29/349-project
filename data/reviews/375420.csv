However, this game was recommended for me, and I decided to give it a go.\nDespite the deceivingly simple controls, where you can move around and - if you have the correct resources - raise/lower platforms, the game requires a lot of consideration from the player. You need to be able to plan ahead and keep in mind which part of the level you change and how - so that you can correctly plan your way to the exit.\nThe first levels are simple - tutorial like - but they gradually become harder and bigger. There are quite a few optional levels too, and there is something I am yet to try that looks like a level editor. I expect to play this for a while.\n\nAll in all, The Architect is a really good game for puzzle fans.","June 8, 2015","true","1.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terracorex/recommended/375420/","Terracorex","Terracorex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terracorex/","4078 products in account","Quirkly puzzle game.  Not quite a platformer since there is not actual jumping involved.  There certainly are platforms in abudance though.  You can raise and lower them as you accumulate either blue or green energy balls.  Those balls can lower or raise, respectively, any platform cell by one level per energy ball consumed.   This leads (somewhat) to a planning element where you navigate the maze of platform cells at various levels, while attempting to not run out of energy balls.  If you do, and get in an area from which you cannot escape, you have to restart the whole level.\n\nSome of these levels can be quite huge and its easy to get disoriented, since the main problem with the game is the lack of control of the camera in terms of being able to easily move it to where you need it.  This can be VERY frustrating.  Yes, you can hit Q or E to rotate the screen 90 degrees, and you can hit F or R to tilt the camera, but what is desperately missing is any keyboard command to shift the camera left, right, up or down.  Instead, you have to move the mouse to the edge of the screen, which makes it difficult to control exactly which angle you end up with.  Sometimes, I had to zoom the camera out (using the mouse wheel) just to be able to shift the screen to the point where I could see my little guy again.\n\nJust adding keyboard commands to control the camera without the depending on the mouse would help immensely.  Two other gripes I had while playing were also mentioned by other reviewers.  First, it can be difficult to select the particular cell you want to raise or lower.  And even when you do, then you have to be very careful when you try and select the up or down arrow without accidentally selecting another cell, the wrong cell, which can really screw you up.  It's entirely possible to accidentally raise or lower and cell in this way, and then have to restart the level.\n\nSecond, the levels while fairly large and somewhat challenging, seemed haphazard in their construction.  There seemed to be more attention paid to how the level looked (like a tree for instance) than on having a focused solution that you would need to follow to complete the level.  Other planning puzzle games like Tori Tori have this essential element that this game mostly lacks--namely the element of having to figure out the right order to go where and do what.  Here, any level has many possible solutions, and you mainly only have to worry about not running too low on energy balls.  Using a simple greedy strategy of going where there are more balls that won't cost you a net loss once you consume the next ball seems to always work.\n\nHonestly, I quickly tired of this game after not finding a real mental effort to grab my attention. The game seemed to depend on throwing large levels at you where you are trying to gather all the balls and not really adding much challenge beyond that.  As a result, the gameplay became tedious, and not very fun.\n\nDo I recommend this game then?\n\nWell, this was a tough one, since I do think the game has some interesting dynamics and a lot of potential.  The camera problems could be mostly fixed by adding some more keyboard controls.  The levels could be more carefully designed and crafted to really require thinking ahead.   So on a scale of 1 to 10, I might be very generous in giving this game a 6.  Very generous, indeed.  Since 6 is slightly more positive than negative, I guess I "recommend" this game, but with all the cavaets stated.","November 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
