They are incenting players to leave positive reviews[forums.redbana.com] to the value of $40 USD of in-game currency. Now that they've closed the event and stated that any participants who review the game before or on June 8 will receive the $40 in-game cash. Count how many of the positive reviewers only have that 1 review and put their IGN in the review (required to receive the in-game cash.)\n\nDo you really want to trust a game that is essentially stating it cannot naturally get positive reviews? They also heavily censor their forums from bad publicity so don't be surprised if this thread disappears. There is a very "you're either with us, or banned" kind of mentality here. Very little transparency. In fact, the opposite. They want you to only know what they tell you.\n\nThe game itself, while outdated, sometimes buggy, and pretty lackluster by today's standards, is fun - and with the relative lack of good rhythm games out there, that is a point in Audition's favor. If you like social rhythm games and dress-up, you might enjoy yourself for a while. This server does not really have the best hits because by their own word they don't have enough money. However it does have songs with uncensored explicit language and racial epithets, suggestive clothing /themes and a good chunk of their playerbase under their required age of 13.\n\nHowever, I cannot recommend this game because of how horribly this game is managed. Redbana is doing anything they can to keep the cash flowing in this dying game and it's showing. They will run events where the cost (in real money) to enter is the same as the value of the prize (IF you win!) They will pretend to care about you right up until the moment you are no longer giving them money or helping them. I wrote the X-Patcher software that provides a better launcher interface than the existing one. I gave technical support to hundreds of users to get more people to play this game. I got fed up with their apathy towards players and their inability to actually do anything that mattered, and quit.\n\nThe GMs have previously shown preferential treatment. They are inconsistent in punishment and will do anything they want with very little transparency. They are incompetent children that have banned hard-working players because they levelled up 'too fast'. Even the game's "player council" has very little influence, and does not get much more information, having been on it myself. Or the sad reality they do leak out to the council members is hush-hush, don't tell our players because they might leave. There is a lot they keep secret, and for good reason: They want you to play, and give them money, and hope you don't have any issues or concerns or suggestions. Everything is fine as long as you don't create waves. Because they can't / won't do anything to help you. There are bugs in the game that have never been fixed.\n\nI am disappointed, again and again and again.\n\nA copy of this review can be found on my forum here[forums.jordantrudgett.com].\n\n- tgfcoder.","June 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 457 of 514 people (89%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","89","457","514","37","15"

I'm writing this review because the other reviews were upsetting. Many of the other reviewers only did it to get $40, which was what Redbana was offering to those who left good reviews. That is why many of the reviewers left their IGNs in their review, which is not usually seen in a Steam review. You'll also notice that many of these reviewers don't have any other games and/or have only reviewed one game (this game). So the reviews are very biased. It is very disappointing to see this kind of abuse.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game is fun, but most of the people that play are terrible. If you plan on playing this game, be prepared for a lot of drama.","June 8, 2015","false","28.9"," 146 of 180 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","146","180","9","0"

During the Nexon days the game was very popular with many channels because of it being part of Nexon. I played RedBana Audition for a little over 3 years off and on and the amount of people playing has dwindled down every year. This can be for a lot of reasons but it's biggest complaint I always heard was the lack of updates or extremely slow updates and losing licensing of good songs because they lack money. The days of having fun with your FAM (in game guild) and having Rivalry's with other FAM's are long over. The best you can hope for is to get a small group of friends you can play with otherwise the game is pretty boring alone. The game was good for its time back in 07 but the game is very outdated now, it's not going to get any better.\n\nIf you are looking for a Rhythm game to play there are better ones out there already like Mstar that are much more up to date not only with their character customization but songs as well. With the rate this game updates, it's many years behind it's origin server Korean Audition. What's the point of playing a Rhythm game with such a small and poor selection of songs. I definitely don't recommend this to any new players as the vast majority of players that play is out of Nostalgia and friends that still continue to play. Not only are their GM's corrupt and show favoritism to certain players in the community and ban those who they don't like, now they are even bribing players with in game money (Bana Cash) to give good reviews on here. As they know most players will be too lazy to do so or won't care as there no is reward involved. If this game was still good then why wouldn't the players happily support it without there being an in game reward involved?\n\nYou can really tell in the reviews who did it just for the Bana Cash reward, who knows if anyone will even get to see this with the massive flood of Bribed Reviews on the page already. Then those who would have gave it a good review despite there being a reward or not. Just a few points, I don't want to list everything.\n\nPros\n- Fun if you manage to get a group of friends to play with.\n- Pass the time being involved with the social network the game provides.\n- Talk to people from different parts of the world.\n- Various Rhythm modes from very easy to very hard\n- Guitar Mode (Guitar Hero on the keyboard? Seems legit.)\n- You can dress your character up in nice clothes\n\nCons\n- A lot of drama\n- Corrupt GM's\n- Tournament's are dead or have hackers\n- Slow updates\n- Most of the community is rude (For a small player base that's disappointing.)\n- All the nice clothes cost real $$$ and not all are permanent. (Permanent clothes cost roughly $10 each piece.)\n\nI'm happy for the game that it managed to get on here but I think it's a bit too late. The game only continues to disappoint. You can compare it to something like MapleStory where they know the end is near for the game, they're just trying to milk as much money as they can from it before the game runs itself into the ground.","June 8, 2015","false","19.0"," 86 of 103 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","86","103","0","0"

I know it's not much but i still have something to say. To be honest, i found out about the bribed reviews like last week i think. I'm very dissapointed. The people who wrote positive reviews for in-game currency basically lied to everyone about how "great" this game is. I won't lie, i got sucked into the game right after i saw the video of it on Steam. I thought it would be fun. Well the first 2 weeks were awesome to be honest. I loved the game very much, but then it changed. As i've noticed, in some of the reviews, people are saying that the graphics are horrible, no settings, etc. Sure, the graphics aren't that great and a game having no settings is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but i don't look at the graphics and all that, i just look at the whole gameplay. Yet i am unsatisfied with some things in this game, so i'm going to write some of my Pros and Cons.\n\nPros and Cons in my opinion:\n\nPros:\n\n+The songs might be old, but i still love them and i wouldn't change them. I would just add some new ones.\n+There are a lot of modes to play, so you won't get bored so easily. (My fav is actually Guitar and Choreo 4 keys CC4)\n+There are a lot of friendly people in this game and you can talk to them. (Like i said, everything is my opinion)\n+You don't have to pay2win, which i find very annoying in any kind of games.\n+It's sort of an "online dating site" i guess, from my experience some people actually have long lasting online relationships. (I'm also in a online relationship atm, but that's not important)\n\nSo i guess these are all the Pros i can think of in my opinion. Now for the Cons and oh boy, i have a lot of them in mind.\n\nCons:\n\n-Bugs in this game are pretty terrible, especially in Club Dance and Beat Rush.\n-Crashes. I'm not saying they happen often, but it would be still nice to fix that problem.\n-The updates are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, since after each update, i've noticed that they don't do anything about the bugs in this game.\n-As far as i know, the GM's have IQ's of snails, since they banned my FAM for "hacking" because some guy reported it without any evidence of that crime at all.\n-A lot of drama.\n-Most of the stuff in this game costs real money, so if you want to look "pretty" and you want to stay that way, you have to pay up.\n-There are also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people.\n-The Events always require for you to pay for something, so ♥♥♥♥ that.\n-The Tournaments are dead, but they start at a very different time, so i can't really attend them.\n\nSo yeah, like i said, these Pros and Cons are basically my thoughts about the game. True, i would be dissapointed if the game was shut down. And i have quite the history with this game. But if it does shut down, i'll just move on. Though i really want to say 1 thing to GM's of this game: Fix the ♥♥♥♥ing bugs will ya? And try turning on your brains, since, as you can see, you're losing people and getting bad reviews. And bribing other players? That's just pathetic. ♥♥♥♥ing pull yourself together.\n\n","October 4, 2015","false","774.2"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","28","34","2","1"

(yes this game is that old(er) ) As I read a lot of the reviews below me, I've seen that many of the reviewers had come into the game with their mindset thinking that this was supposed to be DDR Online, or an OSU competitor. I can honestly tell you that this game is neither.\n\nAudition Online is a heavy rhythm based online dancing game with heavy social aspects. Originally made in Korea, the game has very heavy K-pop culture references (fashion mall/ K pop dance moves), and many Korean songs. If you are annoyed by pop, electronic, or music that is in a foreign language, you most likely will pass on the game. There are enough English songs to pass for an American server, but a vast majority of songs are in Korean.\n\nAs said above, the Korean culture for the game is quite immense. The fashion mall (cash shop) is full of Korean Pop star references and clothing that would mostly make sense to the Kpop audience. The cash shop is completely optional. NOTHING in the cash shop will enhance your skills to the point of unfairness. There is a non-cash currency. (beats). These beats can be earned by playing with other players in the server. The selection of Beats items is quite small compared to the cash items, but there is enough to satisfy one's fashion sense to an extent.\n\nThe Gameplay for Audition is very different from DDR or OSU online. This is something that many new players fail to understand when they write the game off as a DDR clone. Players are given a combination of arrow keys that correspond to the 4 directional keys on the keyboard or the numpad, and must press those keys within the 4/4 metronome displayed, and then hit the space key once the bar reaches the 4/4 on the metronome. The metronome's speed is determined by each songs BPM. Often new players assume that they are really button mashing, but every arrow key combination is attached to a certain dance move. The fact is that this is just ONE of Audition's many different game modes.\n\nAudition has roughly over 10 UNIQUE game modes, with about 15-20 different variations of certain game modes. Each mode has a different concept, a different way to play, and win. Some are team games, some are solo (story mode), and some are social modes (wedding, love party, club). I'd advise the DDR fans to start off with Beat Up mode which utilizes the players numpads using the keys (741/963) as the keys are tapped in direct relation to the rhythm, unlike "Normal Mode" where only key combinations are pressed followed by the space bar at each fourth beat.\n\nThe game has a VERY steep learning curve. If you are prone to quitting easily, or not interested in taking the time to learn the different modes, I'd not recommend the game to you.  The game is currently in need of new players and a revitalization in its community. However, if you'd like to try something different, make some new friends, and even improve your playing skills. Look for me in game at ~KentyGaga~ There's so much more that I can't even bother to explain so I look forward to hearing from you!\n","June 4, 2015","true","13.6"," 93 of 153 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","93","153","8","8"

As far as other modes go there are: normal individual, team battles, Club Dance (couple dance), Block Beat (dance in teams of 2), 1-2 mode where you memorise a sequence and reapeat it and more too! :D\n\nThe customisation is great too as the mall has many things to choose from a lot for cash but a lot for beats too  and you can even get things such as chracter animations and emotes too so i go there quite a bit! :) As far as face, weight and height goes, not too customisable but they don't need to be as the chracters look fine the way they are lol XD + clothing will make them look cool anyways :)\n\nMenu Navigation is pretty good and straight forward and same goes for joining lobbys (the game has commands such as "go room number" for shortcuts which is a cool addition as your friend may be in room 35 and you have spend time scrolling through lobbys as channel 1 is always full lol XD If you get stuck on menu navigation or how to change room name or something like that, there is a guide on Steam that explains it to you which is nice :)\n\nNow, Audition being an online only game apart from EP1 in Story which is single player, Getting to know the community is something that many have by now. The community is great though some people are not pleasent but no communitys perfect eh? XD in my whole time of playing this i have only a met a few of them like a really small number, majority of the community are really pleasent + kind and are happy to help beginners out also sometimes :) my 1st day in Audition i got helped out by the host making the song slower (at the time i just joined random lobbys via quick join XD) so the bpm they were on (the speed of the song) wasn't for me at the time XD + he was my first friend in it, making friends is not so hard here which is great as it is a Multiplayer game afterall with new players and returning players :D\n\nAdvice on getting good at this game is to start on slow speeds (80-100) and Freestyle mode too as that lets the red circle pass through as many times as you wish without missing, i personally did regular 4k (c4 not cc4) on slow speeds and eventually went up as i got used to this game :) I explore other modes these days too and got good at some of them too though to master this game will take you a long long time XD\n\nThe game has Events and Tournaments too which is cool but there is a downside to tournaments which is not all are popular, the only one i found people in is expert so the lvls were way higher than mine XD but i think people still play Beat Up and Guitar Tournaments! (Events and Tournanments are for a lot of modes) Nice addition to the game but i tend to play Events more than Tournaments as they are more casual! :)\n\nLeveling up is slow the higher you go as you would expect really, though the game has double XP cards which can be found in giftboxes or by leveling up (giftboxes you get by playing for a amount of time and if you don't like the gifts, you can sell them and make a lot of beats (currency) depending on the tier of it as theres a few) Maximum level is lv.100 and i have saw a lvl 83 but the game has this quest you have to do on level ups (get so many perfects in a row and overall on a song chosen by the game) so you could imagine how hardcore that would be on getting a lv.83 license, the more you go up the faster songs they choose. To those who don't know how to level up, you got to lobby screen and there is a green button saying License, you can't gain xp till you get your level up done so worth doing! :)\n\nAnd finally, the song list, so many songs to choose from many you will not know but get to like quickly some you will not stand XD and some, you will know like Cray Button, Space Jam and Habits (Stay Hight but remixed) which are 3 of my favourites :) even the slow songs are nice too like All or Nothing which is in around the 90 bpm is one i used to play a lot! Some songs you can't feel the beat and some you can't really get perfect on but overall, the song list has a really nice variety and there will be a lot you will get to like maybe depending on your music taste :)\n\nHope this review was helpful and helps you decide whether the game is worth trying or not, personally, i think you should give it a go and see how you do as you never know till you try! :) I thought i would try this and never go back to it but my playtime says otherwise! XD Oh and don't let the graphics put you off, the game is from 07 so yeah XD\n\nPros:\n+Majority of community is Great!\n+Loads of clothing and emotes to choose from!\n+Nice songlist\n+FAM's (groups/clans)\n+addictive gameplay\n+ No pay to win!\n\nCons: (don't put me off the game but i'll address them anyways)\n- Lag Spikes (very rare but still)\n- Close by itself (again very rare but it can happen during a game)\n- For me, FAM name dosen't appear over me but this is way less common than the 2 above\n-Auto miss in Club (not sure why but very rare)","September 1, 2015","true","602.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This is a very fun game that plays like a blend of Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution for your hands. Unfortunately you can't use your own music at all, but the selection of music is actually decent and fits the game well.\n\nHere is a short clip of gameplay footage from when the game gets harder. Note: The sound is going to be removed because the music gets copyright flagged on youtube. Review continues below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-DbX_VmjQo&feature=youtu.be\n\nA variety of game modes, a lot of cosmetic stuff if you're into that, the multiplayer integration is really fun. They're pretty good about keeping the game updated and fresh too (like right now there's a Father's Day event- never seen that in a game before)\n\nOn the con side, the Steam version does seem to be crashing a lot right now, I don't know if that's just me, and there's no option for windowed mode. Editing the launch options to force it into windowed mode results in a game error and crash.\n\nYou aren't TOO restricted as a totally free player, you can still really enjoy yourself without spending a dime.

At its time it was one of the few games in its genre rivaling with o2jam. Both were new and refreshing. But Audition had something that o2jam didnt. Fun Gameplay, a variety of game modes and pretty decent customisation.\n\nAnd why is this relevant you ask?\n\nWell, its because this game doesnt age well. The only reason you would play this game specificaly is probably for the nostalgia factor. For those who played on Audi SEA/ Audi Nexon /Audi *insert country here*. I loved this game for what it brings back then. BBoy theme with plenty of music. Which bring us to its pros and cons.\n\nPros\nStrong core gameplay with also other game modes from various other rythmn game.\nFluid hand commands that actually flows\nEasy to learn and hard to master with various modifiers and nuances\nFun bboy battle theme\nGood base music varying from techno, bossa nova and melodical trance\nGreat Community / FanbaseConsGraphics are outdated\nReally outdated. 480p Outdated.\nCash shop is eh\nHard to master (definitely can be taxing at times)\nHard for a newbie to find a footing\nNA versions has questionable choices of western music.\ntl;dr Dont play this game if you are a newbie at rythmn game.

I remember first joining and thinking how fun it was and it definitely was with the community back then. Pricing was still garbage lol but don't get me wrong it was a good game. Also I had the worst typo name, aupermoney.... my god it was supposed to be supermoney but dang. Ended up becoming Accomplice, AnitaFuch, Socks~ and Honoka.\n\nHowever a good game that time now it's just something I grew out of. I can't stand half of the players anymore. I honestly can't. Some don't even want to chill or chat and even told us to shut up even though we have every right to have fun and play, but that's not the case. Attitude just for having fun? It's not even suppose to be taken seriously like come the hell on.\n\nForums atleast there's a bright side for where the most part it's ok maybe some high school drama here and there.\n\nMusic I mean what can you expect, it's a good selection for what they can get, you can't blame them. They lost many licenses in the past but they can keep it running for what little variety they got getting things like Communities Choice.\n\nI don't know anymore the fun factor just died to me when it got SO SERIOUS. Fams, couples, etc. I stay away from those. Just try to find friends through regular gameplay and rooms and to be honest? That's hard to do but when you do, it actually feels great. However I am not willing to do this always and moved on to other titles. Maybe I will come back every once in awhile to talk and play a game or two but other then that I think my Audition days are over.\n\nThe clothing I loved. Seriously I would spend hours in a day just in the mall thinking what should I buy next or does this outfit look great? Believe it or not even with those prices, If I like it? I buy it. I will buy the living crap out of it. Hell just making and saving outfits is probably the best part of this game.\n\nGameplay wise, I loved it. Bust a Groove like gameplay, follow the beat Beat Rush, DDR like Beat-Up, DJ Max Fever like Block mode, etc. It's like multiple of my favorite games put into one.\nRythmholic can careless for, not a fan of couple gameplay modes.\nThe only things personally I don't like are 8k and Guitar Mode. I'm not bad at it but I just personally really don't like it unless if it's Beat-up, other then that I refuse to play it. Guitar Mode? I have guitar hero and rockband. I have no reason to play it with a keyboard.\n\nIf You're taking this game seriously, calm down. It's meant to be a social music game to have fun. Also gender doesn't truly matter when you're not going for couples so be a guy or girl doesn't matter as long as you're not trying to couple. (Unless it's like a friend and they already know that)\n\nTo me it was a solid 7/10 experience for the most part but I'm not willing to play a game where it's meant to be fun but ruined by serious players.\n\nIf you like what you see or play, go play it no ones stopping you but as for me, I think It's over. I will be on but just most likely playing alone since I want to listen to the music and play a bust a groove or rythm whatever mode.","February 16","true","273.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

When I played this game, the community was friendly however sometimes you would cross over some harmless discrimination. Moreover, whilst your trying to find a "decent" lobby, ("decent" meaning a beginner newbie like me who doesnt have sonic fingers), its extremely hard to come across one, and you'll end up creating a room yourself, waiting like 15 mins to find an afk player chilling in your lobby, and then you'll be playing in your own game ALONE for like the rest of your day.\n\nOkay. So clothing options. I remember these quite briefly, however they were quite interesting. In game, the currency which enabled to buy clothes are BEATS/DEN, and Cash. Beats/DEN are in game currency which you get through levelling up, opening gift boxes, and other general stuff with gameplay. I dont realaly remember the DEN currency, however it was quite tight on how most of the clothes in the store required cash, which you could only acquire with real money. These clothes were legitimate, whereas the in game currency ones were quite run down and basic.\n\nI recommend this to people who really can master the keyboard keys - be a pro at this game and you'll get many fans.

The community is really nice, the nicest I've seen in an online game for a very very long time. Everyone is just trying to have a good time and the cute anime dancing style reflects that a lot. Please give the game a try - whether returning player from Alaplaya days or new player, now is probably the best time to pick it up!\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nGood old Audition. To be honest, I thought this game died years ago, because I haven't heard about it in forever. Last time I played it, it was published by Alaplaya, back when they also still had S4 League, in case anyone remembers. So this game just has a really nostalgic factor for me. To make it short:\n\nWhat's good\nThe music in this game is great and it is a well thought through rhythm game. Man, this game was a thing long before anyone would even get the idea to ask what an "osu" is. It has a lot of music with a variety of genres and the music pool is always growing. The customization is also nice, although obviously concepted as a way for players to spend real money as free stuff not only takes a while to farm but also doesn't look nearly as good as the payshop stuff. Still, a great way to implement an itemshop that doesn't provide any real benefits.\nGameplaywise, it can both be played casually and competitively, though the age of the game (8-9 years?) has made it clear that the people left are usually people who are really good at the game and the game sure as hell isn't as noobfriendly on a communitybase as it used to be. (Try learning to play the game by playing with pros, it's like learning to handle a gun by commiting a bankrobbery)\nOther than that, the game just has a huge nostalgic factor and anyone who played it years ago, go check it out. Steam gave it a HUGE playerboost and it's still a really fun experience.\n\nWhat's bad\nMan, the game is old. That old of a game, no graphic overhaul? It looks bad, really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad. But the dancemoves and customization are able to make a BIT up for it. Interface? Same thing. Looks like a 16 year old programmer with down syndrome was in charge of how the menu looks. No hotkey customization, the tutorial would've been better if you just threw it out of the game entirely and told the player "This is what you press" in a little .bmp 100x100 screenshot instead.\n\n\nIf you want your rhythm game to be fun, challenging and built around a cute anime style dancing crew, this is the game for you.\nIf you want your rhythm game to be competitive, good learning curve, polished and with thought put in the interface, not so much.\n\nI still like it.","June 6, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've been playing audition since back in 2010. Its a game that allows you to interact with other people from all over the world. The music is amazing and yes, it will be kind of hard at first to get used to the arrows and the speed , but it is definitely worth it. You can just lock yourself in one of the rooms and practice, it gets easier like everything in life. This game is like my second life and I love meeting awesome new people everyday. This is indeed a very old game, but the fact that it still remains perhaps "alive", says it all. People who stopped playing before, always end up coming back to audition xD However, one of the cons of this game is that the shop is a little bit expensive, but you can still buy your clothing with "beats" , its just not going to be as cute as buying cash clothes. Overall, I highly recommend this game <3","June 4, 2015","true","006.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Check.\nGet to stare at your butt all game? Check.\nLook ridiculous? Check.\n\nPrior to this being released on Steam, I played this game from 2007 to roughly 2013 on different servers as well (American, Korean, Sea, European). While I have had a generally negative experience with the people I've met on this game, that's not what this review is about. I grew up with Audition, and although I don't play it anymore I have a general love of rhythm games and this one would easily make it in my top few.\n\nLike with most rhythm games, there is a learning curve and it's pretty steap. That's not to say you can't get better at it without trying, but it takes some time. From my experience I've found that people who have prior experience with rhythm games or those who play instruments have an easier time adapting to the game as it requires both of your hands and a very basic grasp of rhythm, but in such a way that you have to keep up with multiple things at once, i.e. flashing lights, a moving camera (that you can adjust), your character (because yes, it can be distracting), the beat, inputing notes, and the difficulty level increasing throughout a song repeatedly, etc. The game also rewards you for your endeavours by giving you fancy, shiny medals and icons that stay with your character for all eternity (but you can turn them off).\n\nThe game offers multiple modes to try, from things similar to guitar hero or things that have a mixture of DDR and ITG elements, to NPC battles, team battles, couple battles (yes, you can get married!), and much more. Likewise, there's a large song bank that is constantly being updated. When I played it was rare to see a popular song on the radio on the game, but from what I've heard the songs are a little different than before. But, that doesn't make it a bad game. It actually makes it better if you consider the fact there are a multitude of genres. I actually discovered many artists that I  otherwise would've never known of.\n\nPreviously, I stated I didn't have a great experience with the people I met on the game. I think that is standard of most games, if not all. However, despite this, I do have to say the mods on the online forums and the GMs are always trying to interact with others, be helpful, and available. They could be friendly or simple and to the point, but it didn't matter to me as they offered their services frequently and in a timely manner. My experiences stem from not only being a senior on the forums but also with my interactions with them in game.\n\nOverall, it's not Osu, DDR, or ITG. But that's not to say it isn't worth giving a shot. And if you like games where you can have an actual avatar that you can decorate, then that's a plus because many other rhythm games don't offer that. Much less a garden where you can harvest points for your couple rating..","June 4, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I have been playing since back in 2008 and repeatedly find myself coming back to the game because I really enjoy playing it. There are various game types that will appeal to anyone's preferred play style. For the most part, the music in the game is good. The addition of FAM's has allowed players to connect with other people and form friendships as well as work towards a common goal. They offer a variety of clothes to help a player customize their character in their own style.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be that there are many hackers in the game. I'm sure the programmers are working hard to try and combat that issue. Second biggest complaint would be the locked afk rooms. Majority of the rooms, you will find, are locked and just being used to afk in so people can achieve high lvled coupons on the timebox. Not really a game issue but an inconvenience to look at when scrolling through the list of rooms.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys playing music related games while making friends online.

You can jump in and be on equal footing with veteran players.\n- This game has it's merits with outdated graphics and missing settings (Ctrl + S for volume slider)\n- Available song list is fixed and new songs are added by the developer in upcoming patches. This version of Audition (there are different versions for different regions) has prominent artists like Diplo, Weeknd and Krewella to name some.\n- This games biggest strength revolves around the community. People tend to know each other and playing with friends while enjoying the music is just great. THIS GAME BECOMES SO MUCH BETTER IF YOU TALK AND MAKE NEW FRIENDS. You gotta socialize to fully enjoy this game. That's the main reason why i kept coming back to this game after a 8 year long break.\n\nSide note: I am playing osu! (or DDR) myself and both games are too different to be compared. The osu! and DDR related modes are just one of many game modes in Audition.\n\n===================================================================\n\n\nAudition Online is an online dance battle game with a variety of gamemodes which are (somewhat) comparable to DDR (Beat Up), Guitar Hero (Guitar Mode) and Taiko (Space Pang) and it's own "normal" mode.\n\nIn the normal mode, the main mode of this game, you need to hit the arrows on your keyboard according to the arrows on the screen and press Space/Ctrl when the beat ends. This requires a lot of skill i'd say - sense of rhythm by playing instruments can help a lot to get good at this mode.\n\n\nThe songlist covers slow BPM (beats per minutes) and fast BPM songs. Slow songs are good to practice your muscle memory/reading as a beginner. You can't add own songs to the game, the developer adds new songs in future patches (i believe the reason is due to copyright/license issues).\nThe music genre is K-Pop/Western charts with some prominent artists like Deorro, Chainsmokers, Krewella, Zeds Dead, Weeknd, Diplo and more.\n\n\nThe game itself runs with V-Sync on(FPS caps at the refresh rate of your monitor, for most people 60FPS). There are ways to disable V-Sync as an AMD/ATI and Nvidia graphic cards owner  (which i recommend, guides are available on the official Redbana forums). The graphics are outdated for it's time even though i don't mind/like the anime style.\n\n\nThere are two currencies ingame, ingame (Beats) and real cash (Banacash). Even though clothes are purchaseable by Beats the majority of  clothes are Banacash ones. Items or clothes have ZERO impact on the competitiveness of this game - it grants no advantage at all as it's purely cosmetic. Veterans with high levels do NOT have an advantage either besides being more experienced and skilled at the game. Theoretically you could hop into the game and beat veterans just by being more skilled.\n\n\nOne thing i would like to point out is how much more fun this game becomes when you make new friends and interact with the community. You can become Couples, get married, join a Family and fight with them in FAM battles.\nThe last time i played this game was about 8 years ago and i keep coming back. The game has it's merits (graphics are outdated, lack of settings) but if you love to listen to music, meet new people and become friends and thrive to become good at music-based games this game is definitely worth a try!\n\nMy IGN is haifrosch for anyone who stumbles upon me!","June 5, 2015","true","45.1"," 33 of 67 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","33","67","2","0"

All of the current ~popular~ games feel much too flashy at times, and Audition, for a lot of people, is a childhood game that brings back nostalgia, whether or not you've played it before. Usually good old-fashioned games like these die out and it's really disheartening to not be able to play again. I've been a on and off player since 2007 and I've noticed that a vast majority of those that "quit" usually make their way back to this game in some way or another.\n\nAudition is comfortable yet challenging, and it's barely overwhelming despite the amount of time it takes to become decent at this game. Although more updates to the game regarding patches (songs, items, etc) would be nice, I believe the current graphics and modes are one of the positive aspects about Audition.\n\nIGN: Pervert","June 4, 2015","true","344.9"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","26","53","2","0"

It is a bit challenging, but that's the fun in it. Not all games are supposed to be simple. What may remind you of DDR, is not at all the same. You do have to press notes, but you have to finish a bar of notes before the ball reaches the end. Sounds confusing? Well you should be trying it out for yourself! Over the years, I have practiced and learned to get better. Not only do you get better, but you also make a lot of friends along the way.\n\nThe Community in Audition is great. I guess you could say I'm one of the old players. I started when it was in Nexon, and I continued with it when it continued to Redbana. I met tons of friends that I am still friends with today, and I still talk with them. They're great for lending a hand in helping you complete missions, helping you level up, etc. It's never a dull moment playing with fun people.\n\nYou can join a Fam (similar to a guild) whose members are just as helpful, you can have a couple, and eventually get married and have a ring, exclusive clothes and exclusive missions. It's not JUST a dancing game. There are many modes in which you can play, and each mode is different. If you think one mode isn't for you, then don't worry about it because the next one is something different. Try it out :)\n\nYou can always message me for help, I'll always be around.

Most audition players I know have been old time players who don't really bother much about the graphics itself, but have always came back to this game due to nostalgia and the community.  I, myself have made so many good friends and memories on this game and although many have taken breaks or supposedly quit, they have all came back to play again in the end. Imo, to those saying that it is hard yeah sure it won't be easy at first but that pratically applies to any game. Practice makes perfect. The community here is very open and welcoming, and it's nice to see this attitude towards the new players and hopefully the new players are equally as nice! I've been playing for a long time, and it's great that there are so many unique modes available, from the general choreo to guitar and rhythmholic. The songs itself could be better, but I'm not really complaining since they do offer a wide selection and new music is constantly being added. You also aren't forced to play any of the songs you don't like. There are other things that I wish could change such as the prices of the Indefinite cash clothing, but again they're not necessary to thrive in this game. You have the option of buying clothing through beats which is earned by just playing the game so no, this isn't a pay to win game which i think is great itself.

If you dont understand Korean like I do, you just get used to hearing the beats overtime and its still just as pleasant as English songs. As far as popularity (mainstream) songs, there are some but I learned to favor the ones I dont hear often on the radio. There are also a few player made songs as well. If you're willing to teach yourself a new method of rhtyhm to different songs , this is the game for you.\n\nUpon entering , you will have to teach yourself how to navigate around the game if you dont see a guide for it on the forums, but people are always down to thelp you find your way if you ask in the lobby if you dont click on all the help icons on the screen.\n\nCommunity wise it's excellent. After playing this game for so long I can say I've grown and seen most of them grow with this community so I'd consider most of them family after how long its been. I can assure you once you join, you'll be welcomed with open arms so dont be scared to talk.\n\nThis server is not a bot or hack fest like other servers. Most players do strive to reach goals legitamately and will call out someone for it if they think the other person is hacking.GMs have started to ban a lot more people now so the chances of hack cases going untouched is unlikely. I haven't been in much drama for a few years, so the chances of it happening will only depend on the type of people you center yourself around. There's more of a mature side with the community than immature compared to a few years ago. I've also met great people that are still my friends till this day. I've seen people get married in real life just because they met on this game. I'm not saying it's going to match.com , but you really can create great bonds with the community if you open up and talk. I think that's whats made people stay. Despite a few players leaving and quitting , they've always come back to the game after a while.Always.\n\nIn conclusion, I always like the game. It's a good way to pass time and meet people for the long run.\n\nIGN:Kickass","June 6, 2015","true","923.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Those don't have to be you; your experience could be totally and completely different. I have met a lot of great people, that I had shared countless laughs and good memories with on this game. This game you cannot buy the win which is one of the great things about it. It is practice and hard work that can be turned into an amazing skill. So what if you lose, you will win if you keep playing. Everyone on here is a winner at one point in time.\n\nThis is a Rhythm game, it is very relaxing when you play with friends or tense like in a tournament. There is a variety of modes you can play, from the very basic one Dance battle 4k, to the fun yet complicated 1,2 party which makes me think of Simon says. & sure there is a cash option in the game. The cash doesn't enhance your score or winning chances. It gives you the ability to customize your character a little more or buy a card that allows you to get increased experience for like 20 or was it 15 games?\n\nOne more thing about Audition, I'd like to think all the people I have met were great and wonderful to me. That isn't always true. That is in fact the reality of life and game. No place is perfect you will meet some bullies or a few hackers. It is entirely your choice to let them affect your gaming experience in any game. Like I said earlier I met a lot of great friends I still talk to today and will probably talk to in the future. You might find me if you want to play or chat if you can catch me :P\n\nDo give this game a try, I would recommend it! :)\n\n- IGN: PuraNa","June 7, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is not only a heavily rhythm-based game, but also a huge social platform for people to connect and build a connection with. There are a lot of beginner modes to get you started, so don't worry about not being very good right away. It will honestly take some time to get used to, but once you figure it out, the unimaginable fun is yet to be discovered. You can also customize your own avatar by purchasing in-game cash or by free in-game points called “beats”, to purchase fashionable clothes, pets, accessories, etc. The diverse amount of modes that can be played are insane, you are definitely bound to find something you really enjoy and that you can master to join tournaments to gain rewards and status. I definitely recommend this game with a positive rating, it is a great way to pass time, have fun, make friends, and possibly unravel certain capabilities that you thought you never had, along the journey of Audition.\nIgn: Hideki\n","June 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are a few negatives though. Especially when it comes to the songs, which nearly almost all of them are bad, there are SOME good ones, but not a ton. Next... Full screen. I like full screen for some games, yes, but not for this one...\n\nThere are still positives! No need to worry about the patcher and all the other junk on Audition. This is such an easier way to download.\n\nOther than that, I'll recommend this game, sure. It's a fun game...

Those don't have to be you; your experience could be totally and completely different. I have met a lot of great people, that I had shared countless laughs and good memories with on this game. This game you cannot buy the win which is one of the great things about it. It is practice and hard work that can be turned into an amazing skill. So what if you lose, you will win if you keep playing. Everyone on here is a winner at one point in time.\n\nThis is a Rhythm game, it is very relaxing when you play with friends or tense like in a tournament. There is a variety of modes you can play, from the very basic one Dance battle 4k, to the fun yet complicated 1,2 party which makes me think of Simon says. & sure there is a cash option in the game. The cash doesn't enhance your score or winning chances. It gives you the ability to customize your character a little more or buy a card that allows you to get increased experience for like 20 or was it 15 games?\n\nOne more thing about Audition, I'd like to think all the people I have met were great and wonderful to me. That isn't always true. That is in fact the reality of life and game. No place is perfect you will meet some bullies or a few hackers. It is entirely your choice to let them affect your gaming experience in any game. Like I said earlier I met a lot of great friends I still talk to today and will probably talk to in the future. You might find me if you want to play or chat if you can catch me :P\n\nDo give this game a try, I would recommend it! :)\n\n- IGN: PuraNa","June 7, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is really cute tbh, with cash clothes and all, but the prices for 90 days and indefinite are absolutely ridiculous. $15 for a permanent shirt that's pixelated? no thanks. a full outfit indefinite is like 60 bucks and just really dislike pricing, but toher than that, there are a variety of items to choose from too.

I can honestly say that this game is one of my favorite games of all time, if not purely for the social aspect.\n\nThis game is all about enjoying music, talking to others/making friends, enjoying improvement of your own skills, competing in tournaments or even attempting to date if you want to go that far.\n\nFor the gameplay part, there is an extreme amount of variety. You may only like certain modes and hate others, but you cannot say this game does not have variety and creativity in its game modes.\n\nThe main part of the game is simple, press arrow keys, once they are all pressed time space bar at the right time (The 4th beat of the music) and try to get perfect. Do this more than you opponent to win. The winning condition will vary, the keys will vary, there will be random missions asking you to do challanges, hell there are even modes for different instruments that you can buy (Think Guitar hero), but the basics of pressing keys to the beat of music will remain.\n\nThe social aspect is what really makes this game shine. You meet new people all the time, you talk all the time, you laugh, you talk about serious issues, you trash talk in a friendly manner, you gossip, join families (Guilds/Clans) you just relax. I have met so much life long friends in this game that I will never forget, no other game comes close.\n\nOnce you start playing and get past learning the game you will understand why people seem to continue to aply this game through years and years. It has just the right amount of challenge to keep you wanting to improve at all times.. While at the same is a game you can go on to vent, relax, play super casually and just have fun with other people/friends.\n\nBoth elements of the game are important, but the community really makes this game shine and stand the test of time. The most friendly gamers you will ever meet.","September 28, 2015","true","679.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And while I can say that it was indeed better under Nexon as far as songs, I honestly say that it's not that bad as it is today, owned under Redbana. So I will try to give an honest review:\n\nFirst off, They may have gotten rid of some songs, but they keep the old school Audition songs that you know and love. I love the songs they have right now, but I can't deny that I miss the old ones (Magic City, Sunshine, Large by Helix). Their currrent songs by Audition are still there, and they are catchy, and everytime they bring a new song in it is pretty catchy. Plus with recent updates you don't have to go scrolling through the long list of songs anymore unless it is to find the ones you absolutely love to add to your "music list". Which is a whole separate tab of songs that you ABSOLUTELY love so you can just easily search and pick them from there, then just dance! I haven't tried out the BGM List feature yet.\n\nI have never seen anything about sex talk or immaturity of players. Clearly must be hanging out with the wrong crowd. A lot of the people that I have met are nice, and I actually see a lot of foreign players where I can't even understand what they are saying.\n\nClothes? Yea, it sucks that the only cash items they have are available for max up to 7 days, but if you play the right modes, you can look super cute! I was getting frustrated for that same reason when I saw that cute items cost 500k+ beats and I only had a mere 100k that I saved from the past year. Then my friends (who I met on Audition) introduced me to Beat Rush Battle Party, which is a PHENOMENAL way to earn beats, and now my character is cute and I have no reason to buy cash, and best of all it is permanent. I earned the necessary amount needed in a short time! So once you get used to the game, start doing Beat Rush, Beat Rush Battle Party, or Beat Up and your character will look great!\n\nIf you are complaining about the cash items having an expiration date, all you have to do is not buy them, and save up beats to get clothes that are just as cute! Beats aren't hard to earn. And if you must spend cash, it will be to reset the NPC's in Beat Rush Battle Party, which is very much worth it.\n\nSpeaking of clothes, this doesn't affect me, but for those of you coming in, you are lucky I have got to tell you. They changed their default clothes! So you don't look like a 10 year old girl, or a homeless dude who got picked up off the street! They are more "hip" and "modern" so to speak. Girls have a cheer leader-type outfit option, and a sweatshirt and sweat pants. Which my personal favorite is the cheer shirt, sweat pants, white sneaks combo. It's perfection for a starter outfit!\n\nA lot of people on Audition by now are pretty pro, and it sucks when you come in last for almost every dance, but hey, I still have fun, and it takes practice. If you don't like the way they are running their room, find a new one, or make your own! If you don't want to practice in front of everyone and make an embarassment of yourself, feel free to observe, and practice anyway. They have arrows their so you can practice as if you were dancing yourself.\n\nAudition has some great qualities, and I'm not exactly sure why it has gotten so many bad reviews. So I wanted to do this game justice by writing a review.\n","January 1","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From the ammount of time i spent in the game, and the way i see it is that the game is community based.  Although the tags for the game says single player, the majority of the game play is based on the community.  You joined a "FAM", you get to have a "couple" and eventually get "married".  The game being said a community based one, i ccould honestyl say that the small community we have going on right now is quite appealing.

Even Beatmania is not completely like it.\nGuitar Hero is not (Recently at least). Rock Band is not.\nAnd as awesome AudioSurf and BeatHazrd are, they are not the same type of game.\n\nThis game has that, the "Actually On The Beat of The Song Gameplay".\n\nBut most of the game is covered with a game design completely marketed and targeted towards a specific culture.\nAnime games are great, but when they don't embrace any other aspect of any other culture in any way, gets hard to enjoy it if you are not part of that specific culture that the game tries to use as it's target demographic.\n\nWhich goes to the songs too. 100% of them at "Pop" or "K-Pop" songs, that haven't been updated in years. So while the gameplay is fun, it's hard to have much fun with it unless you are into those specific things.\n\nThe thing I wonder is why nobody, specially the same devs. Have made an Audition 2, with upgraded graphics and mechanics, and more approachable for every culture, over the 8 years that this game has existed.","June 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/purerandomosity/recommended/349720/","purerandomosity","PureRandomosity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/purerandomosity/","4 products in account","TLDR: Average age is 16-20. Try all the modes. Beatup = DDR, GuitarHero/Rockband=Guitar Mode Check out the Redbana Forums.\nAfter all the 8-9 ish years I've played it, Audition Online  is a great game!  Years ago, at first when I tried it, it took a long time to get used to, but I cant stress this enough.Try to explore all the modes! I didnt do so hot in some modes but I really excel in others! The mode most similar to DDR is Beat Up and Block Beat! The most most similar to Guitar Hero/ Rockband is the Guitar Mode (of course)! If you would like to enhance your gameplay (with 8k,C9 and beat up for example), you will need a numpad.The game really varies more than the normal mode you see upon the tutorial (in my opinion it's outdated and could use an upgrade to go over all the other modes). .You can look at a glimpse of them with the video provided. You can see how to play modes in depth (just a mini guide) by pressing f12 in the game room.\n\nCommunity: As far as the community goes , it's nice!  The age range is about ages 16-20.  In-game, most high levels would seem intimidating to approach at first, but they are willing to lend a helping hand if you need to (like myself xD) ! You see familiar faces if you stick around for a bit! There are times where the game would show more locked rooms than unlocked but it depends on the times you're on. I know most players are fluent in English (the most prominent) but a few circles do speak fluent Spanish,German, Viet and Portugese which I learned quite a bit for my language skills LOL. You can also join FAMs and play in FAM battles together which is nice .There are suspicions of people hacking but the hacking doesn't occur as often as it used to be with Nexon. A huge huge majority of the population has leveled up on their own without the usage of hacks and bots. Any that were caught doing so have been banned. If there are any suspicions of hacks it would be done privately and submitted in a ticket.\n\nMusic: If you're into different styles well be prepared because there are a lot of them. The genres do vary but expect to hear Korean and Spanish. And it's not really all one list for every mode you play. Some modes like ballroom will have its own set of songs and guitar mode will as well. I find that songs suitable to fit the types of modes is a well thought out process instead of sitcking to 1 list for everything.\n\nGame Currency:  BEATS are rather difficult to acquire when you don't have a ring/garden to work with. You would have to depend on Battle Parties which are fun but they're time consuming before you can spend your beats in mall on the higher items.  Time it would take to get 1,000,000 beats in battle party would take about 30 min - an hour depending on the amount you choose. With a couple ring and doing garden, you can get around 2-3 million beats in a day without having to play any games. Another thing I like about it is you can get coupons for your CASH items at anytime using time box.\n\nTournaments: As far as tournaments go, most of them start but there are a few that dont due to the lack of players entering the tournament that day. The current number required for a tournament to start should be fixed. That's really my only issue I've had with the game.\n\nThere is a forum website : forums.redbana.com that players can communicate on about the inner workings of the game if an error occurs,  BANA CASH from GM and player hosted events and a graphics/drawings to show your creative side!\n\nTIP: To run Audition in windows mode, you'll have to download the original client for now or try downloading the Audition Xpatcher http://forums.jordantrudgett.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=31 and click run Audition. Its always been the alternative patch to the original one for a few years now. Surely its not through steam, but it will save you time having to redownload the original redbana site patcher until they make a windowed mode for steam.\n\nHope to see you guys soon! -Badass","June 4, 2015","true","104.4"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","17","36","2","3"

You don't play Audition, Audition plays you! Oh, but if you're looking for the in-game volume settings, press ctrl + S when you're in game. Solves everything, right? No???\n\nI don't want to make this too long winded, so in short:\n\n- If you like rhythm games definitely do give it a try, there are a lot of modes so there's bound to be something for you\n\n- The learning curve is steep and the in-game tutorial isn't great. It's frustrating, and you have to be prepared for that\n\n- On a similar note, it's extremely difficult to master, so you're constantly able to challenge yourself (...and others)\n\n- Do not play alone!! Audition is a social game, plus being a noob on your own is not fun and will probably make you quit\n\n- Despite being free to play it does obviously have a cash shop, but you can play 99% of the game no problem without ever spending anything. Most of the benefits of the cash shop are only cosmetic. The rest won't matter to you unless you get really into the game\n\nI'm not going to lie and say Audition is a perfect game because it most certainly is not. But if you enjoy rhythm games and you are looking for something new I do recommend trying it!\n\nP.S.

There are a variety of modes to choose from and many people prefer certain modes over others. If you don't like one mode, it's perfectly fine because it all comes down to personal preference. There are many more to choose from but keep in mind that the game itself requires effort and time to see improvement. Most players are well-rounded/decent in all modes because they are willing to learn and try most of the modes. As a dance-related and rhythm based game, there is certainly a competing aspect to Audition. The game is set-up in such a way that allows one to increase/decrease the level of difficulty accordingly. For instance, the speed (BPM) of a song and the level of a mode affects how easy/hard it is to play. Generally, the game is not all about the competition, there are also social aspects of the game which enable players to have fun and socialize with people from around the world, not only limited to North America. The fashion mall also allows one to showcase his/her fashion sense which is a bonus if you like to style up!\n\nIGN: Optimism","June 4, 2015","true","1.8"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","0"

I love the community and all the amazing friends I've made through this game. ^___^ They've become really close friends to me and I'm so glad I met them through this game. The clothes are also pretty cute although need monies $$$. But that's all games hueee. Some songs on the game are pretty good too. I've downloaded some on my phone. Yay new music~ Wish they would release more songs often though.\n\nIGN: Honk","June 6, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The game itself is entirely skill based, and you can play completely free. Paying involves making your character look nicer, special effects and items to help you level faster. There’s a variety of game modes eg. CC4, Freestyle, block beat and many more. Meaning you aren’t constantly having to play one mode, which can get tedious and boring. There’s also a variety of music and different back ground settings, to make playing the game more enjoyable. Another plus to this game would be the community, through my 3yrs of Audi almost everyone I’ve met are nice and lovely. Making friends is all the more fun when playing this game.\n\nOn the other hand, the downsides to this game would be the slow patches and instances of hackers. Furthermore, cash items can be on the slightly more expensive side. However, I believe this game is definitely worth a try!  It’s definitely a keep practicing to get better type of game, so starting can be slightly frustrating.\n\nAll in all, I have to say this game is really fun, and I’ve met some amazing people through this game.

There are a variety of modes in which to play, and a wide selection of songs as well. Basically, there's a lot to do here so that never gets boring. To be honest, I would have probably not stayed around so long had it not been for the long-time friends I was able to make. I first started playing Audition since late 2009 (with long time breaks in-between, but ya know) thinking nothing of it, just a normal game that I'd probably get bored after a couple months. However, here I am, still here. I still manage to come back to this game. This is the only game that I've ever been this into, and it's mainly due to the great friends you come across =] Although this Audition doesn't have a lot of people in it, the ones you make are irreplacable. Yes, the modes are hard to play at first, but that's what keeps you coming back, striving to get better. All in all, I do recommend trying out this game.

Audition is not just a game, Audition is a lifestyle; Audition is about competition, about family, about friends, about tears. I remember I was 12 when I started to play this game and I  was completely fascinated of people,  their relationships, their friendships while I was just a child, who no one was talking to. So I promised myself that I'm going to level up, I'm going to become one of the best players in game and people will recognize my name. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I made new friends, I lost others, I was happy, I was dissappointed, I learnt how to care and to have feelings for persons I have never met.

Other than rockband, its the only rhythm game I play consistently because it is very challenging and extrememly sociable. Most rhythm games (from my experience) are single player or local co-op. As someone who doesn't have many rhythm gamer IRL friends, I really enjoy Audition Online because not only do I find it fun, but I can meet and become friends with a ton of great people playing Audition Online. Its a fairly small game / community and nearly everyone is very nice and sociable.\n\nI frown at redbana for paying people to write good reviews because than the reviews don't give honest opinions and recommendations to new players seriously looking for a new game to play. This review will most likely get buried under all the other positive reviews, but if you are reading this and are thinking about playing audition, look me up in game "Mokraton" and I'd love to play with you ^_^ <3.\n\nGl hf.

It's more fun to play with friends rather than alone. I made many new friends a few years ago and still talk to some of them today.\nThe music playlist is pretty alright, songs are worth playing but not worth enough to put on your everyday music playlist.\nThere are plenty of modes to play, you don't have to stick to one. There is 4-key, 8-key, team choreography, couple games like ballroom or couple mode, beat up, etc. I really love Crazy 8k and beat rush, those modes are the only ones that interests me.\nIt takes a lot of practice to get good at a mode. It requires persistence and determination. Newbies can get discouraged easily because they can't match up to the people who have been playing many years. Practice is key.\nYou don't have to be single anymore! You can get married, do love parties, gather hearts by couple garden, and even nurture a baby!\nI suggest people should find a fam or family. It is similar to a guild compared to other games. It's really nice to see people bond as a family. You can fam battle or go against other fams to see which fam's skills is better.\nThe mall is full of super cute clothing, but you have to spend real money in order to look fabulous.\nThe community is pretty nice and helpful. The community of the forums, in my opinion, is better than the game community. I spend more time on there than the game itself.\nThere are negatives to this game regarding the updates and management, but I won't share them here.\n\n\nHit me up if you're interested in talking to me or have any questions regarding the game. : )\nIGN: Seyeon","June 8, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was expecting them to have implemented NEW graphic options and the ability to turn down the sound ingame (kinda went deaf upon starting up and not finding that menu, if it happens to exist?)... But, they have done nothing about the graphic options. Playing on a 24' monitor with a resolution of what, 800x600? is not fun at all.. The game feels worse than it is because of this.

Come 2009, I quit because of technical issues and thought I would never play the game again. I honestly completely forgot about the game under one day in 2014 I somehow heard a song that I remembered was from Audition. Overcome by an extreme sense of nostalgia, I searched up the game, was surprised to find out that it still existed, and re-downloaded it immediately. I expected to only dabble in the game for a short while to satisfy my nostalgia, but it was too late--I was addicted again, and have been very active ever since.\n\n\nNow why is this game so addicting? Well, there's a variety of possible reasons, since there's so many things about the game that could make it addicting.\n\nThe most common reason would be the community. Many of the active players have been playing this game for years, so they know each other quite well. The game doesn't have many players when you compare it to more popular games, but that makes this game have a close-knit community. Even if you never talk to some people, if you play at least semi-actively you can recognize the IGNs of various other players. Like every game, there's going to be people you like and people you don't like. But the people you get along with can make the game so much more worth playing. You can join a FAM, which is like a guild, and the easiest way to make friends. You can also get a "couple" and get married, and enjoy various features of the Audition marriage, including gaining couple points and taking care of your own couple garden.\n\nOf course, the gameplay itself is Audition's main feature. Audition is a rhythm-based game that features various "modes" you can play. You don't necessary have to play all modes, but the most commonly-played one is the "Normal" mode, which involves pressing a specified sequence of keys and pressing Spacebar or Ctrl at the correct beat. The Normal mode itself consists of various different modes as well. When most people first take a peek at the game they think that it's like DDR on the computer, but in actuality the only modes that are somewhat similar to DDR are Beat Up and Block Beat. I would go into detail of all the various modes, but the best way to learn is to play the game yourself.\n\nLike many other games, you can "level up" on Audition. When you play with other people, you gain EXP. After you gain a certain amount of EXP from playing a number of games, you reach the "license mode." This is only applicable after level 5. In order to level up past level 5, you must pass this license mode in order to reach the next level. The license mode will be a certain Normal mode and a certain song depending on the level you're about to reach. You must pass certain requirements involving the "combo," amounts of "Perfects," and the score.\nSome people have a goal to reach a certain level. There's this culture of "EXP spamming" in which people accumulate various EXP multipliers and play a certain mode on the shortest song. This is generally more common among people of higher levels, as much more EXP is required as your character increases in level.\n\nAnother popular aspect of the game is the shopping mall. Audition has a wide selection of clothing that is mostly Korean in style since this game originated in South Korea. You can buy "beats" clothes, which has a small, relatively decent selection of clothing that is rarely to never updated. The upside to this is that beats clothes don't require any real money, as beats are Audition's in-game currency. You can also buy "cash" clothing, which offers a wide variety of clothing that usually gets updated at least once a month. Bana Cash can be bought with real money through various mediums such as credit card, GoCash game cards, and now Steam Wallet. Cash clothing can be bought for various time intervals: you can buy them for 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or indefinitely. The quantity of cash required per outfit doubles with the aforementioned time intervals. Something to note is that not all cash clothing can be bought indefinitely; however, the selection of indefinite clothing is updated once every few months.\n\nThere is also something called a "Tournament," which exists for certain different modes at specified times, everyday. Here you can find some of the best players of each mode as they battle it out for the final goal--the medal. Tournaments can get quite competitive, but it is that competition that many players are looking for as they seek to improve themselves in certain modes.\n\n\nI don't play other rhythm games, so I can't really compare Audition with other rhythm games, but I definitely would recommend Audition to people looking for a rhythm game with a competitive yet welcoming community. If you have any questions about any aspect of the game, feel free to contact me, as I would be more than willing to help.\n\n\nTo all the new players, I welcome you to the community and hope you have a great time!\n\n\nIGN: Carma","June 8, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has one of the sharpest learning curves that I've come across, and easily the most difficult multiplayer rhythm game out there to pick up and play.\n\nThe community is pretty small, and overall pretty nice.\n\nAs of now, songs are plentiful, but they're mostly underground/mainstream EDM and Korean music.\n\nThere is only one p2w aspect to the game and even then nobody uses it because it helps very little. It's also disabled in any competitive modes, which is great.\n\nThis game as one fatal flaw - it's a game from 2006 that hasn't aged well at all. No graphics options in-game (uses all settings from your drivers, and even then it only picks up drivers from nvidia cards because this game uses OpenGL). 1024x768 locked resolution. Windows 8.1 compatibility issues out of the box (issue with a certain KB update). Anti-cheat issues with certain programs. The list goes on and on. I can't see a typical new user with no experience with these types of games genuinely enjoying Audition when theres a lot of options that PC gamers expect to see with any game blatantly missing.\n\nIf you can deal with those flaws, give Audition a try. Otherwise, Audition's sequel should be coming over to the West in a year or so (World In Audition). It is a MUCH better game, albeit having some minor differences that regular Audition players come to expect. If World In Audition came to Steam, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nIGN - Voltex","June 8, 2015","false","51.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has its pros and cons like any other game. I constantly find myself quitting and coming back to this game. I'm pretty sure a lot of players find themselves doing this. Even if we find this gaming extremely outdated or boring for some reason it always charms its way back into our desktops.\n\nPROS:\n* There are different types of modes for this rhythm based game that can be comparable to other games\n* There is a now growing community, but even at its lowest of moments there are loyal players\n* There are geniunely nice people in game (however of course there are bad ones as well)\n* Story modes create a sense of togetherness by having other players play together and help another out\n* There are daily tournaments\n* A large selection of clothing in the mall\n* There are many events held for players that are posted on both the Facebook page and Redbana forum\n* You can get married and have level up rings to look forward to\n* It is a social game\n* New songs and cash items come every so often\n* A very unique community (people are very strange on Audition, in a good way!)\n* There are also FAMs (similar to clans or guilds) which can also battle other ones (with rankings)\n* Friendly GMs and community advisors\n\nCONS:\n* Not the best songs out there compared to other Audition servers and are not appropriate at times\n* Doesn't make sense that cuss words are censored in games but are in the songs\n* Even with XTRAP software there are still hackers\n* Sometimes it seems like there is favourtism in the game\n* This game costs a lot of money to look fabulous (x8 the one week item is the cost to indefinite) I've personally spent over two grand on this game and have been hacked on one of my accounts recently. It's asisine that you can sell indefinite cash items for beats, this is just asking for hackers to make people miserable.  Ring breaking is also tragic, but I won't get into that\n* If you don't have friends to play with or have trouble making friends then the game itself can get pretty boring\n* The graphics are outdated and we cannot change settings other than volume control by using CTRL + S\n* Does not properly support Windows 8 and 8.1 users\n* AUDI DRAMA (you'll know it when you see it!)\n\nBut overall, I have always recommended this game to my friends to play with me for fun. It's always nice to go hiatus and come back to meet people from the past to reminisce. We don't play for the quality of the game, we play because of the memories we make! The game is also fun too, if you're good at it  LOL\n\nTech support is alright, what can you expect from a free to play game that's trying to survive. It's finally having a second wind though because of the new Steam players!\n\nI hope this was helpful. Enjoy your time in our Audition world if you choose to join us all!\n\nIGN: Ascalon","June 8, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other than rockband, its the only rhythm game I play consistently because it is very challenging and extrememly sociable. Most rhythm games (from my experience) are single player or local co-op. As someone who doesn't have many rhythm gamer IRL friends, I really enjoy Audition Online because not only do I find it fun, but I can meet and become friends with a ton of great people playing Audition Online. Its a fairly small game / community and nearly everyone is very nice and sociable.\n\nI frown at redbana for paying people to write good reviews because than the reviews don't give honest opinions and recommendations to new players seriously looking for a new game to play. This review will most likely get buried under all the other positive reviews, but if you are reading this and are thinking about playing audition, look me up in game "Mokraton" and I'd love to play with you ^_^ <3.\n\nGl hf.

But it all depends on how willing you are to being social and getting to know people. I've been on and off this game since I started and although I may make it seem bad, I still come back to it for a different style of game.\n\nAlthough I can't say how audition is now since I'm not as active as I was before, but I do enjoy meeting new people! :)\n\nIGN: Chihiro","June 8, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Altough the fact that they could ♥♥♥♥ up such a easy/simple ''game'' is soul breaking. First of all they just throw you into this dance/music world ( don't know what I'm supossed to call it ) then they just leave you there dying to figure out how the game works. After you've finally found out how the game works and all that stuff. You will be left helpless trying to beat this so called ''easy'' difficulty song, where you then will have a mental breakdown.\n\nThe bad things about the game:\n-The fact that you can't even quit the current song that you are playing is just so absurd that you just wanna spam alt+f4.\n-The game is nearly impossible if you were to play on a low-budget keyboard.\n-The game mechanics is so broken that they will make you yell out loud The first thing that comes to your head.\n-To actually enter a combo you'll need to press space after struggling with the Up-Down-Right-Left keys.\n-The graphics are like playing a game blind.\n\nThe good things:\n-First of all the concept of the game is just amazing.\n-The community is friendly, or atleast I think so.

As someone who doesn't have many rhythm gamer IRL friends, I really enjoy Audition Online because not only do I find it fun, but I can meet and become friends with a ton of great people playing Audition Online. Its a fairly small game / community and nearly everyone is very nice and sociable.\n\nI frown at redbana for paying people to write good reviews because than the reviews don't give honest opinions and recommendations to new players seriously looking for a new game to play.

Course it helps that I take breaks every once in a while when life catches up to me but there's always something to do on there. Like some of the comments have mentioned, Beside having a variety of 'modes', Audition is also a hotspot for meeting people. I have come across many great online friends over the years whom I would have never met if it weren't for Audition. So I am eternally grateful so to speak, and yes I would be devastated to learn one day that I were no longer able to play- I mean yeah I'd survive, but to lose the option of being able to get on once more- ouch. Like I said, it's a part of me!\n\nBASICALLY, if you're into music, button-mashing, somewhat decent to bad graphics depending on how you look at it, and random amusing conversations with strangers who don't necessarily have to be strangers for long go ahead and try it out, DON'T expect too much from it- just have fun.  :) Just my opinion, everyone is allowed to have their own!","February 28","true","225.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/netram/recommended/349720/","netram","ePick XxcLuTcH_W1Z4RDxX 420","http://steamcommunity.com/id/netram/","213 products in account","This game is a fantastic example of how to make a great MMORPG with very few flaws.\n\nIf "being too Asian" is going to disuade you then you are simply limiting yourself to a much smaller pool of games. That being said, a great selection of the available music is, as best as I can describe it, "Asian music." Basically everything sounds like the genre K-Pop which I discovered and inspected for a matter of moments before I could conclude it was not the genre for me. I say "basically everything," but there are also a good amount of other great songs by popular artists such as The Weeknd and Childish Gambino. There are others you may recognize as well, but I am not quite musically cultured and mainly prefer rap and hip-hop. In addition to songs from various recognizable artists, the game also has a plethora of original tracks (albeit quite Asian).\n\nMusic being too Asian is an understandable reason to avoid playing, but if you can get past that, you have a regular Asian game with the intended audience being the youth. Children's Asian game sounds bad off bat, but the childish part is simply the fact that you aren't going out to slaughter bad guys in dark dungeons to gain loot. One of the greatest parts about this game is that there is no "loot," but simply cosmetic items that you buy with in-game or real-life currency.\n\nI am not very far into the game, but the pay-to-win elements are quite miniscule. There are some weird things that you have to pay for yourself, but I am not convinced that you are unable to obtain them without spending money on the game as I have received many "cash items" through chance boxes and other events that trigger rewards. Odd things you have to purchase (but may be able to obtain via alternative means) include an upgraded messenger, a wedding ticket, and an item that hides your level. They're kind of weird, and I hope you can receive these via alternative means, but I don't know if they're completely necessary for f2p players. For instance, I have no clue what the upgraded messenger does for you. What you should note is that you can pay for 3x cards for beats (in-game currency) and experience. This may help you either obtain more cosmetic items or level up faster respectively, but what one should note is that in order to level up (after the first few levels) you must pass a "license test" which is based off of your skill in the game. You will not obtain levels without having the skill to surpass the level you are on and that is one feature of this game that I think is quite beautiful.\n\nThe entire game is skill-based. There are some "Asian-y" or childish nuances, but past that is a great rhythm game with an incredibly high skill ceiling. Jumping into this game, you could be a master from experience with past games, or you could be completely terrible and not even able to pass the level 7 license test because you can't string together 2 perfects to save your life. The thrill of going for a license test is awesome and always excites me.\n\nWhat I think many people may miss when it comes to conceiving an opinion on this game, is that it's just a damn fun social game. You can become a couple and get married to someone you meet online, or your real life significant other. You can dress up in weird outfits with your friends and try your hardest to dance in-sync. And best of all, you can just compete with your friends and prove who the best dancer is. The incredibly high skill-ceiling allows you to always be improving which is made easier and less repetitive by an incredibly long track list with songs varying from 80 to 190 beats per minute.\n\nOf course, at the end of the day, you're just pressing buttons to make your character dance some pretty silly (kind of overly-feminine at times) dance moves, wearing some super Asian outfit to super Asian music, but damn do I love it and wish more people would play it. This is seriously a great game and I hope that any fan of rhythm games try this out because at its core, this game is a fantastic rhythm game that even veterans of other games will have trouble mastering.\n\nGive this game a shot with a friend and see just how fun it can be","April 6","true","62.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After a solid 1 hour of dancing to songs that only a spider could get decent scores on (anything over 100 bpm) and dancing to songs that where the equivalent of ****ing off for 3 minuets that goal was no where within reach (I think it doesnt support gay couples)\n\nIn conclution this game has really a weird difficulty curve, explains things very poorly, has a locked 800x600 resolution, has graphics from 2005 and doesnt support the LGBT comunity...This is why me and my colleague are giving the game a positive rating.\n10/10 guys good job.","June 21, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

You have all this stuff on your screen, you can't customize your character at all unless you got the money and levels, and when we're looking at actually dancing in the game it is near impossible if your reaction time isn't the speed of light. The first few levels of dancing(1-3) are easy, (4-6) semi difficult, and the rest are impossible in my opinion.\n\nIf you can't register what arrow keys you have to press in the amount of time they give you to do so, or in other words if you're a bit slow, this is not a game for you.","June 21, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Go into the game with your own friends and have some nostalgic fun. Do not go in there thinking you'll meet nice people. Most of these people are scum and that's why most of the rooms are locked - to keep them out.\n\nEdit: On reflection, it was once a great game. A different server makes a world of difference.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrau/recommended/349720/","jrau","Passenger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrau/","91 products in account","Honest review\nI've been playing this game since Nexon (approx 7 years). This game has its pros and cons like any other game. I constantly find myself quitting and coming back to this game. I'm pretty sure a lot of players find themselves doing this. Even if we find this gaming extremely outdated or boring for some reason it always charms its way back into our desktops.\n\nPROS:\n* There are different types of modes for this rhythm based game that can be comparable to other games\n* There is a now growing community, but even at its lowest of moments there are loyal players\n* There are geniunely nice people in game (however of course there are bad ones as well)\n* Story modes create a sense of togetherness by having other players play together and help another out\n* There are daily tournaments\n* A large selection of clothing in the mall\n* There are many events held for players that are posted on both the Facebook page and Redbana forum\n* You can get married and have level up rings to look forward to\n* It is a social game\n* New songs and cash items come every so often\n* A very unique community (people are very strange on Audition, in a good way!)\n* There are also FAMs (similar to clans or guilds) which can also battle other ones (with rankings)\n* Friendly GMs and community advisors\n\nCONS:\n* Not the best songs out there compared to other Audition servers and are not appropriate at times\n* Doesn't make sense that cuss words are censored in games but are in the songs\n* Even with XTRAP software there are still hackers\n* Sometimes it seems like there is favourtism in the game\n* This game costs a lot of money to look fabulous (x8 the one week item is the cost to indefinite) I've personally spent over two grand on this game and have been hacked on one of my accounts recently. It's asisine that you can sell indefinite cash items for beats, this is just asking for hackers to make people miserable.  Ring breaking is also tragic, but I won't get into that\n* If you don't have friends to play with or have trouble making friends then the game itself can get pretty boring\n* The graphics are outdated and we cannot change settings other than volume control by using CTRL + S\n* Does not properly support Windows 8 and 8.1 users\n* AUDI DRAMA (you'll know it when you see it!)\n\nBut overall, I have always recommended this game to my friends to play with me for fun. It's always nice to go hiatus and come back to meet people from the past to reminisce. We don't play for the quality of the game, we play because of the memories we make! The game is also fun too, if you're good at it  LOL\n\nTech support is alright, what can you expect from a free to play game that's trying to survive. It's finally having a second wind though because of the new Steam players!\n\nI hope this was helpful. Enjoy your time in our Audition world if you choose to join us all!\n\nIGN: Ascalon","June 8, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game gives opportunities for competition (player vs. player skill battles), a wide selection of modes (guitar, boys vs. girls, perf champ, ballroom etc.), fashion (a huge selection of clothes!), as well as long lasting friendships/relationships.

I completely stopped playing this game probably about 6 years ago and just downloaded this game when I suddenly found it here on steam.\n\nAudition is fun, but I don't think this game would be very appealing to newcommers solely because of the way outdated graphics. I logged in, made my character, did the tutorial, and when I finally played a real game against other players, they were also old players. None of them were new ones despite having a low level character. The playerbase is pretty low as it can't even fill up 2 channels compared to the 5-6 channels full back in the day.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Not really, but I will rate this as yes because I don't think this game deserves a downvote. The game is not bad, it's just old.

Dancing and playing guitar.\n\nthe guitar gameplay is much like, as you would expect, guitar hero. except, your reactions need to be almost perfect when hitting each button or youre done for basically. it hasnt got the best responce time but is still fun to play. theres only one guitar game to play, so there isnt much variation to the mode. just play guitar, earn exp and beats. rinse and repeat.\n\nthe other main mode is dancing, which is by far the most popular part of the game. dancers taking up at least 99% of the games community. its difficult at first, but the only controls used are the arrows and space bar. (unless you change it up a little and do some kind of couple/club dance where you use f1 f2 and f3)\n\nthis game is fun and challenging, no doubt about it. graphics are not what make a game, it works just fine and just about anyone can play.","June 28, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clearwaterz/recommended/349720/","clearwaterz","SoHK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clearwaterz/","4 products in account","I have history with this game, before it was available on Steam, Before Redbanna ran it, I played back since Nexon and it's a game I come back to time and time again.\n\nI've met so many different kinds of people via Audition, and it's been around for a lot of rough years for me, honestly it probably helped me get through them, yes it is a game that people can arguably say requires little to no skills because yes it mainly consists of arrowkeys and the spacebar (and watching an anime-like figure dance on your screen, sometimes in unrealistic form- like when in s.b.boy the character drops through the floor boards or defies gravity haha), but I can tell anyone that although I have spent hours- years on this game, that I have nowhere near mastered it. Course it helps that I take breaks every once in a while when life catches up to me but there's always something to do on there. Like some of the comments have mentioned, Beside having a variety of 'modes', Audition is also a hotspot for meeting people. I have come across many great online friends over the years whom I would have never met if it weren't for Audition. So I am eternally grateful so to speak, and yes I would be devastated to learn one day that I were no longer able to play- I mean yeah I'd survive, but to lose the option of being able to get on once more- ouch. Like I said, it's a part of me!\n\nBASICALLY, if you're into music, button-mashing, somewhat decent to bad graphics depending on how you look at it, and random amusing conversations with strangers who don't necessarily have to be strangers for long go ahead and try it out, DON'T expect too much from it- just have fun.  :) Just my opinion, everyone is allowed to have their own!","February 28","true","225.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/netram/recommended/349720/","netram","ePick XxcLuTcH_W1Z4RDxX 420","http://steamcommunity.com/id/netram/","213 products in account","This game is a fantastic example of how to make a great MMORPG with very few flaws.\n\nIf "being too Asian" is going to disuade you then you are simply limiting yourself to a much smaller pool of games. That being said, a great selection of the available music is, as best as I can describe it, "Asian music." Basically everything sounds like the genre K-Pop which I discovered and inspected for a matter of moments before I could conclude it was not the genre for me. I say "basically everything," but there are also a good amount of other great songs by popular artists such as The Weeknd and Childish Gambino. There are others you may recognize as well, but I am not quite musically cultured and mainly prefer rap and hip-hop. In addition to songs from various recognizable artists, the game also has a plethora of original tracks (albeit quite Asian).\n\nMusic being too Asian is an understandable reason to avoid playing, but if you can get past that, you have a regular Asian game with the intended audience being the youth. Children's Asian game sounds bad off bat, but the childish part is simply the fact that you aren't going out to slaughter bad guys in dark dungeons to gain loot. One of the greatest parts about this game is that there is no "loot," but simply cosmetic items that you buy with in-game or real-life currency.\n\nI am not very far into the game, but the pay-to-win elements are quite miniscule. There are some weird things that you have to pay for yourself, but I am not convinced that you are unable to obtain them without spending money on the game as I have received many "cash items" through chance boxes and other events that trigger rewards. Odd things you have to purchase (but may be able to obtain via alternative means) include an upgraded messenger, a wedding ticket, and an item that hides your level. They're kind of weird, and I hope you can receive these via alternative means, but I don't know if they're completely necessary for f2p players. For instance, I have no clue what the upgraded messenger does for you. What you should note is that you can pay for 3x cards for beats (in-game currency) and experience. This may help you either obtain more cosmetic items or level up faster respectively, but what one should note is that in order to level up (after the first few levels) you must pass a "license test" which is based off of your skill in the game. You will not obtain levels without having the skill to surpass the level you are on and that is one feature of this game that I think is quite beautiful.\n\nThe entire game is skill-based. There are some "Asian-y" or childish nuances, but past that is a great rhythm game with an incredibly high skill ceiling. Jumping into this game, you could be a master from experience with past games, or you could be completely terrible and not even able to pass the level 7 license test because you can't string together 2 perfects to save your life. The thrill of going for a license test is awesome and always excites me.\n\nWhat I think many people may miss when it comes to conceiving an opinion on this game, is that it's just a damn fun social game. You can become a couple and get married to someone you meet online, or your real life significant other. You can dress up in weird outfits with your friends and try your hardest to dance in-sync. And best of all, you can just compete with your friends and prove who the best dancer is. The incredibly high skill-ceiling allows you to always be improving which is made easier and less repetitive by an incredibly long track list with songs varying from 80 to 190 beats per minute.\n\nOf course, at the end of the day, you're just pressing buttons to make your character dance some pretty silly (kind of overly-feminine at times) dance moves, wearing some super Asian outfit to super Asian music, but damn do I love it and wish more people would play it. This is seriously a great game and I hope that any fan of rhythm games try this out because at its core, this game is a fantastic rhythm game that even veterans of other games will have trouble mastering.\n\nGive this game a shot with a friend and see just how fun it can be","April 6","true","62.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played Audition several years ago when it was owned by the company Nexon. Since then, they've given ownership to RedBana. This transition, however, was NOT for the better. When I played the game a while back, it was about skill and meeting others who could help you through challenges and such. Now, the servers are filled with password-locked lobbies that have one or two people in them. Also, there's mainly ONE server to even play on. During Nexon days, there were several. It's a shame to see this game going down such a bad path. It had potential.\n\nUnless you want to TRY to relive some nostalgia and then be dissapointed, I would suggest staying away from Audition Online. Trust me, you're not missing out.","April 30","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a Korean StarCraft 2 World Champion with 700 APM.\n\nWhen I first started, I had high hopes that this game could be the DDR clone we rhythm game fans have been searching for, but all it did was slap me in the face. It's unforgiving to newer players just trying to get into the game and the controls are unresponsive as balls.\n\nThat leads me into the lobbies. THEY'RE AWFUL. Half the time, you won't know the difficulty until 50 notes fly at your screen faster than the speed of light. And don't even try to create your own lobby as at most, 2-3 people max will show up and leave within minutes.\n\nI would skip this game if you know what's good for you.","May 23","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)\n\nPut the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.\n\nWhisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.\n\nScoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.\n","June 6","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
