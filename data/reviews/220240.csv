"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035983319/recommended/220240/","76561198035983319","(NQR) Reaver76","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035983319/","113 products in account","Price (regular): $29.99 ($39.99 for deluxe)\nPrice (lowest): $7.49 (75% off)\nMy overall rating: 9.5/10Easily one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nValue: 9/10Most other games this age are already down to $20, however the singleplayer is a lot longer than most other action/shooter games, making it well worth the price.\n\nSingleplayer: 10/10Amazing singleplayer. Capturing outposts is probably the best part. There are over 30 spread over the massive map. The main story has some pretty good action too. Plus there is hunting, racing, and assassination side missions and a lot of other things that are a lot of fun.\n\nCo-op: 5/10 (2-4 players)Co-op has some serious issues. When the match tries to launch it almost always crashes or freezes when loading. Due to this you wont be able to find players unless you are playing with friends. When it works it is decent but doesnt have the openness that makes far cry great. Update: co-op has been working better lately.\n\nMultiplayer: 6.5/10The multiplayer is actually pretty good, but a little generic. Doesn't have enough players to reach its full potential though.\n\nContent: 9.5/10Both the co-op and multiplayer are pretty basic, but the singleplayer makes up for it. You of course have the story and outposts, but there is also tons of ruins and caves to be explored for relics and loot, side missions, trials, races, dlc missions, and even knife throwing and poker.\n\nLength: 10/10An average playthrough of the singleplayer will take you roughly 30 hours, doing the main storyline capturing all the outposts and doing most of the side missions.\n\nStory: 8/10The story really tries to be great and in some ways it is but also is a little flat. You and your friends are having the time of your life until getting caught by slavers on a remote island. You escape and have to save your friends and liberate the natives from the pirates in the process.\n\nGameplay: 10/10Very good, open gameplay. Most situations you can choose to attack however you like. Climb any mountain for a good vantage point with a sniper rifle, use stealth with a bow and using knife takedowns, attack head on with an lmg, or charge in with a truck with c4 planted on it.\n\nWith freinds: 6/10The co-op and multiplayer are pretty fun with friends but doesnt have a lot of substance.\n\nGraphics: 9/10Good graphics, very good considering the scale of the game.\n\nPhysics: 9.5/10Maybe not as smooth walking around a small area and shooting a few people as call of duty, but all in all the physics are a lot better than just about any other game. Driving really feels good. Good fire physics, you can light large areas of brush with a flamethrower.\n\nPerformance: 9/10Works good for the most part. Can easily play it on max setting with my laptop, core i7 4810mq @ 2.80 GHz (turbo to 3.80 GHz) 12gbs ram and gtx870m 3gbs dedicated. Haven't had any notable issues or bugs.\n\nSound: 8/10Sound is good but maybe a little rough here and there.\n\nPolished: 8/10Nothing majorly wrong with it but it does have the usual trees growing through rocks and animals spawning inside stuff.\n\nAtmosphere: 8.5/10The vast landscape gives you a good immersive feel but could be better if they didn't have so much of the same plants making it all feel the same.\n\nObjectives: 7/10Objectives are pretty basic. Pretty much go fight through these people and do (insert objective here). Some are a little more in depth.\n\nClarity: 9/10No problems with knowing where to go or what to do. The story line is linear and very easy to follow.\n\nWorld: 9.5/10Unparalleled world. Massive world with large mountains, caves, ruins, shanty towns, vast foliage, ocean, and tons of wildlife to try and kill you. Although most of the landscape has the same trees and plants so a lot of it looks the same.\n\nCharacters: 8/10The characters are interesting. The antagonists really make you want to kill them. All the characters are just a little thin but still good.\n\nUI: 6.5/10The menus are pretty poor. Pulling up your map is really slow. All other menus are in the escape menu which is pretty slow and not that great to navigate. Plus there's Uplay which is horrible.\n\nControls: 9/10Mostly standard controls. Not my favorite layout but close enough I didn't feel the need to change anything.\n\nFreedom: 10/10As much freedom as you could ask for. You can ignor your current mission to go off capturing outpost, doing side mission, or just go for a nature hike.\n\nInfluence: 2.5/10The story itself is very linear. Only choice in the game is the ending and what happens after.\n\nSettings: 9/10Four difficulty setting so good for most any skill level. Average control options.\n\nCharacter progression: 6/10Sometimes feels like they resticked what you can do at the beginning instead of allowing you to do more later on.\n\nWeapon selection: 9/10Has plenty of weapons. Handguns, SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns, LMGs, sniper rifles, launchers, explosives, and specials. Over 30 total, though some feel similar.\n\nCustomization: 7/10Most weapons can be modded. Higher level guns can have up to 3 mods. Mods incude extended mags, silencers, and several types of sights, though most guns are limited on which mods are available. Almost all weapons can be painted.\n\nAI: 8.5/10For the most part the ai is fairly intelegent. Considering what they have to do in an open world unrelated to a story, it's very good. Though this causes a few quirks.\n\nUp to date: 9/10Only came out at the end of 2012 and there isn't any notable aging to the game. Not lacking anything that newer games might have.\n\nReplayability: 8.5/10The story doesnt give incentive replay it, but since you can whatever you like however you like, the rest of the game has a lot of replay value.\n\nPace: 8.5/10For such a long game the balance between length and action is very good. You can go straight to the next mission, rush through a few outposts, or take your time doing everything at your own pace.\n\nRepetitiveness: 8/10If you were to just walk up with an assault rifle everytime it would probably get very repetitive, but change up your approach everytime and it won't be much at all.\n\nRealism: 8.5/10It has some good aspects and a few poor ones when it comes to how realistic it is. Even compared to other games the amount of people you are able to kill is a little ridiculous. It has some supernatural elements which isn't bad but they are a little lame and seem to be inspired by acid trips. Other than that it's actually got good physics and overall better than most games.\n\nDLC: 5/10The downloadable content is all pretty mediocre. A few independent short story missions that are okay, some co-op and multiplayer content, and a few other things that are all insignificant.\n\nAchievements: 6/1050 achievements but only on Uplay not Steam, and 6 are for co-op making them near impossible. The rest of the achievements are great. Good amount and some challenging but nothing too hard.\n\nTrading cards: N/ADoesn't have Steam badges/trading cards.\n\nSeries improvement: 10/10Far Cry 2 was a good game, however has aged a lot and lacked in a few aspects. Far Cry 3 did a great job at improving and made a very well rounded, good performing game.\n\nOriginality: 10/10Bottom line is that no other game is very much like Far Cry. Maybe slightly similar to games like Just Cause or some RPGs and it may have some Tomb Raider elements but not enough that its overall gameplay is at all the same as anything else.","November 14, 2014","true","80.0"," 977 of 1,060 people (92%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","92","977","1","47","36"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imhallows/recommended/220240/","imhallows","Hallows","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imhallows/","637 products in account","So, here's my final verdict for Far Cry 3. Well, I'm currently doing my fourth playthrough of the game (been doing every difficulty) And I still enjoy it just as much as when the first time I played it. I guess that tells you a little bit if the gameplay/story is good, if not, let me go deeper into it.\n\n\nStory:\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I'm going to briefly tell you what the game is about. You're jason, some guy who was on a nice trip with his friends until everything went downhill. You find yourself caged with your brother on an island full of crazy pirates.\nThen you have Vaas, in my opinion one of the coolest villains ever in video game history. Actually, I'm not gonna tell you anything about him, why don't you just get the game and take a look yourself? Throughout the game, you become more powerful, powerful enough to decide you want to take down the people who run the Islands. Are you able to do so, though? You can only find out yourself. There are 2 different endings.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\n\nFar Cry 3 offers a LOT. It's not your regular shooter, no, It's more like.. Hmm, It's quite hard to say really. On Rook Island, you can find plants, animals and useful gear to upgrade your Jason with. You do this by crafting either ammo pouches, medicine, or useful items that can make hunting a little easier. There's quite a lot of different weapons to find/buy, and they all seem to be pretty damn well done. I didn't find any guns that seem underpowered. A single playthrough of the game should take you well over 20 hours, maybe even 30, if you take your time to explore the amazing landscape and secrets the island has to offer. I don't want to go on too much, so I'm just gonna leave you guys to decide wether or not to get the game. Would I recommend it? YES. Absolutely YES. There's nothing you can go wrong with here. Oh, before I miss it, this game support MODS. If you want more of a challenge, try out Ziggy's Mod. It makes the game a lot more challenging by removing the hud, spotting and free weapons.\n\n\nMy final verdict for Far Cry 3 is a 9/10. Only because it wasn't a perfect game, I still wish the multiplayer could be worked on a bit more, but the 9 goes to the singleplayer alone. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope you'll get your hands on this amazing game. :)","November 25, 2013","true","72.8"," 1,004 of 1,107 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","004","1","0","49"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/diana_raluca/recommended/220240/","diana_raluca","Queen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/diana_raluca/","35 products in account","Far Cry 3 is maybe one of those games that really would put anyone in the protagonist's feelings. It is an open world game that makes you think throughout any kind of missions such as stealth, dinamic or other ways of dominating outposts and the entire island.\n\nUnlike Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3 is more into the first game made from the Far Cry series, in the way that the action is based on a dangerous, hostile island and the protagonist has to make his way to get away from it. The storyline is as thrilling as it can be, stuck on a place you do not know, pirates, enemies, predators, all sorts of plants that you have to collect so you can survive, an insane journey.\n\nThe main character has little battle and combat experience, so he has to learn how to survive from scratch, little supplies, he is going to be helped by many people who will soon become his buddies/friends. During the game, you have to gain the "tatau", which is their way of calling "tattoos". They are essential from the beginning of the game to the very end; they are the symbols of a whole, representing the skills you have to gain in order to finish Far Cry 3.\n\nOne more interesting fact is introducing the bow. The protagonist can finally use the bow and customize it in the way the player wants to, paint it, use different arrows etc.\n\nLast but not least, there are lost loots, lost letters, relics, radio towers to activate (to free new guns) and other things that need you to be discovered, in the game, you can play games such as poker, throwing knives, car races, in order to gain or lose (in bad luck :/) money.\n\nI have played this game for more than 30 hours, and I can say i have not finished even half of it (the storyline is excellent). The missions, outposts, helping people in need, searching for artifacts and so on is just amazing for any of us to try.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is willing to try it :)\n\nThank you for reading this review, I would also like to ask, my readers, to comment upon this review, whether good or bad, I would be more than pleased to know your pieces of advice. ^_^","January 12","true","53.8"," 198 of 220 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","198","220","13","15"

The only thing I can think of that is missing is an actual volcano, otherwise the two islands that make up this game's playable area are everything you'd expect on a tropical island. The addition of wildlife in this game adds such an aspect of realism, I found myself stalking a tiger just to watch him take down a deer or goat. This addition also adds a new type of terror/suspense to the game. There is nothing like quickly trying to escape a firefight that you plundered into, running through the jungle and finally escaping your assailants, just to be mauled and pummeled by a tiger. While the resilience and toughness of some of the animals detracts from realism, it certainly adds to the anxiety.\n\nThe firefights, especially towards the beginning are very intense. Until you unlock enough of the "skills" to boost your health bars and make body armor more effective, only a couple of bullets will drop you on the intermediate setting. However this is followed by most of the enemies being easily eliminated by a small string of fire to center mass. What is different for this game is the implementation of cover. While the system is a little rough around the edges, it does allow you to hide behind cover and then peek out and fire rounds off at hostiles.\n\nThe challenge in this game comes mostly from the improved use of enemy AI. While they are still not brilliant, they do notice sounds and are spooked by finding their buddy lying dead on the ground. The enemy itself will work together to suppress and kill you, as well as take cover to hide from your fire. The confrontations with some of the islands predators is also challenging, as well as occasionally terrifying, though the idea of a shark attack bothers me anyways. The enemies are also specialized, making some of them quite difficult to kill and makes plotting strikes against enemy establishments require careful and thorough planning.\n\nThe game overall is worth every penny just for the single player. The addition to weapon customizations and the improved system controls, should also make this an interesting and likely worthy multiplayer. This game has a few small quirks, and no one should expect a Shakespeare story, but you should expect hours of thrills and plenty of enjoyment.","December 2, 2013","true","35.9"," 304 of 365 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","304","365","0","13"

I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.\nIf you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.\n\nHow I Found Out About "Far Cry 3"Well, where to start. To put it simply, I rented Far Cry 3 on the Ps3 a little while after it came out. After it's release, weeks went by, as I heard more and more about Far Cry 3. Nothing was spoiled, but I heard so many good things about it. At the time, I really didn't have the money, so I decided to rent the game, like I use to do back in the day.\n\nAfter picking up the game, I was able to play through about half of it, before needing to take it back. However, around Christmas, my parents got me Far Cry 3 on the Ps3 and I was able to finish my adventure.\n\nAbout six months after that, I saw the Deluxe Edition of Far Cry 3 on sale on Steam, and picked it up. Then things became really good.\n\nUnfair FIrst ImpressionsEvery game genre gets hate by some people. Mainly because of opinions, which is okay. There are genre' I don't like, and others I do. However, the main thing I see about Far Cry 3 in reviews that give it a low score is.....Uplay. Why, oh why must you give the GAME a bad score because it uses Uplay? I understand, it's annyoing at times, especially needing to run it through two different clients, but to give the game itself a bad score because it uses Uplay, is very unfair. I have never had any problems running Far Cry 3 through both Steam & Uplay. Basically, when it says someone is playing Far Cry 3 on Steam, they actually have their Uplay open, as the game itself doesn't need to be running to say you're actually in-game.\n\nNot to mention, Far Cry 3 has crafting in it, along with survival tactics. Someone went as far to report the game for being a Minecraft clone because of it.\n\nReview Of "Far Cry 3"Far Cry 3 is an open world, first person shooter, survival type game. With a very in depth story. Good and memorable characters. Amazing world, and game mechanics.\n\nThe game takes you in the shoes of "Jason Brody", a rich kid who takes a vaction to an island with a group of friends. Before having enough time to enjoy themselves, Jason and his friends find themselves captured by pirates ruled by "Vass". It's Jason's job to break out of the slave camp and get his friends back. Having never shot or killed anyone, it is up to you to learn how to take down your foe using a wide variety of weapons. Using drugs made off of plants from the jungle, and working alongside people like Denis. Can you make it happen?\n\nFar Cry 3 allows you to form your story. Everyone's playthrough will be different.\n\nThe world of Far Cry 3. The world is massive. In my Just Cause 2 review, I talked about the world being massive, but mostly empty. Here, the world is not only massive, it isn't empty. Everywhere there is something to collect, capture, destroy, hide from, or DIE from. The world is split between two islands, which take part at different sections of the story. Each lush with plains, jungle's , a lot of killer animals, green, some more green, beautiful oceans and caves. Far Cry 3 is a graphically intense looking game. The views are just amazing. The world is populated by loot, like weapons, money, and relics. There are also deadly animals, like the Tiger, or Cassowary. Not only that, pirates, who only mean to kill you.\n\nFar Cry 3 does it nicely, where the whole game isn't out to kill you. The pirates will get into fights with the natives. Angry animals will attack civilians, and pirates. You could sit at a far, watching through the scope of a sniper rifle, as a Tiger slips through the enemy defense and takes down a group.\n\nThrown about this world are these plants. These plants can be used to craft drugs to help you with many things. Like detecting animals, or increasing maximum health, etc. Along with crafting drugs, you can also craft other items. Like wallets to carry more money, weapon holsters to carry more weapons, or munitions pouch to carry more grenades. One thing that's strange about this is the fact that you must skin animals to craft these. However, for one thing you might need 2 Tiger skin, and the next, 1 Deer skin, see my problem with this?\n\nScatered around the world are strongholds or "outposts" that are controlled by the pirates. You can take these down by killing all pirates on the inside. By capturing one of these strongholds, it makes the territory around you safe, and creates a fast travel system. Now, how you approach these strongholds to take them down is all up to you. You have full freedom to do what you want. You could run right in with heavy machine guns blazing it out. You sit from a far with a sniper rifle and pick them off. You could sneak in, perform takedowns and use a stealth recurve bow. Or you could lure an animal into the base. There are so many things you could do.\n\nTo take down these strongholds, you need weapons, right? Worry no more. The weapons provided in Far Cry 3 consist of pistols, SMG's, Assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, HMG's, flare gun's, flame throwers, and way more.\n\nNow, while on a mission, though they provide a good story, you are restricted most of the time. Meaning you can't really approach the way you may want to.\n\nAlongside the main story, you of course have side missions. These are of two types, but work and are fun. The first of them being the Hunter missions. Where you take out an animal for various reasons. The second being the Wanted Dead missions, where it is your job to take down a baddie with your knife/machete.\n\nYou also earn XP for getting kills and completing missions. XP will gain you skill points, which then lead to you choosing a skill you'd like. One problem with this system is, you don't have access to all the skills until you get futher into the story. As the skills move on, they get kind of more useless. However that's just my opinion.\n\nIf there is really anything else I don't care about in this game, it's that the second half falls short of the first half. It doesn't really keep the hype going, it kind of dies down.\n\nThoughts (Other)I'd like to post this here. Far Cry 3 is so far my most favorite single player experience of all time. The story was great, the gameplay was great. The soundtrack is amazing, and brings man tears. This was one of the best things I have ever played. Now a days, I use a hardcore mod. Mods are available for Far Cry 3 that can fix things, or make the game more realistic and hard. Now, obviously Far Cry 3 being my favorite, I cannot wait for the release of Far Cry 4 which only comes in a couple weeks. I cannot WAIT.\n\nPro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Far Cry 3 is a great game that is well worth the time. For the story, the world, and the gameplay. Every piece of this game is full of greatness. You ability to do what you want beings a new level to video games. We need more, like this.\n\nPro's:\n+Amazing story.\n+Great memorable characters.\n+Beautiful world that's full of life.\n+Great weapon mechanics.\n+Fantastic gameplay.\n+Big populated open world.\n\nCon's:\n-Second half of game falls a little short.\n-Multiplayer feels just slapped on.\n-Some of the crafting is strange.\n-Skill tree could use a little work.\n\nOverall Rating: About a 14/15 (Must Own!)\n\n\nCredits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.\n\nRemember, this review is based off of opinion only.

The story missions are quite a lot of fun, and if you level up properly none of them are very difficult (i.e. do the stealth kills and try to take down outposts undetected to get extra XP for the skills).\n\nYou started out as a party guy Jason Brody, who can't do anything. Your brother Grant was the ex-Army, and somehow you ended up captured on this island held by pirates and right in the INTRO sequence your brother got killed and your mad dash to freedom ended up with you diving over a waterfall, but you lived, and you woke up in a village, and handed your first mission... and a wimply pistol... get up this tower on top of the hill, and activate it.\n\nFrom there on, you steadily progress from a wimpy adrenaline junky to a fearsome killing machine capable of mowing down squads of professional mercenaries with LMG or assault rifle, hit wings off a fly at 100 yards with a sniper rifle, blade dance with professional knife fighters, stealth kill like a ninja, as you liberate the Rook Islands from two megalomaniacs, Vaas, and his boss, Hoyt, while recovering your friends one by one.\n\nThe islands are beautiful, and the animals behave independently of you. Goats and Buffalos and pigs and more wander the landscape, and predators like bears, leopards, even tigers wander the wild hunting them, and if you get in the way, you as well. In the ocean there are bull sharks and regular fish, and in the swamps there are crocodiles. Yes, it's a ton of fun exploring the place. There are small villages, pirate and merc outposts (that you can liberate... by killing everybody), unoccupied villages that were sites of atrocities, more radio towers you can deactivate, plus for the obssessive collectors, various artifacts to collect, such as 120 relics from the past cultures (including one from Chinese history!) letters from the Japanese WW2 occupation (plenty of bodies left around), memory cards left in outposts detailing the sordid narc industry links of Rook Island, as well as different animals and plants (they go in the survival handbook).\n\nThere are also untold number of caves, underground passages, leading to totally unknown areas deep within the bowels of the island that makes you wonder if you're playing Tomb Raider. :D  Indeed, the radio towers and many other sequences do require a bit of jumping and climbing to accomplish.\n\nEven on the surface, there are random things happening. Friendly and enemy jeeps patrol the routes. Enemy soldiers will patrol, and sometimes, force march prisoners / slaves on the road. You may engage, or not as you see fit, but they are excellent source of XPs, as valid as any one. And animals do roam the island, as it is wild out there.\n\nThere are plenty of side missions, some of which are handed out by locals, like "help find my daughter, who ran away with boyfriend!"  in addition to the story missions. Furthermore, conquered outposts often have bounty missions (kill a pirate or a merc and his minions) as well as "path of the hunter" missions (hunt down X animals using provided weapons). (HINT: you only have to use the same CLASS of weapon, not the specific weapon. If they provide a regular .45ACP, bring your customized .44 Magnum or .50AE Desert Eagle)\n\nAh, speaking of weapons... lots and lots of weapons. Pistols, sniper rifles, shotguns, assault rifiles, grenade launchers, light machine guns, special weapons (including recurve bow), and signature weapons. Some weapons can be customized with different type of sights, extended magazines, even a suppressor. And there are different paintjobs available too. Add the oddballs, like repair tool (welding torch), flamethrower, and even a flare gun... and things can get interesting indeed. Did I mention that many vehicles have mounted weapons, like a HMG that you can wield?\n\nHow you tackle mission (usually involving killing everybody at a certain place) is entirely up to you. Run and gun? Snipe and hide? Silent and deadly? Lure and ambush? It is all up to you. When you have the best sniper rifle (.50 cal with suppressor two-stage zoom scope) you can kill even a heavy with a single shot to the head from afar. There are also sometimes captured predators that you can "liberate" with a shot to the cage, thus letting it attack the enemies in the camp for you! Remember, bonus points if you were never detected (1500 xp instead of 500 xp).\n\nI have tried many open-world games before, from Far Cry 2 to Mercenaries 2, from GTA 3 (and sequels) to many others. Far Cry 3 stands above the rest because it is so well balanced. it doesn't unlock too many skills (some require you to unlock via story missions) at once, no matter how much XP you accumulated. it also doesn't unlock the 2nd island until well past 75% point. At each point you are reminded of the stakes you're playing with... the lives of your friends that may still be in pirate's hands, and each and every one will be scarred for life. The villians are psychopaths, but interesting psychopaths. And the other characters that you meet? They all have their own motivations, which may or may not match your own.\n\nSomehow, FC3 just struck the right balance between too "scattered brained", i.e. "Too many choices! What do I do now?" vs. "where's the freedom? I am bored, I want to do something ELSE"...  And there are plenty of variety in the missions as well as outposts. On the hunt missions, you have to use the specified weapon class/type., which can be challenging, such as hunting tigers with a pistol, or bears with a shotgun. On the bounty missions, you are to kill the one or two "leaders" with your blade. The rest are up to you with no restrictions. Just keep in mind in late game there can be two leaders with a dozen minions around them, and killing them all can be a difficult endeavor, esp. if you can only knife the leaders.\n\nThe skills you learn are divided into three categories: crane, shark, and spider, which of which has a different "tree". As mentioned before, they are unlocked by progressing in the story missions and can be learned by spending "skill points" which are earned by every few thousand XP. And they add a lot of fun abilities, such as chain takedowns, knife throw take down, grenade takedown, double take down, death from above, death from below, and so on.\n\nThere are bazillion crates scattered on the island, each containing some artifacts and/or money. You can further loot the bodies (enemy or friendly) for more artifacts, many of which can be sold for $$$. If you have killed some fauna, you cna often skin them for making containers / slings for ammo, wallet, and so on, and it's the only way you can carry more weapons, more ammo, even more money. In fact, you can also craft herbal medicine from the plants you gathered (which are generically divided into "colored leaves", and you need X of Red and Y of yellow and so on. As you progress you'll learn other formulas, like animal repellant, hunting instinct (lets you see animals, even behind hills), as well as herbal medicine that just heals you, deep dive potion that lets you go below 60 meters deep, and more.\n\nAll in all, Far Cry 3 is a ton of fun with variety of missions, side mission, as well as plenty of freeform encounter play. The story of growth and one man's journey from wimp to hero is the story of the player. And THAT ultimately, is why it's so much fun.","July 25, 2015","true","63.1"," 118 of 129 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","118","129","9","0"

I played it only recently (early 2015), but even though some years old, this game feels like it was made recently. As the third installment in the famous Far Cry franchise, it continues upon the open-world orientated gameplay establised by Far Cry 2, while fixing almost all of the problems that game had and offering a feel and way of playing all of its own.\n\nThe game makes one identify to a degree with Jason Brody, the playable protagonist who is taken captive together with his friends on a tropical island by a gang of pirates lead by someone called Vaas. The opening sequence of the game, from the initial cutscene with the rather vainly partying friends up to the first encounter with Vaas and the escape from his claws, stands out as a classic way of making clear what a game is all about. Vaas is a sinister character, as dark and evil as one could imagine, and more. His fascination with utter violence and the madness of the human mind offers some memorable gaming moments, that made me stare at my screen in utter disbelief and will stay with me for a long time.\nJason Brody starts out as a rather unsure would-be-hero, who is shocked whenever he sees someone killed, and who is very reluctant to kill himself. But his encounter with the sheer evil of Vaas and his fellow criminals, gradually turns him into a killing machine, with only one goal: to free his friends, and ultimately seek revenge. The game cleverly underscores this development by offering some role-playing element: finishing missions or killing enemies grants experience points and levels you up so that you can acquire several abilities which help to overcome obstacles more easily. While the game is rather challenging during its first hours, with raising in level and acquiting more special abilities and better weapons it gets easier, which helps to get the idea of turning into a mean killing machine rather well.\n\nApart from Jason Brody and Vaas, Far Cry 3 contains several interesting and even unique characters along with three "factions" spread out on two distinct islands. There are too many characters to mention them all, but standing out apart from Vaas is Citra, the priestess of the natives who introduces an almost palpable sexual, brooding tension into the game. One of the best parts of the game is the excellent voice-acting: every charachter, how odd or sinister, is made completely believable through his or her voice.\nThe world itself is huge: longer journeys can take up to ten minutes, even by car, jeep or boat (of which there are several types). All in all, the story is not only gripping and very well told, it is combined with the freedom of an open world in a very convincing way. You can play this game in several different ways, the options being almost limitless. Following the main story is a valid possibility, but I found it more interesting to divert from this quite often, roaming around in the astoundingly beautiful world in order to capture an enemy outpost (either by force, stealth or cunning, the choice is once more yours!), gather some useful plants or just hunt for animals (who offer several rewards as well).\nApart from the 38 missions in the main storyline, there are over two hundred (!!) side-missions, ranging from stealth kills to hunting specific animals with a specific weapon, trying one's driving skills in a race, climbing communication towers in order to reveal parts of the map or even playing some poker. The amount of gaming hours to be got in singleplayer alone runs into several dozens or more, comparable to a game in that other famous open-world franchise, Assassin's Creed. I tried the multiplayer as well, but the servers are almost empty by now, alone the rather bland co-op still offers some possibilities.\n\nApart from the amazing game- and gunplay, the game is a prime example of state-of-the-art graphics and sound, excellently optimized and hardly showing that it was primarily aimed at consoles. It runs flawlessly on my 7-year old pc with a 2,66 Ghz cpu, 4 GB ram and a GeForce GTX 650 ti. All the expected options and tweaks for optimal performance are there, but it has to be said: the game does look much better on the highest settings (very high or ultra), so even if it costs you some fps, do try those. The one thing that could offset several players is the mandatory use of the "infamous" Uplay, a platform that gets huge criticism more often than not. However, for me Uplay just works fine, not only in this but in every other game I played on it. Granted, the achievements are a bit pointless since they don't show on Steam, but the possibility of unlocking extra content by gaining U-points in quite nice. Apart from that, the few dlc packets for the game are completely superfluous, but that's a very, very minor criticism.\n\nAnyone interested in the recent developments of first-person shooters or in the way a modern game can tell a story in combination with an open gaming world, should buy and play this game.\n\nGameplay: 28/30\nGraphics: 19/20\nSound: 9/10\nLongelivety: 9/10\nTechnical: 9/10\nSteam Integration: 6/10 (Uplay required, but that works fine for me)\nPersonal appreciation: 10/10\n\nOverall: 90/100","March 28, 2015","true","70.7"," 103 of 119 people (87%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","87","103","119","11","7"

It also forces you to create an Uplay account.\n\nBasically, Steam serves as a glorified CD-key seller, whereas your CD-key actually needs to copied and activated on UPLAY.\n\nI think this is unacceptable. We buy games on Steam, because it's a streamlined delivery method, and the DRM is handled by Steam itself (or at least transparent to the user).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GJeebus/recommended/220240/","GJeebus","GJeebus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GJeebus/","138 products in account","The game itself is enjoyable, but I can no longer play it. A couple months ago I uninstalled this game because I wasn't playing it. After installing it I can no longer access my Uplay account because Uplay wouldn't accept my password. I tried to recover my password, but Uplay refused to send me a password recovery email. I tried to get support, but in order to get Uplay support you have to log in to Uplay. I can't play anymore because Uplay won't let me log in. Thanks, Ubisoft. You truly are my greatest ally.\n\nAlso if you're wondering "Why didn't you make an account to contact support?" Well I did, but even after a couple months I never did get that confirmation email.\n\n[No Spoilers and tl;dr at the bottom]\n\nEdit: After numerous comments asking me to change my review to postive, I've decided to go in-depth as to what I think about the game. I'd advise you to take my opinions with a grain of salt because I haven't been able to play the game in about a year. As for the game itself I would say that it's enjoyable at best. The story isn't interesting in the slightest, but the occasions when Vaas shows up can be quite entertaining. I would say that Vaas was the only reason the story slightly interested me at all because I didn't care at all about my friends. Why would I considering they weren't developed enough for me to even care? Without spoilers the ending gives 2 choices that you have to make on the spot and none of them effect anything. They're not satisfying and the only reason there are 2 choices is because you gotta have that variety right? Anyways I don't think that the story is the reason people play Far Cry 3, because the game is more focused towards free-roam. The world is big, but there isn't much to do. You can hunt, do some side missions, take down enemy outposts, pick flowers, find some collectables, but that's about it. There isn't much going on around you so it makes the world feel empty. I don't remember seeing many animals besides a couple of herds and a few lone panthers. When you take down an outpost the enemies stop spawning in the area, which makes sense, but it makes that area far more boring and almost usless in terms of replay value. One thing they did to fix this is that you can reset the outposts when they're all overtaken. It's a much appreciated feature that should add a lot of replay value if you've enjoyed the main game. There is around 4 weapons for each class (Snipers, pistols, rifles and such) and some special weapons, but most of the common weapons are just generic. A few good examples of the less generic weapons are the A2000, U100, Flamethrower, and BZ19. Shooting in this game shouldn't be that interesting, but it feels much more satisfying due to the fantastic animations. One last thing I liked is that you can customize if you want to go in with a stealthy or more explosive approach. The game gives you a lot of options if we're talking about how you want to approach enemies.\n\nI'd say if you want to have a game you can play sometimes and have a bit of fun go ahead and buy this one. If I remember correctly there is co-op so that might be fun with your friends. I've never tried it, but it might be worth a shot. Twenty dollars isn't too bad of a price, but at that price you're better off getting Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Bioshock 1, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Insurgency, Fallout New Vegas, Splinter Cell Choas Theory, or Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon (I like the atmosphere and weapons in Blood Dragon more than 3 because it feels a lot more unique. Also it has laser guns + lazer lizards) If you want a free-roam jungle fps I don't know any others besides Far Cry 3, so if you want to play this game specifically for that reason alone it wouldn't be too bad of an idea to get this. If you want this for the story just look it up on Youtube. If you want this just for Vaas, refer to my previous statement.\n\ntl;dr: Get it if you want a free-roam fps jungle game. The story sucks, Vass is kind of cool, and the free roam and variety of approaches may be the deal breaker for you. It's all right as a free-roam game, but don't expect to be blown away at all or interested for more than 20 hours. There is co-op but I can't say anything about that sense I haven't played it. It might be worth a try with your friends.","September 12, 2015","false","40.0"," 264 of 372 people (71%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","71","264","372","34","11"

Now I’m not a huge fan of first person shooters (FPS) but there are some goods and this is one of them. This is a open world game which other then the story missions to advance the main objectives you can play how you like.  Set on an island where you Jason Brody must free your friends from the psychotic Vaas.  And there are times you wish you could play as Vaas or enter his mind at least because he is an first-class psycho.  Rook island is a land semi-forgotten by the world.  Where you hunt down relics of the ancient ancestors that lived on the island.  See and feel the effects of World War 2 on this Pacific island.  Truly a world where anything goes and does happen.  The story happens in a nonlinear fashion but as you progress you will see how it all fits together and how this forges your champion Jason Brody.  And the nice thing about the far cry series is each game is its own other then being an open world shooter you don't need to play them in an particular order.  If your looking for a game you can run through swamps, jungles, and mountains you found it don't get me wrong it is no Skyrim on that size but it will take you a good 10+ to get from one side to another.  But if you are one of the people that has to everything in a game you can easily get 60+ hours of play time.  The biggest downside of the game is your friends you are rescuing how they seem unaffected by this island.  The graphics are awe inspiring and the cut scenes will have your heart racing especially.....* NO SPOILERS*  Get the game and find out for yourself.","February 15, 2014","true","51.9"," 116 of 153 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","116","153","0","0"

The game has the graphic quality of a first person shooter with the freedom of an RPG .\n\nThe graphics engine is called Dunia Engine.

If you are ambitious and a bit stupid, like Jason Brody and company, then you may try to spice up the proceedings with a bit of skydiving. So begins, Far Cry 3, a game about a bunch of American yuppies on a vacation that has seriously gone wrong. Back and 2004 Far Cry's open world gameplay was revolutionary, roaming tropical islands slaying mercs and trigens created quite a splash before being encumbered by the tsunami that was Doom 3 and Half Life 2 later the same year. With S.T.A.L.K.E.R being the only other franchise to successfully merge open world shooting with light RPG elements, and Crytek moving toward more traditional levels for their Crysis games, the market is wide open for Ubisoft's vacation from hell simulator.\n\nWhile living it up in Bangkok in order to celebrate his younger brother obtaining his pilot's license, Jason Brody and crew make the ill fated decision to go skydiving. They happen to land on an island infested with pirates and they are taken hostage where they are being primed to be sold into slavery. Jason escapes and meets some locals who aid him in his quest to find his friends and escape since they see it as an opportunity to have Jason liberate their island. It's a tale that's part Deliverance, part Indiana Jones with a dash of the drug abusing hijinx in Alice in Wonderland. Far Cry 3's narrative benefits from a number of eccentric personalities like Spike Lee's Island dwelling clone Dennis, gaming's most possessive and insane ♥♥♥♥♥ Citra,  and doctor who indulgences in enough mind altering substances to make Hunter S. Thompson blush. Topping off the insane cast of character's is Vaas, the leader of the pirates. Unfortunately, Far Cry 3 blunders Final Fantasy VIII style by shifting the focus away from Vaas partway through the game and substituting a far less engaging and charismatic villain. The well worn theme of civilized man reverting to a more primitive state to survive in a primitive environment is a bit hamfisted as every few missions has Jason returning to his girlfriend so that she can keep pointing out how he has changed... Also, the plot is tainted by a white messiah complex. For some reason it seems that the legions of native warriors are not the equal of one white guy with a crappy tribal tattoo and a desire to save his friends.\n\nWhile Jason is not a soldier or gun toter by trade, he quickly warms up to carrying a firearm and explosives in order to liberate his friends. Missions give Jason the opportunity to earn money and experience which he can use to augment his skills and buy new weapons and attachments. Slaughtering the wildlife also gives Jason the opportunity to craft new storage for ammo, explosives and money. The flora can be harvested in order to create medicines that allow Jason to heal and enhance his senses. While all of these crafting opportunities help make use of the large game world and the critters that inhabit it, it also means that the game can have an agonizing start. Initially, Jason can only carry one weapon and very little ammo meaning that exploration grinds to a halt after only a few minutes before needing to resupply. You will want to craft new holsters to hold more weapons and compartments for more ammo immediately. Torching bears with flame throwers, using grenades as depth charges to kill crocodiles and sharks and running kommodo dragons over with jeeps does provide a depraved and perverted form of entertainment.\n\nAlso populating the world are radio towers that have to be scaled in order to unlock a section of the map a la Assassin's Creed and Outposts that need to be cleared out in order to keep those pesky pirates from roaming certain regions of the map. Both the towers and the outposts have unique layouts and terrain that distinguishes one from another but never the less you will fall into a pattern of uncovering the map then liberating the outposts as you progress deeper into the game which becomes terribly repetitive. The wildlife in Far Cry 3 doesn't exist solely for the benefit of adding pouches to Jason's belt either. Animals are often found in cages in enemy outposts where they can be freed to create havok. It just so happens that pirates are much easier to kill when they are trying to save one of their buddies from getting murdered by an angry cassowary. While Far Cry 3 provides weaponry and attachments that encourage stealth, it's also possible to raid outposts full shock and awe style with guns on full auto chucking grenades like Eli Manning throws interceptions. Both methods have their thrills but almost invariably players will lean on their overpowered weaponry late in the game to steam roll the opposition. The extra 1,000 experience just isn't worth the time saved by storming an outpost Rambo style.\n\nFortunately, Far Cry 3's main missions provide a much needed reprieve from the repetition of radio tower climbing and outpost raiding. Missions often take Jason to instanced areas like abandoned Japanese bunkers from World War 2 and ancient temples with Indiana Jones style perils. Even a handful of late game filler missions offer some riotous thrills and enough fireworks to please even the most jaded action gamer. Forced stealth sections are staged in such a way they they are painfully easy however and some really irritating quick time events rear their ugly heads and detract from the experience. Like wise a mid game string of quests that have you raiding ancient temples to reassemble a magic compass throw the tone of the game off. If all of the aforementioned content isn't satisfactory to you there are also extra missions that have you killing animals and special targets with a specified weapon, score-based Rakyat challenges and some small errands given to you by NPCs. It's a rather robust singleplayer that will last most gamers 15 to 20 hours.\n\nThe Far Cry 3 experience doesn't stop with it's campaign however. There are six co-op missions that tell the story of a group of rough around the edges characters who have been duped out of their money by the Pirates and are pursuing them on Rook Island. The narrative is sparse and the gameplay does little to really take advantage of having three friends playing alongside you. You earn experience that unlocks upgrades that can also be used for the competitive multiplayer suit. Multiplayer is a collection of variations of classic multiplayer modes like Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill, capture the flag and domination. The multiplayer does little nothing to take advantage of some of Far Cry's more unique features. Don't expect your foes to be mauled to death by tigers or to be able to jump into a vehicle to make a hasty escape. Odds are, players will get more time out of the main campaign.\n","July 1, 2014","true","25.3"," 78 of 100 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","78","100","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/optionalzero/recommended/220240/","optionalzero","Opt_0™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/optionalzero/","138 products in account","Uplay... god-damnit. Uplay means Noplay for me. I am tired of running extra 3rd party clients. I already play through Steam, and that is perfectly fine for me, it has more than enough DRM features. I don't want to run Uplay as well and have it all linked up. I don't care, I don't want it. Uplay is one of the heaviest DRM I have seen in a while. It's a hassle, and I use Steam already...I don't want yet another program open to "connect" with others and "track my progress". For Steam being what it is, I forget how much Ubisoft likes to really remind the player that they are playing UBISOFT'S game and the player just has "access" to it. It's like long term renting at a flat price.\n\nAs far as FarCry 3, the game itself, by this time the internet is full of Reviews by now. So I won't recap. I hear it's a good looking game and can be a lot of fun. But combined with the issues above and being at a point in my gaming life where I just didn't care as soon as the opening scene started. I just wanted to get out on the islands, wander, explore, adventure, blow ♥♥♥♥ up. Yet as I listened to the story drone on, and started the first stealthy escape sequence I just remembered:\n\n"I don't care... I really don't care. I don't want to go through this 'tutorial' period. I don't want to be introduced to a bunch of characters I don't care about , locations half of which I won't return to, objectives I'll forget what they are related to, skill trees I'll get tired of trying to unlock, loot out the a-hole, blueprints for too many things  won't make, and everything else for the first few hours or so. Just leave me alone, let me wander. Basically, give me the end game freedoms. I don't have time for all this."\n\n(Note: I am just stating my personal sensation at the time, clearly not all games are approached with this level of cynicism. But this one did not grab me enough to fight through it this time. And although I do greatly enjoy open world exploration games with many of these features, this one felt to tedious and predictable right off.)\n\nObviously, this isn't really a review of the game, just a friendly reminder of "Uplay" and it's annoying " joys ". And combined with a bit of a predictable set-up, I just can't say I want to deal with it. Even after a good sale. It looks cool, and there looks like some good fun moments, but I guess I just don't want to put in the time to get there.\n\nFor you real fans, I am not putting down the games themselves. I am not trying dissuade anyone seriously interested in this game, or the franchise. But those on the fence, stay there and maybe lean back a little. Uplay is freaking annoying. It's like running a whole 'nother Steam while you are already playing your game through Steam. You even have to activate other Ubisoft games with activation keys inside Uplay the same way as you do in Steam. And while in game you get a little prompt to open Uplay with shift+F2 just like you can with the Steam overlay...seriously, if you are wondering if maybe you could waste a little casual time for fun in FarCry 3 with the ease of Steam...Nope. It is all an extra annoying hassle with Uplay. It's lame. And consider, if Uplay servers go down, you may not have accessto your game/s. If you already really like the game and very much want it, go for it. You've already made the choice and it does look good.\n[If it was without Uplay, and a "standalone" game in this way, I would recommend on sale; post FC4 release.]","November 15, 2014","false","0.3"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","41","49","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrypotato/recommended/220240/","angrypotato","AngryPotato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrypotato/","65 products in account","Far Cry 3 is wonderful in terms of the environment and graphics (stunning visuals!). There are not many games that have such an enjoyable system of roaming around the map, hunting, driving, swimming, flying etc. The fight is often easy, but fun. The singleplayer experience is quite tense and full of fast-paced action (car chases, bomb escapes, burning houses, helicopter flights, ambushes... a lot of good points). There are even some stealth aspects, you may conquer the outposts in a silent-assassin way and I admit - it gave me a lot of good gameplay experience, especially with later knife skills. Aside from the outposts you'll see it's just a nicely scripted shooter often with no practical use for silent approach :)\nSo, why do I give it a negative mark? Let me explain in a few points...\nIf you spend some time on doing side miniquests and hunt, you get really powerful - I quickly got to point when I maxed my skill tree, had bought everything I could and still had overflow of money. Of course, it's up to you how far you go with exploring the map, so let's say it's not a minus, more like neutral remark.\nThe game has a very dark feeling in it. A lot of despair, loneliness, brutality, often without reason. Sometimes the protagonist make extremely stupid, unbelievable decisions. Your enemies (and some allies...) are psychopatic maniacs. There are a lot of drug themes. I know a lot of these are justified by the plot, but every time I moved a bit forward in game (not counting map exploration), I felt sad and dull. (game music even amplify it) Watch out, if you feel pesimist, probably this game might just make you feel worse...\nWhole drug aspect - not only there's too much of it for my taste, I also feel that the game creators took it as a handy shortcut for fixing loose plot points. I don't want to leave spoilers here, so let's just say that replacing a few proper fights with drug induced visions (and then, magically, your character somehow won everything!) is very cheap. You see a problem but don't solve it, just hop into narcotic projection, see some ghosts and delusions, get back to 'real' world and everything is already done. Yay...\nAlthough many parts of the campaign were enjoyable (especially action scenes mentioned before), the ending itself was so disgusting/stupid (I chose "good" ending, "bad" one was even worse) that it totally threw me off this game. Honestly, I haven't played it anymore since I finished the main plot.\nMultiplayer - I managed to unlock everything before I finished singleplayer and then, without the feeling of getting rewards, it got very boring. It's not a bad experience, but it's very chaotic, certainly not better than other shooters. There are no dedicated servers, so you have little influence on any technical aspect of the game. Also, expect A LOT of hosting problems, a few host migrations during one match seemed like a standard...\nOh, also the game needs to be played under Uplay - Ubisoft DRM system, which is very inconvenient, much less comfortable than Steam... (a bit ridiculous, that we already have to use two platforms, Steam and Uplay, at once to play a game, who knows how many additional programs we will have to run in future to play one game?)","January 2, 2014","false","77.6"," 61 of 82 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","61","82","0","2"

Now first of all this is not a hit on the game, the game's great ... when it works, The Co-Op is probably the best part, 4 friends, screwing around making the lives of pirates more miserable, best cooperative I've played, better than L4D/L4D2, (sorry Valve) except the fact that u can have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of add-ons in L4D/L4D2, that's awesome.  (sidetracked) :/  FC3, as well as the others in the series are great fun, however my problem is with U-PLAY.  Steam doesn't have a problem with my computer and has always accomidated me with an out-dated and newly built (this year) computers, but UP seems to have problems with ... perhaps u could tell me, I haven't a clue, crashing/lost host/lost connection/no internet/no mic/no sound/glitch glitch glitch, twitch twitch twitch.  At this point Steam thinks I've played 34 hrs, reality is 17 hrs, I checked, I literally have spent almost 17 hrs fighting with all the above problems - changed settings - restarted - gave up and tried the next night.  I can turn right around and play ANY game ANY!  and not have an issue, right after I crash!  So if your good at working around or rewriting script or what have you, then you'll love this game.  If your looking to just go and play because you've already waited for it to install, and start a UP account, and exit out so it can update, then you hunt your friends down, then you exit SO THAT can take effect, then it updates, loads, searches for MORE updates, THEN, if your good, then you can play ... oh wait .. no sound, start again.  Then I DON'T recommened this game because you'll become frusterated and possibly hate Ubisoft that much more.\n\n*Note*  I dont download anything or run 'backround programs'  it's pretty much a gaming comp. which I might look on the net or right an e-mail .. sometimes.  this current comp is:  Optimal/Over-spec for this game.

It's fun and exciting to play. The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is excellent. I really enjoyed it and had several play-throughs for the 93 hours I got to enjoy it both in single player, multiplayer & co-op until, my UPlay account was stolen from me. I now own it again on a different account that I had from a long time ago and am going to play it over again. Got it on sale for real cheap on Humble so, it was worth it to purchase it again, to me, anyway. I installed it directly through UPlay this time and not through Steam.\n\nI'm still a bit upset that UPlay has failed to return any of my self paid long distance phone calls and for the first time, failed to reply to my support ticket, concerning the matter. They're usually good about answering me whenever I've had problems.\n\nAll-in-all, I got the game again and will enjoy playing it in SP, MP & Co-op once again. Will also be looking forward to FarCry 4.\n\nAs an added note: The game also comes with a Map Editor.

It is the next installment of Far Cry series after Far Cry 2.\n\nFar Cry 3 gameplay, it has open world, it has small RPG element, and it has one of the best villain character ever. In my opinion Far Cry 3 open world feature is almost similar to Assassin's Creed where you have to climb a radio tower, interact some sort of panel to explore some area on the world around the tower. In Far Cry 3 you don't just get to shoot somebody and run. You can buy and upgrade weapons in store, level up getting new tattoos which conveniently giving you new abilities such as walk faster or something, also, there are some upgrades that require you to hunt for animals hide or plants. The best part is, when you shoot a tiger, it will fight back! Let your guard down and a leopard will eat you. Got bored? Maybe you should go to a village and play some poker games and rob those poker players. Do you want to become Hawkeye? Legolas? or maybe Rambo? Use explosive archer and blow some goats. Got angry? Use a flamethrower and burn the forest! Far Cry 3 has many great feature for a first-person shooter. You will like it.\n\nFar Cry 3 has cool graphics, it is one of the best graphics I've ever seen, not because its so advanced, but because the weapons first-person animation is unique, so alive and... Okay maybe it's not one of the best, but I like it. Far Cry 3 has very good performance.\n\nToo bad Far Cry 3 multiplayer feels like it has been left out, because it's not as awesome as the singleplayer mode. I was thinking the multiplayer will be more like huge maps on the same island, hundreds of players fighting together, something like that. Same thing about the cooperative play. But at least you get to blow something up with bow in singleplayer.\n\nFar Cry 3 is not bad, its good, I recommend this.\n\nRating 8/10","February 1, 2015","true","21.7"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","23","24","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/220240/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","If there's one thing Far Cry 3 does incredibly well, it's give you a very detailed, open-ended game world that's loaded up with so many optional objectives, collectibles and side missions that you'll probably put the game's main narrative on hold in favor of exploring. It's a fantastic-looking first person shooter with a great combat system, and while the main story isn't exactly Shakespeare, there's enough interesting stuff going on to more than make up for it.\nFar Cry 3 takes players to the tropical paradise of Rook Island, where Jason, a young 20-something vacationing in the South Pacific with his friends, is captured by a notorious pirate gang led by the violently insane Vaas. After losing his brother in an escape attempt, Jason is rescued by a man named Dennis, who brands Jason with a mysterious tattoo. Apparently, Jason has the hidden potential to become the legendary warrior that the local tribe, the Rakyat, and it's up to you to save your friends, free Rook Island from the pirates and most importantly, kill Vaas.\nWhile Far Cry 3 may not have the same kind of gritty narrative that's chock full of grim moral ambiguity like its predecessor, Far Cry 2, the adrenaline-fueled, action-packed adventure that Far Cry 3 offers instead is still entertaining. Each story mission has a nice mix of open-ended game play and scripted sequences that can be a lot of fun to play through, but when you're crawling through ancient Chinese ruins trying to find a mythical artifact, hidden away centuries ago, or the leader of the Rakyat starts talking about how great a warrior you are, it can feel like Far Cry 3 is taking a few ideas from other popular action-adventures and trying to put a darker, edgier twist to them - and it can come across as a tad melodramatic as a result.\nOne of the most intriguing things about Rook Island is that it has a really complex ecosystem that feels active and alive. Throughout your travels, you'll encounter flora and fauna of all shapes and sizes, from wild boars and leopards to birds of paradise. You're just as likely to be killed by a tiger or a Komodo dragon as a gun-toting pirate or mercenary, and you'll occasionally run into skirmishes between the Rakyat and pirate forces. As you progress through the game, you'll get to see how your actions have an impact on this environment. The island starts out full of enemy-occupied outposts, and hacked radio towers make navigation difficult by shrouding large chunks of your in-game map. But as you liberate those towers and outposts, they'll reveal the surrounding area and reduce the pirates' influence in the region.\nLiberating Rook Island is where Far Cry 3's impressive combat comes into play. Almost every engagement offers flexibility as to how you want to take out your opponents, and you'll build up a large arsenal of customizable weapons provided you've spent some time unlocking radio towers and looting corpses and containers for cash. Every gun, such as shotguns, silenced pistols or flamethrowers, have their own uses in a firefight, depending on if you like fast-paced battles with lots of explosions and bullets or if you prefer something that lets you be more quiet and subtle.\nFar Cry 3 also introduces skill and crafting systems for improving your abilities and making equipment. Completing missions and killing enemies will grant you skill points to use on various perks that'll increase your health, damage resistance or allow you to pull off nifty action hero moves, like being able to fire a gun while riding down a zipline or using an enemy as an impromptu human shield as you gun down his buddies with his own sidearm. The crafting system is oriented around making items to support you in your adventure. Most of the island's animals can be killed and skinned to give you the materials to craft larger grenade or ammo pouches, and you'll also forage for plants to make syringes that either heal you or give temporary bonuses, like detecting enemies or animals through walls.\nFar Cry 3 does have a few minor issues that could've used a bit more polish. Navigating the myriad of menus can be a pain for one, and occasionally the context-sensitive HUD has issues distinguishing whether you want to pick up a weapon or loot a corpse. Also, whatever behind the scenes mechanic controlling the random placement of NPCs can seem overeager to spawn enemies for you to encounter, leading to weird instances where you drive along an empty stretch of road only to watch as a truck-full of pirates materializes behind you. Thankfully, that happens so rarely that's it's more of a minor annoyance than anything else, but it can break the immersion slightly when it does.\nIf you need a break from the already content-heavy single player portion of the game, Far Cry 3 also has a robust multiplayer component with a Call of Duty-style style leveling system that'll unlock new weapons, equipment, and ally-boosting abilities as you play. Far Cry 3 also comes with a four player co-op mode, where you and a handful of friends can play through a side-narrative of four people seeking vengeance against a cruise liner captain that tried to sell them out to pirates.\nFar Cry 3's single player story may have its ups and downs, but it's still an incredibly in-depth action experience. Its combat and open-ended gameplay is engaging and well-designed, and there are plenty of incentives to explore the game world to see what you can find. The multiplayer modes, while not as detailed, are a nice extra feature that's just as enjoyable as the single player campaign.","September 24, 2014","true","32.7"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","4"

Will you put C4 bombs on your car and use it to make a diversion? Will you open a cage to release a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tiger on your enemies? Or will you sneak your way through? The choice is all yours.\n\nThe story is simple but feels alright, the characters are all pretty charismatic and have their own personalities; the game has humour and dramatic moments. It is beautiful and immersive. The gameplay is varied enough, and when you think it might become boring, new gameplay elements come in. Lots of missions and side-missions to keep you occupied for quite some time; I've played more than 16 hours when I'm writing this review and haven't even finished it yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/domosapien/recommended/220240/","domosapien","robotsarego","http://steamcommunity.com/id/domosapien/","239 products in account","Within the first thirty minutes I experienced an incredibly emotional and engaging introduction that rivaled all my favorite memories from similar games. Remember the beginning to Half Life 2 or dying in the beginning of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? Far Cry 3 wipes those experiences under the table and then continues to give you things you never thought possible in a game of this magnitude.  Every drug-laden sequence early in the game makes you feel like first-person shooters have risen to a new level in terms of creative narrative story-telling.\n\nWe are presented with a very typical open-world game. We can explore the scenic island, take on a slurry of optional missions, search for a staggering amount of collectibles, or take on the newest gaming cliche: hunting. The exploration feels very reminiscent of Skyrim. The stealth elements are familiar for fans of those genres. There are role playing elements and skill tree upgrades. It’s got a little bit of everything and at first-glance they’re all done well.\n\nEven with a new high-end PC I couldn’t play this game on ultra, but on high Far Cry 3 looks absolutely incredible. Environments are gorgeously rendered allowing the player to immerse in every detail of the beaches and jungle down to single blades of grass. The character models are perfectly motion captured and so well acted that you want to know “Who is this guy playing Vaas?” These elements provide a real emotional connection to what’s happening. From the very start you become completely immersed and invested in your motives, the story, the characters, and the world as a whole.\n\nSo what’s the problem? Far Cry 3 is a great game that suffers from the trappings of what makes it a game. The strengths and impact of the opening sequence are quickly diminished when your first few mandatory missions act as tutorials of collecting plants and skinning pigs. With further progression you are inundated with endless optional missions, while entertaining, are irrelevant to the larger story. More may not always be better. And the more you play, you’ll realize: this game is riddled with all the tropes of similar experiences.\n\nYou’ll need to escape from a burning building, hunker down for turret sequences, use “stealth” to follow a person in broad daylight, and deal with a car chase where you blow up pursuers with a grenade launcher. Meanwhile, every meandering story mission you go on seems to further remove you from any logical character development. Fighting a giant tribal ink demon in a drug-induced state looks cool, but it’s completely pointless and punctuated by a ridiculous first-person sex scene. There are multiple times in the game that make you question what you’re doing and why, because at a certain point none of it makes sense.\n\nThis game would have benefited immensely from a shorter and focused campaign. What should have been a linear and powerful storyline is ruined by padding the game out with irrelevant mechanics and tired plot sequences. There was such amazing potential dealing with concepts of human trafficking and how revenge at any cost can transform an ordinary person.  However, the human drama takes a backseat. We’re left with a game that feels manipulated to meet bullet-points on a marketing checklist and a feeling that we are the lowest common denominator for a target demographic.\n\nA lot can be learned from games like Spec Ops: The Line. What seemed like a formulaic shooter was actually a concise narrative that took risks. It explored and engaged the player with what trauma and death can do to the human psyche.\n\nFar Cry 3 could have easily cut characters like Willis, Citra and Hoyt and focused on the drama with Vaas. The optional missions could have been made available as a narrative hook after the main campaign or online experiences with friends. The problem I have is that mechanically the game is still fun. I can recommend it for those reasons. However, narratively speaking, it had so much potential and in the end I was just disappointed with the entire package.","November 25, 2013","false","18.4"," 173 of 290 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","173","290","0","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CVGAnton/recommended/220240/","CVGAnton","[CVG]Anton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CVGAnton/","277 products in account","Far Cry 3, a story driven first person shooter.\n\nI purchased the Deluxe edition of the game when it was on the summer 2014 sale for $9.99 and have played a total of 7 hours as of this writing.\n\nI would fit this game into the FPS genre and add that this is more then just an FPS, its a Story Driven FPS. There is a compelling and interesting story to go through with the solo campaign of the game and the game starts off with an intense beginning.\n\nMy first several hours into the game and I have to wounder why I didn't get into the Far Cry series before. Far Cry 3 is the first game in the series I have played and I am pleased with it thus far. I do want to keep playing more and finish the story line to see how it all comes to conclusion.\n\nThere is more to the game if you play a multiplayer coop campaign but I have not yet tried that as I want to experience it all at my pace and not run and gun through it all. I will eventually play coop but not for a while.\n\nThere is lots to do in the game other then the main missions. I have spent time hunting down animals for there skins, collecting plants and exploring sunken ships, caves and ruins.\n\nThe crafting in the game is simple, its not overly complex like other games with crafting. If you want to upgrade your wallet to hold more money then you will need to collect animal skins of a certain animal. You will see what kind of animal skin is needed when you select the upgraded version and then on the map you will see the symbol of the animal. In that area somewhere you will find it, kill it and skin it. This will be how you will go about hunting animals to get there skins so you can upgrade your various gear, like, Loot sack, ammo pouch, weapon holster and so forth.\n\nWhen gathering plants (Green, Blue, Read, White) you will use them to make syringes for restoring health or to make a boost in abilities. I have only made health restorative ones as of yet.\n\nThere is allot more to the game beyond the main missions. There are random supply drop's side missions where you will drive a vehicle from point to point (a marked flare on the ground) till you get the supplies to the needed person. Hunting various wildlife, timed runs, finding lost relic's, letters and video memory cards.\n\nThe game map starts off with a small section visible and as you activate radio towers throughout the map more sections become visible. The areas that are not visible also do not show up on the mini-map making it more interesting to explore and find the path the to other radio towers.\n\nHang-gliders are also around the island to use and sale through the air to other sections. Its kind of nice to to glide in the air over the island areas and see what there is around.\n\nFar Cry 3 is very Xbox 360 controller friendly. Button arrangements are done well and its a joy to play with the controller over keyboard and mouse.\n\nI didn't like that I have to access the game menu to get to the crafting and would have rather seen an option of a work table or something in a safe zone (or in the game world) for doing crafting. Other then that, I have to say that this game is very impressively done and UbiSoft did an excellent job. I am looking forward to the next Far Cry game.\n\nHaving waited during the Summer Sale of 2014 for the Deluxe edition of the game to go on sale and getting it for $9.99 I have to say a resounding Yes! I am sure that subsequent sales will have the game on sale as well. Look for it during the Holiday Sale folks.\n\n\n\nPro's\nGraphics are incredibly amazing\nStory\nLots of places to explore\nVerity of weapons\nA.I. is good\nCon's\nHave to go to game menu for crafting\nCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː","October 3, 2014","true","25.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

Great world environment.  The jungle, water, caves, underground bunkers, ancient temples all look beatiful.\n\n2. Hunting is fun and exciting.\n\n3. Open world to explore.  I'm a fan of open world games :)\n\n4. Good selection of skills and weapons.\n\n5. A lot of side quests and collectibles.\n\nThe mediocre:\n\n1. Building textures look pretty bad.\n\n2. This game is very taxing on PC's.  It's the only game where my FPS drops to the 30's here and there.\n\n3. Hunting becomes completely obsolete after you acquire certain upgrades, which can be very early depending on how you play.\n\n4. Save system absolutely sucks.  You can lose a lot of progress if you forget to "save" by buying or selling an item in a store.\n\n5. Most of the side quests are unneccesary.  I only did the supply runs, hunter quests, and the trials of the rakyat.  I still managed to get all the money and experience for all skills.\n\n6. Animals and humans don't look that great.  Except the main characters during cut-scenes.\n\n7. Taking over outposts is fun... for a while.  Once you see one, you've seen them all.\n\n8. Some folks criticize the main story, and it's nothing we haven't seen before.  I don't expect much out of the story in a FPS anyways.  I mean, this isn't Mass Effect.  Both endings are kind of crappy I must say.\n\nOverall it's a good, fun game.  But for all the hype it got, I expected a little more depth and less repetitiveness.  It's very similar to Just Cause 2, but with added hunting and stealth.  A good experience while it lasts, but I wouldn't play through it multiple times.\n\n*EDIT: If you want to read up on the game or on whether to get the game or not, don't bother with the Steam forums.  All you'll read are posts about how bad Uplay is.  Uplay runs fine on my end, in games including FC 3, Blood Dragon, and Assassin's Creed 2/Brotherhood/Revelations*","December 8, 2013","true","27.4"," 44 of 65 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","44","65","0","6"

I was introduced into this series with Far Cry 4, with this being the second game I've played in the series. I've noticed a lot of similarites between the two games, in terms of gameplay and such. Regardless, I still had a lot of fun with the game as I loved Far Cry 4, so was bound to like this one as well. Solid graphics and gameplay. I don't really have much to complain about them. You have good combat as there are various ways to go with any situation, whether stealth or head on. Lots of stuff to explore and collect, side missions to do, and more. In terms of story, it serves the setting and game well. It kept me interested and wanting more. Setting is pretty good as well, taking place on an island with lots of mountains, forests, vegatation, caves, ocean, lakes, and much more. Lots to explore on this island. To be honest, I did have some mixed feelings with the last few events at the ending of the story, but overall, was satisfied and happy with the ending I chose and how it turned out. It took me about 36 hours to get 99% completion, for those wondering. I enjoyed the music of the game as well. A fair amount of times during the game's story where I thought it choice of music was quite suited and pretty cool. Overall, there's a lot to do in this game, from hunting, to racing, to assassination missions, to liberating villages, and much more. I was left pretty happy, impressed, and satisfied with this game. Would have no problem playing this game again, as I think of it to be a really great game that I'd definitely recommend to anyone.

And stop complaining without reading my review. Or if you think I have something against the game, then by all means, stay ignorant. This negative review is about Ubisoft, and Uplay, NOT Far Cry 3. ***\n\nFirst of all, I have loved Ubisoft back in the old days, and I thought they were one of the best game companies.\n\nNow? I think it is one of the worst.\n\nFirst of all, let me ask, what the hell is Uplay? And how am I supposed to make this god-awful client even work? I start Far Cry 3 from desktop, by clicking on the icon and nothing happens. But on Steam, it says the game is running. So I have to shut down the game manually....which is not really running in reality. And then I try starting the game from Uplay and I see where it says "Play", but it doesn't look like it is highlighted and not really clickable. In fact, it is not clickable. So then why is it there?\n\nSo....I downloaded the Uplay client itself and tried to play it from Uplay directly. Oh, now "Play" button is clickable there, Yay! Click! It says the game is running on Steam, but I do not see anything again.\n\nI actually installed it once, removed, and re-installed and still nothing is happening. Let's see, Ubisoft, uh, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING ONE OF THE WORST CLIENTS MANKIND HAS EVER SEEN.\n\nAnd guess what, it doesn't seem like I am the only person here. Google "farcry 3 uplay not working" and see for yourself how many people are having problems with this garbage-like client.\n\nOr you need even more proof? Go to the store page of Far Cry 3. And check out the negative reviews on this game. They are mostly about UPLAY.\n\nI have found a few solutions for this, and well, some of the suggestions are to remove certain files, install some new driver, go into some folder and change something........uh....I bought the game, and I have to put up with all this garbage? They might as well put up a warning sign that reads "This game has one of the worst clients that will drive you nuts, so if you don't think you are sure about your PC being able to run the game because of Uplay, then you might want to reconsider purchasing."\n\nGFWL was not that good, but not as bad as this. EA Origin is not bad, but it's actually pretty good. Steam, is definitely one of the best.\n\nUplay? Pure garbage, in fact, it really proves the whole point of Ubisoft being one of the worst companies in the world.\n\nMay I ask why Uplay is necessary? Is it necessary?\n\nUbisoft has the history of screwing up the PC ports of Devil May Cry 3 and Resident Evil 4, the old PC version.\n\n\nIf this is how they are going to do business, well, then I think their games are not worth full price, at all.

Some highlights:\n\n\nOur protagonist meets his friend, who has an escape plan:\n\n"How will we escape?"\n"We found a boat!"\n"Awesome!"\n"A broken boat."\n"I... uh... guess you could fix it..."\n"A broken boat in a cave at the top of a mountain."\n"What?"\n"A cave with no boat-sized exits..."\n"Seriously?"\n"...or any nearby water."\n(long pause)\n"How many of those pills did you take?"\n"Eleventy?"\n"Yeah, that's what I thought..."\n\n\nOur protagonist meets up with Buck, who has been sending him to uncover ancient lost tombs:\n\n"Listen, Buck. The last two times you sent me to a 'lost' tomb, it was filled with pirates. Not centuries-old ghost pirates - the normal kind. And when I got there, you were already there waiting for me. I'd guess that both you and every pirate on the island already knows where the stupid tomb is. So instead of using this magic stone compass thing, why don't we try looking for the tomb on a tourist map first?"\n\n\nOur protagonist meets up with Buck one last time:\n\n"Hey Buck"\n"Hey, Snow White. I'm here to betray you."\n"That was incredibly obvious. Do you realize that I'm holding a small arsenal?"\n"Yep."\n"...and that I killed like 200 dudes on the way here?"\n"Yep."\n"...and that all you have is a dull antique knife, and you're standing on the other side of the room?"\n"Yep."\n"Then why tell me?"\n"Because you can't shoot me during a cutscene."\n"Touche."\n\n\nOur protagonist meets a deep cover agent:\n\n"Hey I've got a plan to kill Hoyt."\n"Hit me."\n"First we'll bring you to his private office and introduce you to him. You'll try to get a job working for him, and after we've earned his trust we'll get you an invitation to one of his poker games. You can kill him when you're alone with him at the game."\n"Wait... this plan starts with meeting Hoyt alone, then follows an elaborate set of steps so we can... uh... meet with Hoyt alone?"\n"Exactly."\n"I can't think of a problem with that. Let's go."\n\n\nOur protagonist is presented with a moral choice at the end of the game:\n\n"Jason, you must choose to leave the island with your friends, or kill them and stay here with me."\n"You want me to do what to my friends?"\n"Kill them."\n"Sorry, I thought you said kill them."\n"I did."\n"Not even if you weren't obviously a psychopath. Nobody would kill their friend for no reason. Actually, nobody would even have lifted the knife to her throat unless a cutscene made them do it. Why would you even include this as an option? Seriously, who thought this ending was worthy of occupying space on my hard disk? Hold on a second. Let me Google this."\n\nJason puts down the knife and pulls out his phone.\n\n"Wait..." he giggles "the main writer thought this plot was clever? Oh my goodness." he starts laughing "the guy thinks that he's subverting video game cliches by just retelling them in the most literal way? Hahaha. Oh this is good. He said in an interview that he thinks we should be looking for deeper meanings rather than just saying 'I get it. That was dumb.' That would be like looking for deeper meanings in Earnest Goes to Camp. He honestly thinks critics hate this plot because we only half-listened to it, not because we understood it and think it's idiotic."\n\nJason ghasps for breath and wipes a tear from his eye.\n\nCitra stares at him for a moment. "So... uh... are you going to kill your friends?"\n\n"No, but thanks for the laughs."\n\n"Wait! What will you do now?"\n\n"Steal some cars and sneak into a bunch more heavily armed compounds because - honestly? That's a riot."\n\nSubscribe to my curator page here\n\nView my other reviews here","February 16","true","29.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","78","21","27","25","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Broskers/recommended/220240/","Broskers","Brosky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Broskers/","572 products in account","After completing Far Cry 3 on normal difficulty, I am now playing through once more on the hardest difficulty and am trying to complete all of the missions this time. I usually don't play through a game twice, but this game is worth it. There are so many things I like about this game, where to start...\n\nOpen World: Far Cry 3 offers a massive, beautiful open world and allows the player to choose one's pace. You can explore the island, do missions, build up skills, build up gear, and follow the story all on your own time. The world is full of goodies like treasures, relics, wildlife (useful and some dangerous), plants, missions, vehicles, and more.\n\nStory: A very simplistic summary would be that you play as a guy who was on a nice trip with his brothers and friends, but then things go downhill and you wakeup in a cage with your brother. You must then escape and save your friends all while building new skills and learning about the island. Of course, it is a rather intricate and enticing storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat, especially when things heat up.\n\nGameplay: Unlike most first person shooters, there are so many ways you can choose to play. You can do the traditional guns-a-blazin, you can be like Hitman and stealth your way through, you can be like James Bond and use your surroundings to unleash hell on your enemies, or you can do what I did which is all of the above.\n\nCharacters: I thought the characters were very well done. One of the main antagonists in the game, Vaas, is personally my favorite video game villain I have encountered. A very interesting character indeed, though I won't say more than that, you will have to play it and find out for yourself. Besides Vaas, the other characters were also very well designed.\n\nWeapons: This game has a weapon for everyone. Pistols, SMGs, LMGs, Snipers, Assault Riffles, Flame Thrower, RPG, Grenade Launcher, Bow, Flare Gun, Explosives, etc. When your weapon holster is maxed out you can carry four weapons. They are all very well balanced, nothing is too underpowered and nothing too overpowered. Very well done.\n\nVehicles: A fair variety of vehicles. Everything you would expect on an island like the one in Far Cry 3. Once again, nothing is too under or overpowered when it comes to vehicles. My favorite would have to be the glider, quite unique and very fun to use.\n\nI could go on, but I'll just add one more thing because I think it was incorporated quite well. There are a few instances throughout the game where you are giving some type of drug that sends your character on hallucinogenic, soul searching journeys. They were quite entertaining and really added to the whole storyline. This is definitely a stoner-friendly game, however I haven't smoked while playing (yet anyway), though it would be fun.\n\nOverall I would give this a 95/100. Not a perfect game, but very captivating. I'm also not a big fan of the Uplay launcher, but my rating didn't reflect on the launcher, just the single player game.","March 24, 2014","true","36.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lickbrains/recommended/220240/","lickbrains","Junebug #1376","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lickbrains/","281 products in account","The ending is enough to justify a negative review but I'll go more in depth...\n\nIt's a Taken/Pocahontas story we've heard before: bunch of bored, spoiled, rich, white kids travel to a deserted island where they get jumped by Spanish-speaking pirates and are held for ransom. One of them runs away (the player) and the story somehow turns into a heroic epic to save Pocahontas and her people. Oh, and the friends he's slowly caring less and less about. Pocahontas and her people grant him powers that they possess but can't use the way he does (or at all) because he's American and they're incompetent and he's special and blah blah blah. Golly gee whiz, I never expected ~*~certain people~*~ to be antagonists! What an original and inspiring plot twist that led to one of the best endings in storytelling history! /sarcasm over. Been there, done that. They had a lot of potential to turn the narrative into a human experience but it was squandered into an anachronistic load of bs we've all seen over and over again. Nty.\n\nThis may just be me but the constant notifications bugged me. A lot. The game doesn't stop pestering you until you check every notification even though you've been notified of the same thing a billion times before that. I know I got a relic, game. I literally just picked it up! I know I can craft a medical syringe; that's why I got the green leaves! Hell, this game notified me so much that, after the first 15 minutes, I already knew how to craft all of the basic pouches and syringes. If I needed to remember, I could just look in the menu. I don't need you constantly reminding me! You are not an alarm so stop it!\n\nIt's a simpler version of Assassin's Creed mechanics in FPS mode. Don't get me wrong, it was still entertaining and the graphics can be absolutely breathtaking but there were too many similarities. Liberating Borgia towers/outposts was pretty entertaining to go through, especially in the second half of the game. Climbing to the highest point and synchronizing/getting radio towers working and doing the Leap of Faith/ziplining down was a tedious chore. I found it more fun to attempt a Leap of Faith and send Jason Brody awkwardly stumbling down the tower to his untimely death. "Stealthing", or more accurately crouching right under your enemy's noses (sometimes literally) and hobbling about, is a joke that unintentionally made me laugh several times.\n\nThe story already felt uninspired. In Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft made me want to do the mini-missions and care about the people just as much as the awesome main missions we chose to do. Whereas in FC3, I tended to skip every single mini-mission because I just didn't give a crap. Sometimes the main missions were just as asinine as the side missions. As someone else said, the game felt more linear because it forced me to go certain directions and do certain things rather than being the promised open world it should have been. I'd get notifications throughout the game saying that if I stepped out of indistinguishable bounds, I'd forfeit a mission I didn't even know I accepted. With some near-identical mechanics, I couldn't help but constantly think about how much I missed playing AssCreed, especially with its superior storytelling and true sandbox gameplay.\n\nLast but not least, cultural appropriation[swanblood.tumblr.com] + magical n*gro[en.wikipedia.org] trope + noble savages[en.wikipedia.org] trope = no bueno. The cultural inaccuracies were equivalent to turning a Mexican quinceanera into a celebration of honor for a McDonald's burger flipper. Maori people and Pakatan Rakyat leaders would not be happy to see the defiling of their history, culture, and traditions. Not cool, Ubisoft.\n\nTLDR: This game's an unoriginal, hot mess that smells like moist butts on warm pee with gameplay that reminds me too much of Assassin's Creed. They had so much originality with AssCreed that they failed to do the same with the latest Far Cry entry. I are disappoint. Skip this and play Blood Dragon instead.\n\nEDIT: Whoa, lots of Far Cry 3 stans it seems. I'd like to challenge any dissenters to take me up on any of this. Don't think I didn't do my research on the failings of this game.

The game is in a constant state of requiring to connect to "far cry 3 services" which is just nonsense. So apparently when I launched the game,  I was greated with "failed to connect to far cry 3 services". Cryptic, for sure. Basically an issue on ubisoft's end.     While playing, every time I access the menu or map (and in this game, you do it a LOT) I was forced to set for about 15-30 seconds after, everytime, interrupted by an immergency message saying the game needed to connect to "far cry 3 services". It failed, every time. After this attempt, I was "allowed" to keep playing as long as I didn't use the map or inventory/crafting screen because then it would try again.\n\n2. The map is beyond glitchy and buggy, its broken and in many instances, preventing the use of fast travel or even basic viewing.\n\nGame itself is fine, the method of delivery is ♥♥♥♥ poor. Avoid.\n\n\nBELOW IS MY PREVIOUS REVIEW TAKE ON THE GAME INITIALLY.\n\n\nI really like this game ! But I'm reviewing the steam digital version here. And unfortunately, compared to what Steam offers, it's downright idiotic that their entire opportunity to use TRADING CARDS or  ACHIEVEMENTS       is GONE because of U PLAY.  U PLAY is like a steam wanna be except it doesn't do what steam does , it just tries to do what xbox live does, and I was never interested in either. I really don't mind U play that much, but its pointless since nobody is going to see your account because nobody uses U PLAY apart from when they are forced to for a few select games of their choosing.\n\nGREAT game ! A little silly stupid sometimes with how inept a character can be until you suddenly gain control and they turn into Rambo's dad.          Hindered by being forced to use a second DRM game launcher that is essentially a second Steam..... that prevents Steam from doing what it does best.  And nobody needs two different online platform accounts for the same game.","December 22, 2013","false","38.7"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","25","36","0","1"

This game was simply, one of the best games I have ever played, for years. When I was little my dad bought me FarCry, and I played it, but it didn't interest me as much, because I was more of an arena gamer. But this game here, man, simply blew my mind. The campaign got me stuck to the characters, and the missions actually gave a challenge. I never bought any thing or used skill points because I never really payed attention to those, but when I started using them, it made the game alot more fun. The campaign has tons of plot-twists and made the game more exciting, and for the choices you choose, it creates a more diverse story.\n\nAs an improvement for the game, it would be better if the "Boss battles" or combat battles would be more realistic, because I feel like I am in a dream whilst dueling Vaas/Hoyt.\n\nOne Hole in the story though, its a slight hole though. IN the beginning, you see a guy in a beanie wearing glasses: THat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Vincent Salas. Who is he? Is he the friend Vaas mentions in the beginning, "DO YOU WANT ME TO CUT YOU OPEN LIKE I DID YOUR FRIEND(Topkek he forgot to say no homo)" Anyways, this character was supposed to be in the game where you accidentally shoot him in the game when you are with Vaas. His name isnt even in the intro, yet you still see him and you are with him. And he was never in any part of the game besides the intro, and none of the characters even mentioned him.

Huge islands to explore with just too many sidequests. You can just run/drive/fly around and do nothing or you can; hunt animals, craft items, free settlements, find relics and other secrets, take over radio towers, do some trials and a whole lot of other activities and (side)quests. It's seemingly endless and completing the entire game will take you probably well over 50 hours. Now that's some value right there.\nThe graphics are just gorgeous, no matter what settings you use. You can't make this game look bad, you just can't. The animations and models are some of the best I've seen in a game. Wow. The same thing applies to the sounds and voice acting, which is brilliant and truly convincing.\nWhile doing the story and sidequests you'll earn XP to upgrade your skills. There are 3 skilltrees in total and the way you play the game is entirely up to you. The Shark skilltree will let you upgrade your assault and healing skills, while the Heron tree will help you with your sniper skills and speed and finally, the Spider tree will let you focus on your stealth and survival skills. There's no right way to play this. There are many ways to complete an objective. And that's what makes Far Cry 3 fun, but not necessarily unique.\nHowever, there aren't many FPS that give you this much freedom, while telling a realistic, focused, story at the same time. So I take my hat off to Ubisoft for creating this masterpiece. The commercial and critical success for this game is well deserved.\nLet this be a lesson - and example - for future first person shooters.

Far Cry 3 – fine to that an example. Competently combining successful elements of two previous episodes (apart from console backs-off the Instincts series), this shooter it is quite expected – and it is deserved – becomes the favourite in the genre. The Geympleyny mechanics also was enriched with a stealth – villains obediently go to that place where you threw a stone, and thus hold up a back under a knife, – but the stealth carries out also other essential function: allows to hide from patrols. Posts and patrols in the second Far Cry at any stage started irritating terribly with the abundance and sticktoitiveness – extreme devils persistently pursued you everywhere while you didn't calm them a well-aimed bullet, and to pass their unnoticed it was difficult. Here the visibility indicator and as soon as you see is provided that the opponent paid attention to your location, it is possible to hide quickly behind a bush, and that will go further on the affairs. Very conveniently to regulate thus number of casual firefights.

The island is really a living place and you can spend a good amount of time by traveling in some car or hunting some animals. By the way, this is the best game to use a bow, I really enjoyed use it during all the game, the gameplay is fantastic.\n\nIt has some great music, sound effects and voice acting but the story could be much better, but it is almost ok. You start trying to save your friends but after some point later in the game I completely forgot about them (and I feel bad for saying it, LOL), but I was having too much fun playing around in the island, going to new towers and hunting new animals between the missions... Well, what can I do?\n\nOn the other hand, Vaas is a great and unique character, unfortunatelly the others aren't that interesting as him (except one soldier in later game...), every time you encounter him is very cool (and crazy).\n\nAfter all that I went to co-op, which is a very linear and short storyline, but is fun and works great. In every mission you will face some sort of competition with your friends (sniper, jet ski, rpgs, buggies, ...) and that makes it even more fun and a lot less repetitive.

DULL, everything is the same and repetitive,  weapons are only FEW and all are similar really, hunting is fun for like 30 minutes and then gets annoying and unnecessary ( you get the holster and ammo pack upgraded in about 30 minutes and anything else you don't need, especially the wallet which I do not understand why even exist since you unlock weapons which are free for ever and everything else u can pick up), fighting is dull as hell mainly due to the easiness. AI is just apes with firearms.  Stealth is ridiculous, enemy must be blind, I can clear out all camps with just a knife. Dont get me started on unlocking the radio towers which is just atrocious, and pointless.\n\n2. Immersion. There is non. Everything feels staged and unrealistic, the story is ok but the main character is a joke. I couldn't get into the story from the very first few minutes. I mean how some random dude from rich family is all of the sudden an expert commando killing machine just cose some doc told him hes a warrior, and what do u know, he suddenly is, climbing, diving, sniping, killing, sneaking and god knows what else he can do.\n\nWhat really hit me was that he's brother actually would be a MUCH better main character knowing he was a military and all, at least I could understand why he handles guns and knife so well, but no, he dies almost immediately. For comparison, in FC2, you are an experienced mercenary/military/hitman with a clear task given, much more immersive and that I can understand, this is my job to eliminate and thus being an ace sniper and firearms master suddenly feels completely not out of place unlike FC3.\n\nWorld is meh, Graphic is meh too, everything feels like its made of plastic.\n\n3. Easy mode all the way. I played the hardest setting, and it was a walk in the park, I can kill the camps in any way there is, name it, knife, sniper rifle, zerg rush with machine gun, rpg barrage, anything really.  But since I really like stealthy strategic approach with sniper rifle, I got to say it was just laughable, I yawned as I was picking enemies off with no problem, and when I got silenced sniper rifle with better zoom? haha I couldn't even be bothered to kill anyone with it, it just felt unfair to the poor AI.\n\nConclusion, to me, this game is a one big bore and the difficulty is insulting. However I can see how  people  like it, its easy to pick up and just shoot away,not what I personally look in fps tho hence that is the reason for me disliking it. And thats why Im not recommending it. It's just not worth of the Far Cry title, its not Far Cry, it resembles Just Cause much more than FC1&2, it is not serious, it is easy and childish, not what I was expecting from FC series.","November 23, 2014","false","12.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","2"

All my hunting for upgrades, over 20 outposts, I'm gutted, truly. But as I said, this game is indeed amazing and I'll take this one on the chin and trod along, making doubly sure my games are being saved (have we not come so far into the gaming world where this is inate?).\n\nTo add insult to injury, uPlay is EXTREMELY intrusive, and one can't even get to the Main Menu without it wanting to download this and download that, download profiles, download stats, it takes a whole couple of minutes EACH TIME before you get into the game! You wanna do trials? Oh ho ho, lets sync (think) first. I've had to force myself to play in offline mode (once again PATHETIC!) just to be able to run the game like the hundreds of other games I have in my library. And the first time uPlay install?

If I wanted to play a Ubisoft game, I'd buy the game and play it via uPlay, but I have STEAM for a reason and it’s just really silly that I have to play a uPlay game THROUGH STEAM.

It has some very interesting features and there are a lot of improvements over the previous game (Far Cry 2), for example:\n\n- Better stealth. Enemies can no longer spot you from miles away and snipe you with a pistol.\n- No more infinite vehicle chase. If you come across an enemy patrol, you can outrun them instead of having them follow you till the end of Earth.\n- More animals. Far Cry 2 had animals (Zebras!), but thtey were extremely rare.\n- No more weapon deterioation. F*** the gun jamming mechanics in Far Cry 2. All it did was to force the player to visit a gun warehouse in between mission.\n- Weapon customisation - horray for red-dot sights\n- Stealth take down - in Far Cry 2 if you sneak up to someone and stab them in the back you will alert everyone nearby, but in Far Cry 3 you can actually perform a stealth kill with a melee weapon and even hide their body.\n- Better fast travel - I can't remember how many bus rides I took during Far Cry 2.\n- Crocodiles. I will never forget the first time I see an unsuspecting NPC get dragged into the river by a crocodile.\n\nHowever, this game also has a lot of flaws, some I found critical, other annoying enough to put me off the game:\n\n- You can't save during a mission. Sure you can quick save (which btw isn't mentioned in the game manual) to keep the loot you have found, but you will lose any other progress if you don't complete the mission in one sitting. Far Cry is supposed to be an open world game, so why the heck do I have to go to the menu to abandon quest if I change my mind half way through?\n- Too bloody many tigers. More than once I have seen an outpost (that I am supposed to conquer) get slaughtered by some wild tiger/komodo dragon. While it's funny to watch the first time, it rapidly gets less interesting after that.\n- NPCs keep repeating the same line. It's as if they only know 20 words in total.\n- Immersion break. If the locals have formed a resistance group against the pirates, aside from the occansion patrols, why is is that I seem to be the only one fighting?\n- Terrible health system that forces you to choose a stealthy approach. Even with a bullet proof vest, you can only last for a few seconds in a gun fight before you health is completely depleted. You pretty much have to thin the enemy out from a distance using a silenced weapon in order to survive.\n- Odd graphics. This game has some very weird shading that reminds me of cell-shaded games. It is as if the developers can't make up their mind on whether to make the game look realistic or cartoonish.\n\nI know that a lot of people will disagree with my opinion and there are a lot of positive reviews out there regarding this game. However, I feel that I have given this game a fair chance and I just cannot get around to enjoying myself playing it.","October 20, 2014","false","7.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Talon_One/recommended/220240/","Talon_One","Talon One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Talon_One/","345 products in account","No. Just no.\n\nThe game is a big step-up from its predecessor and it is really good when you're free roaming the island taking out pirate camps, exploring the monotonous but beautiful landscape. And it looks pretty nice. But that's about it.\n\nThere are a lot of problems with the pacing. Half an hour in the game and I was carrying a modern french assault rifle and a silenced sniper rifle with free access to unlimited ammo if visiting the right places.\nThe crafting mechanics are completely contrived (why do I need tiger-skin to make bigger pouches?) and there is a lot of dissonance between gameplay and story. The protagonist lies in doubt about his actions, about killing other people while ingame recklessly slitting throats of pirates like there is no tomorrow.\n\nThe story itself is very unengaging and the characters in it are just as boring.\n\nThe supporting cast ranges from "meh" (the friends) to "completely braindead and annoying" (everyone else).\nThe big shaman girl is just a ♥♥♥♥♥, calling the main character "no warrior" after he single-handedly defeated a dozen pirate camps while her so-called warriors did nothing at all.\nThe half-enemy strange guy that kidnapped your best friend attacks you with a knife. And for some contrived reason your player character pulls out his knife instead of just shooting him with the MACHINEGUN IN HIS HAND. Argh.\nVaas, the big-bad from the beginning of the game waits around corners to punch you like... fifty times. It gets old VERY fast.\n\nLots of setpieces don't make the slightest sense.\nI have a clear shot at the big-bad-evil-guy and am carrying around a Remington sniper rifle. Can I take the shot? Nope. Because cutscene.\nI escape the pirates and decide to steal a helicopter instead of just slipping into the jungle... why exactly? Oh right, because Vaas needs to recapture the player.\nI finally get the opportunity to attack Vaas' hideout and decide to kick in his front door and go in guns blazing. Alone. Not to mention the combat in this game works best if you rely on stealth and hit&run attacks. Riiiight.\n\nThis level design belongs in a Micheal-Bay-Style FPS like Call of Duty and not in something with this kind of survival-vibe.\nAlso the kills on the antagonists aren't even satisfying because they're just boring QTEs.\n\nIn conclusion:\nIf you want a free-world action game get GTA or Just Cause 2. If you want a spectacle shooter get CoD. If you want a shooter with an engaging anti-war story get Spec Ops: The Line. If you want a first-person survival game.. uhm.. Metro? Stalker?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteelSasquatch/recommended/220240/","SteelSasquatch","SteelSasquatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteelSasquatch/","45 products in account","Amazing.\n\nThis game is an absolute masterpiece, and in this review, I'm gonna stick by Yahtzee's rule of: "A game must be able to stand on singleplayer alone." and, wow, this game really does stand out. The summary of this is that you (the protagonist) and your friends has been kidnapped by pirates and you've escaped. The rest of the game you are trying to get them back.\n\nVenturing throughout the game, you battle amongst different species of animals, depending on the food chain. This includes sharks, snakes, komodo dragons, crocodiles, tigers, panthers, and bears. Majority of a lot of the predators on the island include intense quicktime events when they attack by suprise. One sticking out would be a crocodile attack. If you fail to complete the quicktime event, the animal kills you. If you finish it, you either kill the animal, or damage it. You need to also kill animals to craft larger objects (bigger bandolier, more space in wallet). A situation which I found hilarious was where I was hunting for tapir to gather their pelt. I was interrupted by a tiger, who literally left my health at the lowest point. To which I retreat to the river where I was instantly attacked by a crocodile. The game realistically shows all the different situations in the jungle and proves Vaas as he said: "if the jungle doesn't eat you up alive, I will.".\n\nGoing onto characters, Vaas is one of the best villians I have ever had the pleasure of laying my eyes against. True fact, Vaas wasn't even supposed to be in the game, Michael Mondo's(Vaas' voice actor) audition pleased Ubisoft so much, that they decided to create the character Vaas for him. As you saw the summary above, which is quite bland, Vaas introduces the story of insanity. To which it makes you think, what if all of this isn't happening and you're sedated or on drugs? What if this is all a dream? I may be sounding completly irrelevant and random, but the theme of insanity really does make you wonder what is actually going on throughout. Not to mention there are even more villians than Vaas.\n\nWhile you battle pirates and animals, you have a wide range of weapons to choose from. There are RPGs, bows, SMGs, rifles, shotguns, flamethrowers, flare guns and machetes. Not to mention you get to customize your weapons, for instance, you can add a red dot sight to your bow to help accuracy or add a extended mag to your rifle to stop running out of ammo quicker.\n\nYour character also gets tattoos from the Rakyat which improve your fighting and stealth skills. The tattoos you get to pick from are the heron, the shark and the spider. Tattoos that would be an example would be moving faster while crouching, the throwing knife takedown and the added health bars.\n\nIf you are thinking "tl;dr", then my summary of this review is that this game is one of my favorites I have ever played along with other great games like Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, and Fallout. There are a few problems with the UPlay, which ruins it a bit. But all in all, a great game.\n\n10/10 GG Ubisoft.","June 20, 2014","true","34.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","5"

The game constantly crashes. Why is this game so buggy? When I attempt to load it will get stuck in an endless loop. If I try to buy a gun, it crashes. If I try to update my skill tree, it crashes.\n\nWhen the game gets going, I have a lot of fun. I love the open world aspect. I can explore what I want and go where I want. I can take out enemies stealthy with a knife or go in guns blazing. The world is beautiful and fun to explore.\n\nUnfortunately, I found this game can get repetitive within the first island. Rather than create new challenges, it seems like take another base (with the same enemies). Yes, you can attempt to stealth it, or go full on combat, but eventually it loses its flare. Looking for relics gets boring fast. The game designers made some interesting puzzles to solve, but it feels like bad version of Tomb Raider. Relics lose novelty fast, after 60 of them, if you arn't completely bored of them, you still have another 60 more to go. Its fun to watch the world get reinhabited by the island folk, but their animations, or scripted events get boring fast. It almost seems meaningless to take a base from the enemies and where do the good villagers come from? It would be fun to find villagers hiding and occupying little outlying huts.\n\nAm I happy that I purchased this game? ...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RyneS/recommended/220240/","RyneS","Ryne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RyneS/","1858 products in account","7/10 -What a trip. I enjoyed hunting animals to craft items, Looting, finding relics and completing side missions to get money to upgrade and buy weapons, stealth killing, sniping from a long distance to shoot a cage to let a tiger out of it and watch it maul everyone nearby, taking over enemy posts so I can fast travel to them, fixing towers to show the map and unlock new weapons, running people and animals over with my car, upgrading my character with xp to unlock new moves, starting things on fire and watching it spread and last but not least the story missions. You can craft plants but I ended up not crafting any except green ones which give you health because the rest of the plants you can craft are basically useless. Who wants to craft a plant to allow you to be flame retardant for 15 secs? I didn't care anyway.\n\nUnlike plants crafting animals is useful since you can carry more weapons at a time among other things by collecting their skins. I had fun hunting these animals in the wild and checking my list of how many I needed of a certain breed to create whatever it was. However it was pointless hunting animals anymore after you craft everything unless you want to gain barely any money in doing so or just for the hell of it. Looting dead bodies got really annoying because you have to wait and see the same animation over and over again. There is no way to skip it. Another annoying problem was if their weapon is nearby you have to hover over a certain spot on their body to loot them since you use the same key press to pick up their weapon...why couldn't I just hover over their body and get the loot automatically without pressing anything and press a key if I wanted their weapon? I ended up all the time swapping my weapon accidently because of it.\n\nThere is really no death animations just ragdoll physics. Which is disappointing since I liked how in Far Cry 2 you can snipe someones leg and they start yelling in pain from it and if one of their friends is nearby they could pick them up and carry them to safety. You shoot anyone in the leg in this game they just die and fall over. The story was a let down to me. It's really a big lame excuse to kill people on an island. You go to the extremes to save your friends in any situation. I didn't like the main characters voice it was annoying and laughable at the sametime. It doesn't help that your character is a real ♥♥♥♥♥ and makes very poor decisions you have to watch unfold that you don't like. The ending wasn't satisfying at all.\n\nDon't get me wrong though I did enjoy alot of the story missions. The co-op is alright but can be frustrating due to waves of overwhelming odds and connection issues. The motion blur in this game gave me headaches and there is no way to turn it off. I am only nitpicking here but you can't blow up a car or truck by sniping it's fuel tank. You can't cut down trees. You can't blow up a building having it's walls collapse in. You can't fly a helicopter. You can't even see your own feet. It's no Crysis that's for sure but I did have fun and I spent alot of time just wrecking havoc.","December 14, 2014","true","37.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Now don't get me wrong I'm sure there are better games out there, but Farcry 3s enticing story (I'm about halfway through atm) and deep character progression are something to behold. (Not to mention the incredible voice acting).\nThis game offer many different ways to play and there are multiple ways to complete a mission. When you're not off killing pirates and blowing s##t up, you can kick back and go out hunting (surprisingly therapeutic) or play some mini games that the villagers offer. There is an unbelievable amount to be done is this game and the whole map feels like a playground, where you do things your way.\nI would go into the story, but I'd get carried away and probably spoil something, so all I'll say is that Vaas is possibly my favourite villian of all time be it in a book, movie and of course game. So I'm not saying everyone will love this game, but if you like the freedom to do whatever the hell you want and also don't mind a pretty brilliant story (in my opinion) then just buy it! I nearly didn't because of all the complaints about a so called Uplay, but trust me its not that bad! A little unesscary, but once in game you forget all about it.","February 15","true","28.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The game is pretty.  That is the only good thing I have to say about this game.\n\nThe following review may contain spoilers!!!  You've been warned!!!\nYou start Far cry 3 and the first thing you notice is how great everything looks and you think to yourself "This is gonna be great".  Since this is a game that lets you free roam you do the first storyline mission, maybe two and then you just go explore.  The problem with exploring is there really isn't anything to explore.  You have to liberate the radio tower in an area to unlock the map and then you get 2-3 camps to liberate to remove enemy soldiers from the area.  The only other thing to do is find all the collectible crap that might unlock signature weapons but mostly is just there to keep the OCD people playing until they complete 100%.  Everything that was fun or interesting about the game was over by the time I finished the first island.  The second island in the game was not fun at all and contains pretty much every crappy gimmick that has been put into video games in the past decade.  Seriously timed button presses, mini games,  and poorly made rail shooters.  I only completed the storyline missions on the second island just so I could finish the game.  It wasn't fun, interesting, or engaging.  It seems like they knew their game was bad so they decided to make you have to jump through hoops to unlock literally everything in the game.  You have to unlock the map, the weapons, extra weapon slots, extra ammo slots, all the skills, literally everything.  Nothing in this game happens without you performing some kind of grind.  This isn’t fun, what happened to the days when games were fun?\n\n","February 13, 2014","false","31.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The story is terribly written in my opinion and doesnt fit at all in the far cry series. the gameplay is very repetetive, with each outpost having the same structure. it comes too predicable that even at the hardest difficulty you can easily do well at the game just using a pistol.\n\nIn the story (Both co-op and single player) it's just cliche after cliche after cliche. It happens so often that it just gets annoying and it just feels awful. You get no connection to the protagonist at all, you won't llike him, you don't even want to be him and wish he'd just jump off a cliff, break his ankles and left there for no one to be found ever. Neither do you feel connected to the world. In most games you get a sense of where you are, roads feel familiar, certain parts feel like home. In this game it is just jungle after beach after dirt road and they all just seem the same.\n\nThe story is full of spiritual nonsense that could fit in a setting centuries ago or in a different kind of world (where magic and unicorns exist), but not in the 21-st century on a tropical island where everybody has 17 guns. If you have a gun, you don't need some pretentious spiritual power to kill just another thug with a group of his guards. Honestly, the only way the game is fun is to just avoid all storyline missions, not using the map and running around blindly shooting people. Basically what Far\nCry 2 consisted of.\n\nThe co-op is kind of alright in the game. The campaign doesnt really have that much story (this doesn't really matter though, it's about shooting things with your friends). It consists of multiple chapters which can be played chronologically. It's fun to do a few times, but the problem is that all these chapters are so repetetive and contain the same things, you never get a nice surprise. The worst part is the extreme glitchiness in Co-op. Anybody has a ping over 60? Fat chance that when you respawn after everyone dies, somebody on your team will just randomly drop dead and has to wait for the next checkpoint. Or he seems to appear on top of a building, while you're standing inside it. Good luck saving him when he gets incapacitated. Furthermore it is impossible to play with 2 players, as random kicks without a visible reason happen very often. if you play it with 2, and one gets kicked, you automatically get booted because 'there aren't enough players.' Say goodbye to your progress.\n\nAll in all, get off the store page, and spend your money on a better game. But not this, don't do this to yourself.","December 18, 2013","false","198.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This is all great and fun indeed.\n\nThe graphics are quite great especially with everything turned up.\n\nYou're probably asking why I don't recommend this game.\n\nUbisoft seems to have trouble programming and supporting its titles beyond console release.\n\nThsi game is littered with gamebreaking bugs, glitches and will make your machine regardless of if it is top of the line 2 years ago or top of the line today to crash or hang.\n\nSometimes you'll be able to play the game for 4 or 5 hours straight no problems other times you'll have difficulty having it running for 15 minutes.\n\nIt seems to be a theme with Ubisoft every PC port they make has an unexcusable number of problems.\n\nIn addition to this there is the extra layer of trashware implemented - Uplay.  Which is basically a massive Ubisoft advertisment which requires administrative access to run and is morethan likely one of the causes for autosave points to crash your machine.\n\nIf you would like your machine to crash more times in the one playthrough of a game than over the last 3 years, by all means buy this game.  If you want ot keep your sanity and send a message to Ubisoft that PC gamers will not put up with a half ♥♥♥♥♥ job then do not buy this game.","January 7, 2014","false","52.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

You have a wide open world with alot to explore and... well thats it. There is virtually NOTHING else to do in this game beyond the story. You can do super TINY lil missions like "Go kill a lion with this bow" and capture little camps so that your buddies can take it over and even then the fight is easy on account of it being a simple "kill 8 dudes" kinda deal.\n\nThe story is pretty bad in my opinion. You play a total wimp rich white boy with less hair on his chest than a newborn. There is no choice in the majority  story at all which would not be so bad if the story was good. The supporting cast is relatively bland and fail to be interesting or even create any sort of bond between you and them. I only like one on your friends because he looks like Nick from L4D2.\n\nYour character (besides being a limp-weenie) is an utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥. CHECK YOUR CORNERS DANGIT! The story of the game also involves a large amount of tribal ritual mumbo jumbo that I find utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are alot of drug-related sequences you go into in this game to the point where I just know my guy is going to have a serious addiction.\n\nThe combat is just pathetic. Its not interesting due to a lack of enemy intelligence and overall difficulty. The game is so easy and I played it on the 2nd hardest difficulty. I could have pushed it to the max with little difference. The AI are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and present no challenge. They all act as independent units with no teamwork at all other then random chance bringing them together. Stealth in this game is alright in of itself, but feels entirely hallow due to knowing that you can breeze through the enemy 12x as fast if you just ran in. Stealth killing the enemy loses its pleasure when you know the enemy are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe crafting is weak as all it results in is you becoming MORE overpowered and giving you even LESS of a challenge.\nThe story is crap.\nThe combat is crap.\nThe story is MEGA crap.\nThe main character is ULTRA crap.\nBuuuuuut the game is very pretty. The visual design is by far the strongest part of this game.\n\nIs it a bad game? No. I dislike it because I value characters and story very highly and this game utterly fails in this department destroying my attempt at an un-biased view.","January 3, 2014","false","14.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

An open world FPS experience has never felt so polished before.\n\nStory:\n\nIn the third installment of the Far Cry series you take over the role of Jason Brody, a 25 year old american daredevil who is currently on a holiday with his friends and brothers in Thailand. Everything is party and fun until the group goes skydiving over the supposedly uninhabited Rook Islands, only to land on a world occupied by pirates who deal with kidnapping and human trafficking…\n\nWhile the plot is not as mature and meaningful as the one of Far Cry 2, it’s more than first meets the eye, being a carefully built satire.\n\nCharacters are very deep, and Vaas Montenegro is one of the coolest antagonists ever to show up in a game.\n\nThough not directly related to the main plot/story line, the detailed history of Rook Islands (going back all the way to ancient China), the Rakyat (the native people of the islands) the Japanese occupation during the second world war, etc. adds a lot to the game and to the immersion.\n\n9/10\n\n\nVisuals:\n\nFar Cry 3 looks absolutely stunning. Colorful yet wild, the tropical world has never looked so good and alive before, with breath taking landscapes and dozens of animals roaming/flying around. This is definitely one of those games you just enjoy by looking at. The variety is also impressive, from the lush jungles to the sandy beaches, from ancient temples to small villages, it’s simply a pleasure to roam around, and explore, and the small details really make it feel rewarding.\n\nCombat also looks and thus feels great, with brutal animations and beautiful explosions, making firefights incredibly fun.\n\nThe day-night cycle (although somewhat short) is present as well and adds a lot to the visuals, creating sights which will easily take your breath away.\n\nOf course, such visuals will require a decent system in order to run smoothly on High and/or Ultra detail settings. On the test rig (for reference see test system specifications at the bottom of the review), I could run Far Cry 3 at 1080p Ultra details and 2xMSAA with very good frame rates. I did get some rare fps drops in very intense fight scenes, but even then the game was more than smooth enough to be played. Turning MSSA over 2x however, pretty much killed my frames, but this is absolutely acceptable considering the visual quality. All in all, you will need something like an Intel Core i5 3570K or an AMD FX-8350 CPU paired with a GeForce GTX 770 (GTX 680) or an AMD Radeon R9 280X (HD 7970 Ghz Edition) GPU to be able to play on Ultra settings with 2-4xMSAA at 1080p resolution. However, I also know people who play Far Cry 3 on low end PC's or laptops and they were still able to get decent fps rates on low to medium detail settings, so the game seems to be quite well optimized... thumbs up for Ubisoft (for a more in depth analysis on system requirements I advise you to check the "Far Cry 3 Performance Test: Graphics & CPU" on Techspot).\n\n10/10\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nIf you thought visuals were the game’s greatest strength, you were wrong… the gameplay is simply fantastic. Far Cry 3 takes over where Far Cry 2 left off, but delivers so much more in a significantly more polished way.\n\nThe main plot is long, with varied and fun to play missions. The secondary missions/quests may not be as meaningful as in Far Cry 2 for example, but the game more than makes up for them with the unbelievably fun exploration, hunting, gathering, collectibles, etc. Really, collecting stuff and exploring has never felt as rewarding and as fun, whether you are searching for relics or letters from the Japanese soldiers (who occupied the islands during the Second World War), or whether you are hunting a rare white tiger or gathering herbs, you will have fun.\n\nYou could probably rush through the main plot in 15-20 or so hours, but if you allow yourself sucked into the world of Rook Islands you can spend 75+ hours and you will still have plenty of stuff to do. Simply awesome.\n\nOf course this is an FPS, so one of the main questions here is, how are the guns? Short answer: great! There are well over 20 weapons to choose from, pistols, sub machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, light machine guns and even exotics like the flame thrower or the re-curving bow. Also, almost all weapons are customizable, you can attach sound suppressors, scopes, extended magazines, etc. providing a truly varied arsenal which you can configure to perfectly fit your play style.\n\nLong range and close quarter combat is usually viable in every FPS, but Far Cry 3 will also be completely playable using stealth tactics, even more, you will be rewarded for stealthy kills and takedowns (which are awesome by the way), or carefully and tactically liberating outposts without getting detected. Oh and do you remember the outpost re-spawn problem from Far Cry 2? It's gone! In Far Cry 3 a libreated outpost is taken over by the Rakyat, and will serve as a safe house.\n\nAs in the previous Far Cry installments, vehicles are also available. And I have to say (at least for me personally), the cars handle better and are more fun to drive than in many racing games… which is not something we are used to from an FPS.\n\nBut Far Cry 3 is so much more than a simple open world FPS… the introduction of RPG elements might sound scary for some hardcore FPS fans, but Far Cry 3 nailed it. During your adventures you gain experience and eventually level up, which is rewarded with skill points which you can use to unlock some incredibly cool and brutal takedown moves and other bonuses. The skills feel balanced, you’ll never become a Terminator, but they are also rewarding enough to make you want to unlock them.\n\nAnd we are still not done, Far Cry 3 also has crafting! Now don't imagine a complex gathering/crafting system. You can gather skins and furrs from animals to create ammo bags and pouches, and different plants for different syringes which can heal you or provide different short term bonuses. Not much but it perfectly fits the game and the setting.\n\n10/10\n\n\nSound:\n\nWhile the previous Far Cry games were ok when it came to sounds, they never really managed to impress me. Far Cry 3 is different, the soundtrack finally contains some memorable tunes, the ambient sounds are great, the guns, the explosions and combat in general sounds brutal, and the voiceovers are some of the best I heard in a long time, again with Vaas stealing the show.\n\n10/10\n\n\nReplay value:\n\nFar Cry 3’s plot is linear, and there aren't many choices you can take, you won’t replay the game for the different endings, but for everything else, because Far Cry 3 is pure fun. And... for Vaas!\n\n9/10\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe third Far Cry game really managed to put an incredibly polished and fun gameplay onto the table. It would be nice if developers finally understood that visuals and content are important, but in the end, it’s the gameplay that will really make a game fun to play… because a good game is fun to play.\n\nGreat games however, are not only fun to play, but also look great and also have tons of content, and Far Cry 3 is one of these, it simply delivers in everything. Definitely a must have!\n\n9.5/10\n\n\n\nTest system specifications:\n\nAMD FX-8350 (OC @ 4.6 GHz); 8 GB DDR3 RAM @ 1866 MHz; AMD Radeon R9 280X (AMD Catalyst 14.4 and 14.9), Windows 8.1 64 Bit Pro.","October 24, 2014","true","113.2"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

The console way of going through options and interacting with stuff also affects FC3 and heavily so. I personally have raged so hard over this, because it started as a PC game and I looked so much forward to FC3. What a load of zhit. Honestly and I I'm sorry for the language, but this is completely ret@rded. Waypoints even on the hardest settings showing where to go to begin with. You have to mash space to knife a guy, and you have a feeling that the game is made for five year old kids. A hint system that is forced upon you, and while you go through it you can't do anything. All options are locked, you want to throw a stone and make some noise? Well too bad, wait for the game to allow you to do so. You need to jump over an obstacle, you just press space and your characters does it. Forget about the game engines of Quake or Unreal, where you actually could jump around and had a feeling about the world. Don't buy it and make the same mistake I did, get the pirated version and decide afterwards whether this is something for you. Money completely wasted on my behalf.","December 20, 2013","false","23.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The story is about Jason Brody having a vacation on an island. And wakes up in a cage realising that his vacation is over and he has to save all his friends so they can get back home. This sounds and also felt generic. But as you continue through the game the story gets more and more interesting, due to well voiced characters and the inspiring monologues. The game also felt like some kind of total recall to me, because the character has many drug trips. So even when I was playing the normal sp missions I was asking myself if it wasn't just a drug trip. Because if the bulk of the story was a drug trip the story would make a lot more sense. The campaign story was mostly the reason that kept me playing.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay other hand was good and entertaining, but nothing special for me. Some early missions could be annoying, because you were forced to play stealthily. Also the sp missions can sometimes feel as a narrow route.  The power of the gameplay itself is that you can choose how you want to play. stealthily or guns blazing. Both can be fun but both also have some issues. The stealth problem is that the ai can be annoying. And for guns blazing you can easily run out of ammo and have to break your arm to revive yourself many times if you play guns blazing.(Atleast on my difficulty. I would maybe recommend to play 1 difficulty below or first do a lot of side missions to unlock more health, weapons etc.) Also if you have no ammo you mostly have to camp until you can easily knife someone, without getting hit. Sadly every endboss fight from the game showed the definition of insanity in gameplay. The game was also a bit overwhelming in the beginning because of the many menus with upgrades. At first I ignored them, but later I really saw the benefit of it. Otherwise you will easily die.  The graphics of the game still look nice, I especially liked the lighting. And how much effort there had been put into the building.\n\nOpen World:\nI have to be honest I haven't done that much in it. Because I wasn't really interested in it. Still I can say if you are interested in exploring the world there is alot to do! There are enough side-missions, which is mostly killing enemies/animals in a certain way, missions where you have to go from A to B as fast as you can etc and, of course, collecting stuff. Really the only thing that made me stop fast-traveling from mission to missions was the tower climbing and the animal/flower hunt to unlock stuff. They were more rewarding to me than the side missions that just give you money and xp that I already had enough of.\n\nOnline:\n\nMultiplayer:\nIn my opinion the mp isn't that special. It has 4 standard game modes. Of course they are varied with some nice ideas. But to me it just feels like a cod-clone. The multiplayer also has a strong map editor. Probably at the time there were many great mods made. (I found some interesting ones on youtube. ) But now that the game isn't as active anymore, I couldn't find a modded map to play.\n-Co-op:\nI played the co-op with someone many months before continuing my singleplayer campaign. It was pretty long at 6-8 hours. But still the co-op was pretty generic and forgetable. The only thing that I liked were the mini-games. What is strange is that the multiplayer and the co-op leveling system are combined. So if I had only played Co-Op, I would have all the unlocked loadouts for the multiplayer.\n\nOverall:\nI can say Farcry 3 is a great game, but you can ignore the multiplayer and co-op, because they aren't that special and that active anymore. I think for the people who only own FarCry 4, FarCry 3 is still a great game to play, especially for the campaign, that makes it something special.","July 5, 2015","true","27.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasedAvellone/recommended/220240/","BasedAvellone","The American Tolkien","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasedAvellone/","260 products in account","Far Cry 3 is a hugely enjoyable open world FPS set on a beautiful tropical island.\n\nGame-play is great, providing many alternate methods of completing your objectives. This offers players the chance to use stealth and silent weapons to pick off their enemies one-by-one while remaining undetected. Alternatively you can run in and gun everyone down, which is slightly less fun and not as rewarding. Many games boast this feature of choice and always seem to be lacking in either the stealth system or just general combat. I'm glad to say that Far Cry 3 delivers on both fronts.\n\nThe game offers a huge array of things to do aside from the main campaign. There are around 30 outposts, 20 radio towers and tons of extra side missions sprawled around the game map. Completing all of these side activites is bound to give you numerous benefits, but not without a challenge. Far Cry 3 also contains one of the best hunting system I've seen in gaming. While not forcing you to have to hunt for survival or anything, hunting will give you many materials to help craft items to make you character carry more items, weapons and money.\n\nNow, the story. At first the story of Far Cry 3 doesn't seem like much, you're an American tourist on holiday with your friends to an exotic Indonesian island. But what lives on this island is much more sinister than you expect. A huge group of pirates, lead by Vaas Montenegro, a once good man driven to insanity by the temptations of evil.\n\nYou are Jason Brody, a typical American who has a desire for adventure. The character arch of Brody is great, showing how much a man can change when something is taken from him. The story is one of madness, strength and discovering the darkness of human nature.\n\nThe visuals are pretty excellent. The world is colourful, vibrant and perfectly lit, the island and all of the characters on it look spectacular, even on the medium settings my PC was forced to run it at.\n\nThe soundtrack is overall pretty great, especially a track which appears toward the end of the main campaign.\n\nI highly recommend picking this up if you're a fan of FPSs and/or open-world games. It's worth it at full price but this game is no stranger to sales so it might be best to wait until the time is right and pick it up for less.\n\nuPlay also seems to be bearable with this.","June 20, 2014","true","30.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

And if it was just that first island with the distinct characters and the well-crafted experience, it wouldn't have me giving it a thumbs-down, but the problem is, the game takes this massive nosedive in the back half.\n\nI feel like I should state I had fun with half of this game, and so if you can find it for half price, that seems reasonable, but as a whole, this is the digital equivalent of swimming half of a lane pleasantly, and then finding that the return trip has replaced your flippers with concrete blocks.","June 23, 2015","false","19.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

So far I have not been able to do so because Uplay's "cloud protection" wipes out saves, rewrites, replaces and overall just messes everything up.

IMO This game overall is nothing special. Even playing on the hardest difficulty this game was easy. Tank your way through and inject enough medical needles to turn yourself into a walking testosterone infused pot head, and you will be fine. Stealthing made it a little more challenging, but not by much.\nThe story is nothing to right home about, most of the characters are just boring, the script for most of them was like somthing out of a bad modern action movie, opened world with not much to do, money is freaking EVERYWHERE, obtaining new weapons is as easy as climbing a tower, upgrading all of your varius storage packs are as simple as killing a few animals, and this game is repetitive AS HELL!\nFind artifacts and letters (it's as easy as an easter egg hunt), liberate outposts by killing about 6 to 8 guards, climb towers to get free stuff, damsel in distress, medical runs, hunt animals and bandets, and the main story (about 8 hours).\nThats it, there is nothing that makes this game stand out from the rest.\nThe story didn't have a stong start and just feels like poorly writen action movie. It doesn't become interesting until a character named vaas tells you the definition of insanity. But once he dies the story goes down hill again faster than lemmings.\nIt's not all bad though, a few of the characters are interesting along with some dialogue, and it tries to spice things up. But it's not enough to backlash all of the ♥♥♥♥.\nOver all if you are a FPS junky and don't mind doing the same thing over and over and over again go for this game.\nBut if you want games with outstanding sotries, interesting gameplay, new and different ideas, and memorable characters. look elsewhere.\nAlso, note how i never metioned the graphics and multiplayer? Thats because almost every ♥♥♥♥ING FPS does nothing but that now.","February 23, 2014","false","20.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stevencojo/recommended/220240/","stevencojo","Steven Cojo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stevencojo/","2403 products in account","Quite a memorable game with memorable characters. Despite being mostly a free-roam game, with plenty of distractions and activities, like hunting, killing, swimming, gliding etc. it has a decent story.\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, the characters are one of the strongest points in this game, every character with their own strong personalities, each one with their own insanity, great voice acting and motion track. The motivation and choice freedom of the protagonist feel a bit wooden and not quite dynamic, but the diversity in the activities, making it feel not quite so linearity dependent, compensates for the lack of story control.\n\nThe story can be easily completed with minimum of effort, since difficulty doesn't really represent an impediment (if you play shooters often, you can aim for the highest difficulties), but making the side activities do help in certain cases, especially for the traveling part.\n\nThe vehicle control is quite fluent, reminds me of the car from Half-Life 2. The weapons can be customized in a variety of ways, from adding attachments to adding a camo, quite easy to use, they have ironsight, so for any Call of Duty player they should be a no-brainer.\n\nIt has a sort of RPG-like skill tree, which allows you to get new abilities and features, supporting your gameplay as well as your herb/animal crafting system.\n\nThe co-op is average, not much of a story, really linear levels, it's basically a cooperative competition, since each level contains a sort of mini-game with ranking, so you will be able to beat your friends and brag about it. It's sometimes bugged, you may be spawning dead, fall through the ground.\n\nThe multiplayer is quite...empty...not many people play it, it has basic game modes like team deathmatch and domination like modes, feels a lot like a "Call of Duty" style. You also have a multiplayer leveling system (not the same with the one from single player), which will unlock new weapons/skills etc. I also happened to encounter some cheaters and some bugs.\n\nAlso wanted to add that this game's antagonist (the cool one), Vaas, was a source of inspiration for one of my cosplay projects, feel free to check it out. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=291330025","August 15, 2014","true","74.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/220240/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Far Cry 3 is a game that takes place in Rook Island, which is divided into North Island and South Island. You begin the game as Jason Brody, an American tourist who is vacationing with his friends looking for fun on this tropical paradise. Things go wrong when pirates kidnap them for the purpose of selling them into slavery. You encounter a leader named Vaas Montenegro, who makes life a living hell for you and your friends. Later you’ll run into another nasty guy in the name of Hoyt Volker, who lives in the South Island has more powerful pirates protecting him.\nJason may seem like an ordinary guy, but you can make him quite powerful using the skill tree system. There is plenty to explore, including the plant life, the animal life, and the numerous outposts controlled by the pirates. You will also get to know the Rakyat, the natives of the island and you will learn their traditions as you progress through the story. The story missions are interesting and well-scripted, but the most exciting part of the game is being able to freely explore the island when not working on a story mission. The world has plenty of randomness such as shootouts between the Rakyat and the pirates. Other times you will see animals attacking the Rakyat. On some occasions you will see animals like bears, tigers, and leopards attacking the Rakyat tribe. On other occasions you will see tigers or bears stalking boars. Sometimes the predatory animals will come after you and you will have to kill them in order to survive. Other times you see a pack of dogs with one howling like a wolf. You look around to see if these animals are stalking you.\nThere can be benefits to killing animals in the game. After killing them you can skin them in order to craft bigger wallets to hold more cash and craft loot rucksacks to carry more leaves and loot recovered from containers and dead bodies. Liberating outposts requires you to kill all pirates guarding them so that they can be your safehouse. The game rewards you more for using stealth than for going all out on a shootout against the pirates. Each outpost contains alarm panels near the flags representing the outposts that pirates can use to call reinforcements should they find you. But you can shoot out the alarm panels to eliminate the possibility of reinforcements. The sniper rifle comes in very handy when trying to liberate outposts. I would shoot a few pirates and find a place to hide by hiding behind rocks and in the foliage. The XP gained from liberating outposts is used to develop Jason in different ways. This is the RPG element of Far Cry 3. There really no wrong skill to learn because all the skills are useful in some way. You can learn to take down an enemy from behind using the brutally effective machete. Then you can learn to take down an enemy by taking one down from behind and throwing the machete immediately to take down a nearby enemy without alerting others. Liberated outposts offer side missions such as assassinations and hunting animals both common and rare. You have to complete assassinations by using your brutal knife, so using any other weapon will result in mission failure. This is in line with Rakyat tradition that you will learn to respect in Rook Island. The hunting of animals requires you to first stop by a site to pick up a weapon designated for hunting the animals. Using any other weapon will result in mission failure. The hunting of rare animals is rather interesting because the skinning of these animals will help you craft larger wallets, larger ammo pouches, larger loot rucksacks, larger syringe kits, etc. So hunting and crafting go hand in hand and will help you throughout your exploration of the island.\nWhether you’re hunting, crafting, searching for relics or lost letters from dead WWII Japanese soldiers or progressing through the main story, Far Cry 3 is rarely boring. You can unscramble radio towers throughout the island to make your map clearer to read and to help Rakyat supply lines. As soon as you kill deactivate a radio tower, you will have a supply drop side mission available. Supply drops require you to drop medical supplies within a certain time limit. This type of side mission lets you know how treacherous driving can be in Rook Island. It also can get a little repetitive. In my opinion, the supply drops side missions are the most tedious in the game.\nThere are many vehicles that you can drive, but driving on the roads can feel a bit awkward. Driving boats and watercraft can be a lot of fun while exploring the gameworld by sea. You can navigate from one place to another by ziplining, which is more fun from a first-person view than I expected. It’s cool to zipline, get to drop down on a pirate, and brutally stab him at the same time. There are hang gliders scattered throughout the island that you can use to reach faraway places or hard to reach areas.\nIn the original Far Cry you could use binoculars to tag enemies you see in the distance. Far Cry 2 removed that feature to make it more realistic. Far Cry 3 has brought back the ability to tag enemies in the distance, so you will be able to see enemies through walls after tagging them. Weapons would eventually wear down in Far Cry 2, so you had to replace them. In Far Cry 3 weapons never wear down from use and you can upgrade them using the built-in store in each safehouse for a price. Some weapons can be upgraded by using attachments such as a sniper scope, a laser sight, or a silencer. Some weapons can also be customized by painting them in a variety of colors that are available in the built-in store.\nThe AI in the game is very good, as you will see enemies react to dead bodies. They will automatically go into search mode in an attempt to find you. They will try to flank you if they detect you or they can hide behind objects such as rocks and shacks. They enemies work as a team when trying to find you and kill you.\nThe graphics of Far Cry 3 have very impressive textures and make Rook Island look alive. The animals are incredibly detailed and so are the skies whether it’s sunny or raining. The details of the faces of the Vaas and Hoyt look amazingly realistic as do the faces of the pirates.\nWithout trying to spoil the end of the game, I will only say that there are two endings. Each ending leaves you with moral choices to contemplate. The story missions are somewhat linear, but having two possible endings for the game makes it more entertaining.\nIn my opinion, Far Cry 3 is the best in the Far Cry series. The other two Far Cry games emphasized an open gameworld, but Far Cry 3 is the most open gameworld and the random encounters really help this game. The randomness ensures that the result of approaching an outpost will never be the same each time. You may infiltrate an outpost on your own only to be interrupted by a predatory animal such as a bear, tiger, or leopard. Sometimes, your attempt to liberate an outpost is thwarted by a jeep filled with pirates. Far Cry 3 is a classic action game that I highly recommend to anyone.\n","June 5, 2014","true","120.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Ubisoft must be proud of this game. Far Cry 3 takes the open-world action onto a completely new level. You can either spend your time completing missions, overtaking enemy outposts or hunt animals. Hunting animals isn't there just so the jungle feels alive, it actually has a huge purpouse. You can skin animals and craft wallets to store more money, craft better weapon holsters, or craft potions to, for example, see all enemies, all animals, regenerate health etc. Upgrade and customize your weapons exactly the way you want. You can even fight SHARKS in the game, which feels absolutely INSANE.\nThat was only the Singleplayer. But no. Ubisoft doesn't stop there. Far Cry 3's multiplayer is AMAZING. You can level up, make new weapon loadouts, customize your weapons like in the singleplayer, decode data from flash drives and disks to unlock new weapons modifications. When your team wins a match, the person who has gathered the most experience can either kill the enemy with the most experience with a unique death move, or free him.\nThis game does everything perfect. I cannot say anything bad about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lezzofficial/recommended/220240/","lezzofficial","LeZZ'","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lezzofficial/","34 products in account","Let's start by talking about why Assassin's Creed 3 is pish. It's a game obsessed with making you play exactly how the designers had intended. Those rewards you get for full synchronisation aren't rewards for playing well; in fact, withholding them is a punishment for playing a mission any way the designers didn't intend. Assassin's Creed 3 wants you to hit certain beats to look stylish and will end the game if you don't dance to its tune.\n\n\nBack in Assassin's Creed 2 the series valued emergence - the kind of crazy nonsense that might or might not happen depending on how you did or didn't play. You'd get a target and more often than not you'd do your thing and the game was happy for you to do it the way you want. Far Cry 3 loves emergence, and that makes it a more authentic Assassin's Creed than Assassin's Creed 3.\n\nIt's not an unfair comparison. They were mostly developed at the same studio in Montreal, they both begin with the same old quote from Alice in Wonderland and then they both proceed to share the same ideas all over the place - similar towers to climb, similar minigames to play, a similar focus on hunting endangered critters, and a similar structure - with one critical difference: Far Cry 3 lets you do most things your way. It's a thirty-hour anecdote generator and some of the year's best gaming moments have been emergent madness spawned by Far Cry 3's checkpoint assaults.\n\nNow, there's a lot I dislike about Far Cry 3. The campaign has all your Game Design Favourites like Forced Stealth, Escort Missions, and First Person Platforming is terrible. I don't want to have to keep leaving the game to see my map or craft items and I don't see why Far Cry 2's magical cardboard in-game map couldn't have carried over to Far Cry 3.\n\nI once grumbled about Far Cry 2's respawning checkpoints but 3's alternative has you gradually stripping the world of content until there's nothing left to fight but a bunch of tapirs. And I'm not keen on the - to lapse into sociology-speak - "othering" of the Rakyat, the white dude restoring order to a disorderly "ethnic" land via the hot end of his assault rifle, or the implied ♥♥♥♥ and QTE disco stabfest stuff either.\n\nThat's not to say I want Far Cry to be a PG-rated no-chairshots-to-the-head cuddlefest, because I miss the sheer brutality of Far Cry 2 - a game where your bestest buddy deforests acres of jungle with Agent Orange just so you can have a clear line of fire at the guys farming there, never mind the damage it does to the ecosystem or to your face.\n\nIn Far Cry 2 even your friends weren't your friends and it all felt like a proper descent into madness - mad characters, mad game design, one final mad moral choice, the lot. Cut to Far Cry 3 and you're punching your brother until he cries, doing the whole "look at my hands... what have I become?" thing and then getting straight back to jumping off a cliff with a hang glider and dive-bombing guys for phat XP. Thematic consistency is the all I'm after - Far Cry 2 had it; Far Cry 3 doesn't.\n\nBut Far Cry 2 also had bad guys who could spot the golf ball Alan Shepard teed off the Moon just as it's passing Jupiter so every mission became a shoot-'em-up killing spree where everyone and everything caught fire. Four years on, Far Cry 3 has bad guys with all the observational powers of a referee in the WWE, so stealth works and works well. You get to hide and feel powerful right up to the moment you make a silly mistake and then you get to fight off a small army with the obscene firepower you're given within minutes of starting the campaign.\nYou have fantastic tools with which to scout out an area and so many ways to know when enemies are nearby - the radar, Brody's X-Ray vision, their constant chatter - that you master the environment. Games have become sorta obsessed with "empowering" players - apparently ignoring the important lessons taught by games like Resident Evil and Dark Souls on the way.\n\nBut in stealth games every system needs to be transparent or else you end up shouting "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T" at the screen when a brown man standing in front of a brown tree in a brown forest filled with brown grass on the other side of the universe puts a bullet between your eyes when you were hiding behind a rock. Far Cry 3 understands stealth like Mark of the Ninja does and it means you have the tools to play the game how you like.\n\nWhen he's not making games badder in badder Andy Kelly likes to take out outposts with a couple of neat sniper shots to the alarm system, then pick everyone off from afar. Me? I like to get in the camp and get up close with knife and bow. And we've both had fun with it. Something goes wrong so you hide and relocate, or you Rambo everyone to death with explosive arrows, maybe.\n\nI carry a grenade launcher everywhere like Mask De Smith and go explodey the very second a pirate or a Cassowary gives me an excuse. I once had a grenade launcher joust with pirates on a bridge until I'd dumped five truckfuls of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into the river. Weird things happen in far Cry 3 and it's brilliant.\n\nWhen Ubisoft are trying to force Uncharted-style scripting into Assassin's Creed's massive open world it's clear game design is headed down a dark rabbit hole. And at the bottom of that hole isn't a magical wonderland filled with whimsical characters and adventure; nope, it's just a regular hole filled with rabbit poo. Far Cry 3 is good because it lets you tell your own stories within the neat boundaries Ubisoft give you. Mad emergent things happen and you're forced to deal with them using whatever comes to mind - stealth, fire, missiles, running away and hiding - Far Cry 3 doesn't care what you do, so long as you're having fun.\n\nAnd then you go away and tell your friends about what happened in your tropical adventure and they tell you what happened in theirs, and the stories you tell are different. That's what videogames are supposed to be. Any idiot can tell you a story, but only a videogame can give you enough flexibility to be creative and tell your own. Far Cry 3 is a proper videogame and I have the stories to prove it.\n\nIf you like it, make a "Yes"\n\nThank you for your time!","December 4, 2013","true","7.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The open-world gameplay and combat is solid and it's what I enjoyed the most.  That said, there's no other reason to pick up FC3.  The story is very weak.  The writer has defended it by saying it's a parody.  Just because it's a parody or a commentary does not mean weak writing is excusable.  If anything, a good parody is harder to write.  And it shows.  The story is weak, the character development is predictable or non-existent for anyone other than the protagonist and the endings are lackluster.  This is not a deep game, it is not a well-written game, and it is not a game you should play for the story.  However, if you enjoy killing pirates and open-world exploration and combat that is toned down from TES level, you'll have some fun.  Just don't expect it to get any better than that, it certainly won't blow your mind.","December 26, 2013","false","30.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I think.  To be honest, no.  There was always a glimmer of this being Just Cause 2 meets Tomb Raider reboot meets maybe a dash of Spec Ops crazy, but it takes these good ingredients and pops out a mediocre product.   It's also full of rather game-ruining bugs, which were promised to be patched up by Uplay and Steam but ultimately cut many hours of progress to shreds (the camera/rocks could not be accessed, all my guns and ammo were stripped for no reason at all.)\n\nMaybe it's better on consoles, but it's ultimately a very, very generic product (Hope you like recapturing the same little outpost 32 times) outdone by its predecessors and JC2.","January 1, 2014","false","11.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Could have probably designed a whole other Island, or given **********SPOILERS SPOILERS******* Vaas a decent showdown / death scene instead of that dream sequence off camera death.***********SPOILERS OVER********* instead you had them designing the aforementioned cave systems instead. As a player I don't feel that Boar relic #24 added anything special to my game experience other then making me think I really wish I had some bacon right now.\n\n","December 26, 2013","false","42.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpybirds/recommended/220240/","derpybirds","DerpyBirds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpybirds/","641 products in account","FarCry 3. One of the BEST games I’ve ever played in my years of gaming.\nThere’s so much to talk about, I guess I’ll divide this game into multiple categories to talk about.\n\n– The storyline 10/10\nWords literally how amazingly amazing it felt to play this game. The story mode was well thought out and executed perfectly, an original story with everything else was amazing. I do not wish to spoil the story too much because you NEED to play this game. Basically you are a tourist visiting an island when suddenly something goes wrong…\n\n– The graphics 10/10\nGraphic-wise the game is beautiful and detailed, when you’re playing it, it feels like skyrim but with better graphics and more realistic weapons. Sure some computers may not be able to run the game, but the majority of the people who can run the game on the best graphics will admit it you can feel a simple breeze from the wind. The weather system can’t be talked bad about at all because the rain wasn’t too annoying, but was made just perfect.\n\n– The A.I 8/10\nThe A.I is the only element in the game I could complain about, yet it was marvelous. In times during the game I noticed some A.I glitching in the wall or just auto-noticing me behind a wall. In other times the A.I were just surprisingly professional by avoiding all walls and hiding behind baricades while shooting me only when I stand up to shoot them! Also the A.I of animals was made so they act like they do in real life, from turtles crouching in their shell to sharks slowly getting closer and going in for the kill.\n\n– The Controls 10/10\nEverything was designed wisely, starting from the basic-in-every-game controls like WASD and Shift to sprint to smaller details like switching items in your inventory around the way you like.\n\n– The gameplay 10/10\nThis is the main element of the game which is most essential. The possibilities are infinite, you can play the game as vanilla as you want by using weapons you pick up from the enemy but you can’t taste the game truly unless you’ve tried the RPG’s or the Flamethrower. The leveling up system in the game is not like any other but a very original concept. You unlock new weapons and get them free in shops by claiming land from the enemy or climbing radio towers which noticeably become harder to get on top of with every new one. You can also convert to be a better warrior for the sake of the island by leveling up and getting “Tatau” aka Tattoo’s on your arm which give you abilities like holding your breath underwater longer or decreasing the damage you take from animal bites.\n\n– The Ending 10/10\nI really can’t talk much about the ending to not spoil it, but the way you want the game to end is all up to you. There are 2 endings so it’s all up to you how you end the game.\n– Final Verdict 10/10\nThe Game as a whole is a 10/10. A First person survival which has more then 30+ Realistic animals. I recommend everyone to play it.","July 12, 2014","true","140.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jay720/recommended/220240/","Jay720","720","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jay720/","199 products in account","Far Cry 3 is like your favourite action movie. It has snipers, exploding vehicles, and a maniacal villain named Vaas. Already this may sound like a clichéd shooter, but Far Cry 3 does so many things well, that it’s hard not to dive back into its world again.\n\nAlong your perilous journey, you will climb up a radio tower, cover yourself in magical tattoos, and drive a quad-bike into a river. All of these elements, while definitely daredevilish, don’t feel out of place in Far Cry 3. The map is vast, and allows you to explore to your heart’s content. Hunt wild animals to collect their skin, or liberate enemy outposts to gain respect amongst the civilians. In Far Cry 3, it’s completely up to your how you approach situations.\n\nBeneath the crazy guise that Ubisoft paints with Far Cry 3, lies a character that actually cares. Jason Brody, along with his other twentysomething friends, travel to the remote Rook Islands, for a holiday. But all is not what it seems. Vaas, a psychopathic leader of Rook Island, captures Jason and his friends. Jason escapes, but his other friends are not with him. Jason must meet with local islanders to find his friends and go home. Playing Far Cry 3, I thought Jason was an excellent character with a determined, hard-working spirit, who wants nothing but to keep his friends safe.\n\nVaas is a wonderful villain, with humour, but also a sort of finess on how he handles situations. The strange calmness he portrays is intimidating, but at the same time, left me uneasy. He is definitely a unique character, and one that I welcomed into the game. The only this is, Vaas seemed to swear a lot, often too much. This took away from his character slightly, and was one of the only disappointments I had with this game.\n\nFar Cry 3’s gameplay is diverse, entertaining and never gets old. One moment, you will be fighting for your life setting pirates on fire, and the next you will be jumping out of a plane in a wingsuit. All of these never felt nuanced or out of place, and whether you are using a keyboard and mouse or a controller, the controls are easy to pick up, and similar to other games of its genre.\n\nThe game’s campaign mode is quite long, and lasted me around twelve to fourteen hours. While it is definitely the main aspect of Far Cry 3, after you finish your missions on Rook Island, there are still so many other places to explore and new things to discover. Loot is found everywhere throughout the vast map, hidden in crates. Bodies can also contain money and trinkets, which can be sold for money at stores. Plants are also found on the minimap, each a different colour. I found the Green Leaves especially useful for crafting important medical syringe kits, which have saved me from death countless times.\n\nThe customization of weapons in Far Cry 3 is amazing. If you really want to, you can add a Red Dot Sight to a .44 Magnum handgun, or an extended magazine to an ACE assault rifle. All of these can also be customized with decals and camos, letting you find the weapons that are more suited to your play style. You can equip an M249 SAW, an LMG, and a LPO-50 Flamethrower and torch the lot, or go in silently with a silenced Z93 and a Recurve Bow with a Reflex Sight. In Far Cry 3, it’s completely your choice.\n\nVehicles in Far Cry 3 could have been much improved. There were only three “classes” of vehicles, like the army-like 4WDs or the sedans and quad bikes. These all handle basically the same, and I personally am not a fan of first-person driving and was disappointed you couldn’t change this. Also, vehicles are scarce around Rook Island, and I was often without a ride and sprinting for ages to get to a destination in time.\n\nOverall, Far Cry 3 is an amazingly diverse, creative and humongous first-person adventure, and one that will keep you glued to your monitor in excitement and anticipation as it shows you a fantastically good time.","November 18, 2014","true","40.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The details, the world,  missions, objectives, ... - it's all amazing ! I never thought i could run this game but after all it runs very smooth on my laptop for a open world game. The side missions are not bad either; oh, don't worry, there are a lot too. This game perfectly describes "open world".\n\nI surely recommend it to buy this game, i bought the game when it was around 5 € (around -80%) .. aaaand i'm looking forward to buy Far Cry 4 sooner or later.\nMaybe one thing that's bad/weird and that is that you need another client (Uplay) to play this game.

We're talking about an Action - First Person Shooter game! Well, it is well known for its Single Player mode, which I have to admit that I've found extremely well designed and of course, vicious! Also, we have to mention at this point that Far Cry 3 is an open world game, which gives you even more options concerning the gameplay (Herb Gathering, Animal Hunting etc.). The storyline is the following: You (Jason Brody) are on vacation with your brother and your friends in an awesome, abandoned, tropical island. You are trapped by some criminals who are led by Vaas and Hoyt, two evil and reckless masterminds. While you and your brother are kept under captivity you finally succeed to escape the enemy camp and then... Your adventure begins with one simple goal to achieve: find and rescue the rest of your friends!Will you succeed? It all depends on you and your judgement! Go and find it out! The game, simply amazed me (as I expected it to) and I was left fully satisfied by it. As for its multiplayer, it's fine and pretty simple (If you have played Battlefield/Call of Duty you will get what I'm talking about)! I didn't find anything exciting about it, but I have to admit that I really had fun playing it. Give it a try if you want to, but definitely complete the Single Player first! In conclusion I want to mention that there are various side-missions that are worth your time (I've finished all of them and I do strongly recommend you to do the same) Also I find that the game's characterization was simply breathtaking! They did a fine job with the game's design in general.\n**Attention: I don't know why the displayed hours are 0! Maybe cause I was playing it at offline mode!**\n\nI give this game 9/10","November 26, 2014","true","0.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarangkhaitan/recommended/220240/","tarangkhaitan","T.K.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarangkhaitan/","738 products in account","Far Cry 3 is a sum of many ubisoft games, they have taken many features from their other IPs and successfully combined it with the tropical setting of far cry 1 the end result is a brilliant open world fps that is exciting to play till the end.\n\nThere is coop and competetive multiplayer in FC3, the PvP is decent fun you level up fairly quickly and have battle cries and can customize a lot, you can spend a decent amount of hours in it before getting bored, the PvE is really fleshed out and the characters are well written and is objective based you will have better luck finding a game in the competitive mp rather than the coop mp.\n\nThe single player is a very diverse,really fleshed out levels and thoroughly exciting until the end. The best part i loved about FC3 was that it rewarded stealth play example if you take out an outpost you get 500 xp take out the outpost but without triggering the alarm and you get 550 xp and if you take out the outpost without being detected you get 1500 xp. This is the reason why i almost always used stealth to take out outposts and you can do the same in most of the missions. The wildlife makes it feel like a real world where you can skin animals and sell it for cash or use for crafting, the herbivores will run away scared of you the carnivores will actively attack you and try to kill you, you can also set animals like bears,tigers and lions on the enemies by luring the animal to them or by shooting the caged animals which is a lot of fun.\n\nTraversing through FC3 is a blast you can use the outposts you captured as fast travel, the cars are decent to use the water vehicles are very fun to use espically the jetski, the most fun you can have traveling is when you ziplines and the glider, later during the late game you will have access to wingsuit and paracute which makes traveling from one point to the other even more exhillariting and fun to do. FC3 is a looker it looks really good and the vistas change from region to region some of the segments are breathtaking, the level of detail if you can run it on very high/ultra is mindblowing, the lighting the shadows and the particle effects are really well done, the facial animation doesnt look that well but it is a 4 year old game now so cant complain too much. The jungle truly comes alive as the meshes of the trees grass and plants make it feel really life-like.\n\nI feel FC3's villian characters are really interesting with backstories and are well developed especially Vaas whose voice actor really brings the character to life but the hero characters espcially the main hero J.Brody is not intersting nor convincing the character will blurt out stupid puns and make fun or everything and sometimes acts all serious making him feel like a man-child. The story is simple and the game has two endings, i only wish they made the "bad" ending somewhat better but i guess then it wouldnt be the bad ending but overall the story is servicable and the characters for the most part are good.\n\nThere is a lot to do in FC3 from unlocking towers to view segments of the maps, free outposts to fast travel and access new items, complete side quests in which you are required to eliminate enmies or animals using speific wepons, looting is very fun and the game actively encourages you to do so the chalice ones are hard to do and fun since it makes you explore, apart from these you have races,gambling,knives throws, etc, so yeah a lot to do. FC3 tropical setting really helps the mood of the game and the nigh and day cycle really bring out the jungle vibe. The game doesnt have too many  bugs or glitches, i did run into a few popups and stutters but mostly its looks good and runs well. The problem sometimes occues in mp when uplay decided to disconnect you automatically during game and its quite annoying but thanfully thats just on the mp side of the things.\n\nYou can crafy syringes to enhance your abilites and skin animals to upgrade carrrying ammo, extra guns and special bows.There are also some dlc missions which are quite good if you have them, blowing stuff up feels really rewarding and the enemy AI is really nice, they will try to flank you into the open they actively use grandes to make you go into open areas to kill you easily.The tagging system in FC3 really makes the stealth aspect very intriguing as you can tag the enemies observe their pattern to quitely assassinate them or set animals on them. The takedown feature is probably the best feature ive seen in video games reason being the variety of takedown you can perform, from the simplet takedown to chain,gunslinger,death from above/below, heavy and grande, each does something differnet and feels really satisfying.\n\nLastly the audio is really crispy and on point, some of the soundtracks are spot on the one instance where you light a weed farm on fire with flamethrower has skillrex's ft. damien marely make it bun dem is brilliant and become my faveourite track, you can hear the hissle of snakes and the roars of the tigers from a distance giving you audio feedback as how to approach your immediate surronding.\n\nOverall an excellent open world game by ubisoft and truly back to the Far Cry roots and a step in the right direction since i considered FC2 a failure, FC3 is a game anyone can easily love and sink hours into you can spend anywhere between 20-40 hours doing all kinds of things, I completed all outposts and towers and many of the missions and still wanted to play for an hour or so coz travelling with the wingsuit was so darn fun.Easily recommeded to anyone at any price point.","January 7","true","32.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Well it's adventure to put it bluntly, and it seems like they geared the whole game around it. Adventure, action, survival. It's plot bares very interesting similarities to 19th century adventure stories like Treasure Island, with the protagonist having to face pirates and psychologically grow stronger as a character.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the game is fundamentally very similar to Far Cry 2, but at the same time very different. The plot structure is more cinematic and focused on story. Adding to that, animals are much more heavily focused upon. The game introduces a crafting system and inorder to carry more guns and ammunition you must skin specific animals. This actually makes the game very interesting with how you hunt animals in the overworld and breaks up the monotony of killing pirates fairly effectively.\n\nThat's not to say the game is without flaws. While the protagonist is portrayed as an everyman, even on the hardest difficulty you are death incarnate outside of cutscenes. Adding to that the game's sidequests are more or less just "Kill this particular enemy with a specific weapon" or "find this particular animal".\n\nUbisoft designed the world very effectively. Overall it's kill pirates, get money, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es. Not necessarily in that order.","December 3, 2013","true","27.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","3"

When you experience something so great, so beautifully crafted, with so much attention to detail that you find it hard to find a word, or words that perfectly reflect what you have just experienced. With Far Cry 3, I find myself in a state of awe, struggling to best define this masterpiece.\n\nFar Cry 3 is in all sense of the word, remarkable. It has an amazing story, a beautifull location to explore, tons of missions, side quests and activities to do, and even racing. Although some of the aforementioned activities are optional, you will feel like the game experience won't be complete unless you engage in them, and they are quite rewarding and most importantly, a whole lot of fun.\n\nYou play as Jason Brody, a regular guy on vacation with two of his brothers, his girlfriend and some friends. The vacation however quickly turns into a nightmare, forcing Jason to do things he never thought possible, gathering strenght and courage with the help of a local tribe, the Rakyat in order to free your friends and liberate the island from drug dealing pirates, and a human trafficking organization.\n\nRook Island, where the game takes place is not only beautifull, it is also a very dangerous place. From pirates to privateers, to the local fauna, this place feels alive to the point of making you getting lost in it. You are not playing a game, you are fighting for survival. The animals in the game act realistically, and attack you, and can greatly affect the outcome of battles versus your enemies as well. You will need to hunt some of these beasts to craft inventory items, which will let you carry more weapons and ammo for example. Expect to find Bears, Tigers, Komodo dragons and even crocodiles on your journey. Flora also has an important role. You can craft syringes to aid you on your quests, and in order to do so you need to gather plants of several kinds, allowing you to create some really helpfull items. It is very believable and incredibly realistic, in this aspect I have never encountered a game that makes you feel that what you are experiencing on screen could easily be a real life situation.\n\nIt is a violent game, gritty at times, and that contributes a lot to the feeling and believability throughout the experience. Characters will swear and have no problem in handling situations in the most violent of ways possible. Unlike Far Cry 2, the characters in this game are memorable, which makes you care about what happens to them in the game. Be warned that this game messes with your sense of morality, some choices you will need to make will leave you in shock.\n\nThis game requires Uplay, and some people have a problem with it, for whatever reason. In my experience I have had no problem with it, and even though it shouldn't be necessary to play it, it is not a hassle to deal with. If you are not playing this masterpiece because of this, and you are a steam user, it is utterly hypocritical of you since Uplay is the same kind of DRM as Steam is. Don't let Uplay stop you from experiencing one of the best games ever made, and in my opinion, the best sandbox FPS ever created.\n\nFar Cry 3 is brilliant, amazingly crafted and expertly executed.\n\nThe good\n\n-Beautifull graphics and music\n-Huge variety of weapons\n-Memorable locations to explore and characters to interact with\n-Strong, believable story\n-Co-Op\n-Enemy AI\n-Skill Trees, RPG style, that allow you to create a character to suit your playing style\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Nothing I encoutered could be classified as bad, but if I want to be nitpicky, some animations could have been a litlle bit better\n\n10/10 Masterpiece","May 14, 2014","true","90.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","7"

Graphics are really nice and world is full of adventures. It allows you to play camping, multiplayer and co-op mode. In camping you can crafts your own items with killing animals and picking flowers. Weapons are also great and you can customize your own weapon. Story have 2 ends and choise is yours. I really like jungle of this game and awesome water and world details and driving with vehicles. You can also skill your own character with levels. You gain XP while killing player and completing missions. When you complete story you are able to play free roam and you have a lot of side quests and other things to do so you won't be bored at all. Multiplayer is also very nice and fun to play with friends. You can skill your character  just like in campaing with levels and XP. You can also customize your own weapons. Multiplayer doens't have so much levels so you will probably reach maximum level pretty fast. You can also play co-op mission which are nice too!\n\nGame is really worth of money. I reccommend it to everyone who like action, open world and first person shooter games.\n10/10","December 23, 2013","true","5.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Imeline graafika, story ja gamepaly on super combo. Täiesti prefektne. Muidugi oli ka paar asja mis häirisid, nimelt oli loot cheste väga palju ja nendest sai vähe kraami. Mõtekam oli sidequeste teha. Ütlen siis ära, mängu lõpus on valik, ehk saad lõpetada mängu kahte erinevat viisi. Mina ise valisin selle "inimlikuma". Selliseid valikuid oleks võinud olla rohkem mängus. Osad cutscened olid minule vastutahtmist. Näiteks ütles karakter, et ta tahab saarele elama jääda, kuigi mulle see üldse ei meeldinud. Kui tagasi tulla story juurde, siis asi on väga deep. Mida kaugemale jõuad, seda rohkem tahad kätte maksta. Selles mängus soovitan palju eeltööd teha enne main questide juurde asumist. Kindlasti oleks vaja võtta kõik radio towerid ja outpostid ära. Mängu alsutades oli plaanis ka kõik relicid, messaged ja memory cardid ära koguda. Hiljem sain aru, et see oli praktiliselt võimatu. Memory cardid (tegin ära) ja messaged olid mõleldavad, aga 120 relici on natuke üle piiri. Lõpetamiseks kulus 25 tundi, mis on open world mängu kohta täiesti paras. Kindlasti kui oleks teinud veel side queste ja chillinud oleks 30 tundi ka ära tulnud. Mängus on ka veits rpg elemente, ehk sul on võimalus enda karakterit leveldada ja asju craftida, et paremini metsikus looduses ja sõjas toime tulla. Kindlasti soovitan mängu, see on igat senti väärt!","December 28, 2013","true","49.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

You won't find very many "flaws" (for those whom aren't having problems with Uplay anyway) once the game is up and running. Solid gameplay, solid story, great looking world, excellent music score, memorable characters...you've heard as much already I'm sure. So what's there to dislike?\n\nThe only real problem was how there wasn't any 'heart' in the game. By following a formula they never left any room for the creativity and innovation to fully unleash the world of the island. It's difficult to explain but easy to spot the places where they focused on following formula instead of improving user experience/immersion. For such a high production game this lack of going the extra mile somehow ends up being the only thing that prevents it from being perfect.\n\nIf you don't own it you should really buy it during a sale. Not my GOTY (I enjoyed The Darkness 2 significantly more), but definitely worth a playthrough. The low to no replayability shouldn't matter with Far Cry 4 out now anyway.","March 11, 2015","true","31.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","8","12","3","1"

A deep and totally amazing story for both the singeplayer mode and the 4 player co op mode. And of course, there is the ordinary multiplayer mode aswell.\nThe game itself is pretty much a sandbox, so you can rund around in a open world and do whatever you want.\nBut a couple of things you should know if you are planning to buy this game: This game requires Uplay to work (at least it did for me), the game might be a bit laggy (mine was, but changing from DirectX 11 to DirectX 9 helped a lot), and the saving system is a bit complicated (you can only have one saved game at a time, the game doesn't always save when you hit "save game" even if it says it does, etc.)\n\nAnyhow, I would give this game a 9.5/10.

First: Open World. Farcry 3 is more of an "Open Map" granted the Map is big but parts are locked off until you do certain things, also there are a lot of invisible walls on the island itself. i don't mind that, in fact i understand why they did it. but Skyrim doesn't have that. Next: Side quest. Farcry 3 has actives like racing,shooting,hunting, and kill missions. but they don't call them side quest, the ones that they do call side quests are pitiful and worthless. most of them you have to go "Spy" on someone across the town and then report back to who gave you the quest, or you go here and kill 15 of this or that and "save" a poor civie. In the end the actives are way more fun then the side "quests".  and third: Customization, you can't make your own character in FC3, you can't even change your outfit. once again i under stand why they did that, but they are the ones who started compering the two.\n\n\nOk now that is out of the way lets focus on the Single player story line. The Story of Far Cry 3 is that you and your friends are vacationing on a remote island, but what you don't know is that it is controlled by a cruel gang of Pirates and Drug lords, you start off captured and locked away in the Pirate base, and you have to escape. Now i don't want to spoil anything about the story line so i'll stop there. Story Wise the game is epic there are some times where the other characters appear to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but most of the time the story was fun and exciting. The villain of the game is like a more gory Joker and it really is insane. most of the time you won't even now who is your friend and who is your enemy. The main villain does stay around for a while but you never will think that he shouldn't have survived your attack or feel like he is god-like in some areas because the script writers didn't want to kill him off. (*hint COD Ghost hint*) The game has tons of the stuff for you to do and the skill and perk tree is large and helpful, you can craft meds and other helpful things, and hunt animals for their meat/skin. the Single Player story line took me 9 hours on Normal. keep in mind however it took me longer because i didn't rush to do the main quests.\n\n\nThe Co-op mode of Farcry centers around a band of travelers who are left for dead by their greedy captain who works for the pirates, the Co-op gameplay is all on a different island from the Single player one. the Co-op itself is fun but compared to the Single player island the co-op one feels like a hallway shooter, also there are few players playing co-op and even fewer who will stick with you to go through it. when the Host leaves a Co-op game (and VS games) the game takes a ridicules amount of time to "Migrate" and when it starts most players leave meaning it migrates to other players each time taking longer, in fact once this lead to every one on my server to leave. The VS mode in Farcry is as you expect two teams fight each other to the death and who ever loses all their points first is the loser. the high set scorer and the wining team gets to to choice to spare or kill the highest scorer on the the team that lost. all in all the MP in Far Cry 3 is fun and enjoyable but because of their crappy Net code you might not be able to play very long.\n\nin the end i would say buy the game for the single player experience and if you have some buddies with the game maybe you can actually get through a Co-op game.","March 8, 2014","true","27.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ianuarius/recommended/220240/","ianuarius","Ianuarius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ianuarius/","665 products in account","Far Cry 3 was an interesting experience. The core game mechanics were very fun and responsive but the problem of the game turned out to be the story. The game went the usual GTA sandbox route where you can just roam the game world doing various activities or engage in the story missions. Those story missions just weren’t very fun. The thing is that instead of building over the existing fun gameplay they seemed to constantly take away from it by constraining the ways the player could play the missions and filling them with quick time events. To top it all off the characters and script of the game were just ridiculously clichéd and uninspired outside of barely few fun exceptions. Even the missions themselves quickly boiled down to just following markers and watching cutscenes. The main character in particular was just not convincing at all and made me question if anyone in Ubisoft knew anything about human beings. As I said the core game mechanics were very good (if you don’t count the driving sections) and at best made me think of games like Fallout 3 and Just Cause 2. Lastly, I need to point out that people making Far Cry games seem to have an endless fascination with tropics and paradise islands. I happen to hate them. Here’s for hoping that the next Far Cry game will take place in some sort of Twin Peaks inspired setting.","April 12, 2014","true","18.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

This game has one of the best stories I have seen and characters. You are given some choices on what you can do during the game. Gameplay is almost perfect but tends to get unchallenging when you unlock things further on. The world is fun to explore with dazzling sights and many different types of animals. The graphics are very well polished, except in soome occasions you will see the most horrible plant textures. The game is Open World to some extent. You cannot explore the whole Islands until you progress the story, however you are left to explore the two Islands at your will once you beat the game. Although I loved the game I did hate one thing. Uplay. When you buy this game you have to redeem it on Ubisoft which can be annoying to people whom like me prefer having everything in one place such as Steam.

I don't mean it is the best game I have tried, but the whole experience, game mechanics end overall quality is really top notch. Very impressive.\n\nWhat is great about the game?\nGraphics are outstanding - The game looks and feels great even if you have to reduce the quality. Voice acting and sound in general is superb. Acting and motion capture is also very well done. Immersion is outstanding - Moving around feels fantastic, all vehicles are fun. Gunning and fighting is very well done. Interaction with people and cutscenes don't break immersion.\nGame is long, but involving the whole way. The game manages well to not be frustrating. The world you are in feels alive, and you really enjoy exploring the island(s). The world "happens" by itself without your input. AI is good and some antagonists are fantastic. World and gameplay is very open, giving you lots of ways to play your own way. Story goes quite deep.\n\nWhat is not so great?\nWell, you need a really good machine to run it well. There is a lot of "in and out" with the menus and maps which breaks immersion. Messages and hints are too many and too frequent. (Farcry 2 had it nailed down, not breaking immersion at all.) Some skills you can aquire are quite useless. Kind of annoyed with the whole "saving rich spoiled kids"-thing.\n\nIn many ways, Far Cry 3 is superior to Far Cry 2. It is better paced, has a better story, it is less frustrating, AI is better. But in some ways, I see them as different games. Far Cry 3 is more of a dream and a fantasy, "a game", while Far Cry 2 feels more realistic. Far Cry 2 is not as "gamey" and "Hollywood-ized" either, and is more immersive. It actually still looks fantastic and does not require as much computer power as Far Cry 3. I still recommend you try Far Cry 2 considering it is quite cheap. But do not expect a similar experience to Far Cry 3 at all. Far Cry 2 needs much more patience and has many annoying flaws, still being quite a gem.\n\nThe deeper message in Far Cry 3 is quite nice, and makes you think about your actions in the game-world. The game hints at times that you are actually in a game, a dream, a fantasy. I really like this idea, it makes you more aware of yourself, in and out of the game.\nThere is a lot do in this game. I just finished the campaign, and did not try co-op and multiplayer which I have heard is quite nice. I took over most bases and all radio towers, but I skipped quite a few side missions, still playing this game for well over 40 hours.\nBut when you have finished the main story you can go back to the island if you wish to explore more, as there is a lot to find. You can also create your own maps with a really nice map editor. So there is lots to do well worth your money even at full price. I also highly recommend Farcry 3 Blood Dragon for a great spin-off with lots of humor but with the same great mechanics.\n\nWell recommended.","April 24, 2014","true","45.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

You could even say it's an excellent game. No game is without fault however I'll talk about some of the good things and some of the bad.\n\nFirst: the guns; the core part of any FPS. They're so fun to use in this game simply because they all feel different and it's very easy to recognize the differences between all the weapons. Stealth is also a big part of the combat, stealth takedowns and silenced weapons eventually become your best friend as rushing in is generally a bad idea (especially once you've reached the later half of the game) even on normal difficulty. Optional objectives are spread throughout the game which include: side quests, hunting challenges, sniper challenges and poker. Most of them are purely optional offering nothing more than something to do while you're playing others are higly incentivized (Radio towers, hunting, liberating camps + supply drops) as they offer XP, money and lead to unlocking better equipment and guns! Getting around isn't that hard either (provided you aren't getting shot at) and you'll find that once you have access to more fast travel points you'll reach your destinations really quickly!\n\nNow I'll touch on the story for a bit before I get to the cons! The story... not so great! That is to say it's not amazing, but it feels a lot like an action movie and those don't really require great stories either! I did find, however, that across the story there were a few memorable characters and sequences that I really liked but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. Also worth noting, several instances of nudity!\n\nAnd now the final part of this lengthy review, the cons! There were quite a few bugs, mostly visual and none of them game-breaking definitely a slight on the game but they can be over-looked! I found that when I was exploring or hunting for collectibles whenever I had a waypoint on my map there was no clear indication as to whther or not the thing I had waypointed was above me or below me. By the time I realized this this I had usually gone too far off to find the actual path to the thing I was looking for. And finally, the major offender... UPlay! I have nothing against the platform itself but not having it installed prior to playing this game lead to me waiting a good 45 mins before I could actually play the game. It also requires you to be connected to the internet for a enjoyable experience, meaning if you've got a dodgy connection or are simply having issues you should probably just play something else.\n\nTo wrap things up, like I said in the beginning, this game's great. If you have any interest in shooters or open world games then you have to give this game a spin, as there's tons to do and you'll probably have a good time doin' it!","January 15, 2014","true","26.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What I got was a dirty needle and some pig entrails.  This is a disgusting game in more than one way.  Obviously, there's a crafting system that involves gutting and skinning animals that you hunt.  It's gross and I can get past that.  That's not the disgusting that bothers me.  The enemies are pretty rough characters -- drug runners, kidnappers and mercenaries.  Looting them will yield an assortment of colorful vendor fodder like dirty needles, crackpipes and the sort.  This bothers me a bit...but I can get past it.  The game, however, seems to pride itself in what an ugly world and situation it places you in.  Loading screens treat you with random, stream-of-consciousness words, a few of which are obscenities.  Of course the in-game dialog is repleat with obscenities.  I guess you can't have a modern "gritty" game without them.  At this point, I'm swallowing a lot of ugly for the sake of the game play, which holds up pretty well until you start hitting certain progression walls.\n\nLike many games claiming to be open worlds, the world is gradually revealed or unlocked through progression in the story.  Character skills and crafting recipes are similarly locked to your storyline.  In the end, it was these restrictions that put me off to the game entirely.  I hated the storyline for the game's ugliness I described above.  I just didn't want to run through it.  However, with at least half of the game world locked away behind irritating game content, I lost my will to play the game at all.  And cheat codes don't help you much in escort missions in which NPCs will gladly take cover in front of enemy gunfire.\n\nAll of that said, I laud CryTek for what they tried to do here -- open world shooting with crafting and skill systems that feel lifted from the latest MMO.  I loved that concept.  I just wish it weren't tied to content that made me feel worse for playing the game.","December 26, 2013","false","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I do understand that many people are upset that UPlay is also needed together with Steam to play the game while it is purchased on steam, but I guess because I've purchased it quite late and not at release UPlay problems don't bother me that much (except the random UPlay crash I experienced once).\n\nIt's an amazing game with loads of stuff to do, and the most important thing - it is fun.

The core game mechanics were very fun and responsive but the problem of the game turned out to be the story. The game went the usual GTA sandbox route where you can just roam the game world doing various activities or engage in the story missions. Those story missions just weren’t very fun. The thing is that instead of building over the existing fun gameplay they seemed to constantly take away from it by constraining the ways the player could play the missions and filling them with quick time events. To top it all off the characters and script of the game were just ridiculously clichéd and uninspired outside of barely few fun exceptions. Even the missions themselves quickly boiled down to just following markers and watching cutscenes. The main character in particular was just not convincing at all and made me question if anyone in Ubisoft knew anything about human beings. As I said the core game mechanics were very good (if you don’t count the driving sections) and at best made me think of games like Fallout 3 and Just Cause 2. Lastly, I need to point out that people making Far Cry games seem to have an endless fascination with tropics and paradise islands. I happen to hate them. Here’s for hoping that the next Far Cry game will take place in some sort of Twin Peaks inspired setting.","April 12, 2014","true","18.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

There are a lot of areas where FarCry succeeds but many more where it simply falls through the floor.\n\nFar Cry 3 offers a compelling storyline through the singleplayer campaign. It is almost unrivaled and allows you to take hold of a person and watch them grow from a normal friend-loving schoolboy to a psuedo-psycho badass of the jungle.\n\nMultiplayer is completely broken as there a lot of bugs and hiccups along the way. The loadout option is pretty much useless as there is currently one build that destroys anything else that you put against it.\n\nCoop is a very welcomed theme within the Far Cry series, it's just a shame it wasn't implemented into the overall storyline. Or atleast contained within it's own world. Rather than you and a friend playing within the island sandbox, you are forced to go through objective-based and competition-based tasks that follow a very crappy storyline of 4 people just wanting to get rich and get out.\n\n++ Singleplay, Multiplayer and COOP modes.\n+ Guns and tools are nice\n+ Great scenery\n+++Buy this game for the singleplayer\n\n- Multiple bugs\n- Uplay requirements/overlay\n- Game-breaking bugs\n- Overpowered SMG class\n- Graphics are similar to FC2 but..worse?\n\nI would only recommend this game for the singleplayer and nothing else.

You could even say it's an excellent game. No game is without fault however I'll talk about some of the good things and some of the bad.\n\nFirst: the guns; the core part of any FPS. They're so fun to use in this game simply because they all feel different and it's very easy to recognize the differences between all the weapons. Stealth is also a big part of the combat, stealth takedowns and silenced weapons eventually become your best friend as rushing in is generally a bad idea (especially once you've reached the later half of the game) even on normal difficulty. Optional objectives are spread throughout the game which include: side quests, hunting challenges, sniper challenges and poker. Most of them are purely optional offering nothing more than something to do while you're playing others are higly incentivized (Radio towers, hunting, liberating camps + supply drops) as they offer XP, money and lead to unlocking better equipment and guns! Getting around isn't that hard either (provided you aren't getting shot at) and you'll find that once you have access to more fast travel points you'll reach your destinations really quickly!\n\nNow I'll touch on the story for a bit before I get to the cons! The story... not so great! That is to say it's not amazing, but it feels a lot like an action movie and those don't really require great stories either! I did find, however, that across the story there were a few memorable characters and sequences that I really liked but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. Also worth noting, several instances of nudity!\n\nAnd now the final part of this lengthy review, the cons! There were quite a few bugs, mostly visual and none of them game-breaking definitely a slight on the game but they can be over-looked! I found that when I was exploring or hunting for collectibles whenever I had a waypoint on my map there was no clear indication as to whther or not the thing I had waypointed was above me or below me. By the time I realized this this I had usually gone too far off to find the actual path to the thing I was looking for. And finally, the major offender... UPlay! I have nothing against the platform itself but not having it installed prior to playing this game lead to me waiting a good 45 mins before I could actually play the game. It also requires you to be connected to the internet for a enjoyable experience, meaning if you've got a dodgy connection or are simply having issues you should probably just play something else.\n\nTo wrap things up, like I said in the beginning, this game's great. If you have any interest in shooters or open world games then you have to give this game a spin, as there's tons to do and you'll probably have a good time doin' it!","January 15, 2014","true","26.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/220240/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","If you’re deciding whether to buy Far Cry 3 for Uplay or for Steam, I’d recommend you just get it for Uplay. Sure the Uplay client is inferior, but you’ll have fewer problems getting the game to work (took a long time to get the game to run). Also, when you start the game in Steam, it just launches Uplay anyway so it’s basically just a shortcut. I had kind of a unique situation so I can’t say for certain that you’ll encounter the same problems playing the Steam version\n\nFirst off, the game is very hardware intensive. It probably stressed my system more than anything other than Watch Dogs, which I just gave up on running due to low frame rate. I had to turn down the graphics a bit to get a nice 40 fps for Far Cry 3. If you have better than a GTX 460 video card you should be fine.\n\nFor gameplay, the game is very similar to Far Cry 2 (big surprise). It’s a first person shooter with 4 gun slots (you unlock them through crafting). Similar to many other modern shooters, when you kill a gun wielding enemy, they usually drop that weapon for you to pick up, or just scavenge the ammo. There’s a stealth component to combat where you are rewarded (with extra exp) for sneaking up and using takedowns on enemies rather than just running in shooting. Various styles of takedown are unlocked through skill points as you progress through the game (such as dropping down on enemies or pulling the pin on an enemy’s grenade and kicking him toward his buddies. I mentioned crafting earlier and the crafting system is very simple, if somewhat time consuming. You hunt animals for their skins and use the skins to unlock equipment upgrades. For example 2 goat skins might increase the number of grenades you can carry or 2 flowers can be turned into a healing item. I spent about 3 hours just hunting all the animals to upgrade my gear before tackling the main story quests. Similar to Tomb Raider and Deus Ex: Human Revolution, “leveling up” doesn’t make you stronger with more HP or damage. It just gives you a skill point to spend.\n\nThe game story is very well written and executed (completely new protagonist and story from the previous Far Cry games). I won’t spoil it for you but you start as a non-combatant and end up as a badass. There’s a ton of collectible items strewn across the game map telling the history of the island (kind of like Tomb Raider) and you’re rewarded for finding them with more exp.\n\nOverall the game is fantastic and a definite thumbs up. I only have the basic version so I can’t tell you if the “deluxe edition” is worth getting. I kind of doubt it though. By the way, I thought Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon was a DLC for Far Cry 3. Blood Dragon is actually a total conversion and you don’t need Far Cry 3 installed (or even owned) to play it.","August 18, 2014","true","20.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It reminds me of assassin's creed and The Elder Scrolls games alot. What I like most is how you can hunt and craft for better equipment. The skill tree is nice also, but it does not bind you to a certain way of playing. So you can still be stealth without actually having to get alot of perks.\nAnother amazing aspect of this game is the landscape. The jungle looks absolutely stunning.\n\nThere's not too many downsides. The only one I can think of now is it being too easy to get all craftable gear maxed out. It took me around 23 hours. The amount of variety in the "wanted" missions is too small though. It basically always comes down to knifing some dude who downloaded media illigally.\n\nConclusion: Get it.

About the second Far Cry I read a lot of rather lukewarm comments and only purchased it on a Steam Sale  a year  or two later. As expected it was a mixed bag of an interesting open world gameplay (with an entirely different feel than FC1), but somewhat underdeveloped and riddled with annoying elements and a completely uninteresting storyline. Still I have to admit that somehow the game managed to keep my attention and I played it through to the end.\n\nWhen I read about FC3 it seemed like once again a different kind of game than FC1 or 2. But once I started playing I found that FC3 is very much a continuation of FC2, but thankfully much better developed and with a lot of smart improvements.\n\nThe storyline is more interesting, the world is richer and more diverse and there’s a nice mix of gameplay elements to offer diversified gameplay experience. For the most part you can set your own pace, alternating between storyline missions and the various side missions to stretch gameplay and broaden up the experience.  Some elements, like the radio towers, were obviously adopted from Assassins Creed, but it’s a nice change of pace. The basic concept works quite well and gameplay all in all is enjoyable.\n\nBut while I thoroughly enjoyed the game some flaws and strange design choices kept FC3 from being a great game. Let’s ignore some of the weak spots in the storyline (and  skip over the pretentiousness of the “Alice in Wonderland”-quotes suggesting a depth the storyline simply didn’t have, and ignore the unsatisfying conclusion) and just look at the gameplay:\n\nCrafting was basically an interesting idea, but I found it not all that useful and basically pointless in the second half of the game (Perhaps more useful on more difficult settings, but I played medium and don’t think I collected a single plant on the southern island). Money also is an important point in the beginning, but loses importance in the second half (most of the time I had more stuff to sell than my wallet could handle). I have the strong suspicion that shops originally should be spread scarcely across the map (as it was in FC2), but the integration of autoshops in most spawnpoints made shops pointless and gave gameplay a strange rhythm. That goes along with the quicktravel option, something I liked on one hand (especially later, when I hunted for relics), but it robbed the game some of its immediacy, since you could hop around the map (at least between unlocked points) and resupply as much as your wallet allowed. That’s the other extreme to FC2’s four travelpoints, which forced the player to travel long distances to missions. I would have wished for something in between: Less travel points, less (or even no) autoshops, no free weapons after radio tower missions.\n\nAnd to be honest I found many gameplay elements repetitive after a while. Freeing enemies camp was fun most of the time, but many of the additional missions overstayed their welcome during the second half. IMHO it would have been smarter to introduce entirely new gameplay elements on the south island (if done smartly motivated by the different environment and enemy group). As it was the second half felt like “more of the same” and I found myself rushing through the missions.\n\nAnother missed opportunity was to integrate real sidequests. While inhabitants all over the map offer the player little sidequests, those have to be worked through immediately. How much more interesting it would have been to have quests, which can be accepted but finished either later, or might even have to be dealt with on a different spot on the map.\n\nAll in all FC3 was a definite improvement over its predecessor, but I can’t help but feel that some compromises and design flaws kept it from being even better. We will see if FC4 will correct some of those mistakes, but frankly as much as I enjoyed FC3 I’m not compelled to purchase FC4 immediately.\n","August 28, 2014","true","58.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Farcry3 follows Jason, a slightly wimpy American teenager who gets into trouble with some bad guys on an island. In essence, they kidnap some of his friends and he goes to get them back. Firstly, let's get the characters out of the way. Lots of people hate Jason and his friends, and although they are very 1 dimensional, I have to say I grew fond of Jason. His transition from cowardly white boy to tattooed warrior was a great development throughout the game. The other characters are brilliant; The unstable and unpredictable Vaas, in particular, I absolutely adored. And Sam. BLITZKRIIIIEG! I love the fact that you hear them referring to you as 'Snow White' as your legendary status increases, it makes you feel like a badass.\n\nThe game is just so much fun! I felt genuine fear as I ran and hid behind bushes from the enemies, having heard their trucks driving closer and closer. I nearly had a heart attack the first time a tiger jumped on me, and laughed out loud as a herd of cows chased me. I adored having to go to certain areas on the island to hunt for different animals to make things. The skill development trees are great, and the skills built up perfectly in sync with the difficulty progression of the game. The open world feature is brilliant - it makes the game less linear and a lot more interesting. I absolutely loved the idea of having to turn on the pylons to unlock sections of the map, and the turquoise water, sandy beaches and lush tropical vegetation make the game look stunning.\n\nThe tasks are varied and a lot of them are so much  fun  (the drug fields task was probaby my favourite task in any game, ever). From having to drive a quad bike against the clock, to sneaking into camps to take things, to shooting a gun and making everything explode from a helicopter, to torturing somebody, the tasks are endlessly entertaining. At no point in this game did I think 'oh great, another one of  these  tasks'. And that's another thing: you have a lot of choice. No, you don't have to keep taking out all the enemy camps, you can sneak around them. No, you don't have to do lots of vehicle driving if you don't want to. Aside from the main storyline, you can play the game how the hell you want.\n\nThe difficulty increases throughout the game so perfectly, you have to take your hat off to Ubisoft. Towards the end, the tasks got really quite demanding, and there were several instances where I 'ragequitted' and sulked for half an hour, before having to go back for more punishment. And to me, that is the sign of an incredible game - I had to finish it, I needed to know what happened. The storyline is probably the best storyline I have seen in a game for a long time, it flows well and you genuinely care about what happens.\n\nOf course, there are a few bugs and general irritants in the game. The enemies are very 1 dimensional and often a bit daft, as Jason's friends are. Some of the later tasks are ridiculously difficult (constantly spawning enemies). Having to pat down dead bodies to steal stuff means you'e continuously having to hold E, and the character feels a little bit clunky when you're climbing around.

Yet when you dig a little deeper, you discover that it is exactly those things... with the main difference being that bows are less fun to use, as well as the absence of a grappling hook, lack of interesting characters or an understandable story and all those other things that tend to make games more enjoyable to play.\n\nThe story itself is pretty awful, you, your brother, his girlfriend, your girlfriend, your other brother and 2 other friends have all been kidnapped by a creepy mohawk guy who I can’t for the life of me remember the name of! You’ll just have to escape and free the others. So begins about 8 hours of confusing alliances with yet more people with interchangeable names, during which, you rescue, one-by-one, your useless friends, who do nothing really to help you other than to comment on how heavily armed and tattooed  (sorry tataued?) you’ve become. Speaking of tattoos, they are a rather interesting way of showing your progression through the skill trees, as with each new skill, you earn another tat, classy. Through the tense and action packed storyline, you get to meet, among others, an American guy who likes flamethrowers, a really creepy Australian guy and an even creepier woman who likes wacky rituals… These “characters”, apart from all being completely psycho, contribute to help or hinder you as you travel “your path” of revenge against the Mohawk guy from the beginning. I personally didn’t really want revenge on this guy, much preferring just to go home, but that’s alright, because I don’t have to make those sorts of decisions! The only real choices you get in this game are pretty much just relegated to what weapons you get to carry, which in some cases is cut down by having to carry a plot-significant heavy weapon like a flamer that my long range sniper build didn’t need.\n\nIn between my character’s illogical decision making, the game actually gets fun. Generally, you’re allowed to leave the plot missions for a while and go explore which typically involves climbing defunct radio towers to reveal parts of the landscape (something I think was done better in this title than Assassin’s Creed!), then finding the nearest pirate outpost and taking it over. Whilst I’ve read a lot of praise for this part of gameplay, (which is undoubtedly fun), I rarely found it necessary to scout out and silently kill all the guards to avoid setting off the alarm, since I tended to forget about that and charge in with a HMG armed technical, mowing down even armoured pirates with ease. Besides, when you’re in a vehicle, dogs, leopards and angry cassowaries can’t hurt you!\n\nThe animal life in the game is pretty cool, with all sorts of deadly creatures out to get you, including but not limited to snakes, crocs, tigers, bears and tortoises - although the tortoises are about as deadly as a speed-bump (which I often used them as, sorry cuties...). Aside from the fact that these animals seem to be armoured and unless strictly classified as “prey” will not scatter when shot, instead preferring to go out in a blaze of glory and charge me, they seem pretty realistic, and it always adds a bit of fear to wandering off the roads into the jungle (which I do not recommend if in a vehicle).\n\nThe vehicle handling is pretty well done, although like in FC2, the available choices are usually limited to different coloured jeeps and technicals, with the rare cargo truck or buggy scattered around the place. That’s not to say the devs haven’t tried to make each technical look different, I was particularly impressed by the different rust patterns and colours I found, at times wondering whether any of my weathering pigments could approximate that hue… they won’t if you’re wondering.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty good, but I’m left feeling a little sickened after the main storyline, since mutilation isn’t really my thing… Other flaws contribute to making elements of the game just painful. For instance, I was constantly getting stuck when running on stairs and other small rocks in the ground, which if I was playing battlefield wouldn’t be a problem (come on this is basic stuff, even for a 2012 game!). The extremely cluttered hud with massive text reminding you of your objective was also pretty distracting, bring back FC2’s minimalist one! Thankfully, once the main story is complete, you can free-roam to you heart’s content, so I may still play it for that, but the flaws do add up, so I definitely would not recommend paying full price for the game, the fact that it got GOTY awards when others from 2012 like ME3 didn’t really surprised me. I’d say definitely play it, just get it in a sale first :D\n","September 22, 2014","true","29.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is a truly epic role-playing first-person-shooter. It's what others call, 'Skyrim with guns.' In my opinion, a must-own game that deserves a 9/10.\n\nStory: You are a guy named Jason Brody who he and his friends go on vacation on an island known as The Rook, in which get captured for randsom, and now you need to free them and get off the island alive.\n\nGameplay: In an open-world island filled with exotic creatures and menacing enemies, players are given the ability to survey and plot their attacks when it comes to danger; with either stealths, such as silent takedowns by performing melee attacks from above, below, or close behind, or just sheer brutality like taking an RPG and shooting explosive objects. Equipment is controlled by a simple system: Missions get completed, new items are unlocked to be purchased or crafted. Skills are are unlocked in three skill trees, collected by gaining experience from simply killing enemies or doing missions.\n\nPros:\n+Organic gameplay.\n+Layered narrative.\n+Great story.\n+Can be modded the crap out of.\n+Has multiplayer.\n+Has co-op campaign.\n+Awesome guns.\n+Amazing characterization.\n+Amazing graphics.\n+Moving soundtrack. Doesn't beat Skyrim's, but it's awesome.\n+Fantastic single-player campaign.\n+Upgrade system and character progression is astounding, featuring experience points, skill trees, and a crafting system.\n+Ecology and unpredictable creatures make the world vivid.\n\nCons:\n-Can get slighty repetitive.\n-Quick-time events.\n-Too many in-game cutscenes, leaving little to no control over your character.\n-Some boss fights sucked.\n-Unrealistic upgrade system. I mean, come on, tattoos make you stronger?\n-Side characters, meaning Jason Brody's drug-loving, alcohol-drinking friends, are ♥♥♥♥ing arrogant.\n-Like most other free-roam RPGs, this gets boring upon completion of the game.\n-Co-op mission design feels lackluster.\n-You need the right rig to play this game.\n-Ubisoft's Uplay.","April 19, 2014","true","19.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/empireian/recommended/220240/","empireian","Black Open Carry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/empireian/","198 products in account","This time, world renouned jet ski enthusiast Gaston Broley may have gone too far! Fueled by alchoholic fervor and being able to do the robot, he has punched out some chinamen, gone skydiving, and gotten himself into trouble with some priates who killed his brother who would have been a better protagonist in every way. Can a drunk, worthless, ex roadgeneral's spoiled brat son/ex marine corps POG provide him the career guidance he needs to overcome evil? Will visiting the shaman chick ever help his quest in a meaningful way that doesn't involve boobies? Is there any problem that can't be solved by waving an LMG around until hundreds of people are dead? We shall see, shan't we gentlemen?\n\nGoing to start with the positives, the game is fast paced and fun except when you are hunting animals for necessary supplies, which unfortunately is the whole first half of the game; the controls are responsive and make sense even if it keeps ommitting the lean buttons it arguably would be better for; the stealth and cover systems are good and don't use any consoley gimicks like sticky cover; the gunplay has depth in general as soon as you get used to the fact that the ballistics make no sense and AK47s somehow don't kill deer when you shoot them right through their vitals; the weapons are distinct and balanced and have cool upgrades but still only do damage if they aren't full auto; the game retains the original sequel's good storytelling via animation, patting fire out, biting bullets, most of the scripted combat, and ♥♥♥♥ like that are all very gritty and hillarious, and stuff like shooting or standing too close to a wall makes you pull your gun back realistically which doubles as a cover/stealth indicator; and the characters are well acted. The two guys who help you out and advance the plot, both white americans, although one of them is also at the same time a hillarious german steriotype that keeps helling BLITZKRIEEEEEG, are very likable and relatable in their psychopathic this is a fart cry game sort of way. Also jumping is satisfying for some reason.\n\nHang glider is arcadey but satisfying and grounded in actual concepts like dumping altitude for airspeed, the wingsuiting and parachuting is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t by about 1000 feet of ground clearance and opening the parachute somehow makes you actually stop and go upwards for a moment. If you go over a little hill, you can glide down somehow like it's the ♥♥♥♥ing moon. Like every non urban open world game which also lacks random encounters, the driving around adds very little other than making you reload your save when you keep driving off a cliff trying to make the driving sections not seem so ♥♥♥♥ing long and dying.\n\nJason can for some reason stab a billion guys super fast once you level him up a little because he is the great white tribal hunter, but in all the other ways you can think of he's just like the guys from fart cry 2. That is a big difference though, and it IS fun sometimes. The window to cutscene stab someone when they have not raised their weapon or you have just sprinted up to them is also pretty satisfying, and unlike human revolution, its not actually a cutscene stab, it's really fluid and barely breaks up the action at all.\n\nSadly the finale is pretty lame, you basically just get really good at killing and shoot up an airfield and then do a stupid but not too challenging rail shooting mission, hardly the exposive and challenging finale of fart cry 2 that forced you to kill all your fellow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ expatriots, and very very short indeed of actually good finales like those of Mafia, F.E.A.R., Max Payne, GTA IV, etc.\n\nAlso unforunately when I say that the animation is good, I mean it is good except that stabbing animals is somewhere between the walking dead and fighting goo men with a lightsaber, and slashing people to death makes you wonder why broley hasn't broken his wrist flailing around and limp wristing like that, I sense a trend, it is people who don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about how things actually get stuck in things as long as you get a nice closeup, maybe that's also why fall damage breaks the hands instead of the legs so that you can akwardly set them while holding them up to the camera. It's like they took far cry 2's animations' bitter sense of realism, as well as it's dark absurdist sense of humor, and while retaining them added a bunch of random stuff they thought was cool like extreme sports, whining girlfriends, and obnoxious edginess and racist exoticism for no reason. With the slashing animations I mean, I think the fall damage was also that dumb in fart cry 2. And also they actually did all those things to the story too.\n\nNot all the characters were good, Citrus and Dennys seem like they were not given their fair share of the cameratime as originally intended by the writers, this is because they advance the plot in no way for two reasons. The villagers are ♥♥♥♥ing useless and don't help because otherwise they would have had to make AI that's good, and the named characters are useless because fart cry now serves two very different masters, as in fart cry 2 they need to make all the assistance you get have a blackly humorous price tag or come for a blackly humorous ironic reason, but on the other hand, I think it would seem racist or break their stupid exoticist mystique, not sure which, if the entirely colored cast of named tribesmen (all two of them) were actually humorous or interesting. Still, if they, and bandito king, honestly, he also came off as half baked, had been given more chracterization than maybe they would be likable and the protagonist's personal struggles might actually make sense. Hell, even coke dealer just seemed like a 3 edgy 5 me crazy person added only to advance the plot, with a paperthin connection to the initial premise, whose worldview we don't really trust at all.\n\nBuck, I think he got enough characterization, he just, he just likes ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAlso why do you kill bandito king and buck with the china blade but you kill coke dealer with his own knife, I had been led to believe that using the china blade was like the whole point of those psychadelic knife fight scenes.\n\nI'll go ahead and spoil the ending because nobody likes the main character anyways, all the white people are really nice to him but the exotic islander chick and the drunk black dude declare that he needs to kill them because they are racist or something and nobody ever chooses that because it's ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and makes no sense, so the black dude drunkenly tries to kill you, accidentally killing her and surprising nobody, why didn't he ♥♥♥♥ing die though? What a useless sack of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI give it a meh +, the plus is because the guy on the cover has good trigger discipline. It's depressing that this passes for good these days, but at least I can play something to fulfil my need to shoot people dead.\n\nAlso, if Crysis broke all of Fart Cry 2's teeth out as the better sequel, than this game knocks Crysis 2's internal organs out by lightly flicking it in the toe as the better threequel. For a game that is literally just mixing Fart Cry 2 and ♥♥♥ Creed and coming out worse than both, it is actually really fun and complete.\n\nIs it better than alpha protocol? Worse story, worse tech tree, better gameplay. Similar mediocrity that gets saved by lovable sociopaths. And I don't mean bandito king, bandito king is boring not lovable. Before playing either game play all three Stalker games, Crysis, and Fart Cry 2, those are all better.\n\nI also can't reccomend the game if you hate white people or white people being the hero of a game about pacific islanders, unless you like white people killing their loved ones in order to join a racist steriotype islander tribe of course. Unless you have that particular fetish you won't be choosing that option at the end.","January 3, 2015","true","62.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDailyDino/recommended/220240/","TheDailyDino","TheDailyDino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDailyDino/","315 products in account","!!! Far Cry 3 !!!\n\nHmmm...Game Of The Year 2012? Yeah, I'm 2 years behind on this game and i cant believe i let this one slide me by. Let me start by saying it's refreshing to meet a game where it's strongest point is singleplayer, usually current games stash all of their real content into multiplayer then hack on some half-witted single player just to have it there.\n\nFirst off, just to get it out of the way, you have to deal with the horrible abomination that we all call Uplay...I'm glad i could finally play the game in offline mode, but still, it's a dumb program in the way of your gaming experience. There were also alot of server issues galore when i tried and i have yet to be able to play a single CO-OP game. so as of this review, ive stuck to singleplayer.\n\nMost people pass this off as an average console port, but i don't really think so. as far as graphical options, this game truly delivers. Full DX11 support and even offers a dam FOV slider, when was the last time you saw one of those beautiful things? Mouse smoothing also isn't a problem since you can just turn it off. The amount of sheer detail found in this game is outstanding, but moreover, its consistent. Most games of this scale will throw in the occasional bland texture, but ive yet to see ANY.\n\nI'll start with the story, it is really quite interesting as you progress and experience Jason, a town-raised ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, changing as a person; lowering himself to Vaas's level. Becoming a warrior himself.  Vaas, is very Heath Ledger (joker) like, the way he talks and his fast paced personality. you can clearly see the amount of effort that Micheal Mando (Vaas voice actor) but into him. The game is even matched with little tid bits of "Alice in wonderland" quotes thrown here and there between the chapters, they fit perfectly.\n\nSupporting Far Cry 3's story is a pretty large arsenal of side quests; ranging from hunting special animals to races to mini games. There always seems to be something to do. There is even a very robust crafting system in place, at times it feel very lackluster but as my progress in the game grew deeper, i found myself liking it's simplistic style more and more. Crafting in this game is essential and really makes you want to go hunt or gather ingredients for syringes that besides healing you can grant you some neat abilities (the ability to sense the animals around you or repel predators,etc). Now this is a Free Roam RPG shooter, so as well as crafting and side missions, your hit with 3 character advancement skill trees that as you unlock the skills in them, tattoos appear on your forearm *or tataus like they are called here* i feel the skill system could have been a little better, but i think that was just me remembering FFX oh well.\n\nThe huge focus of this game is its amazing amount of freedom in anything and everything you do. Sure there are a couple of story missions that are kind of linear or restrictive, but other than that it's all up to you. Do you like to make a noisy entrance into the enemy base, without knowing where the enemies are, spray-and-praying Call of Duty style? Go ahead.Do you like to stalk your prey and make a plan and try to keep to it as you silently pick them off with your silenced sniper or trusty bow? You can do that. Or maybe baiting your enemies while you sneak into their base, plant amine near every alarm and next time they see you BOOM! Or maybe let that leopard trapped in that cage do the job for you. Done! You have so many options it can be overwhelming at times. Most AAA RPGs that are released now and boast with their freedom of choice don't even come close to this game.\n\nAs for the animals, this is where the game does a VERY good job. There are two types of animals: carnivores and herbivores. Predators and prey. Wherever you go chances are you will see leopards chasing deer, tigers hunting buffalos, sharks eating tortoises, bears assaulting villagers etc. It feels very organic, natural and chaotic as well. These animals can make your life very hard - like surveying an enemy outpost only to find yourself attacked by a tiger, thus drawing enemy attention and realizing there are 4 times more enemy troops now. Or making a run for it and having to cross a river only to be assaulted by a crocodile and dragged underwater as soon you dive into the river. Splendid!\n\nwell, i think i made you read for quite long enough. all in all i would highly recommend this game, especially if you like first person shooters. im sad to say my review was based only on the singleplayer, but ive heard from many people that Far Cry 3 has a very solid multiplayer and an extremely fun and engaging CO-OP, matched with a high singleplayer replay value. this is defiantly a game ill be playing a few times over\n\n-XeroSyphon","June 19, 2014","true","6.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The graphics are excellent, and can bring high end gaming machines to their knees! However, even with a mid range graphics card you could easily manage some playable settings and enjoy the game to the end.\n\nThe characters are quite easily the best part of this game. Vaas is possibly the greatest villain ever portrayed in a game, largly down to immaculate voice acting & believable animations. Even the side characters you meet on the way are believable and help immerse you in the story.\n\nControls are easy to get to grips with whether you use keyboard or control pad. I played through with an Xbox 360 controller and it was an enjoyable experience start to finish. The feeling of the guns is realistic and they feel different whether using a pistol of LMG, the weight and control is spot on.\n\nOverall the game is immaculate and shouldnt be missed. It's a shame the PC multiplayer seemed quiet because I thought it was brilliant, some nice game modes, excellent maps, and the graphics are still on point. Better than the typical CoD games. Did not get a chance to try Co-op but from what i've seen it seems fun.\n\nI would give the game 9/10 for single player alone, could have been 10/10 if the multiplayer had been able to extend my time with this game!","November 27, 2013","true","28.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The upgrade system was a bit foreign to me since I hadn't seen perks implemented as they were in this game, but it didn't take long to figure it out.  The injections system by which you crafted stuff like health vials and a few other buffs was a bit awkward and I don't think it added much to the game (although it was a necessary thing to do in order to play successfully).\n\nI had fun playing it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/empireian/recommended/220240/","empireian","Black Open Carry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/empireian/","198 products in account","This time, world renouned jet ski enthusiast Gaston Broley may have gone too far! Fueled by alchoholic fervor and being able to do the robot, he has punched out some chinamen, gone skydiving, and gotten himself into trouble with some priates who killed his brother who would have been a better protagonist in every way. Can a drunk, worthless, ex roadgeneral's spoiled brat son/ex marine corps POG provide him the career guidance he needs to overcome evil? Will visiting the shaman chick ever help his quest in a meaningful way that doesn't involve boobies? Is there any problem that can't be solved by waving an LMG around until hundreds of people are dead? We shall see, shan't we gentlemen?\n\nGoing to start with the positives, the game is fast paced and fun except when you are hunting animals for necessary supplies, which unfortunately is the whole first half of the game; the controls are responsive and make sense even if it keeps ommitting the lean buttons it arguably would be better for; the stealth and cover systems are good and don't use any consoley gimicks like sticky cover; the gunplay has depth in general as soon as you get used to the fact that the ballistics make no sense and AK47s somehow don't kill deer when you shoot them right through their vitals; the weapons are distinct and balanced and have cool upgrades but still only do damage if they aren't full auto; the game retains the original sequel's good storytelling via animation, patting fire out, biting bullets, most of the scripted combat, and ♥♥♥♥ like that are all very gritty and hillarious, and stuff like shooting or standing too close to a wall makes you pull your gun back realistically which doubles as a cover/stealth indicator; and the characters are well acted. The two guys who help you out and advance the plot, both white americans, although one of them is also at the same time a hillarious german steriotype that keeps helling BLITZKRIEEEEEG, are very likable and relatable in their psychopathic this is a fart cry game sort of way. Also jumping is satisfying for some reason.\n\nHang glider is arcadey but satisfying and grounded in actual concepts like dumping altitude for airspeed, the wingsuiting and parachuting is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t by about 1000 feet of ground clearance and opening the parachute somehow makes you actually stop and go upwards for a moment. If you go over a little hill, you can glide down somehow like it's the ♥♥♥♥ing moon. Like every non urban open world game which also lacks random encounters, the driving around adds very little other than making you reload your save when you keep driving off a cliff trying to make the driving sections not seem so ♥♥♥♥ing long and dying.\n\nJason can for some reason stab a billion guys super fast once you level him up a little because he is the great white tribal hunter, but in all the other ways you can think of he's just like the guys from fart cry 2. That is a big difference though, and it IS fun sometimes. The window to cutscene stab someone when they have not raised their weapon or you have just sprinted up to them is also pretty satisfying, and unlike human revolution, its not actually a cutscene stab, it's really fluid and barely breaks up the action at all.\n\nSadly the finale is pretty lame, you basically just get really good at killing and shoot up an airfield and then do a stupid but not too challenging rail shooting mission, hardly the exposive and challenging finale of fart cry 2 that forced you to kill all your fellow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ expatriots, and very very short indeed of actually good finales like those of Mafia, F.E.A.R., Max Payne, GTA IV, etc.\n\nAlso unforunately when I say that the animation is good, I mean it is good except that stabbing animals is somewhere between the walking dead and fighting goo men with a lightsaber, and slashing people to death makes you wonder why broley hasn't broken his wrist flailing around and limp wristing like that, I sense a trend, it is people who don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about how things actually get stuck in things as long as you get a nice closeup, maybe that's also why fall damage breaks the hands instead of the legs so that you can akwardly set them while holding them up to the camera. It's like they took far cry 2's animations' bitter sense of realism, as well as it's dark absurdist sense of humor, and while retaining them added a bunch of random stuff they thought was cool like extreme sports, whining girlfriends, and obnoxious edginess and racist exoticism for no reason. With the slashing animations I mean, I think the fall damage was also that dumb in fart cry 2. And also they actually did all those things to the story too.\n\nNot all the characters were good, Citrus and Dennys seem like they were not given their fair share of the cameratime as originally intended by the writers, this is because they advance the plot in no way for two reasons. The villagers are ♥♥♥♥ing useless and don't help because otherwise they would have had to make AI that's good, and the named characters are useless because fart cry now serves two very different masters, as in fart cry 2 they need to make all the assistance you get have a blackly humorous price tag or come for a blackly humorous ironic reason, but on the other hand, I think it would seem racist or break their stupid exoticist mystique, not sure which, if the entirely colored cast of named tribesmen (all two of them) were actually humorous or interesting. Still, if they, and bandito king, honestly, he also came off as half baked, had been given more chracterization than maybe they would be likable and the protagonist's personal struggles might actually make sense. Hell, even coke dealer just seemed like a 3 edgy 5 me crazy person added only to advance the plot, with a paperthin connection to the initial premise, whose worldview we don't really trust at all.\n\nBuck, I think he got enough characterization, he just, he just likes ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAlso why do you kill bandito king and buck with the china blade but you kill coke dealer with his own knife, I had been led to believe that using the china blade was like the whole point of those psychadelic knife fight scenes.\n\nI'll go ahead and spoil the ending because nobody likes the main character anyways, all the white people are really nice to him but the exotic islander chick and the drunk black dude declare that he needs to kill them because they are racist or something and nobody ever chooses that because it's ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and makes no sense, so the black dude drunkenly tries to kill you, accidentally killing her and surprising nobody, why didn't he ♥♥♥♥ing die though? What a useless sack of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI give it a meh +, the plus is because the guy on the cover has good trigger discipline. It's depressing that this passes for good these days, but at least I can play something to fulfil my need to shoot people dead.\n\nAlso, if Crysis broke all of Fart Cry 2's teeth out as the better sequel, than this game knocks Crysis 2's internal organs out by lightly flicking it in the toe as the better threequel. For a game that is literally just mixing Fart Cry 2 and ♥♥♥ Creed and coming out worse than both, it is actually really fun and complete.\n\nIs it better than alpha protocol? Worse story, worse tech tree, better gameplay. Similar mediocrity that gets saved by lovable sociopaths. And I don't mean bandito king, bandito king is boring not lovable. Before playing either game play all three Stalker games, Crysis, and Fart Cry 2, those are all better.\n\nI also can't reccomend the game if you hate white people or white people being the hero of a game about pacific islanders, unless you like white people killing their loved ones in order to join a racist steriotype islander tribe of course. Unless you have that particular fetish you won't be choosing that option at the end.","January 3, 2015","true","62.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

This game is a truly epic role-playing first-person-shooter. It's what others call, 'Skyrim with guns.' In my opinion, a must-own game that deserves a 9/10.\n\nStory: You are a guy named Jason Brody who he and his friends go on vacation on an island known as The Rook, in which get captured for randsom, and now you need to free them and get off the island alive.\n\nGameplay: In an open-world island filled with exotic creatures and menacing enemies, players are given the ability to survey and plot their attacks when it comes to danger; with either stealths, such as silent takedowns by performing melee attacks from above, below, or close behind, or just sheer brutality like taking an RPG and shooting explosive objects. Equipment is controlled by a simple system: Missions get completed, new items are unlocked to be purchased or crafted. Skills are are unlocked in three skill trees, collected by gaining experience from simply killing enemies or doing missions.\n\nPros:\n+Organic gameplay.\n+Layered narrative.\n+Great story.\n+Can be modded the crap out of.\n+Has multiplayer.\n+Has co-op campaign.\n+Awesome guns.\n+Amazing characterization.\n+Amazing graphics.\n+Moving soundtrack.

I mean, come on, tattoos make you stronger?\n-Side characters, meaning Jason Brody's drug-loving, alcohol-drinking friends, are ♥♥♥♥ing arrogant.\n-Like most other free-roam RPGs, this gets boring upon completion of the game.\n-Co-op mission design feels lackluster.\n-You need the right rig to play this game.\n-Ubisoft's Uplay.","April 19, 2014","true","19.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/malloryknox/recommended/220240/","malloryknox","MalloryKnox.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/malloryknox/","127 products in account","When I picked this game up in the sales for a few pounds, there was no way I expected it to be as brilliant as it actually is. Farcry3 follows Jason, a slightly wimpy American teenager who gets into trouble with some bad guys on an island. In essence, they kidnap some of his friends and he goes to get them back. Firstly, let's get the characters out of the way. Lots of people hate Jason and his friends, and although they are very 1 dimensional, I have to say I grew fond of Jason. His transition from cowardly white boy to tattooed warrior was a great development throughout the game. The other characters are brilliant; The unstable and unpredictable Vaas, in particular, I absolutely adored. And Sam. BLITZKRIIIIEG! I love the fact that you hear them referring to you as 'Snow White' as your legendary status increases, it makes you feel like a badass.\n\nThe game is just so much fun! I felt genuine fear as I ran and hid behind bushes from the enemies, having heard their trucks driving closer and closer. I nearly had a heart attack the first time a tiger jumped on me, and laughed out loud as a herd of cows chased me. I adored having to go to certain areas on the island to hunt for different animals to make things. The skill development trees are great, and the skills built up perfectly in sync with the difficulty progression of the game. The open world feature is brilliant - it makes the game less linear and a lot more interesting. I absolutely loved the idea of having to turn on the pylons to unlock sections of the map, and the turquoise water, sandy beaches and lush tropical vegetation make the game look stunning.\n\nThe tasks are varied and a lot of them are so much  fun  (the drug fields task was probaby my favourite task in any game, ever). From having to drive a quad bike against the clock, to sneaking into camps to take things, to shooting a gun and making everything explode from a helicopter, to torturing somebody, the tasks are endlessly entertaining. At no point in this game did I think 'oh great, another one of  these  tasks'. And that's another thing: you have a lot of choice. No, you don't have to keep taking out all the enemy camps, you can sneak around them. No, you don't have to do lots of vehicle driving if you don't want to. Aside from the main storyline, you can play the game how the hell you want.\n\nThe difficulty increases throughout the game so perfectly, you have to take your hat off to Ubisoft. Towards the end, the tasks got really quite demanding, and there were several instances where I 'ragequitted' and sulked for half an hour, before having to go back for more punishment. And to me, that is the sign of an incredible game - I had to finish it, I needed to know what happened. The storyline is probably the best storyline I have seen in a game for a long time, it flows well and you genuinely care about what happens.\n\nOf course, there are a few bugs and general irritants in the game. The enemies are very 1 dimensional and often a bit daft, as Jason's friends are. Some of the later tasks are ridiculously difficult (constantly spawning enemies). Having to pat down dead bodies to steal stuff means you'e continuously having to hold E, and the character feels a little bit clunky when you're climbing around. Having said that, these are very minor issues that took absolutely nothing out of the game, I'm just trying to balance it out a bit.\n\nI wish I could go back to the time before I played FarCry3 and start all over again. I absolutely recommend this game, and for the sale price of less than £5 you would be absolutely crazy not to have this on your list.","June 22, 2014","true","22.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Ever*.\n\nBuy it and don't pirate it, because this game does not like pirates in particular. I love how you are given alot of freedom to just do whatever you want. It reminds me of assassin's creed and The Elder Scrolls games alot. What I like most is how you can hunt and craft for better equipment. The skill tree is nice also, but it does not bind you to a certain way of playing. So you can still be stealth without actually having to get alot of perks.\nAnother amazing aspect of this game is the landscape. The jungle looks absolutely stunning.\n\nThere's not too many downsides. The only one I can think of now is it being too easy to get all craftable gear maxed out. It took me around 23 hours. The amount of variety in the "wanted" missions is too small though. It basically always comes down to knifing some dude who downloaded media illigally.\n\nConclusion: Get it. It is totally worth the price and it will keep you busy for hours if you like first person shooters / RPG's.\n\n\n*Not actually best game ever but alot of fun.","March 3, 2014","true","52.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This one is a pretty bad work material for that.\nIf this game has some bugs or glitches, it's not even worth mentioning. All of those are minor.\nFor example once first heath bar was still flashing even though Jason was healthy or 4th health bar is a little bit brighter than the rest.\nJumping is kinda awkward sometimes. It really doesn't have to be THAT high to lose some of your health.\nWhile sliding (from a cliff) and going iron sight, only zooming works at that point. After landing, suddently weapon appears.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Can't even remember anyhing gameplay related. Most likely due to lack of those glitches.\n\nThe storyline is interesting even though Jason's goal is revealed pretty much from very beginning but it has a little twist and turns. Vaas, one of major villains in one original ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Biggest icon of Farcry 3. Bigger than our protagonist I'll say. Launch this game for more.\n\nI really like the environment you move in. It's far from piece of ♥♥♥♥ industrial/urbanized area I hate so much. Love the jungle idea and free roaming. Additional tasks like hunting or "Wanted Dead" quest are relatively easy. Too easy I say. In fact the whole game can be easier. That happens when you decide first to uncover whole map by capturing radio towers which also unlocks purchasable weapons (more unlocked towers happens to make those weapons free) and capturing Lost Letters for a better melee weapon - Tanto, Relics that can unlock two Signature weapons, syringe that makes you godlike for 30 seconds or syringe that makes your every shot, no matter what weapon, a one shot kill (shotguns, high fire rate weapons and LMGs are best for this), Trial of Rakyat that unlocks the best LMG and possibly the most versatile weapon found in this game and Outpost that grants you a modified, silenced Colt 1911 after libarating 17 outposts I think.\nYea. With this the game gets easy but it's up to you how you play. A fine example of single player FPS game. It has multiplayer too but I do not give a damn about it. A good example of a non-linear, single player first person shooter with big variety of tasks to accomplish.

Although the storyline and setting is pretty typical of FPS games (bad guys/terrorists vs you/the little guy) the gameplay its self isn't typical. Infact, the game rewards you for trying outlandish, improvised or tactical approaches to seemingly ordinary objectives.\n\nYou'd think all this freedom means it's just another one of those titles that you derp about blowing yourself and everything else up till you get bored and leave the game to rot in your library, but the storyline and characters within FC3 do enough to make you want to actually finish or at least progress through the game. The map itself, teamed with the crafting mechanics and ecosystem, is great fun to explore. The little relics and hidden locations mean getting sidetracked can be worthwhile. I personally also really enjoy the patrols of bad guys and having to hide or engage, which is just another way the game has of reminding you not to relax for too long.\n\nThere are a few things that annoy me however. Firstly, you need a Uplay account to run this. I bought through Steam because of the convienience and achievements and all that cool stuff, but Uplay wipes that out. There are a few UI/Navigational annoyances in this game too, menus mainly. Some of the flavour texts I feel are a little overdone, or repeated too often to be funny. These are however more preferential things than a straight up issue.\n\nIn short, even if you don't play FPS games, you'll still probably enjoy this enough to warrant picking it up through a sale.

I stayed up 2 and a half days straight to complete it but there is really nothing to do but the story and that lacks so much...\n\nThis is not a game like GTA, it offers a wide variety of extra tasks to do but there is no need to do them other than to feel the grind, one extra is the ability to hunt to craft upgrades and the ability to find flowers to create medicine or buffs but I completed the game without upgrading any of my gear and I never had to create buffs... the only thing worth while creating was medkits and once you unlock the ability to heal yourself without medkits(much slower) you will not find the need for them... I also never really ran out of ammo and if I did I just picked up another gun off an enemy.. easy!\n\nThat is another thing I find lacking.. there is so many weapons but for the entire game I stuck with the AK47 from one of the first people I killed at the start... I don't even know what other weapons there was.. was no need..\n\nThe Graphics are nice but of course a little dated now and with my settup appeared very cartoony.. the people that is had thick black borders around them.. the world however was beautiful!\n\nNow the story.. jeeze.. it was amazing BUT.. I found a lot of flaws with it.. to start with the story restarts 3 times.. 3 times you complete it and it takes everything away from you and sends you back to the start only this time something is a little different... I also hated the weird magical mystical scenes.. granted when I'd smoked some weed or had hallucigenic powder blown in my face? great! but then you reach say a boss battle and your transported to some made up magical place where the fight consists of button bashing (really.. you have to mash keys when it tells you to win) at first I did not even know I had killed the first boss.. I thought I was somehow on drugs in fact I still believe I was on drugs.. I swear I killed him while on drugs and he never actually died but after i came around apparently I killed him so you know? ok?\n\nTowards the end I felt this was a pebble compared to Farcry on my old Xbox (the original) and I felt that though the story was good it was very very short akin to DLC (as i said they restarted it 3 times to make it appear longer) I like te premise for the story I just don't like how it was executed..\n\nNow I had great fun with this game but I don't know I'm sort of half for recommending it and half for not... right now it feels a cross between original farcry but done as a point and click adventure game..\n\nI've decided after a small break to decide that I'm NOT going to OFFICIALLY recommend this game however I'd like you to be well aware that this is a magnificent game even though there was to many flaws for me to recommend it.. you should buy it if it's affordable to you.. (IE you're mega friggen rich or it's on sale)\n\nI recommend this game but I don't, 5/10 (meet you half way)\n\nBONUS PET PEEVE: There are enemies on it that wear about 40 body packs and can take about 6 rounds of my assault rifle to put down, I thought they were going realistic here? get them to carry a riot shield next time and leave fantasy alone.. it's clear you guys cannot grasp reality/make pretend anyway!

Dont get me wrong i loved this game, but i bought it for open world and side quests. Far Cry 3 had "side quests" but these quests would mess up the story line and often mess up the main story line. The open world aspect to it wasnt open world at all really just a large world filled with nothing in particular. In my opinion i would recommend it to people who like a game that sticks to the storyline and just that. I would not recommend this to people who like games like "skyrim" or "fallout". I do know its bad to compare these games to this, but if thats what your looking for, dont get this game.","June 15, 2015","false","60.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It is just too immensely rich and fun to play. There is always a cave you haven't explored, a secret you didn't find, a nice place you didn't see, a way of fighting you didn't try before... Rook Island always makes you come back for more.\n\nGameplay--- I have to place this statement in a proper context though. My first playthrough on the vanilla version of the game only lasted about 25 hours, full of high-tempo combat, mad driving, killing pirates by the dozens, completing missions in a hush-hush way. This is because the original game can feel a little FPS-mainstream (damn you, COD, for what you have done to the genre). The emphasis is a little too much on the action, and less on the open world and side missions, as is the case with Far Cry 2. However, where game-dev's fail in order to satisfy the producers and the company, the game community comes to the rescue. With proper modding (Ziggys Mod!), this game becomes what it had to be all along. The pace is slowed down, the difficulty has gone way up, making run-and-gun console-type approaches impossible. Instead, you have to resort to guerilla-warfare and the use of stealth and your natural surroundings. The over-guidance of the vanilla game is gone; you have to rely on your own noodle now. Sometimes you'll be the hunter, sometimes you'll be the prey, and that is what makes this game an exciting experience. Also, you will notice that this game is much richer in content than you noticed at first, since you spend too much time running and gunning in the vanilla version. Now, you can just ignore the missions and go hiking the amazingly beautiful island on your own.\n\nStoryline--- Although I get the feeling that it is a little too cliché-ridden, the storyline is quite decent. No big plot twists or big schemes, but enough to keep the game going, and to give you a sense of urgency. Also, it does a good job in letting you question your morality and sanity by the end of the game, a nice break from the justified-violence themes in other games in the FPS-genre (yep, looking at you, COD). The most credit has to go to the voice-actors, who did an incredible job in giving the characters some depth (Vaas already is a classic).\n\nTechnical aspects--- The graphics of this game are just insane (keep your finger on the print-screen button!). Then again, so are the system specs, even for current standards. Bear this in mind when you buy this game!\n\nMultiplayer and coop--- Not really worth the trouble. The multiplayer is COD-clone without depth (sorry for the fanboys that I keep mentioning this franchise in a negative way). The coop, however, is quite fun and easily accesible, since it uses a sort of 4-player drop-in format like L4D. But honestly, who cares? This is the best single-player experience I had!\n\nConclusion--- Buy it, mod it, fall in love with it. Once you set a foot on Rook Island, you'll never want to leave.","February 16, 2014","true","110.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Captain943/recommended/220240/","Captain943","Captain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Captain943/","463 products in account","You play Jason Brody, some rich kid from California, who goes on a trip with some friends and ends up as a hostage of the local pirates. After he barely manages to escape he is recruited by Tribals who call themselves the Rakyat, and goes on a long and erotic journey to self-discovery.\n\nWhile the initial Idea is pretty good, it is not executed very well. Jason never killed anybody nor skinned an animal, but after the cut scenes end and you can finally go out and explore, you can happily murder half of the Island´s population without hearing a whimper ever again. Well, except when skinning animals; Jason never gets used to that, even though you have to kill the whole fauna twice over to craft a wallet and a rucksack. This is something Tomb Raider pulled off better.\nAnother problem is that the faction you are working for (and you have no choice here) is not really likeable. Even though YOU are supposed to help THEM, you rarely see them fighting the pirates. There are several occasions where, after "liberating" one of the pirate outposts, I´d hear some Rakyat proudly proclaiming: "WHO`S THE MAN?! ME!" Yeah buddy, you sure are. This goes on and on, and after a while you ask yourself why you would even help them in the first place; your goal is to rescue your friends. But because some black guy who fished you out of the river, put some tattoos on your arm and sent you to the local drug king told you to, you´ll happily oblige. BECAUSE YOU ARE A WARRIOR, JASON. AND YOU NEED DA TATAU TO BECOME STRONGER. This part of the story is just unnecessary.\n\nThe game also has an obsession with drugs; on several occasions Jason ends up getting drugged, whether willingly, by accident, or per force. These dream-like sequences may be fancy for the first time, but are outright annoying the second time around. This is the part where you can guess what Ubisoft´s Target Demographic must have been.\n\nThe Far Cry series has always been known for graphical fidelity; this one is a slight exception in my opinion. While the game DOES look good overall, there are some things that are worse than in the previous games, if not ♥♥♥♥ in general. I can´t understand how a game that runs essentially on the same engine as the previous game looks worse, even though they even upgraded it to the second version. When you compare the two games side by side, several things just stand out negatively: the LOD and view distance are handled way better in Far Cry 2. I have never experienced such severe pop ins like I did in Far Cry 3, especially since it uses a rather obvious effect to do so. Secondly, Far Cry 3 uses way too much SSAO, to the point where objects have black halos surrounding them. Unfortunately you can´t disable this effect in game without switching to DX9; you have to edit the config file if you want to get rid of it. Another thing I really can´t understand is a weird graphical glitch that happens when you are inside caves. Sometimes the walls appear all shiny, like somebody spent two weeks smearing oil on random cave walls.\n\nThe sound is generally pretty good, the weapons all sound quite alright. Only problem here is that all suppressed weapons use the same sound, no matter if you are using an assault rifle or a shotgun. This can be kind of annoying when you tend to use more than one suppressed weapon. But this is nothing compared to the sound quality of EVERYBODY except the main characters. Every single civilian, pirate and rebel sounds like his voice was recorded with a microphone wrapped in a plastic bag; the sound quality is just awful at times. Couple this with repetitive voice lines á la "FOCK. DIS. HEAT" or "BURNS LIKE A MOTHER WHEN I ♥♥♥♥. SHOULDA USED A RUBBER." and the problem will become really obvious.\n\nThe gameplay itself is what really saves this title. The gameplay is mostly fluid, rewarding and well, fun, that you can forget most of these annoyances when you get the chance to play undisturbed for more than half an hour. It is way more fun to ambush pirates with mines, surprise them with C4 or just stab everybody with your knife than playing the main missions, which sometimes severely limit how you can approach the situation. Maybe this is why I liked the southern Island more; the whole tribal hero ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is cast aside, and there is only the mission and how you want to approach it, just like the previous games. Unfortunately the game is almost over when you reach the second island, leaving you with such a low amount of missions that I wonder why they even bothered making another island.\n\nThe weapons are fairly standard, ranging from pistols to rocket launchers. But for some reason some weapons have their attachments disabled, something which really sucks in the beginning. This is strange because all weapons HAVE attachments, which you can use in coop and multiplayer. A simple mod can unlock all attachments for the weapons, which makes me wonder why they chose to disable them in the first place.\n\nThere is also a problem with the game´s difficulty. First of all, the AI is not that great. Even though your enemies can take cover and try to flank you sometimes, they just charge towards you most of the time. Couple this with aimbot like accuracy on the higher difficulties and bugged fire that you can´t put out because the QTE prompt does not show up and you know what to expect. Because of that, a stealthy approach is easier most of the time. If you do get spotted, you can abuse the takedown system by shooting even the armored guys until they stagger, walk around them and stab them in the back to kill them instantly. Things like that make some encounters ridiculously easy.\n\nAfter all I have criticized, you´d think that I don´t like this game. But here comes the funny part: I can´t deny that Far Cry 3 is a fun game. It has some major flaws and annoyances, but at least this time the gameplay is decent. Stabbing people, blowing up convoys and hunting the local fauna just has a certain charm. While it is not a bad game per se, it is not a good Far Cry. Despite this, pick it up when it is on sale, it will keep you occupied for a while.\n","December 21, 2013","true","25.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

The color pallet is incredibly varied! I can actually see greens (true greens, not f*cking brown-grey-ish greens, Skyrim!!!!), the water is actually blue! I was shellshocked the first time I saw it, it's truly amazing and a sight to be seen ASAP!\nStory wise is where I can safely say the game shines (since every single side quest is as repetitive as a CoD game. Side quests are basically: kill this super holy-♥♥♥♥-huge beast animal! OR it's: This pirate is really badass and only you can save us! Kill him! But with a knife because it's our ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will-get-you-killed-some-day tradition!),  one of the antagonists (of course, Mr. Insanity himself: Vaas!) is the best villain of all time! Movie-wise, book-wise, game-wise, whatever-wise. Vaas is the perfect Villain I've been expecting to see somewhere for years!! The story tells the personal story of Jason Brody, who is trapped along with his girlfriend, brother and friends in a circle of human traffic, lead by Vaas and other amazingly written villains (not as good as Vaas, but they are still some of the best I've ever seen anywhere!). The story is really good, character development EXISTS! It's amazing! One of the best storylines of all time! Although it's annoying the cliché at the start where Jason is a lonely boy who doesn't know how to do anything and 5 seconds later he's Jason Brody, the son of Rambo + Chuck Norris in the womb of John Connor! It's not very believable, but with that aside, the story is stellar and it's the steal of the show along with the graphics!\nGameplay is pretty standard, you have guns n' sh*t and you have to kill some animals to create bigger bags to create bigger ammo pouches, bigger rucksacks (for loot), bigger wallets (it's pretty obvious...) and carry more guns (up to 4 guns, yes you can carry 4 LMG's if you want to do so). The is an RPG like system where you gain XP for stuff that you do and get skill point with then you spend in 3 different skill trees, which allows you to have more health, takedown heavier enemies (this game has stealth and actually does it WELL! F*ck me finally!), among other amazing traits!\nGunplay is pretty good, guns have a very nice handling and feel. Most of them sound very powerful. However in the demo shown at E3 2011 (I think it was E3 2011, not sure) the guns, like the AK (the one shown) looked and seemed to feel much better in that demo than in the actual game, but those are small complaints since the AK still feels amazing in this version.\nSOund design is amazing as well, you can hear jungle noises, tigers roaring, gun fire at the distance. The Island is alive and it's great! It really really is! I love the game and everything about it! The game also has a FULL Co-Op campaign up to 4 players and a FULL Multiplayer component (with perks, attachment for guns, clan support, so much, just so much to cover in this game, you can easily put over 40 hours out of it!)\nGet it at any price, even 49,99€ it would still be worth it! On Steam is now 29,99€ buy it now or wait for a sale, you won't regret it (unless you're not a tropical island/FPS fan, but who isn't? Nobody, that's who!) :D","October 13, 2013","true","23.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

The game suffered from front-loading all the best content.  The first half of the game was superb.  The second half failed to live up to what preceded it.  On almost every level – villains, objectives, scenery, atmosphere – the second half of the game was like a bad sequel.  But what finally drove me away was utter disgust for the character I was required to play.\n\nUnlike a lot of games that try to implement moral choices and some sort of moral system, FarCry3 seemed utterly uninterested in whether what the character was doing was good or right or heroic, instead choosing to focus on other themes.  This was ultimately to the game’s detriment, as progressing in the game often required acts that were morally unpleasant – just because the game designers don’t particularly care if something is moral or not does not mean that the players won’t.\n\nFor example, the opening of the game did a wonderful job setting up the pirates as a force that I could wipe out in good conscience – they were horrible, sadistic and murderous men who made me feel like I was saving lives when I removed them from the gene pool.  Even those who may not have been so downright evil were enemy combatants in a war they had chosen to declare on me.  And the game did a good job reinforcing this with many of the random encounters.  Absolutely none of that can be said for the mercenaries introduced midway through the game.  I expect this was intentional.  The game makes a point of claiming it is about insanity, and this is a fair way of showing the character’s increasingly murky morality and perverted mentality.  But in choosing to do that, the game chose to create a protagonist whom I found progressively less enjoyable to play.   Inevitably, the game’s demand that I mass-murder a huge swath of these guys was more than I was willing to give it.\n\nI'll admit, my attitude towards wholesale slaughter of the mercenaries probably had a lot more to do with the game than an objective measure of their comparative evils.  Hoyt himself was certainly as bad or worse than any of the pirates; and the mercenaries were following his orders, right?\n\nWhen the mercenaries first appeared, I had no idea who they were.  It was a mission to provide sniper cover for my allies while they attempted to recover their people whom the pirates had taken prisoner... or so I was told.  Except the people who showed up weren't pirates.  All I knew about them was that they looked military -- for all I knew, they were the armed forces of a sovereign nation, or possibly even people sent in by the United Nations -- and that they decidedly weren't the people I was there to shoot at.  I didn't know these people, I had no grudge against them, I couldn't even be sure that they weren't the good guys, and I had absolutely no reason to declare war on them.  Except that if I didn't the game would not allow me to progress, so it was either murder these people for no good reason or quit the game.\n\nI continued playing, despite the really bad taste that left in my mouth, because the game had been amazing up until that point.  Next, I find out that instead of the allies I was told I'd be rescuing, the military men were transporting my enemy.  So either my allies had suffered a catastrophic intelligence failure, or I had been lied to.  Worse, I'd just declared war on an unknown group and murdered a bunch of their people in order to set a horrible, sadistic psychopath free... for all I knew, I'd just launched an attack on the good guys just as they were taking action against the pirates!  To say I was unhappy was an understatement.  I had lost every bit of faith in my "allies" and I really wanted to be given the option to tell them to go ♥♥♥♥ themselves.\n\nOf course, it turns out the military men were Hoyt's mercenaries.  But at that point, as much as I hated Hoyt, I was primed to want to give these guys as much of a benefit of the doubt as possible.  The first town was under their control, but they weren't slaughtering the civilians like the pirates would.  The first scenario where I really dealt with them had me sneaking past the first two mercenaries and listening in on their conversation.  One mercenary was reveling in psychopathic bloodlust.  The one with him was reining him in, telling him this was a job not a murder free-for-all, and that he was only to shoot where and when he was told to.  My reaction?  The first guy very clearly was a danger to society and needed to be permanently put down.  But the second guy?  He was working for a very bad person, yes; but he was actively preventing a bad situation from getting much, much worse.  I didn't want to put this guy down, just as badly as I wanted to take out the other one.  The islanders needed people like that in the enemy's camp.  Of course, the game had stripped away my ability to choose what to do in that scene; I couldn't kill either or the scenerio would restart.\n\nI ran into those two again in one of the next situations.  Only this time, instead of not being allowed to take out the homicidal psychopath, I wasn't allowed to spare the other guy.  In fact, I was required to abandon all common sense, not to mention my characters skills, stealthy play style, and impressive custom sniper rifle, and make an absurd, bombastic rocket-launcher attack on a bridge and then carve my way out through all the people I had just carefully slipped past.  I was supremely not impressed.\n\nFinally, I was taken to see Hoyt.  I was lead into his office fully armed for a private sit-down with the guy.  At which point, I killed him with my silenced SMG, then tried to sneak out the window.  A bit of a mistake -- the place was so crawling with guards that I really didn't have much of a chance the moment the alarm went up... made all the worse by there being only a single exit that I could use: the front gate.  But my brother was in the place, and thanks to my undercover ally, I was able to rescue him.  We got to the gate, and of course that triggered the final cutscene where I had to make a fatal choice... and I chose to make sure my ally got my brother to safety, making a last stand that left me a bullet-riddled corpse.  I have to say, though, a damn good ending...\n\n...except none of that happened.  Because you can't shoot Hoyt even though you are alone in a room with him and you are fully armed.  But I was allowed (read: required) to ignore that the bad guys had video footage that would have told them who I was, blown my disguise and made (or at least should have made) everything I was told to do afterwords a painfully obvious trap.  Because the second half of FarCry 3 is pretty much awful.\n\nI gave FarCry 3 every possible chance.  I played the first island exhaustively, finding every treasure and relic, doing every side quest, exploring every inch of the island... hell, probably spent days worth of game time just having my character hang out and play poker with the guys.  But in the end, the strikes against the game piled up so high that I simply couldn't enjoy it anymore.","July 3, 2014","false","301.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Open world immersion! Crafting, hunting, exploration, side games, challenges, optional quests, lively characters, and amazing weapon design -- this game has it all! Not many games live up to the given price tag, and this is one of them. I spent fifty hours on my first play though. That is an extensive single player fps.\n\nCut off the music and turn off all of the "hud" options that can be toggled, (I left the grenade indicator on) and this island will come to life. When hunting, the player will need to stand still and listen for the growls and other noises made by the animals. The items obtained from the wild life give the player options to craft new weapon, ammo, and consumable slots. The open world feel will often send the player face to face with tigers, bears, or enemy patrols when least expecting it.\n\nThe ONLY thing I didn't like about the game.... Is the main character! I wanted to smack my guy in the face way to many times =/ But that is a small price to pay for a full and complete game that has been polished into a guided, open world thrill ride that is sure to please. The first time you light an enemy base on fire then slide down a steep mountain side for a quick and slick escape from the guard dogs like a serious BA, just to land on a pack of frickin' grizzly bears -- you'll be hooked!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=168799526","June 8, 2013","true","82.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

As action heroes go, Brody is an unlikely one. While Far Cry and Far Cry 2's protagonists had military or mercenary backgrounds, which at least explained their ability to reload an assault rifle in three seconds, you're just an over-privileged Californian bro in his early twenties stuck in a nightmare situation.\n\nFar Cry 3 is one of the best open world games ever.\nThis game offers a wide variety of different things to do, From Liberating Outposts to even hunting animals for their skins! Far Cry 3 is a delightful and harsh tropical wonderland, crawling with wildlife and threatened by the pirates and drug runners that disrupt its peace. Furthermore Far Cry 3 also has multiplayer, co-op so you can play online with friends or just play a game of deathmatch , Far Cry 3 also has a map editor where you decide what you want in your map, from where you want the animals etc...\n\nWhen i got Far Cry 3, i thought it was going to be another typical First Person Shooter game but i was wrong, Far Cry 3 adds realism to the game which actually makes you feel as if you are Jason Brody yourself. Far Cry 3 is a game i would definitely recommend to people who love fps games but  WARNING: THIS GAME HAS ANIMAL ABUSE SO IF YOU ARE A ANIMAL LOVER THEN THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU . I would give Far Cry 3 a 10/10 for many reasons, one of them being the graphics which is just out of this world and the characters are well created especially Vaas who is my favourite character in the game simply because of his humour. To the people who do not own this game or don't have the sufficient funds for it, wait for the sales to come around then Far Cry 3 will drop prices massively and that's when you can get it but if you do not own this game, you are really missing out.\n\nWhat i don't like about this game are the constant notifications and reminders. These are so frequent, and so annoying, like if i am roaming around, nearly every 10 seconds a notification pops up on the top corner of the screen about the objective which can get a bit annoying but that is all that i have against this beautiful open world fps game.","March 12, 2014","true","21.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Huge islands to explore with just too many sidequests. You can just run/drive/fly around and do nothing or you can; hunt animals, craft items, free settlements, find relics and other secrets, take over radio towers, do some trials and a whole lot of other activities and (side)quests. It's seemingly endless and completing the entire game will take you probably well over 50 hours. Now that's some value right there.\n\nThe graphics are just gorgeous, no matter what settings you use. You can't make this game look bad, you just can't. The animations and models are some of the best I've seen in a game. Wow. The same thing applies to the sounds and voice acting, which is brilliant and truly convincing.\n\nWhile doing the story and sidequests you'll earn XP to upgrade your skills. There are 3 skilltrees in total and the way you play the game is entirely up to you. The Shark skilltree will let you upgrade your assault and healing skills, while the Heron tree will help you with your sniper skills and speed and finally, the Spider tree will let you focus on your stealth and survival skills. There's no right way to play this. There are many ways to complete an objective. And that's what makes Far Cry 3 fun, but not necessarily unique.\n\nHowever, there aren't many FPS that give you this much freedom, while telling a realistic, focused, story at the same time. So I take my hat off to Ubisoft for creating this masterpiece. The commercial and critical success for this game is well deserved.\n\nLet this be a lesson - and example - for future first person shooters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/recommended/220240/","Duskspark","Duskspark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/","484 products in account","I've played about 30+ hours of Far Cry 3 on PC and another 40+ hours back on Xbox 360, meaning I've had quite some experience with the game. That being said, Far Cry 3 is probably Ubisoft's prime example of advertising and hyping without fully delivering, hence my negative review: it's far from as great as people claim it to be.\n\nThe Good:\n· Michael Mando's performance as Vaas Montenegro is very well done, simply one of the best motion capture in any game.\n· The huge island allows for hours of exploring, hunting, and doing sidemissions.\n\nThe Bad:\n· First I'm going to list what bothers me the most, and it also happens to be the thing I liked the most... Vaas. Ubisoft promoted Far Cry 3 with Vaas from the get-go; putting him in the early demo, placing him on the boxart, including a wahini-figure in the Collector's Edition... his insanity was basically the center of the game. Unfortunately, those promises weren't met. Slight spoiler warning ahead so please skip to the next point if you don't want any bits of the story given away, but Ubisoft's oh so glorious Vaas Montenegro had a combined total screentime of 15 minutes. Yep. Durning your 30+ hours, only 15 minutes will be spent looking at or listening to Vaas. It's like buying a movie ticket to go and see Fight Club just to end up watching A Good Day to Die Hard.\n· The missions are repetetive beyond believe. Save this person, do this for that guy, kill these guys. The sidemissions exist largely of racing- and huntingmissions, both equally boring after the first time. The only enjoyable mission -- spoiler warning, again -- was the one where you had to burn marijuanafield with a flamethrower to a raggae-dubstep beat. If only there were more original missions like those.\n· The character development is so unbelievable it feels parodic at times. You go from a party-going teenager to a hipster Rambo that is able to murder hundreds of experienced soldiers in a few hours.\n· There's no real reason to craft anything. Health syringes are useless if you have upgraded your manual healing skill that'll automatically heal you when you're out of syringes (by bandaging your scratched arm when you fall or pulling out a bullet when a tiger attacks you. Yeah...) Your wallet can only hold a certain amount of money, so maybe crafting a larger wallet would be usefull. But why do so if climbing all the radio towers will basically get you all the weapons for free?\n\nThe Visuals:\n· The overal graphics are very nice, from detailed textures to great lighting, but the shadows were so overdone it almost felt cartoonish.\n\nFinal verdict:\n· High expectations, even higher promises, and ultimately you get an avarage repetetive shooter. Far Cry 3 is the best example of how Ubisoft spends more time hyping and advertising than polishing what could have been a much better product. 6/10\n","July 1, 2014","false","39.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The guns feel very nice to use and there are a lot of different types to use. Enemies can shoot through thin walls which is both realistic and amazing, and cover is done really well too. If you hide behind something you can aim down the sights and you will lean out or fire over the top.\n\nScattered across the map are radio towers and enemy strongholds. Radio towers are useld like veiwpoints in Assassins Creed, where you have to go to the top and trigger an animation to be able to veiw that area on the map. Another bonus to these is that you get some really nice veiws from the top. Unlocking radio towers unlocks free weapons in stores, so you never have to pay a large amount for a gun. Enemy Strongholds can be taken out by lots of different ways, stealthily stabbing everyone, sniping all the pirates or just running in all guns blazing (which is likely to get you killed).\n\nThere are several different vehicles in the game to get you from A to B. They are really fun and feel nice to drive with a keyboard and the handling is very arcade-y. There are also 3 types of boat and handgliders scattered across the map for fun transport. Enemies and friendlies will patrol in these as well and some really fun situations can emerge where you find an enemy roadblock and try to run from it, only to be pursued by two cars filled with pirates.\n\nThe first part of the game is very survivaly as you are unequipped and have low health. Hunting and crafting are used to improve your equipment and skills are used to improve yourself, such as adding more health, not running out of stamina and being able to hold your breath under water for a lot longer.\n\nI would reccomend playing on hard or very hard difficulty otherwise the game just becomes too easy within about an hour.\n\nThe Map-\n\nThe first half of the story takes place on an absolutely stunning jungle island. It is absolutely huge and is covered with stuff to find. Temples, outposts and caves dill the map with stuff to do. The second half of the game is located on an island about a kilometre south that is made up of mountains and to me, wasn't as impressive. It was still very good but there just wasn't as much stuff on it to do but the outposts and enemies there are a lot more challenging, so that's fun.\n\nStory/Missions-\n\nThe story missions ranged form burning fields of weed with a flamethrower to shooting pirates to exploring ancient tombs in search of a treasure. The characters are really well written and the voice acting is brilliant. After completing the game there are still many side missions to do aswell as hunting activities and bounty quests. However, one of the biggest problems with the game becomes apparent during the missions, the checkpointing. Sometimes it is fine but other times you will die and be reset to 5 minutes earlier, that becomes annoying.\n\nAI-\n\nThe AI is very good, especially on the higher difficulties. They react to sounds and their dead bodies and don't just look for you for ten seconds and then stop, they will keep on searching. Also, they don't just follow paths, their movement seems very dynamic and don't patrol a small area on a repeated loop.\n\nGraphics and Sound-\n\nOn a GTX 760, intel i5 4690 3.5GHz and 8GB RAM, I get about 60FPS in 1080p and everything at ultra, apart from a few things which are at high. The game is beautiful and colourful and the FOV goes all the way up to 110, which is better than most games (ahem Skyrim).\n\nThe sound is brilliant aswell and the way enemies react to sounds feels real. If htey hear a gunshot they will search in the direction it came from to find it. All weapons have a unique sound that is very luad, like a gun should be, unlike other games where an assualt rifle sounds like a cough.\n\nOverall-\n\nThe game is amazing and really fun. The checkpointing is the only real issue I have with it but otherwise it is brilliant.\n\n\n","October 26, 2014","true","78.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Needs mods to make the gameplay more fun, but it never gets its core problems fixed.\nLacks depth, exploration is only fun for the first 2 hours. Very repetitive gameplay, in the first hour of the game you've seen 90% of the content the game has to offer. Weapons are very unsatisfying, they lack a punch and don't feel unique. Driving is awkward and you'll never drive too long before crashing your car. "RPG" mechanics are very, very shallow, there's only a "perk" tree in wich you unlock some abilities you'll rarely use, and you can unlock them all anyway. Stealth mechanics are simply bad. It's not even worth mention the "survival" mechanics and the gathering wich is just a chore to make the game feel longer instead of just letting you buy more ammo space and such.\nAnd don't get me started on the story.\nIf you are looking for an open-world FPS with some RPG mechanics play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. instead.","February 28","false","11.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The vehicles are varied and feel satisfying to drive.\n\nThe Co-op multiplayer, however, is completely different to the hunting-survival-like single player.\nCo-op gameplay reminds me of Left 4 Dead (but without the zombies). You and 3 friends run and gun your way through set paths blasting and shooting absolutely everything in your way. There are even mini-games where you compete against your friends to get the most points.\nIt's a bit different from the single player, and can provide a breath of fresh air if you are bored of sneaking around in the bushes stalking a tiger in order to craft a larger wallet or whatever.\n\nThe Versus multiplayer is like any other first person multiplayer game- not much to say here apart from there are some playlists which include custom maps made by the community which is a nice addition. (did I forget to mention there's a level editor included with the game?!)\n\nOverall, a brilliant game that can fill all your first-person shooter desires.\nThere are some mods online which can tweak your single-player experience to make it more realistic and emphasise the survival aspect of the game, as well as make the weapons more realistic (ie: more deadly).","March 23, 2014","true","56.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alex_The_Great/recommended/220240/","Alex_The_Great","Camouflaged Cow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alex_The_Great/","729 products in account","(Scroll down for Pros and Cons) 82 hours and one of my most played games on Steam (I have over 220), it is amazing. Far Cry 4 will be similar, and I know everything about it so far. If you like FPS, adventure, open-world, fun, b00bs, guns, parties, Co-Op (unfortunately not open-world, but WILL be in 4), and games worth your money, you found the right one!\n\nPros:\n-The enviroment. A huge map and probably my favorite open-world game, ever! The second part of the map opens after half way through the game. While the enviroment isn't as detailed as Far Cry 4's will be, it's still an amazing treat.\n-The graphics. They look the best for 2012. 'Nuf said.\n-The characters. Interesting and awesome (especially Vaas, in my top 3 favorite villians of all time) and a story that will keep you interested even after the game is over!\n-The weapons and cars. While there is no flyable helicopters (Which there will be one in Far Cry 4 called the Gyrocopter), the cars are varied with random encounters with Pirates (Grunts) down the street. The boats are awesome and that comes to our next pro.\n-Hunting and Scavenging. In Far Cry 3 you can hunt animals (don't worry, they're virtual and not real) and pick flowers. With animals, you can make upgrades, like more holsters for guns, ammo pouches, and sick stuff. With picking flowers, you can make "medicene" (drugs) which boost things in combat, hunting, and health.\n-Co-op and Multiplayer. They didn't stop with the Singleplayer, and it still would have been an amazing game, just look at my hours! (86+ hours) Unfortunately, the Co-op is linear but a nice touch, and the Multiplayer isn't just stapled on. They have a cool decoding system and Battle Cries, which are very helpful. It gives a lot more teamwork than Call of Duty ever would.\n-B00bs. You probably say Nudity on the Rating, but how could I not put this in? Seriously?\n-$30.00. You've got to pick up this game for that price, no matter what kind of gamer you are!\n-Mini-games. From Throwing Knives to hunting Legendary Animals, there is some Minigame for you!\n\nCons:\n-No Open-World Co-op. There will be Open-World Co-op in Far Cry 4, which I can't wait for. My biggest con.\n-The enviroments are a little empty in some places, which it will be fixed in Far Cry 4.\n-No Elephants or the Gyrocopter, until Far Cry 4.\n-No worth-while DLC. (Besides Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and for $15.00 you should pick up if you like this game!)\n-When it ends. Great choices at the end you can pick from and I loved the game.\n\nRating (Non-Bias):\n9.5/10-Bad-A$$ Seal of Approval (Even Angry Joe gave it one and a 9/10!)\nRating for Hardcore Far Cry Fans:\n9.8/10-Bad-A$$ Seal of Approval (Even Angry Joe gave it one and a 9/10!)\nThey're just missing the Open-World Co-op with a friend.\n\nP.S: You might recognize me, that's because I currently have the 8th most Top Rated Guide of Far Cry 3 (It's called "Far Cry 3 Ultimate Guide")! I'm so glad the community could be there all these years to meet that goal! I am accepting requests to add things to the Ultimate guide.","October 25, 2014","true","92.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The atmosphere and the vibrancy of the island you have at your disposal is such a wonderful contrast to most games with the First-Person Shooter classification. One of the most compelling parts of the Far Cry formula is the freedom to approach a situation in whatever way you can dream up. As a fan of stealth games, my mindset was to wipe out an entire enemy force and either make it look like a tragic accident or a nightmarish ninja slaughter. Another aspect that oddly sticks out in my mind is the guns; they all sound unbelievably real and deadly. I’m not sure how they crafted the sound effects for gun fire but they nailed it in Far Cry 3.\n\nSo again, my best summary of Far Cry 3 is still “very relevant”. It is a fantastic open world, first-person, sandbox shooter with light RPG elements and I highly recommend everyone pick it up while it’s cheap!","November 24, 2014","true","43.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The atmosphere and the vibrancy of the island you have at your disposal is such a wonderful contrast to most games with the First-Person Shooter classification. One of the most compelling parts of the Far Cry formula is the freedom to approach a situation in whatever way you can dream up. As a fan of stealth games, my mindset was to wipe out an entire enemy force and either make it look like a tragic accident or a nightmarish ninja slaughter. Another aspect that oddly sticks out in my mind is the guns; they all sound unbelievably real and deadly. I’m not sure how they crafted the sound effects for gun fire but they nailed it in Far Cry 3.\n\nSo again, my best summary of Far Cry 3 is still “very relevant”. It is a fantastic open world, first-person, sandbox shooter with light RPG elements and I highly recommend everyone pick it up while it’s cheap!","November 24, 2014","true","43.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm playing the hell out of Far Cry 3 and really enjoying it, but holy ♥♥♥♥, it's completely indefensible. A real shame, because the game is really fun and well designed.\n\nProblematic themes and depictions include:\n\nA raging case of Last Samurai Syndrome. A white man comes to an exotic foreign world and is quickly adopted by the oppressed natives not only into their culture but as their savior, despite the fact that he knows nothing about their environment and has no applicable skills. We're supposedly a tribe of island warriors who've been living here since time immemorial but only you can save us, scrawny Californian douchebro who's never handled a gun before!\n\nAs such, the Rakyat can't do anything for themselves. Only Whitey Samurai has any kind of power in deciding how the Rakyat fight for freedom. After the heroic white boy singlehandedly liberates an enemy outpost, a half dozen Rakyat warriors show up in jeeps to secure his conquest, AK47s at the ready, but they're only there for atmosphere. They're unable to take outposts themselves or even help the hero out. I know that having the player be the only being in the world with agency is a convention of open world games going back farther than GTA, but it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ed that these people literally have to wait around for the white hero to save them.\n\nCitra. The spiritual leader of the Rakyat is a colonial fantasy straight out of Victorian pulp fiction, the hypersexual female native drawn to the white savior, despite being surrounded at all times by hunky warriors from her own culture. Weirdly, she doesn't even look like she's the same ethnicity as the other Rakyat, who are supposedly... Polynesian? (The game never says exactly where Rook Island is.) Citra is ethnically unplaceable, and definitely has more "caucasian" features than the rest of her people, presumably to maximize her sexual appeal to the game's target demographic. Also, the warrior initiation ceremony of the Rakyat involves Citra straddling you while topless and grinding on your junk. Whoops, that was a spoiler, sorry.\n\nDennis. At the beginning of the story, the white hero is rescued and guided by a magical negro witch doctor. Dennis has been adopted by the Rakyat years before, but is not worthy to be their savior himself. He can only assist our white hero, despite being depicted as much more competent and experienced.\n\nThere are two enemy factions, the savage bloodthirsty "Pirates" and the professional mercenary "Privateers". The disorganized and drug-addled Pirates are all Afro-Caribbean, while the much more competent Privateers are (mostly white) Americans.\n\nThe main bad guy is a white South African who is of course depicted as a genocidal monster. Poor Afrikaners, no other ethnic group is so easy to demonize in video games and action movies. It's not their fault that their accent makes them all sound like Bond villains.\n\nIn conclusion, buy it cheap during a Steam sale, enjoy exploring the gorgeous world, the awesome stealth killing mechanics, and the wide variety of customizable guns, and shake your head at the tone-deaf racism.","January 5, 2015","true","50.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/220240/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","Far Cry 3 is beyond any doubt an amazing game and an experience that mustn't be missed, even with it's flaws.\nThe graphics, ambience and voice acting are all amazing and makes this game one of the most asthetically pleasing titles in recent years, however as a result Far Cry 3 is pretty demanding in the hardware department. So make sure your gear is up to speed and optimize it for maximum performance.\nThe gameplay has been referred to in the past as "Skyrim with guns". This is true, Far Cry 3 puts the player in the heart of a tropical paradise plagued with drug-running pirates and gives them the opportunity to go about as they please: Exploring areas, fighting off skirmishes and collecting items. However unlike Skyrim the primary story isn't completely optional, with constant reminders appearing on your screen to go here or do that while out experiencing the island for yourself makes you feel like a dog in an off-lease park; yes you are free in a sense but you're still not in total control of your experience.\nTo further add the sensation of "freedom with boundaries", Far Cry 3's story is very restrictive in comparison with the exploration. During a mission you are forced to use this one specific weapon, drive this one specific vehicle, do this objective in precisely this particular way, go here within the alloted time; the list goes on. Adding unpredictable restrictions to the story makes the player feel like a ball and chain has been shackled to their ankle, which does no favors to the overall experience of the game. However, when you are allowed to play your way, Far Cry 3 really shines through. Plotting out ambushes on fortified outposts or joyriding across the island running over whatever gets in your way is a blast through-and-through, made even better by a large variety of destructive weaponry ranging from grenade launchers, RPGs and even flamethrowers.\nThe story of Far Cry 3 is simple, you take on the role of Jason Brody, a rich white boy who loves hair product. While you and your friends are on a drunken binge in exotic places you're all kidnapped by a band of pirates looking to ransom you and then sell you off to slavery. Jason manages to escape and begins his adventure to rescue his friends and kill the bad guy and get the girl. To be frank, the story isn't all that great. Jason Brody and all his friends are shallow and dislikeable, and I'd much rather shoot them all in the mouth than risk my life to save them. In contrast, antagonists in the game are interesting and imaginative and save Far Cry 3's story from being dullard. Vaas Montenegro, the most well established villian is similar to the Joker from Batman: Arkham Asylum, he's psychotic, unpredictable, imaginative and fun to watch.\nFar Cry 3's combat is split into two categories: Stealth and shoot-em-up, and both are well-made and flow well into eachother as the situation requires. Jumping into foliage when not in combat makes it so enemies cannot see you, allowing you to plan out your attacks or to play venus fly trap and lure them to you by throwing rocks before jumping out and puncturing them with a knife takedown. The takedowns are a very satisfying insta-kill against unarmored enemies (and can be used against heavy foes later in the game after acquiring a perk) so long as you take them by suprise, and with unlockable perks takedowns become even more versatile and deadly by either pulling the pin off a grenade of the freshly deceased or going for multi chain stabs. On the other side of the combat spectrum the guns and shooting mechanics are satisfying and have a good healthy punch to them.\nUnfortunately the combat indulges in one of video game design's bad habits, Quick-Time Events, prominently when fighting carniferous wildlife like aligators and sharks. You're swimming across a river when SURPRISE GATOR SEX comes up, then you're given half a second to mash a specific button before you die. QTEs are a bad mechanic in video games and while they're not too prominent in Far Cry 3 they still feel unecessary on the whole. Finally the worst part of the combat is the battles against the main antagonists like Vaas or Buck, both of them being such hostile albeit savourably enjoyable characters you'd think the fight would be memorable, right? Wrong. When fighting them the game designers decide to put you and your foe into a sort of drug-trip combat sequence that makes no sense and is incongruious to the rest of the game, followed by a series of QTEs taking control away from you for the sake of trying to make the encounter more cinematic. This resulted in final struggles that were disappointing and left a very sour aftertaste.\n\nSo in all, Far Cry 3 is a game with flaws, but they don't drag it all the way down. Far Cry 3 is fun, addicting and worth the time (especially if you got it while it's on sale). I suggest you look past it's flaws and let the overall experience take you in.\n\nAlso before I close off I need to mention: Far Cry 3 also has an online multiplayer, which only exists for the purpose of having an online multiplayer. It's unimaginative deathmatch and is not anything special.","January 2, 2014","true","44.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","8"

Definitely recommend it, but I think you already knew that because EVERYbody loves this one.","November 13, 2014","true","41.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Seriously, other open-world games do not even come close to this, yeah, GTA is the most popular because of its diversity and gameplay, but the survival and adventure feel of Far Cry 3 tops most other gaming experiences I've ever had. Alike other games, this also comes with a fair amount of bugs or mechanics that could be improved on - like the steam overlay bugging out as seen in my screenshots, or when skinning an animal you're really just skinning the floor. But in my opinion with the gameplay and emotion that comes with this game, I can totally forgive every single one of its small errors. If you have the money, don't hesitate for a second to buy this game. I'd give a 9/10 in terms of gameplay, graphics and content.","March 5, 2014","true","62.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Actually, it's really good.\n\nThe story goes where your friends, brothers and you go on an exotic, adventurous vacation. What they didn't saw coming was that you all would be captured by swashbuckling pirates who want to sell you for ransom money. That is certainly not what the brochure said...\nYou manage to escape and you have to find and safe your friends and brother.\nAll in all, it's pretty good but it has some flaws of which mostly: Character Progression.\n\nThe game starts as you, scared and unexperienced. Never killed a man before but the moment you get a weapon in your hands, the main character goes pretty much berserk. While it is understandable that you can't limit the skills of the player, the story doesn't make this progression better and soon you will be the Berserker Warlord of the Jungle.\nIt has potential but it goes just a bit too fast to believe it.\n\nGameplay feels smooth and feels right. From the firefights to the stealth, nothing to really complain there.\nThere really is a bunch to do and terrain to see and it looks damn good.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with Far Cry 3 is that the Field of View returns to default in cutscenes, making it look like every character is invading your personal space.\n\nAll in all, a beautiful game with a name story and lots of things to do!","December 1, 2014","true","26.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The islands are pretty damn well made and there has been time and effort spent in building a believable backstory, history and culture for the Rook Islands.\nThe game running and shooting mechanics are also pretty good, where you won't instantly shoot if you are running and switching between weapons feels believable, along with the sliding mechanics which are worth a mention. There are also a nice amount of weapons to choose and unlock from. The enemies are also nice and varied and can pose a challenge if you stay exposed too  much.\nThe story itself is not bad, but maybe it is me, I just felt I expected what would happen before they happened and found most story elements too predictable. Another thing which actually ended up bugging me is that throughout my game session I probably killed enough tigers to have reduced the overall worldwide tiger population by a wide percentage margin. Tigers, leopards and bears you encounter should in my opinion have been more rarer. And bull-sharks are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I happily rammed them with my jet skis whenever I could.\nI also feel the Skills system was very redundant in many places, with abilities that were hardly useful, but also some which should have been unlockable earlier (You unlock your skills three times throughout the story, having one set of skills available in beginning, another set further in and then last set of skills a good way into the game).\n\nI would still recommend the game, as it is quite fun and if you spot it at bargain price, get it. I would advice though that while it is Steam, it will start up Uplay, but not been that much a hassle really.","March 10, 2014","true","80.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Seriously if you are one those burned out players that played FarCry 2.

These are the positives: responsive controls with customizable keyboard configuration that actually works (funny that I have to call that out, but many games execute this poorly), good graphics, and a large, often interesting area to explore. If that's enough for your gaming experience, then this is the game for you. If you like multiplayer, also, this is a great setting. However...\n\nIf you want a good single-player game, unfortunately, Far Cry 3 also has these things that I have to put in the negative column: really, really annoying major and minor characters (including the main character Jason, who must be the all-time worst ever created for a shooter - bad, whiny voice acting combined with no redeeming values), an awkward game interface for controlling inventory and crafting (obviously designed entirely for clunky consoles), endless messages popping up on the screen to tell you things that you already know or don't care about, poorly executed "big game hunting" that is both cartoonish and annoying, and worst of all: every major villain must be dealt with in some kind of "alternate-reality" setting that seems to be happening in the unlit hallways at Ubisoft. Note to game designers: every time you move someone abruptly out of the game world you have been carefully creating for them for the last dozen hours, you ruin the immersive experience. Boss fight with Vaas? Lame. Boss fight with the weird Australian guy? Lame. Boss fight with Hoyt? Lame. Boss fight with the giant island demon thingy? WTF? Lame.\n\nHalf-way into this game I absolutely lost any interest at all in how it would turn out and finished it entirely so I could expunge my disappointment by shooting a few more pirates.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/220240/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","Far Cry 3 is beyond any doubt an amazing game and an experience that mustn't be missed, even with it's flaws.\nThe graphics, ambience and voice acting are all amazing and makes this game one of the most asthetically pleasing titles in recent years, however as a result Far Cry 3 is pretty demanding in the hardware department. So make sure your gear is up to speed and optimize it for maximum performance.\nThe gameplay has been referred to in the past as "Skyrim with guns". This is true, Far Cry 3 puts the player in the heart of a tropical paradise plagued with drug-running pirates and gives them the opportunity to go about as they please: Exploring areas, fighting off skirmishes and collecting items. However unlike Skyrim the primary story isn't completely optional, with constant reminders appearing on your screen to go here or do that while out experiencing the island for yourself makes you feel like a dog in an off-lease park; yes you are free in a sense but you're still not in total control of your experience.\nTo further add the sensation of "freedom with boundaries", Far Cry 3's story is very restrictive in comparison with the exploration. During a mission you are forced to use this one specific weapon, drive this one specific vehicle, do this objective in precisely this particular way, go here within the alloted time; the list goes on. Adding unpredictable restrictions to the story makes the player feel like a ball and chain has been shackled to their ankle, which does no favors to the overall experience of the game. However, when you are allowed to play your way, Far Cry 3 really shines through. Plotting out ambushes on fortified outposts or joyriding across the island running over whatever gets in your way is a blast through-and-through, made even better by a large variety of destructive weaponry ranging from grenade launchers, RPGs and even flamethrowers.\nThe story of Far Cry 3 is simple, you take on the role of Jason Brody, a rich white boy who loves hair product. While you and your friends are on a drunken binge in exotic places you're all kidnapped by a band of pirates looking to ransom you and then sell you off to slavery. Jason manages to escape and begins his adventure to rescue his friends and kill the bad guy and get the girl. To be frank, the story isn't all that great. Jason Brody and all his friends are shallow and dislikeable, and I'd much rather shoot them all in the mouth than risk my life to save them. In contrast, antagonists in the game are interesting and imaginative and save Far Cry 3's story from being dullard. Vaas Montenegro, the most well established villian is similar to the Joker from Batman: Arkham Asylum, he's psychotic, unpredictable, imaginative and fun to watch.\nFar Cry 3's combat is split into two categories: Stealth and shoot-em-up, and both are well-made and flow well into eachother as the situation requires. Jumping into foliage when not in combat makes it so enemies cannot see you, allowing you to plan out your attacks or to play venus fly trap and lure them to you by throwing rocks before jumping out and puncturing them with a knife takedown. The takedowns are a very satisfying insta-kill against unarmored enemies (and can be used against heavy foes later in the game after acquiring a perk) so long as you take them by suprise, and with unlockable perks takedowns become even more versatile and deadly by either pulling the pin off a grenade of the freshly deceased or going for multi chain stabs. On the other side of the combat spectrum the guns and shooting mechanics are satisfying and have a good healthy punch to them.\nUnfortunately the combat indulges in one of video game design's bad habits, Quick-Time Events, prominently when fighting carniferous wildlife like aligators and sharks. You're swimming across a river when SURPRISE GATOR SEX comes up, then you're given half a second to mash a specific button before you die. QTEs are a bad mechanic in video games and while they're not too prominent in Far Cry 3 they still feel unecessary on the whole. Finally the worst part of the combat is the battles against the main antagonists like Vaas or Buck, both of them being such hostile albeit savourably enjoyable characters you'd think the fight would be memorable, right? Wrong. When fighting them the game designers decide to put you and your foe into a sort of drug-trip combat sequence that makes no sense and is incongruious to the rest of the game, followed by a series of QTEs taking control away from you for the sake of trying to make the encounter more cinematic. This resulted in final struggles that were disappointing and left a very sour aftertaste.\n\nSo in all, Far Cry 3 is a game with flaws, but they don't drag it all the way down. Far Cry 3 is fun, addicting and worth the time (especially if you got it while it's on sale). I suggest you look past it's flaws and let the overall experience take you in.\n\nAlso before I close off I need to mention: Far Cry 3 also has an online multiplayer, which only exists for the purpose of having an online multiplayer. It's unimaginative deathmatch and is not anything special.","January 2, 2014","true","44.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddlagarry/recommended/220240/","ddlagarry","CinderellaMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddlagarry/","724 products in account","Far Cry 3 succeeds like its predecessors in providing an open world action / thriller set in a tropical climate.  Like similar games such as GTA and Batman: AC, the current objective is shown on the map... there are side missions and mini-games that can be unlocked and played at will.  Portions of the map details are hidden until radio towers are "unlocked" by scaling them and sabotaging the fuse box.  Weapons and skills are steadily unlocked as progress is made in both the main story line, collecting hidden treasures, and completing various other tasks.  Thrown in for good measure are hunting and crafting, and a completely separate and very challenging co-op campaign.\n\nOn the plus side:\n> The world is beautiful and nicely detailed.\n> The story is quite good and features one of the best antagonists in any video game I have ever played.\n> The weapons look, feel, and sound excellent.\n> The stronghold raids and "kill nasty dude x" side missions are the meat of the game and very entertaining, with many ways to approach them\n> The takedown skills are challenging to apply and fun when they work.\n> An excellent PC port with all the graphical and control flourish we expect.\n\nOn the negative side:\n> The game ramps up too quickly... I found myself proceeding at a reasonable pace, and by act 2 I was becoming overpowered... this along with another mechanic in act 2 makes the second act seem anti-climactic.\n> On the same vein, the first act Boss feels more threatening than the second.  He also was such a good character I was disappointed that he was dead.  Can he have his own game, please?\n> The native peoples character models are too similar.\n> The world does not feel "lived in"... it feels more like an action game set piece.  There is also very little variation in the game world.\n> There is very little incentive to continue exploring after the game ends.\n\nThe co-op campaign is very difficult... you will want at least 3 players for that.  I bought the game on sale on steam for $5... was it worth it? Yes absolutely.  I would say $20 is reasonable for this since I got nearly 40 hours of entertainment out of it.\n\n8/10\n","July 14, 2014","true","110.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/severityone/recommended/220240/","severityone","Severity One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/severityone/","183 products in account","Like Far Cry (and not so much like the somewhat disappointing Far Cry 2), Far Cry 3 is a stunningly beautiful game. It's also loads of fun to roam around, do crazy things, blow stuff up, kill people and endangered species. The side quests are fun, too, and generally satisfying.\n\nThe weak point of the game is really the story and the main quest line. I read an article where the story writer argued that those criticising the story hadn't understood it. Well, if you need to explain the story, it wasn't told very well to begin with. What's left is posturing, trying to defend poor storytelling abilities.\n\nThere are games that tell their stories very well; Valve are particularly good at that, starting with Half-Life. GTA4 is another example, where you know that Niko Belic did some pretty bad things back in former Yugoslavia, but it never becomes specfic, and it doesn't need to be.\n\nThen, there are other issues that take away from the fun. The game occassonally crashes, and if you're in the middle of a long mission, well, though. You'll have to start all over again. It happened to me at least five times.\n\nCut scenes cannot be skipped. There are a couple of examples where it's quite easy to die, and every time you have to watch the same boring cut scene again. And again. And again.\n\nWhich brings me to dream sequences. For some obscure reason, some game publishers are under the illusion that dream sequences are cool. They're not. They suck very, very much.\n\nSome parts of the game are very dark, even with brightness and gamma all the way up. I need a bit more light than the average gamer, but I just can't crank it up enough to see everything. Maybe if I had a super bright TN screen, but no, it's eIPS. And other games don't have the same issue.\n\nFinally, a dishonourable mention goes to Uplay, the Ubisoft launcher that you get without asking for it. Whatever the idea behind this piece of annoyware is escapes me. Maybe they're trying to create some sort of brand loyalty; they achieve exactly the opposite. Steam serves me just fine. I don't need another layer.\n\nSo, would I recommend this game? In a word, yes, as long as you get it on special offer. It cannot be stressed enough how gorgeous it looks (as long as you're outside at least), and there are so many fun things to do. The weak story is something you have to accept as part of the package.","July 28, 2014","true","107.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jawzpro/recommended/220240/","Jawzpro","Jerry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jawzpro/","249 products in account","Far Cry 3 was described as 'Skyrim with guns'. Despite the immediate similarities with Skyrim, I'm afraid this is totally not the case and Far Cry can stand on it's own as a game set on such an island. The Far Cry 2 engine can clearly be seen at work here despite the fact that it is updated and there are new animations that make the experience feel a whole lot better. The great things about Far Cry 3 remain its excellent shooting mechanics and driving, the gameplay really sells the game itself as it is a joy to actually shoot a gun and kill people within Far Cry. Each gun feels very responsive and though it could use some tweaking, the actual gunplay is quite rewarding and fun, making you feel like a rising killer within the game. The story however is a total let down within this game. I found the main character, Jason to be quite annoying and unlikeable really and part of this was due to the poor voice acting of his character in comparison to many of the supporting characters such as Vaas, Buck and Willis. Vaas' performance was incredible and made me really like him as an antagonist within the game and he truly was as frightening and crazy as I hoped upon seeing the trailer for the game. Despite the fact that the story was a let down and really wasn't very clear, it does have decent character development as Jason (whom never shot a gun before) starts to like killing and murdering people. I actually felt as if I was this character and due to the excellent shooting within the game, I also started to like killing people within the game.\n\nThe island itself is very diverse and has a variety of different landscapes and areas to explore even after completing the main game. The multiplayer, I hadn't really delved into so much though I'm sure it would be as generic as many of the other first person shooters.\n\nOverall, I would give Far Cry 3 a 7/10","July 10, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Be it animals running around, predators trying to eat you, random ♥♥♥♥ exploding, or pirates trying to murder you, this game always has something for you to do. As far as FPSRPG's go, I think this has some of the best gunplay I've experienced for a while. It feels impactful, and the gun sound assests make it sound that way as well. That being said sometimes powerful animals/enemies in the game can feel a little bullet spongy, which isn't really something I liked. The side-quests can get quite boring and  are mostly monotonous busy-work, though it can be made up for a by the plethora of side activies and challenges you are able to do. (i.e. poker, shooting challenges, races, or capturing outposts)\n\nIn short, the world is great to run around in, the combat is satisfying, and the story is great (whether you take it literally, or put your own philosophical theory to it).

I purchased this guy on release ($80) it was worth it I sat down for a weekend and aimed to play right through it and finish it. It was a challenge but I did it. Overall the game was great. However the looting gets old real fast. However the crafting system added into the game is amazing. you basically craft items to hold more stuff which makes perfect sense. You need to hunt animals and mix certian parts to create these parts. it is extremely well polished and fun. Kinda like a FPS Skyrim without all the bugs. I had a blast it was a very good improvement since their last game FC2 which was repetitive until you wanted to kill yourself. Try it out, probably not at its full price but it’s a good investment of time. It does get a bit linear in SP missions, but ill recommend playing multiplayer its heaps of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexY-BlacKy/recommended/220240/","SexY-BlacKy","BlacKy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexY-BlacKy/","72 products in account","Great game!\n9/10 in the BlacKy scale.\n\nThe good:\n\n* Story starts great (no spoiler): A group of rich kids went for a vacation on an exotic island (or a group of islands if u'd like) to have fun, but then gets kidnapped by pirates. You free yourself and get help from local villagers to free your friends and take the kidnappers down.\n\n* Island looks amazing. Overall graphics is very up to date.\n\n* Exploring the island is very fun (whoever liked Red Faction Guerrilla's enviroment will like this aswell). Many side quests to do. Having a bunch of items to find (just like the classic hidden boxes from the GTA series). Driving a vehicle makes you feel as you're inside the game. You can actually feel bumps on the road.\n\n* The wildlife is very nice. Many exotic animals to encounter. Animal's AI is well done overall.\n\n* The more you advance in the game, enemies get thougher.\n\n* Customizable weapons. Need i say more?\n\n* Co-op is pretty fun when its not crashing.\n\n* You get to cheat on your gf with an amazonian nympho.\n\nThe bad:\n\n* Story ends bad, in my opinion: I'll do my best not to spoil - When having the chance to get out of the island with all your friends, you take the other option, revenge, staying behind and killing those who have kidnapped you and your friends.\n\n* Enemies AI is a bit poor. They sometimes suspect that something is wrong but they dont tend to do much about it, even if they're defending an outpost, etc.\n\n* I've found all the syringes except health syringes to be unnecessary to use. No need to dive too much underwater so water syringe is irrelevant. The camera's ability to tag enemies and animals makes the hunter syringe to be irrelevant aswell. You can extinguish fire when you're on fire so fireproof syringes are, again, irrelevant.\n\n* Your health is too OP. You can make up to 10 health packs while also carrying impossible amount of crafting materials to make even more health syringes if you'll need to use later. After getting enough progressed in the game, you have constantly infinite amount of health which makes everything boring and less exciting.\n\n* The skill tree isn't as good as other games, E.G Borderlands franchise. You will eventually unlock all the skills in the game, which makes it unnecessary to think 'which skill am i going to unlock next?'. Some of the skills have absolutely no value in the game so you may think that even if you have free skill points to spare, you wouldn't pick that specific skill.\n\n* While the crafting option itself is very well made. Everything craftable in the game gets unlocked after ~50% of game time (finishing the north island), so you wont be needing to kill animals for hides at the second island at all if you have explored the first island effectively enough.\n\n* Activating radio towers makes the game very easy. Too easy i might say. Weapons will become free in weapon shops, ammo gets very cheap, and you get the sense that money isnt a factor anymore. If you like a bit of a challenge, dont do what i did, which was unlocking most of the radio towers before making the quests. Try exploring everything at once:\n\n- Do a few missions.\n- Do a few side missions.\n- Explore the island as you can: Find some artifacts / SD cards / letters / etc.\n- Unlock some radio towers and outposts.\n- Repeat\n\n* uPlay - Sadly this game runs by uPlay, which means constantly-crashing servers in multiplayer and co-op, no Steam achievements, and no real option to search for specific servers like in normal Valve servers via Steam.\nMultiplayer and co-op have no skill filter. A level 1 noob will often join a group of level 75's (highest level).\n\nThe ugly:\n\n* Vaas\n\nOverall:\n\nI admit i was 'letting myself go' on the bad stuff. But when you play the game, you will realize the good compensates the bad in many ways. Very enjoyable game. Open world FTW!\nJust dont count on the MP / Co-op to be enjoyable. Because of the above circumstances, its not.","June 22, 2014","true","42.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love roaming around the jungle, gathering plants for potions, hunting animals for their skins and upgrading my equipment and killing mad baddies. I love activating the radio towers for more weapons and to reveal more of the map and I love trying to unlock the signature weapons. I enjoy that the collectibles that aren't impossible to find, but that's not my thing really. If you enjoy them, you'll like this game. The gun's are awesome, and for once, the melee isn't useless if you know when to use it! I played this game through on hard and the difficulty was perfect for me, as I died multiple times, but still felt like I was making progess. Except some times when it throws you back 5-10 minutes on a really hard mission multiple times, but fortunately this is very rare.\nNow the story on the other hand is very basic, and after about 2/3 through the game it get's dreadfully boring. You'll see why. But if there is one thing I love about the story it's one character. The character who single-handedly saves this game's story. Vaas, the main villain, a maniac pirate who loves to tell you the meaning of insanity. Sadly the other characters are boring or just plain annoying (except for Dennis, he cool mang.) This game's advertised as a game that breaks the rules of story-telling games' cliches, but honestly it follows many of them. Except every once in a while it throws some crazy-♥♥♥ riddles at you that go away so quickly you don't even have time to think them through. And the ending, in my opiniion, is the worst thing since Shaquille O'Neal's acting career, but some people think it's fine.\nEven after that rant I still enjoyed this game a lot, and you can see I played it as a single-player game even though it has a multiplayer aspect to it. So if you're into that, this game has it too!\nI'll give this game a 8/10 for it's amazing gameplay and Vaas.","March 7, 2014","true","23.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Seriously, other open-world games do not even come close to this, yeah, GTA is the most popular because of its diversity and gameplay, but the survival and adventure feel of Far Cry 3 tops most other gaming experiences I've ever had. Alike other games, this also comes with a fair amount of bugs or mechanics that could be improved on - like the steam overlay bugging out as seen in my screenshots, or when skinning an animal you're really just skinning the floor. But in my opinion with the gameplay and emotion that comes with this game, I can totally forgive every single one of its small errors.

The hunting was lackluster and was often inturupted by random encounters which ruined them entirely and cost me to lose my quarry. On top of that, the gunplay I found surprisingly boring and unsatisfying. Furthermore most interactions between characters did little more than frustrate me.","November 30, 2014","false","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The issue? The multiplayer is so broken that it could take you literally an hour to find a game, and after one game, Farcry 3 will crash. After every multiplayer game. This is because Ubisoft chooses to not have dedicated servers and make people play through their service called uPlay. You can't play with steam friends. You have to add your friends on uPlay. You don't get steam achievements, you get uPlay achievements. uPlay is literally the dumbest thing ever and Ubisoft should be ashamed of themselves for releasing Farcry 3 and not EVER fixing the multiplayer crashes and bugs. I'm not the only one who experiences this, almost every player who plays on direct x11 will deal with it. A small number of people can play fine with Direct 9x but why limit yourself so much graphical degration for a game you payed for that should of been COMPLETE. I'm never buying another Ubisoft game again. They lost my buisness and i highly reccommend you not buy any Ubisoft games if your interested in playing any Multiplayer. They've also been known to intentionally degrade graphics on PC on some of their games to make it look more like the console versions. (Watch Dogs for example) Thumbs up my review, let people know before they buy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordshadowz/recommended/220240/","lordshadowz","Lord Shadow Z","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordshadowz/","160 products in account","This was the game of the series that I had heard the most about from reading reviews and whatnot. This is the first game where I’ve actually found real enjoyment from playing it and I’m so glad that most of my biggest issues with Far Cry 2 were extinct when I played this one. For once, I’ll actually be talking about how good the game is and just not relentlessly bash it.\n\nIn this game, your character Jason Brody and his friends were on vacation and after skydiving over a random island get captured by natives/slavers. You escape and have to explore the island, rescue your friends, and help the natives, the Rakyat, deal with pirates. It’s a simple premise, but it definitely works. The island is beautiful. This is by far the best looking game in the series so far. It’s exciting to wander around seeing all the various plant life, the waterfalls, and everything else the island has to offer. It’s a gorgeous game.\n\nThis is once again an open world shooter, which means you can approach missions however you like. Once the game finally gave me a sniper rifle with a silencer attachment, I was unstoppable. There are outposts you can clear of pirates all over the island, and for me, all I would do is snipe all of them and go undetected most of the time. Unlike the previous game, when you clear out an outpost, the Rakyat warriors move in and hold the outpost, and there will be fewer to no pirates spawning in the area ever again. This was one of my top 2 problems in Far Cry 2 eradicated. Awesome.\n\nThe wildlife…what can I say? There’s a variety of wildlife that you can hunt, or be hunted by, for you to collect pelts to craft upgrades. The crafting system is pretty good, letting you create things to restore health, enhance senses to detect enemies or wildlife, increase ammo capacity, or carry more money. As for the wildlife, there’s goats and deer, as well as more exotic creatures like komodo dragons and tigers. Tigers are really annoying to deal with if you run into them a lot early in the game like I did, but it keeps you on your toes and keeps your twitchy trigger finger happy. If you feel slightly less adventurous, you can just hit the animals with a vehicle. This was the best method I found to reliably kill skarks, using the propeller blades of the boat to decimate them. I ended up getting most of my upgrades done pretty early in the story.\n\nThere’s a couple types of side missions you can do, such as hunting rare animals, knife assassination missions, types of racing missions, and various others which I haven’t really tried. Aside from the hunting the rare animals to get all the best upgrades, I didn’t really bother with doing other side missions because they just weren’t all that interesting to me, and I got bored of them pretty quickly.\n\nThere’s a skill system which is solid. You get xp from kills and missions and everything just as you would expect, and when you earn skill points from getting enough xp, you can put points into one of three skill trees to increase things like your survivability, how fast you can reload, boost accuracy, new types of takedowns, and all sorts of things. There are few skills I would call useless which makes deciding where to use skill points all that much harder.\n\nI think my only major problem with this game is that the stupid, inhumanly smart AI from both of the previous games is back, and god is it annoying. I tend to use weapons with silencers on them so that I can stealth kill from afar. Yet when I happen to miss a shot just barely, or even when I kill someone who was near another enemy, they know exactly where to look for me somehow. How? Do they just happen to automatically know the bullet trajectory? It makes sniping a little bit harder, and on one particular outpost, clearing it out this way was just impossible, and I had to clear out waves of reinforcements before finally claiming it for the Rakyat. Also, AI pixel perfect accuracy is still bull.\n\nFar Cry 3 is the game that finally gets me to genuinely like the series. The only real frustration I had was caused mostly by my own incompetence rather than bad game design, which is definitely good. It improves upon everything that made the previous two games unique and/or good, and for me at least, finally made the game enjoyable. Everything is better, the wildlife is a unique challenge at times, the story is interesting, and the game is just gorgeous.\n\nTL;DR Best game in the series so far, with few major flaws\n\n8/10\nAwesome","January 24, 2015","true","31.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Graphically, it is very aesthetically pleasing but can be very taxing on older machines.\nGameplay-wise it mostly fluid and intuitive, with a good, solid movement system and shooting mechanics designed for fast paced but skillful shooting. However it came become a pain to quickly move in and out of vehicles and healing yourself can become a serious pain.\nFew games can claim to have a story I've given 2 half-baked waffles about but Far Cry 3 has quite a good story. With engaging charater arcs and plot twists that twist the plot for once. The story is all very tight and works well with the rest of the game.\nHowever, while I don't want to spoil the ending too much, it's one of the only parts where the game lets itself down.\nThe final mission of the game is split two ways - Flying from the enemy base in a helicopter to 'Ride of the valkyries' in an epic mounted turret section- then going through some boring tibal love drama nonsence. Then you pick if you want to be with your friends and escape or with Citra- the tribe leader. Its a sort of moral choice sequence with no moral choice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadeball/recommended/220240/","Shadeball","Shadeball","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadeball/","130 products in account","TL;DR- Far Cry 3 manages to improve on its predecessor without abandoning most of its basic mechanics. Does have a ridiculous plot that is terribly handled at the end.\n\nI had a love/hate relationship with Far Cry 2. I loved the weapons, the world, and the combat. But I hated the way the place was populated only by people who wanted to kill you on sight (except for in the closed cities). I didn't like the way enemies respawned automatically and the beautiful world was somewhat marred when I couldn't enjoy a senic boat ride without getting sniper fire, even though I'd crushed that outpost five minutes earlier. Unlocking weapons tended to be a bit tedious as well, though it was worth it to get some of the best ones. The mortar in FC2 is one of my favorite weapons in ANY game. It took patience to figure out, but once mastered it could be used to desolate an enemy encampment in dramatic fashion.\n\nFC3 keeps the nice variety of weapons, with the facepalming exception of the above-mentioned mortar. I guess it was unbalancing because of how useful it could be against outposts, but I still wish they had left it in somewhere. Vehicles are still fun, as are boats, plus handgliding is actually a bit more doable in this game- even useful when the game doesn't cheat and turn on the invisible walls for missions. Best of all, not everyone is out to kill you at all times. There are different factions in the game and only MOST want to kill you at any one time! You can actually see battles between the different factions where you can help one over the other. When you take out an enemy outpost, it stays down... unless you decide to revert them back to enemy control so you can have fun blowing them up again- a neat option by the devs to placate both sides of the 'respawning enemies' argument. Plus they've added carnivors. If you remember in FC2 they made some kind of hand-waving statement that they couldn't do that because it would wreck the simulation... or something. Well this time they said "screw it, add more tigers!" Bravo.\n\nThere are a lot of gimmicks in the game. You can blow open the cages of conveniently placed animals to screw with enemies, use hand-gliders or zip lines that just happen to be near enemy outposts, or... all sorts of other stuff that sometimes gets a little old. But there's enough variety that the fun makes up for the head-scratching about why the redshirts don't learn not to leave a man-eating tiger around the middle of their base. There are plenty of unscripted surprises (the first time a croc tries to eat you, for example... happens to everyone) and the whole thing is just a fun romp. The plot... well, I don't really care much about the plot. They botched it a bit by having the sub-enemy be more interesting than anyone else in the game, and there's a lot of trippy psycadelic fight scenes. The free-form part of the game is the draw. There are some RPG elements that really don't need to be there and don't serve much purpose, other than to seemingly check off a box on the list of things every game is supposed to have... but it's not a big deal.\n\nAlso a shame is the lack of a day-night cycle as in FC2. It worked so nicely and could have been used to great effect here with easier stealth at night and movement by day, or some other trade-off mechanic. Much of the plot is also nonsensical and a QTE torture scene is so hamfisted I had to roll my eyes when the protagonist looks at his hands afterwards. The whole plotlineis a contrived piece of garbage that could have been solved by your character or his combat-knife equipped buddy just killing the Big Bad who is sitting three feet away and jumping out a window... the same kind of thing you can do at every other part of the game that isn't a cutscene. But instead you have to wait until another QTE-ridden dream sequence... or something... to finish him off. Then have an awful on-rails sequence that, again, makes no sense and seems to be there just to annoy the player. Oh, and combine that with an escort mission. And the escorted person is a ♥♥♥♥♥ who seems to purposely get you shot down.\n\nThe plot is a necessary evil. The way its handled is... well, an unnecesary evil. Frankly the entire last mission arc is crap. But FC3's island is worth the price of admission... maybe be smarter than I was and just ignore everything after the second island gets unlocked, plot-wise.","December 10, 2013","true","78.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Like similar games such as GTA and Batman: AC, the current objective is shown on the map... there are side missions and mini-games that can be unlocked and played at will.  Portions of the map details are hidden until radio towers are "unlocked" by scaling them and sabotaging the fuse box.  Weapons and skills are steadily unlocked as progress is made in both the main story line, collecting hidden treasures, and completing various other tasks.  Thrown in for good measure are hunting and crafting, and a completely separate and very challenging co-op campaign.\n\nOn the plus side:\n> The world is beautiful and nicely detailed.\n> The story is quite good and features one of the best antagonists in any video game I have ever played.\n> The weapons look, feel, and sound excellent.\n> The stronghold raids and "kill nasty dude x" side missions are the meat of the game and very entertaining, with many ways to approach them\n> The takedown skills are challenging to apply and fun when they work.\n> An excellent PC port with all the graphical and control flourish we expect.\n\nOn the negative side:\n> The game ramps up too quickly... I found myself proceeding at a reasonable pace, and by act 2 I was becoming overpowered... this along with another mechanic in act 2 makes the second act seem anti-climactic.\n> On the same vein, the first act Boss feels more threatening than the second.  He also was such a good character I was disappointed that he was dead.  Can he have his own game, please?\n> The native peoples character models are too similar.\n> The world does not feel "lived in"... it feels more like an action game set piece.  There is also very little variation in the game world.\n> There is very little incentive to continue exploring after the game ends.\n\nThe co-op campaign is very difficult... you will want at least 3 players for that.  I bought the game on sale on steam for $5... was it worth it? Yes absolutely.  I would say $20 is reasonable for this since I got nearly 40 hours of entertainment out of it.\n\n8/10\n","July 14, 2014","true","110.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Throughout the course of the game you learn the importance of stealth, resources, allies, and enemies. The only complaint I have is the co-op mission glitches that make it hard to invite your friends sometimes. With that in mind, the story itself is very entertaining and well put together. In a way, I would like to say the game is realistic, because once you zone out after playing it for a few hours, you get really intense and into it. The graphics are pretty great a good majority of the time, but my laptop isn't exactly prepared for me to have all the graphics up in "high".

I gladly spent hours of mine on the PS3 version, and have downloaded it on my PC to play through again on a harder setting and see the full potential of the graphics. This game is absolutely beautiful. The PS3 version had me impressed, PC has my mind blown. If you want to immerse yourself in a game that both feels and looks real, this is it. Graphics aside, the story starts you out on a skydiving adventure (no gameplay) that goes horribly wrong. You wake up in a cage with your buddy and have absolutely no idea what is going on, aside from the fact that some insane dude is talking to you from outside the cage. His name is Vaas, and you'll be working towards taking him and his regime down for the entirety of the game. He is one mental badass. The rest of the game involves taking over enemy camps, hunting animals, securing radio towers and powering them on which unlocks better weapons/ammo/attachments. There are various quests to do as well that will unlock things. It's a great set up, and you feel as though you become a part of the village you started in. I'd also add that the themesong is amazing and I have to listen to it more than once every time it comes on. There are some good songs throughout the game, but there's also the typical FPS-esque ones that drone on without any real melody. To me this game gets a 9/10. It's almost perfect. I cannot wait to see what Far Cry 4 is going to bring to the table.","January 1, 2014","true","24.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You free yourself and get help from local villagers to free your friends and take the kidnappers down.\n\n* Island looks amazing. Overall graphics is very up to date.\n\n* Exploring the island is very fun (whoever liked Red Faction Guerrilla's enviroment will like this aswell). Many side quests to do. Having a bunch of items to find (just like the classic hidden boxes from the GTA series). Driving a vehicle makes you feel as you're inside the game. You can actually feel bumps on the road.\n\n* The wildlife is very nice. Many exotic animals to encounter. Animal's AI is well done overall.\n\n* The more you advance in the game, enemies get thougher.\n\n* Customizable weapons. Need i say more?\n\n* Co-op is pretty fun when its not crashing.\n\n* You get to cheat on your gf with an amazonian nympho.\n\nThe bad:\n\n* Story ends bad, in my opinion: I'll do my best not to spoil - When having the chance to get out of the island with all your friends, you take the other option, revenge, staying behind and killing those who have kidnapped you and your friends.\n\n* Enemies AI is a bit poor. They sometimes suspect that something is wrong but they dont tend to do much about it, even if they're defending an outpost, etc.\n\n* I've found all the syringes except health syringes to be unnecessary to use. No need to dive too much underwater so water syringe is irrelevant. The camera's ability to tag enemies and animals makes the hunter syringe to be irrelevant aswell. You can extinguish fire when you're on fire so fireproof syringes are, again, irrelevant.\n\n* Your health is too OP. You can make up to 10 health packs while also carrying impossible amount of crafting materials to make even more health syringes if you'll need to use later. After getting enough progressed in the game, you have constantly infinite amount of health which makes everything boring and less exciting.\n\n* The skill tree isn't as good as other games, E.G Borderlands franchise. You will eventually unlock all the skills in the game, which makes it unnecessary to think 'which skill am i going to unlock next?'. Some of the skills have absolutely no value in the game so you may think that even if you have free skill points to spare, you wouldn't pick that specific skill.\n\n* While the crafting option itself is very well made. Everything craftable in the game gets unlocked after ~50% of game time (finishing the north island), so you wont be needing to kill animals for hides at the second island at all if you have explored the first island effectively enough.\n\n* Activating radio towers makes the game very easy. Too easy i might say. Weapons will become free in weapon shops, ammo gets very cheap, and you get the sense that money isnt a factor anymore. If you like a bit of a challenge, dont do what i did, which was unlocking most of the radio towers before making the quests. Try exploring everything at once:\n\n- Do a few missions.\n- Do a few side missions.\n- Explore the island as you can: Find some artifacts / SD cards / letters / etc.\n- Unlock some radio towers and outposts.\n- Repeat\n\n* uPlay - Sadly this game runs by uPlay, which means constantly-crashing servers in multiplayer and co-op, no Steam achievements, and no real option to search for specific servers like in normal Valve servers via Steam.\nMultiplayer and co-op have no skill filter. A level 1 noob will often join a group of level 75's (highest level).\n\nThe ugly:\n\n* Vaas\n\nOverall:\n\nI admit i was 'letting myself go' on the bad stuff. But when you play the game, you will realize the good compensates the bad in many ways. Very enjoyable game. Open world FTW!\nJust dont count on the MP / Co-op to be enjoyable. Because of the above circumstances, its not.","June 22, 2014","true","42.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've enjoyed it thoroughly, but it seems to be one of those games which provides a lot of things to the player, but doesn't do any of them particularly well. I bought the deluxe edition version of this game for £5, so I'll happily admit that it's a steal; I do think it's been worth my money, however.\n\nGood pointsThe AI is much better than in Far Cry 2 - multiple playstyles are actually an option now, rather than being forced to go rambo for each of the outposts in the previous game\nGraphical-wise, it is a very pretty looking game. The forests look quite lush and the upgrades to the engine help compliment this, even if the ambient occlusion seems pretty strong at times\nThere is actually a story that you can follow this time. To me, Far Cry 2's story seemed pretty nonexistent, so this is a large improvement\nA much wider diversity of weapons compared to its predecessor, and the attachments and paintjobs let you customise firearms to suit your style\nMuch of the bad points in Far Cry 2 have been addressed and built upon, for instance outposts respawning if you venture a couple of meters away and the driving physics is much better\nBad pointsThere's only one environment in the game, and it's the jungle. I understand this was remedied in Far Cry 4, but it does make it slightly dull when the entirety of both islands are the same\nOnce you've completed the game, there isn't much to do other than free the remaining outposts and complete the side quests - which personally, aren't that interesting\nOverall, I'd recommend you purchase this, but I'd wait until it's next on sale.","December 8, 2014","true","22.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/220240/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","Far Cry 3 is beyond any doubt an amazing game and an experience that mustn't be missed, even with it's flaws.\nThe graphics, ambience and voice acting are all amazing and makes this game one of the most asthetically pleasing titles in recent years, however as a result Far Cry 3 is pretty demanding in the hardware department. So make sure your gear is up to speed and optimize it for maximum performance.\nThe gameplay has been referred to in the past as "Skyrim with guns". This is true, Far Cry 3 puts the player in the heart of a tropical paradise plagued with drug-running pirates and gives them the opportunity to go about as they please: Exploring areas, fighting off skirmishes and collecting items. However unlike Skyrim the primary story isn't completely optional, with constant reminders appearing on your screen to go here or do that while out experiencing the island for yourself makes you feel like a dog in an off-lease park; yes you are free in a sense but you're still not in total control of your experience.\nTo further add the sensation of "freedom with boundaries", Far Cry 3's story is very restrictive in comparison with the exploration. During a mission you are forced to use this one specific weapon, drive this one specific vehicle, do this objective in precisely this particular way, go here within the alloted time; the list goes on. Adding unpredictable restrictions to the story makes the player feel like a ball and chain has been shackled to their ankle, which does no favors to the overall experience of the game. However, when you are allowed to play your way, Far Cry 3 really shines through. Plotting out ambushes on fortified outposts or joyriding across the island running over whatever gets in your way is a blast through-and-through, made even better by a large variety of destructive weaponry ranging from grenade launchers, RPGs and even flamethrowers.\nThe story of Far Cry 3 is simple, you take on the role of Jason Brody, a rich white boy who loves hair product. While you and your friends are on a drunken binge in exotic places you're all kidnapped by a band of pirates looking to ransom you and then sell you off to slavery. Jason manages to escape and begins his adventure to rescue his friends and kill the bad guy and get the girl. To be frank, the story isn't all that great. Jason Brody and all his friends are shallow and dislikeable, and I'd much rather shoot them all in the mouth than risk my life to save them. In contrast, antagonists in the game are interesting and imaginative and save Far Cry 3's story from being dullard. Vaas Montenegro, the most well established villian is similar to the Joker from Batman: Arkham Asylum, he's psychotic, unpredictable, imaginative and fun to watch.\nFar Cry 3's combat is split into two categories: Stealth and shoot-em-up, and both are well-made and flow well into eachother as the situation requires. Jumping into foliage when not in combat makes it so enemies cannot see you, allowing you to plan out your attacks or to play venus fly trap and lure them to you by throwing rocks before jumping out and puncturing them with a knife takedown. The takedowns are a very satisfying insta-kill against unarmored enemies (and can be used against heavy foes later in the game after acquiring a perk) so long as you take them by suprise, and with unlockable perks takedowns become even more versatile and deadly by either pulling the pin off a grenade of the freshly deceased or going for multi chain stabs. On the other side of the combat spectrum the guns and shooting mechanics are satisfying and have a good healthy punch to them.\nUnfortunately the combat indulges in one of video game design's bad habits, Quick-Time Events, prominently when fighting carniferous wildlife like aligators and sharks. You're swimming across a river when SURPRISE GATOR SEX comes up, then you're given half a second to mash a specific button before you die. QTEs are a bad mechanic in video games and while they're not too prominent in Far Cry 3 they still feel unecessary on the whole. Finally the worst part of the combat is the battles against the main antagonists like Vaas or Buck, both of them being such hostile albeit savourably enjoyable characters you'd think the fight would be memorable, right? Wrong. When fighting them the game designers decide to put you and your foe into a sort of drug-trip combat sequence that makes no sense and is incongruious to the rest of the game, followed by a series of QTEs taking control away from you for the sake of trying to make the encounter more cinematic. This resulted in final struggles that were disappointing and left a very sour aftertaste.\n\nSo in all, Far Cry 3 is a game with flaws, but they don't drag it all the way down. Far Cry 3 is fun, addicting and worth the time (especially if you got it while it's on sale). I suggest you look past it's flaws and let the overall experience take you in.\n\nAlso before I close off I need to mention: Far Cry 3 also has an online multiplayer, which only exists for the purpose of having an online multiplayer. It's unimaginative deathmatch and is not anything special.","January 2, 2014","true","44.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","8"

This takes away immersion from gameplay as you can't really do missions when you feel like. Worst thing in story is it's black magic mubo jumbo that can't be taken seriously.

Died. 11/9\nSerious review: Far Cry 3. I've played Far Cry 2 before on Xbox 360 and liked it, but got bored since all the missions are essentially the same. Go somewhere shoot it up, occasionally die of Malaria. But this one I played every day since I had it download. Let's start with pros, neutrals, and cons.\n\n~Pros\n+Variety. The missions vary from hunting some animals to killing a bunch of dudes while ziplining to them, and trying to blow up a bridge with an RPG at the same time.\n+Graphics. Stunning graphics, even on the lowest possible settings.\n+Music. So much amazing music, specifically Beethoven.\n+GUNS! SO MANY GUNS! AAAAAAHAHAHHAAHHAHHAH!\n+C4. I could be registered with insanity the way I used C4. Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity, by the way?\n+Vaas. The big bad guy at the beginning. I love love LOVE his character. Too bad he dies. That's not a spoiler, we all knew it would happen. At least I'm not saying when.\n+Wingsuit. I'm not telling you about this. You get to find out on your own.\n+Vehicles. In Far Cry 2, the vehicles were smooth, but they were even smoother in this game.\n+Animals/Wildlife. So many plants and animals, ranging from Cassowarys, crocodiles, to bears.\n+Largeness. Agoraphobes would be terrified. I feel like I just offended a ton of people.\n+Other characters. All the OTHER characters are just so diversified. We got Vaas, the insano, Oliver the stoner, Nick the "badass" who really isn't at all. So diversified, I feel like that's the wrong term.\n\nNetruals:\nHow hard it was to get the lowest possible settings. I had to look up so many tutorials to get to this, but in the end, I got a smooth 10 frames. Look, it's smooth in my eyes as long as it doesn't stutter. I GREW UP ON CONSOLE STOP JUDGING ME!\n\nCons:\n-Jason Brody. Jason starts off as a cowardly whimpering baby who can't stand even an evil person dying, which I liked, but later on becomes insane and likes killing, which I don't. He starts out saying, "Oh ♥♥♥♥! He's dead!" to, "HE'S MOVING! BURN HIM, PUT ALL THE EXPLOSIVES ON HIM, MAKE SURE HE'S DEAAAAAAAD! RAAAAA BLOOOOOOOD!"\n-The endings. At the very end you have the left click option and the right click option. They both give seperate options. Nothing that happened before matters, just which button you click.\n-OH GOD NO! I'M REMEMBERING THE BOSS FIGHTS! GAAAAH. But seriously. The boss fights, which luckily there are only 3 of, are QTE's not including Vaas. Vaas is different, which I like.\n-How hard it was to come by money. I didn't do the sidequests during my campaign play, so it was super hard for me to get money, which I needed.\n-Uplay. 'Nuf said.\n\nSo, in the end, was it worth the ten bucks getting the Far Cry Franchise Pack? Absolutely. Is it worth whatever it's priced at? Definitely. What would I rate it? 9/10. Yep.

The characters were nothing to write home about, and sometimes I had a dislike for them, such as both the protaganist and antagonist. The hunting was lackluster and was often inturupted by random encounters which ruined them entirely and cost me to lose my quarry. On top of that, the gunplay I found surprisingly boring and unsatisfying. Furthermore most interactions between characters did little more than frustrate me.","November 30, 2014","false","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
