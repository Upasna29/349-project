Don't support this jackass, this kind of ♥♥♥♥ is unacceptable. *****\n\nIt's not at all the type of game that needs to be in Early Access.  It's far, very far from feeling finished, but holy crap, it plays and looks like ♥♥♥♥ (don't let the skeletons or eye boss in the previews fool you).

This game is about as frustrating as an itchy butt that, at first, feels better when you scratch it but then the itch gets worse very quickly and it won't go away no matter how much you scratch. You eventually find yourself stuck on an extremely itchy spot on your ♥♥♥ and you keep scratching and scratching but nothing helps, so you eventually give up and go do something else to forget about it.\n\nThe arrow key controls are simple enough. You can move left and right and jump with the up arrow, but you can't control how you spin in the air, which adds some unneeded randomness to a game which relies on precise jumps. You can also shoot with your mouse by aiming at a target and pressing the left mouse button, which may or may not require some skill, but I didn't progress far enough in the game to see this mechanic applied in action.\n\nThe music is nice, but gets boring after a while and you can't turn it off or control the volume at all. The art is quite nice and is aesthetically pleasing, in a way. From screenshots I can see that further levels feature more cool art but I couldn't be arsed to progress further than a few of the first ones. What turned me off completely was the "Flappy Bird-esque jumping through small gaps in poles", which were also surrounded by spikes. That got very frustrating and put my progress in the game to a complete halt. The randomness of the jumping and spinning physics coupled with cheap hitboxes on the spikes got really old really fast. I started to feel like this game was more about luck than skill.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad game, but it needs a lot more polish to be enjoyable. As it is right now, I wouldn't pay for it. Call me a wuss if you wish, but I got bored quite quickly and moved on to other, more forgiving games. The itch is still there so I may or may not come back to scratch it some more, depending on how the developer handles things.","May 22","false","1.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","14","17","3","3"

It's like Syobon action level of the frustration BUT in Syobon action most of the deaths u got were because of the traps, because that game was like one huge trap. Here you can see the danger, you know what you have to do BUT you still die die and die and die again, you know what to do, but you cant make it, because it's simply impossible. I wasted like an hour and a half for 5! (FIVE) levels, and i died like 100 times each level, but then that level with the ball of death is simply enough for me so what do we have:\n\n+The name of this game fits it perfectly - this game is perfect gift for someone you hate or at least want to troll\n+This game is perfect for rising hate-o-meter - if you need to brake up with your girlfriend or something like that just play this game for like 10 minutes and you are DONE.\n+White cube of doom - the big part of the game difficulty is that you are cube that SPINS nonstop, at the same time physix works pretty ok but you never know how your CUBE will land on the obstacle, on the edge or on the corner :|||||||| That cube has red eye, so will you, because of the constantly rising blood pressure.\n+Music - it's like music from hell, rising the level of madness pretty good.\n+Double jimp\n+Squareshaped blood\n+Powerups like speed/slow-mo/shooting with your own blood\n+This game is good to have short time fun since it's loading quick and you can start from any level you unlocked.\n-No control changes (yet) personally i prefer WASD over <^v> AND since you have to use mouse with your right hand, you actually need to press direction buttons with your left hand, it's not very nice (aint got to the part where you shoot but still)\n-Steam overlay doesnt work yet","April 27","true","1.3"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","20","31","9","0"

Most games of this "genre" start off easy and ramp up the difficulty so that players can get a feel for the game before launching into the core of the game.\nNo sense of hitbox. Most of my deaths show the "character" not touching the spikes whatsoever, sometimes even passing the spikes.\nThe jumping control of which most of the game is centered around is akin to a binary switch rather than momentary. In other words, jumping always jumps the same hight if you tap it or hold it. This makes "keyhole" jumps that much more difficult in the artificial way. (This as well as the previous point resulted in being unable to pass the second level for me.)\nThe game looks like it was created in MS paint. I could understand if it was going for a specific aesthetic, and that it's in EA. Between random sprite graphics with bland and generic graphics on the side, it feels like a graphical mess. At least to me.\nAt the current state it's in, even considering it's in EA, I can't recommend it. I may change my review if (or hopefully when) it's updated to fix these issues.","May 22","false","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Albeit that, the title stand for itself, it is impossible, the levels are hard and will appeal to some 1% of people who like doing things over and over for hours on end.\n\nThe gameplay is fair enough, arrows and double jump, you can't control the spinning of the cube, wich and be trouble.\n\nThe hitboxes are based on the sprites, not the graphics, so you die for being to close to a spike while on a flat surface.\n\nGraphics are bad. Not only are de serifs fonts horrible, they clip over the game screen, go away too fast, or hide behind the actual level. Every asset is a single tile repeated multiple times.\n\nMusic is ok, as far as repetition go.\n\nI wont go further, given the beta status, but I will say this. This is not worth 5$. This is not a beta game, this isn't even an alpha game. This is a minimum viable product; the least possible ammount of work done to release something.

Take 'The Impossible Game', slap on even more crudely drawn Microsoft paint images and a supposed "coffin" containing your hero, absurdely hard jumps, and you get this nightmare of a title that doesn't even let you play without solving the riddle of the ♥♥♥♥ing sphynx.\n\nOf course, this is referring to the game during launch. If you're not sure how to get to the game until it's fixed (which the developer has informed me is being worked on), simply load game, close game at difficulty select, start game again, choose continue game, then first stage. (Or just click the giant red START I chocked up to being a header given it's placement. Again, developer clarified this)\n\nThe first stage is passable but don't ask me how the hell I did it. Thumbs up for recomendation simply because it lives up to exactly what the title says. You're experience on level 2 and beyond may vary though.
