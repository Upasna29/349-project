The info buttons give very little information.  Additionally, I stayed in reprojection 100% of the time in this game with a GTX 970, so the optimization is very poor.  To add insult to injury, the textures are flat, environment are square, and the sense of wonder is low.\n\nNot worth the $2-3 price point until the performance is fixed, more content is added, and the overall quality is increased.","April 14","false","0.1"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Why? What were the egyptian beliefs about life, death and the afterlife? What's the significance of the dog-headed Anubis figures? Who were the pharaohs and what was their role in egyptian society?\n\nIn practical terms the time spent on the treasure hunt section would have been better used to provide much deeper educational content. If people want to play a game on their Vive, this isn't going to be the title they reach for - so why spend time and resource developing it? The flashlight is too dim, making it very hard to get an idea of the full grandeur of the room you're stood in. I'd like to see higher quality textures and many more items added to the tomb.","April 16","false","0.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Treasure hunt is a lot of fun, although I almost knocked over my desk trying to reach for all the gold in time. Discovry mode is really chill, but not much to do after you've listened to all the info narration. The coolest part is definitely the coffin itself its very detailed.\n\nThis game i better if you have a bigger space since you have to walk a bit to reach some treasure pieces and some of the teleport points are tricky.  If your like me you'll be tempted to use the teleport laser as a lightsaber. Overall definitely worth the price for getting to turn your living room into an ancient tomb.","April 14","true","0.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

I'd prefer if they made a more serious focus on education about Ancient Egypt since there is a lot of potential out there for seeing the Valley of the Kings and other Egyptian sites in VR.  Abu Simbel would be a great VR experience, for example.","April 23","true","0.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It's fine for what it is. It'll be a nice experience for parents or other people new to VR. I would have liked at least a couple more rooms to explore though.","April 15","false","0.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

If you're making an experience about a real place it should be accurate.  While the size of the tomb felt right, the contents in it were all very inaccurate.  The "Information" elements were also very uninformative.  It didn't make it fully clear what they were talking about and  the narration overall didn't feel passionate or make you want to listen to it.\n","April 21","false","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There were some things that showed true promise, such as the simple node-based teleport system, the menus and controls, and the professional info spots and narration. But unfortunately there are only 3 small rooms in the tomb, and in the demo and while well produced, ends very rapidly. There are some minor technical issues like the torch glaring up when turned away from you or just going out altogether, nothing that would not be forgettable if it were not for there being only three rooms to navigate within.","May 4","false","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's very short and limited to just a few rooms, plus the hands are uber creepy. Maybe if it was a free demo that would be okay but it's not worth paying for at any price. There are some nice tidbits of info about ancient Egypt but it just leaves you wanting to learn more and explore more of these beaufiful sights. The "game" part is just picking up a few objects scattered around the rooms in a limited time.","May 5","false","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have been showing this to multiple people and they have all been pretty impressed by the same things that I have noted.\n\nI would like other tombs and parts of pryimid to expore, I can see this being made into a real interested way to learn and explore new places.","May 27","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
