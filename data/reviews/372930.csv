The story is compelling: you're a detctive  in 1950s NYC trying to solve a string of disappearances of Mafia bosses under mysterious circumstances. In addition, each of these disappearances seem related to another dissapearance, this time of a small child. Somehow butterflies are also related. It's a nice little mystery.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging, and there are several difficulty options you can choose from, affecting the amount of help the game gives in the form of visual cues or hints. The music's really cool and fits the theme nicely. I love the retro style and the "period feel" of the 50s and the artwork really showcases that. Overall, New York Mysteries is a high-quality HOG.\n\nThere are loads of collectible items (and completing each collection earns you Steam achievements) and there are a lot of different areas to visit in the game. The map is huge, but fortunately, there is also a convenient fast-travel system allowing you to jump around from place to place quickly.\n\nOne thing you won't find in this HOG are word-lists and cluttered scenes where you have to cross all the words off the list by finding the items. Hidden object scenes are more organic here, you're given a group of silouettes and you have to work out the objects that fill them. Each of the objects is usually used in the scene to uncover one or more of the additional objects, so the scenes work out more like a puzzle than a straight-up search.\n\nThis seems like it is one of the longer HOGs I think I've played, though it's still a game you can complete pretty quickly. I don't really see that as a down side at all though, since the polished and well-presented gameplay and story are really enjoyable.\n\nHere is some gameplay video footage of New York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia (shot by seph.au from Gaming All the Time):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoDH9mcap3c\nNote: A copy of this game was provided for review purposes.","May 30, 2015","true","2.6"," 66 of 70 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","66","70","2","7"

Nevertheless, I will be the first to admit that: even when these games are well developed, I can understand why a large percentage of gamers would find them unexciting.   New York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia (Collector’s Edition) is one of the better hidden-object/point-and-click adventure games I have played, simply because there are so many things done “right.”  But if you don’t really like these types of games, you probably shouldn’t bother with it, because there isn’t anything special about it that will change your mind. However, any gamer who already enjoys this particular genre should definitely check this out.\n\nAll of the things you would want a game like this to have, it does have.  Various difficulties, a fast travel map, challenging-yet-intuitive puzzle solutions, collectibles, and achievements.  It also has a decent story and the cut-scenes aren’t horridly cringe-worthy, which many games in this genre can’t truly claim.  Another rare and awesome feature is the fact you can unlock most of the missable achievements from the “extras” menu to replay specific puzzles— rather than having to replay the entire game for one achievement.\n\nOne of the best features of the game, though, is the integrated strategy guide.  I think it is a great dynamic and it is certainly easier to use than having to alt-tab to find a guide online.  It is organized so that you can choose to use it: only to help find collectibles, only if you are stuck, the whole way through, or not at all.\n\nNew York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia (Collector’s Edition) certainly won’t be blowing anyone’s socks off, and it probably won’t appeal to gamers who aren’t big fans of the hidden-object/point-and-click adventure games.  But if you are a fan of this type of game, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to you, because it is definitely one of the better games in the genre.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","September 15, 2015","true","6.3"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","49","54","0","0"

I won't lie; I love this genre. I love puzzles, I love revealing stories step by step, and I love spending some mindless time on them. Yet, the HOG genre consists of one of the most repetitive gameplays ever. Thus, it is remarkably hard to make anything either new, or even refreshing as a HOG. New York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia is one great HOG, with hours of gameplay, imaginative puzzles that I haven't seen before which comes with comparatively logical item combination. Plus, the story is interesting!\n\nIt's New York, 1955. The fearsome Mafioso of their time disappear one by one, leaving only an odd green residue and a butterfly behind them. It is also reported that children all over the city disappear alongside these dangerous criminals, drawing the exact same butterfly as the last thing they do. Our protagonist, investigator and reporter Laura James is contacted by the curator of the New York Museum, where the last disappearance has occurred. Laura is asked to investigate this odd phenomenon and find the missing children if possible. She suddenly finds herself in a picture with a secret organization, old underground passages that trace all over the city and an Indian ghost story. How come all these odd happenings are connected?\n\nComing up with a strong and interesting story, this is a great game for its genre. Art and environment design are high quality - depicting the hidden beauty of New York City during its shadier years - , with beautiful character design and marvelous cinematics. There is real labor put into this game, I tell you. Voice acting isn't excellent, but it's obviously beyond par. I'm a bit disappointed that we don't hear Laura's voice commenting on something, but it's not a priority.\n\nHOG scenes are not your usual. They are compact; weaved with puzzles and item combinations similar as an adventure game within themselves, designed to reach a singular item at the end. Puzzles are numerous and mostly brain scratching, designed elaborately. I went for not skipping any puzzle for the achievement, so it was a tough and fun experience for me. If you are into puzzle solving, this is a neat addition.\n\nMaybe the greatest bonus of the game is its game time. Added up with the time you'll be spending for many imaginative puzzles and the bonus chapter, there is an approximate game time of 6-7 hours! The gameplay has an usual amount of backtracking, but with the usage of the interactive map, nothing's a chore. You are also given the option of collecting some phantom objects and collection items for achievements, if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nIf you are fresh out of HOGs to play, do not think twice. New York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia is an A+ HOG for you to enjoy. The game comes from FIVE-BN games, - nope, it's not Artifex Mundi, but definitely AM quality - a relatively small producer that I suggest keeping an eye on in the future.

Don’t expect any traditional list-based hidden object scenes in it though.\n\nLong version:New York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia is an ambitious game that tries to push the boundaries of the hidden object genre, but it doesn’t try to change too much.\n\nLike many good HOGs, New York Mysteries knows the importance of a good story: we are following an investigative journalist on the trail of some mysterious child disappearances that always occur at the same time when a prominent member of the Mafia goes missing. While the plot involves a secret society and some supernatural elements, it retains the more realistic thriller-like atmosphere to the end.\n\nAlthough it is classified as a HOG, the game has no traditional hidden object scenes, only procedural ones, where you have to use uncovered objects to get even more items. The developers focused on the numerous and diverse puzzles instead, including several types that are rarely seen in these kinds of games, elevating New York Mysteries among the best HOG types on Steam.","December 11, 2015","true","7.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

From docks to a lake, welcome to the '50 New York!\n\nThe plot is in reality a double story: the kids and the mafia bosses. The bosses are abducted by a real ghost while the kids are by humans. Yet, everything is tied to a mysterious order. I was kinda disappointed by the plot twist because I wanted more "paranormal" stuff.\n\nThe hidden objects scenes are inexistant in their normal form: here, the list is composed of silhouettes: it's up to you to find them through different actions. The puzzles are not too hard but not too easy. The guide that is included will help you if needed. For me, it was only useful for the bonus chapter.\n\nYou have also to find special items and objects that morphing into another regurlarly, which is now a standard for a casual game.\n\nThe graphics are correct, though I found the character I was incarning not so well-proportionned. The soundtrack is also ok.\n\nOne of the good surprises is the possibility to play the minigames from the menu, meaning that you can unlock some achievements without doing another playthrough.\n\nThe game was quite a surprise for me, as I didn't expect a paranormal story - I didn't read the description and with the header, I really thought that I was going for a noir story.

And, on the flipside, I enjoyed interacting with the enviroment, turning keys to open doors, mixing chemicals, rejoining torn papers as well as clicking on puzzle pieces.\n\nOn top of that, there's some nice cutscenes, along with some voice-acting (Though, sadly, Laura doesn't have much of a speaking part) to really paint a picture for new players.\n\nIt's a good balance, there's something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nNow, with all that in mind, I will definitely say that the game was most definitely enjoyable from my end and was worth every penny - six hours for a comfortable playthrough for six bucks sounds fair to me; and with the replay value of revisiting the puzzles and the massive open-world levels with lush artwork, it's almost a steal!\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't have some issues, however minor...\n\n-You only have ONE save file, you can't have multiples.\nAlso, even worse, if you're replaying some of the main game again but want to also replay the bonus chapter, the save data for the bonus chapter WILL overwrite your save data for the main game - and vice versa.\n\n-Spilling text on certain documents.\nOn some of the books and journal entries, the bottom of the text runs off of the page.\nThis can prove to be frustrating, I'd like to finish what I'm reading instead of it running off into oblivion or cutting abruptly.\n\n-Bonus chapter's too short.\nI can understand that it's a 'mini-episode' and all, but it just felt like the very end was a bit sudden; Laura explores the underground city and rescues her companion, but, there was no real explanation for what happened to the people there.\nMaybe it's supposed to be left up for interpretation, but there could've been a little more to it.\n\nOther than that, I loved playing through the game; it was nice to sit down and relax with.","June 24, 2015","true","6.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I was about half way through and the hint button broke, leaving me stuck with the developer's unsolvable, counter-intuitive puzzles. I think this happens when you complete the challenges in a sequence that the hint button doesn't expect. I went as far as asking for a refund from the seller. However, I withdrew my claim and review after I used a guide to get a bit further and then the hint button started working again.\n\nThe puzzles are impossible but the point and click parts are solid. Beware of the bugs, it isn't well-made and should've been patched months ago, the developers have been made aware of the problems but they just don't care. Overall, the atmosphere and story won me over and I can say that this is a good game but it has a lot of problems.\n\nEDIT: Reverted to a negative review after yet another glitch left me unable to progress in my second playthrough. I half completed the minigame with the five circles at the start of chapter two, messed it up and couldn't reset it for some reason (seriously, why not?) so I put it down and wanted to pick it up again, thinking maybe that would reset it - it didn't, it just wouldn't let me pick it up again.

The game had less New York than I was expecting but still managed to be a fun experience. The game dances between mystery and sci fi, which can be annoying, however everything comes together smoothly.\n\nYou play Laura, a beautiful dame tasked with finding out why big bosses in the mafia have been disappearing and also why children have gone missing as well. With the help of Lucas and your detective skills, you travel via a series of underground tunnels to different points of interesting to piece together answers you seek.\n\nGame play is solid, the mini games offer a great challenge as so the hidden object scenes. The scenes aren't your tradition flare, they are the type where you have to find items to then use on other items until you find the one item you're looking for. A hybrid of hidden item game and puzzle. These aren't my favorite, especially when that's all there is in the game, but they were fun so I didn't mind.\n\nThe game also offers a nice sound track as well as a strategy guide built in if you are ever stuck, this also makes getting the achievements a lot easier. The game is an all around great experience and despite a few flaws I found it very relaxing but also engaging.

The game as a whole doesnt have much hidden objects per se. It does have a few of them but its mostly find this piece to complete this object. Example find a razor and find a pillow and cut open pillow to get next object. These are done well for the most part. The puzzles are a mix of old and new. A few I have never played and some that I have played a million times before in other games. So thats a mixed bag if you have played a lot of HOgames in the past.\n\nGraphics are very well done and are super easy on the eyes. Great color and nice full motion scenes and voices. Really nicely done. The story is another standout. The focus is on mafia bosses and finding lost kids. Its well done and interesting.  Now for a minor nit pit. This game forces you to write stuff down as their are a lot of click the six objects and see what does what and in what order. I wish it would have the paper in upper right corner all the time for these type of super clickey puzzles.

The mafia is present merely as a plot device.  The themes of this HOG are more typical of the genre; mysticism, secret societies, and, most importantly, all of it set in a world where everyone uses elaborate puzzle locks to close everything, including their mailboxes, and then carelessly scatters essential parts of those locks around the neighbourhood.\n\nA particular innovation in "New York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia" that I had never previously encountered is that the HO segments don't simply present you with a purposeless laundry list of items to find (and then, presumably, discard).  Instead, each item in your list (given in silhouette form) has a use within the HO screen, to open a lock, to combine with another item, or to free up some other item.  By the time you've completed the HO segment, each object you found will have been used to a purpose, to ultimately make the very last item available -- that's the one you keep.  In essence, by emphasizing the use of found items for sequential problem-solving, each HO segment is made into its own HO game in microcosm.  This works very well, to my mind, and makes the HO screens feel less pointless.  Of course, the fact the these segments are done in isolation and cut you off from your regular inventory does lead to occasional yelling at the screen "I don't need that!  I already have a knife!" but it's still feels more meaningfully integrated with the game plot than a normal HO segment.","September 30, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play a pretty lady detective: typical for the genre, and an obvious nod to the clientèle. Also typically the characters are quite meaningless.

It took me 9.3 hours to finish the game with 100% Achievements (6.8 hours for the first run-through of the main game, another 2.1 hours for the bonus chapter, and an additional 0.4 hours to go back through the main game for the Achievement I'd missed).  So, I'd say the game is absolutely worth the $7 list price it's currently at (assuming you want a challenging HOG).","October 26, 2015","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just starting but is very interesting so far.  Would highly suggest if you like these types of games.   One of the best I have played so far.","August 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The dialogue and production values are about as high as you get with these foreign-made low-budget adventures.  The story is a little coo-coo and there's a couple frustrating puzzles and excessive backtracking that's prevelant in nearly all HOGs but otherwise I have no complaints.  Recommended!","December 6, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a HOG style game I find the puzzles fun and interesting, and the story was great.  The cutscenes and voice acting is pretty good.  If you enjoy Hidden object games the price on this one is okay.  Surely a good time killer if there ever was one.","September 2, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very well detailed, good puzzles and the hidden object scenes are interesting, not a mess of casual things but you need to find tools in a logical order to find the one that you're looking for to continue the story. Even the cutscenes are good enough and there's a bonus chapter after the main game with some backstory and other extras.","August 26, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For every dollar spent on the game there should be an hour of game time spent towards completing the game. In this case it is right on the money! Seven hours for seven dollars. Great game play, awesome story line, easy to navigate, and overall a very enjoyable game. 18/20 achievements earned on the first playthrough and I won't mind playing it again on a rainy day to pick up the other two I missed.","January 14","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I completed it on Expert level. The puzzles are varied and challenging, the objects are fair but also challenging at times, and the story does the job to tie everything together. I would have thought with a game with 'The Mafia' in the title  may have been themed more towards that than what actually happens in the game but nevertheless it is still satisfying. In game help does feel a little like cheating if you use it but it's there if you need it. Overall, value for money and definately geared towards those with a bit of HOG experience under their belt.","April 17","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
