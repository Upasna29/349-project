Instead of templars they will be following a lead regarding a Mayan Artifact </Synopsis>. Some critics/fans held Shadow of templars better than Smoking mirror but for my personally tastes i find this game lot better. Not only from dialogue aspects and better graphics, but also from story/length.

The story on this one felt less than believable and was often times plain comical. Like the first one, this is a very casual adventure; the puzzles are extremely easy, plus the blue markers remove any difficulty in finding whatever you need. There is also a hint system in the unlikely event you ever get stuck. The movement is still slow paced. Often times you have to wait for an animation sequence to complete and you can't double-click to run or quickly move from one location to the next. Overall, it was is a reasonably well done adventure game that feels a little dated.","April 28, 2014","true","8.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","3"

Whilst not as good as the original, I feel this game still belongs in the hall of fame for point and click adventures.\n\nIt continues all the great elements that the first game had, and has it's own interesting continuation of the characters. The only downside to this game I feel is the character artwork for Nicole, the artwork portraying her character animation looks horrible compared to the facial conversation artwork, I can't believe they didn't improve it.\n\nStill, it's a great game to play.","December 1, 2013","true","4.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The story is not as good, with a far more black and white us vs them (while the original had three factions which made the story more interesting). For the longest time I was afraid they had remade Nico into nothing but a side-character who does nothing but get rescued, but luckily she does get to do more stuff later in the game.\n\nThe biggest let down was the number of time-wasting puzzles though. I.e. puzzles that are not hard to figure out, but takes a long time to do... or in the case of the jungle section, not even to do, just walking around (in the directors cut of the first game it was possible to fasttravel by dubbelclicking... the remastered version of the second does not seem to have that). Or when you want to tie two things together with a rope and you click on one of them and George instead says it would be better to tie it to the other first... instead of just doing that.\nTogether with some puzzles that have frankly stupid or contrived solutions (or the puzzles themselves are contrived) it certainly makes it weaker than the first game and far shorter. Sure it took me 7h vs the 10h of the original, but I'd still say it was half as short... the additional two hours felt artificially prolonged by the time-wasting aspect of some of the puzzles.\n\nHowever, while it is IMO weaker than the first game, it is still a good adventure game. If you enjoyed the first you will probably enjoy this one for the most part. If you haven't played the first, start with that instead.","January 5, 2014","true","7.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I picked it up before playing BS1. Along with my dad we would sit down and try to solve the puzzles and find the correct item combinations to move us forward in the storyline. The game felt relaxing and I really enjoyed that time. I finished it a couple of times since then and I got this Remastered version to see if it can replace my decaying CDs and to see a fix for the compatibility issues the game had. And yes, this Remastered edition is worth it. BS2 is not the best game in the world but it's fun and enjoyable. Very relaxing too, apart from the QTEs where you had to time something otherwise you were screwed. While I get the concept it felt out of place for this adventure game style. I also do not like the hints but simply just because I played the original version and I see how it takes the challenge out. But that is just my opinion on them. Overall a good game worth your time so I recommend it to all fans of the point&click genre.","December 30, 2014","true","0.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I still had Broken Sword 1 & 2 to replay which were both fantastic. When I heard Broken Sword was coming back with Broken Sword 5 I had realised I really did walk away from the series as I didnt even know there was a 4th lol. Now that all 5 games have been released on Steam as an oldschool fan I will be playing through 1 & 2 again and then I will go into 3 and 4 with an open mind and look forward to the return to a 2d adventure game in 5. I have the original CD copy of 1 & 2, but when I saw they were re released as a remastered directors cut's on Steam I decided to buy them again.\n\nBroken Sword 2 - The Smoking Mirror:Remastered\n\nAgain with a remastered version I was a little aprehensive, more so with BS2R as BS2 is my favourite BS to date (I havent played 3,4 & 5 yet. As we all know when creators go back and mess with things that were already great they can make alterations that will annoy returning fans etc.\n\nWith BS2R, they basically left the core game as the original was back in 1997. With BS1DC they took out some chunks and you couldent actually die as you could in the original 96 version. In BS2R they left the ability to die firmly in place and didnt take out the blood. The additions were nice like the new dialogue boxes and some new easter eggs which were not in the original.\n\nI would recommend this game to Vetran Broken Sword fans to replay through this great game again. I would also strongly recommend this game to any other 2D adventure game fans (Grim Fandango, Monkey Island etc.) who may have missed the Broken Sword series.\n\nVery pleased with this as I was back in 97.\n\nI have yet to play 5 but lets hope with its success more Broken Swords will follow.","January 29","true","7.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

If you already enjoy the genre, you already know this and it won't bother you much.  If you are newer to the genre, you just have to remember the all-purpose "click on everything" rule and "combine your inventory with anything you can no matter how strange it seems" rule.  There's nothing too farfetched.\n\n*Voice acting is quite good for the most part and the interactions are fully voiced, which I appreciate.  Sound and music in general is nicely done.\n\n*Art is very cartoon-ish.  That could be a selling point for somel; it certainly isn't for me.  However, despite being sort of a snob about art style, I will say that it is very well done even though it's not a style I love.  It in no way detracted from the overall game for me, and some people might absolutely love it.\n\n*The story was good, taking our heroes into Mayan Central America this time.  The end was a bit abrupt but did tie up the story nicely.  The addition of some optional graphic novel content helps flesh out the gap between this game and its predecessor.\n\n*There is a built-in help system for when you get stuck, which you can choose to use if you like (or can ignore, if you like!).  The help is "progressive hint" style, giving you the option to start with a very vague hint and work your way up to a detailed solution if you're still stuck.  While some people consider this absolute heresy, others will appreciate not having to track down a detailed walkthrough for help on one small point.\n\n*Play time is shorter than some comparable games.  I clocked in at around six hours, plowing straight through and not getting too hung up on anything (I'm too impatient to wait too long before checking to see what I missed!).  For someone not using any hints, it could probably take a couple hours longer.\n\nSo, I would recommend not only this game, but picking up the trilogy in a package if you don't have any of the games already.  It's a great deal and definitely worth it.","July 5, 2015","true","6.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Again we see Our protagonists George and Nico Kicked straight in action... Well, maybe just George because Nico's being kidnapped by a huge thug from the empty house of a disappeared archeologist she was supposed to interview. So George finds himself tied to a chair with a posonous spider slowly approaching him.\nI enjoyed the story from this chapter, the exotic locations you have to visit and the silly atomsphere and situations happening through the game are kind of a constant of the whole series. You will also meet some old friend from the first Broken Sword.\nThe interface is the same classic used in the previous game: a classic point & click setup, with mouse controls, a classic inventory system and most importantly many choices of subjects for dialogues with other characters. As a Remastered edition you can easily notice the backgrounds and the landscapes are improved. Unfortunately the characters are still rendered in poor resolution which I don't actually understand the reason behind this lack.\n\n+++Pros+++ STORY. I really enjoyed this chapter, You jump into action, your investigations will bring you again all around the world but the most imortant is the end. I also really liked some funny moments, and the way towards the end George and Nico get separate sequences, to join back again.\nRIDDLES. As usual all along the game there are Some nice puzzles, especially towards the end.\nREMASTERED. This chapter has been remastered so you can enjoy even more all the locations and landscapes you'll run through the game, though...---Cons--- HALF-REMASTERED. ...The characters look quite poorly detailed as if they're still the old animations from the original game which doesn't quite make sense to me.\nODD RIDDLES AND MAZE. Some Puzzles are not as good as the rest of the game or as the previous Broken Sword, not to mention the swamp maze where it was quite hard to figure the hot zones to go in other directions. But I guess it's just me being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because I bet that wasn't even meant to be that great maze I felt like.\nRUSHED LAST SECTION. I had the feeling that the Story was a little rushed towards the end. It's not like it sucks, I alrady stated I enjoyed the plot.

I pretty much said all I could about these games in the recommendation for the first one, but I guess one notable thing would be this one is definitely not as long as the first one. The first one was actually pretty lengthy and took me a few days to complete, where as this one is easily done in a day. With that said, it’s still worth a go.\nIn this one you can unlock little bonus content as you go along, a little comic book type thing that fills in some gaps that the game doesn’t. Which I thought was a nice addition to the game, and it actually fits the style of the game pretty well.\nThe art is great and the storyline for both games are decent, this franchise is definitely a good one for anyone’s point and click adventure section in their library. Although I can’t speak for the third one, as I have yet to play it still.

It's another of my  childhood games that continues the story of George and Nicole from the excellent prequel - this time around centering the story around Mayan mythology. It's not a very long or difficult game and it doesn't have the same depth as the first did, but it's still a nice ride from start to finish. Fortunately Nicole is a much more important character this time around, and not just a lazy sidekick sitting on her butt in Paris most of the time. The game is much more linear than the first game - there are no maps or locations and they always follow one path. The graphics looks much better though with beautiful 2D art and gorgeous lush locations.\n\nDefinitely a game any point-and-click adventure fan should already have played.","July 21, 2013","true",""," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although it isn’t as polished as the original, and has a good chunk of mandatory going around in circles, it is still a fun adventure game.\n\nLong version:Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror wasn’t exactly on par with the acclaimed original: initially it was regarded as a disappointment, but the low quality of the third and fourth games elevated its status in the following years. It is really not bad though, just not as good as the first one.\n\nThe plot tries to up the ante by changing the Templar mythos to Mayan gods, legends, and doomsday predictions, but the new enemies are nowhere near as organised or threatening as the Neo-Templars were, and the low variety of scenery (mostly jungles) make it feel more of a step backwards. There are also several parts where progression is tied to lots of talking and running around in circles, unnecessarily halting progression.\nThere is much larger focus on dialogues, which undoubtedly have improved a lot since the first game, along with the voice acting and the audio quality. Thank heavens these conversations are rarely plot dumps, but unless you like slow-paced adventure games, they will feel like just padding added there to prolong game time.\n\nThe puzzles themselves followed the Monkey Island formula: even more complicated, even less logical. Their main focus is to disguise the slightly shorter run time of about 8-10 hours. (If you don’t get lost. If you try the jungle maze without help, you can wander there for days.) Don’t worry though; it’s not King’s Quest of Gabriel Knight 3 levels, just old-school adventure game difficulty, perfect for anyone who wants some old-school point ‘n’ click adventure.","April 9, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So, here we go!\n\nBroken Sword 2 - the Smoking Mirror is an adventure game that has its fair share of flaws. But oh boy, is it fun!\n\nThe game was released in 1997, back in the golden era of point and click adventure games (after the huge success of the first game), and I'm so happy to say it's aged quite well. In fact, I found the character portraits/facial expressions which are exclusive to the remastered edition completely unnecessary. Most of them are plain bad (starting with George's and Nico's) while others bear no resemblance to the actual characters they represent.\n\nThe Smoking Mirror is incredibly slow paced. You can't make your heroes run nor can you double-click on a location to be instantly transferred there. If you're striving for fast gameplay, you can rest assured there's none here.\n\nOne more thing - the game is very linear. Even though you get to travel the globe with George and Nico and visit so many places - most of them really colorful and interesting (bar London) - you are actually "stuck" in one place until you solve all the puzzles which are required to advance the story. Gone is the map from the first game that allows you to choose where you want to go and gives you the freedom of exploring the game the way you want it.\n\nThis also makes The Smoking Mirror shorter than many other games from the time (and more recent ones) - the game can be finished in 5-6 hours and there's not much to come back to once the main story is over (there are only a few easter eggs throughout the game).\n\nFlaws aside, Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror is still a must for every (true) fan of adventure games. The story will get you hooked from the start and you'll want to get to the bottom of the mystery revolving around a stone of Mayan origin and a (missing) professor. Of course, being a classic adventure game, TSM will make you face all kinds of obstacles and puzzles that have to be solved using your brain. Most of them (I'd say 85%) are based on pure logic so you shouldn't have too many problems if you've played other adventure games (or you can always go with the popular method of using all your inventory items with world objects/characters until you get a winning combination). Also, the remastered version includes a progressive hint system, so you can find your way around even the most complex puzzles in no time.\n\nMost of the characters have been voiced really well, while the music is nice and never gets in the way. There's just enough music to make for a relaxed atmosphere or a tense moment. The ambient sounds are also up to par.\n\nOne final thing to note is that there are a few places where making the wrong decision will get your hero(es) killed. If you haven't played classic adventure games from the 90s, you may find this strange, but it was considered perfectly normal back then. So, save often and you won't have to restart the game from a much earlier point.\n\nAll in all, Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror is the sequel to a fantastic adventure game that tries to keep the winning formula (more or less) intact and make some things even simpler, resulting in a casual-player-friendly title. The remastered version goes one step further in this regard and throws a hint system (and a nice diary) in the mix, making sure that you never get stuck and that you finish what could've definitely been a longer story (with a rushed final chapter) even faster. Still, it's more than deserving of your attention, especially if you get it on sale.","March 6","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Apparetly this game wasn't as well received as the first one. Why?! In my opinion it's even better! The first game was brilliant of course though. And this one starts a completely new adventure, not reated to the Templar storyline (so kinda irrelevant to the title "Broken Sword"), but there are references to it and you meet some of the same characters again. The story is fascinating, I managed to interest my cousin with it even though he never plays such games. And the riddles are even better and more satisfying to solve in this game in my opinion. Overall I love this game. I was happy to play it again after all these years in this Remastered edition. Which by the way has no significant changes: they gave it a new interface with help system for those who are stuck and too tired to think, and they added portraits of the characters speaking.","November 13, 2012","true","9.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The only con in relation to the first game is the playtime, which I found it shorter by some 3 hours. Anyhow, Broken Sword 2 deals, yet again, with an interesting theme, this time, the Mayans and their myth of the god Tezcatlipoca. It's different from the Templars and in a good way. The graphics and animations are pretty much the same and Broken Sword still can achieve to be a comical game at some stages. The ending was the only aspect I found a bit disappointing, as it looked to be kind of rushed out and after the main enemy had been dealt with... It simply ended. Concluding, if you enjoyed the first Broken Sword - you will most surely enjoy the second one.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=425701745","April 18, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game felt much like most sequels to popular movies are rushed and not done quite as well as its predecessor. Ever seen Ocean's Twelve? Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom? Jaws 2? Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen? Quantum of Solace? Grease 2? Son of the Mask? Now I'm not saying that all of these movies were downright terrible, although many of them were pretty bad. What I'm trying to show is that none of these ever lived up to the first movie in the series and this game is unable to live up to the high standard of Broken Sword 1 (If you would like, I have a review on Broken Sword 1 as well). Few movies and video games ever do, but they are out there that can match and sometimes do better. Monkey Island 2? Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers?\n\nThe story seemed like a quick weekend brain storming session that they slapped together (I ended up finding the game to be very linear and lacking in plot), the character interactions were unpleasant (I fell in love with the characters of George and Nico, but in this game they act like jerks and lost much of their appeal. And the sunglasses, really?), and the puzzles were slightly more simplistic than the first. So pretty much everything I had enjoyed before was now gone.\n\nI do understand that if people become attached to a video game or movie series that it is possible to overlook these not so great aspects and still enjoy what others find to be terrible. For me, Monkey Island and Indiana Jones fall into this category. People will continue to complain about Escape from Monkey Island, Temple of Doom, and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I can see where these people are coming from, but surprisingly enough, none of them bother me. If you are a die hard fan of Broken Sword 1, you should probably get this game. If not, you could probably live without it.\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!","July 14, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Smoking Mirror deals with Central American mythology, which should be as interesting as the Knights Templars in the first game... unfortunately, it isn't. Much of the game is spent in the Caribbean jungle, which just isn't as interesting or vibrant as Paris and the rest of the first game was. Furthermore, George and Nico are separated for much of the game, which sucks as their banter really is a high point of the series!\n\nA big problem, as I see it, is also that the ethics of George and Nico seem to bounce all over the place: They seem like nice, respectful people - until they suddenly start smashing priceless artifacts, trapping people to steal their private property and causing harm to innocents to accomplish their own goals. All while smiling and cracking jokes. Some of these actions go very poorly with the usual likeability of the two protagonists, and can tend to break immersion at points and make the game a little too Monkey Island'ish. Monkey Island never took itself seriously - Broken Sword 2 seems unsure of whether it wants to or not.\n\nAlso, due to your characters having to walk pre-defined pathes, when at sections of the game that require a lot of running around, the game can seemingly slow to a crawl. It's not as bad as a game like Syberia, but the impatient will probably be annoyed.\n\nThere are animated sequences in this game, but they are few, far apart and all end very abruptly. It's like watching Disney on a budget!\n\nThe "Remastered" edition, unfortunately, is really a detriment to the game, as the new HD portraits don't fit with the classic graphics AT ALL, and much of the time breaks the immersion, as the portraits have a very limited range of emotions.\n\nStill, the old George Stobbart charm is still present, and his witty remarks really carry a game that would otherwise somewhat suck. All in all, though, this is by far the worst of the original 3 Broken Sword games, and, really, should be skipped by anyone who is not a dedicated fan of the series.","July 23, 2014","false","4.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

By the time I got around to playing, it had been upgraded to the "remastered" 2010 edition. I don't know what the difference is but it would have been nice to be given the choice between the two rather than to force it on me. Apparently the update is aimed towards iOS and Android devices, not so great for PCs.\n\nThe difference between this and the first game in the series is fairly apparent. There are less engaging puzzles. It's more trial and error, typical point-and-click mechanics. The story is fairly bland but was interesting enough to keep me going.\n\nSome parts are frustrating in a bad way. Having to complete things in a specific order to unlock a certain conversation option, when another method is clearly apparent yet unapproachable, is so very typical of many poorly designed adventure games of the '90s and BSII is no different.\n\nThere are many abrupt animation cues and continuity errors that make scene transitions jarring. The ending seemed rushed too; there was no closing dialogue, it just cuts to credits. Not to mention the credit title theme song repeats three times. There are also many grammatical errors and typos present in the subtitles. You will often hear a character say something completely different to what you are reading, not to mention some of the voice acting is terrible. Nico's character sounds completely different from the first game, I did not enjoy her performance at all.\n\nBSII may have been an amazing game for its time, but it doesn't hold a flame to the likes of the Monkey Island series, and it doesn't particularly hold up to today's standards either, even with the recent remastered upgrade. There are still many issues plaguing the update that were meant to be fixed, including poor sound quality that continues to persist.\n\nI can only recommend this game if you're a die hard fan of the genre.","November 14, 2012","false","9.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The character interaction and writing in BS1 was intensely witty and funny, the script of BS2 has its funny moments but was more cynical and mean spirited. Nico was voice acted by a different person and the new actress's voice over was terrible. Though George did a lot of the leg work in the first Broken Sword, you still felt that Nico was an active partner in the relationship. She was just completly useless in BS2. She was pranced around like a little princess waiting for George to do everything.

It's not about the intuitive leaps that make adventure gaming great; it's about your tolerance for the slog.\n\nBeing short isn't some egregious sin.

After an interesting intro, the story stagnates and barely anything happens until the end. I remember repeatedly thinking "What am I doing here? Why am I talking to these people? What does this have to do with the story?" Finally in the end, the whole story is wrapped up in a single (non-interactive) cutscene.\n- Shorter, less mysterious, less suspenseful, more linear, less intricate version of the first game.","August 22, 2015","false","10.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Pleased that Duane and Pearl make a reappearance from Broken Sword 1.  Puzzles occasionally frustrating, a lot of back-and-forth dialogue puzzles where you need to coordinate between NPCs who are across the map from eachother.  The game is cut into discrete level-like segments, so you never need to worry about backtracking to previous areas.  There is a full in-game hint system, which unfortunately sometimes gives you the wrong hint -- telling you to go talk to an NPC, but not telling you what unrelated actions will unlock the dialogue options that you need to continue.\n\nAn acceptable game, especially with a walkthrough, but not one I'd go far out of my way for.  Buy it on sale.\n\n[edit] Made it to the end -- it fell into the cardinal sin of games/movies in this general genre.  It let the magical macguffin overpower all of the human characters bickering over it, a la Indiana Jones 4.  Though one character was redeemed that I did not expect, which was nice.","August 25, 2015","false","13.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The way I see it, if you really enjoyed the first one, this should be fine. Otherwise, tread with caution. For me, it simply came down to the fact that it required more time than it rewarded, and I no longer cared enough about the protagonists or story to see it through to completion\n\nWe once again join George and Nico in another escapade to solve mysteries (I'm tempted to hum the Scooby Doo theme tune here) - though George's usual charm seems to be laced with a bit more obnoxiousness here. Him and Lobineau find it more fitting to trade terse ripostes than actually try to find out if Nico is ok. You're then breaking into private land, smashing artefacts and plunging a dog into the ocean... I found George becoming more unlikeable as I went along. The antagonist Karzac and his henchmen aren't particularly interesting either. All in all, the characters felt weaker this time around, and for such a story-driven game, this is a considerable problem\n\nThe shark-jump for me, however... was being on the docks and repeatedly having an overweight watchman fart in my face (no, I'm serious) - At that point, the game seemed to move beyond serious plot laced with humour, to just plain silly. It just didn't seem to know whether to take itself seriously\n\nI'm also not sure on the graphics. The game itself is fine - But the portraits lacked the visual appeal from before, particularly in the speech animations. George in particular had a rather creepy expression (a small grin, from the side) which looks like he intends to watch you inappropriately in your sleep\n\nThe one thing Broken Sword 2 DID do, was remove some of the unnecessary dialogue options. So when chatting to people, you at least don't have to potentially click through every item in your inventory, but just the important ones and a handful of funny ones too. The catch is that a lot of the puzzles seem to be lacking too. It fell again to a lot of dialogue. The worst was landing in Quaramonte - Pretty much having to talk to the entire town repeatedly, walking back and forth between screens until I managed to trigger another talking point with another character... who happened to be on the other side of town... it was a very tedious section and I just didn't feel very challenged or engaged\n\nIt's a shame. But personally, the plot just wasn't strong enough to carry to slower pace. And likewise, the puzzles weren't exciting or challenging enough to compensate for the weaker storyline","December 9, 2014","false","3.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Yet they are so little that this game doesn't feel like another game at all but that's not really an issue soo moving on. We are still dealing with average P&C mechanics, puzzles, annoyingly slow moving characters like the first one but two main points are pretty much sucks compared to the first one. First is the secondary lead character Nico. They changed her voice actor and the new one is really bad, especially compared to first one. "Luckily" you don't hear her voice much because Nico's role in this game and ceratinly as the lead is very little. I don't know what the hell the creators were thinking but that's just wrong. Second biggest mistake they made is the story. All that's going on in this game has little to do with the first game at best. Plus it's not even a good story. Cliche bad guys, escapes, end of the world etc. Why they would choose to start from scratch is beyond me but it's not a wise choice at all.\nTo sum up: This clearly shows rushing after a successful game doesn't bring another success.","March 20, 2015","false","7.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The game itself builds upon the original, but it somewhat falters in two points and one of those is arguable; it strays just a tiny bit from mostly logical puzzles of the original and Mayan mythology as the crux of the story may not exactly be everyone's cup of tea compared to more universal Templar mysteries. Also worth noting is the absolutely needlessly dragged out puzzle at the end that has you turning wheels to match symbols. These things still fail at besmirching one of the better P&C adventures out there, though.","July 14, 2013","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

They come with the original games along with the remasters. Steam version does not\n\nBroken Sword 2 takes the formula of the first Broken Sword game and improves it. Everything from story to the characters to the puzzles are improved. Except I don't know why they took out the one feature the first game had where if you clicked on a doorway you instantly switched scenes instead of waiting for the character to walk all the way. It's also slightly shorter which I count as a positive because Broken Sword games never had complex enough stories to deserve being too long and that's where the first game failed in my opinion.

Once again our protagonist duo, George Stobbart and Nicole Collard, are thrust into a story filled with mystery, danger, suspense, and have to use their skills to make it out alive.\n\nJust like in the previous game, the story is pretty straightforward, with no shocking plot twists or anything. But still, it is very enjoyable, as the writers once again took a relativle simple plot and made it great with clever and witty writing and an interesting diverse cast. George and Nico are an excelent duo, retaining their incredible chemistry from the first game, and are stll backed up by great voice acting and dialogue. Some of the memorable side characters from the previous game make their appearance again, adding to the ensemble of colorful side characters who still have crazy and memorable lines.\n\nIn terms of graphics, the remastered version offers a full screen options, and slightly more detailed sprites, although this isn't a field I pay much attention to. However, I did enjoy the fully-animated drawn cutscenes.\n\nAlso, the game features one of the most insane easter eggs ever. Towards the end of the game, there is puzzle which, although not very difficult, does require a fair amount of time to complete, and multiple iterations of the same actions, which can be tedious. Well, in case you want to skip it... the developers put in an amazing way to get past it. Spoiling it in a review would be a shame, so I leave it up to you to search it on youtube. Seeing it is far more entertaining.\n\nThis is an excellent p'n'c adventure game with an excellent story, characters and fun puzzles. I recommend it to any fan of the genre, definitely worth your purchase.","October 18, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
