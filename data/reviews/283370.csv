"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/283370/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Absolute rubbish in every sense of the word. Where do I even start. Budget shooter from 10 years ago plays even worse than it sounds. Graphics are from 1999, not 2004 when it was released. You use the exact same bolt action sniper, pistol, and knife the whole game. Cannot pick up other weapons. The levels are super linear and look terrible. Bushes in the jungle block bullets and you can't move through them, basically making them blocks which makes no sense for a game called "jungle warfare" Enemies just run forward blindly or stand around while their teamates get shot. On the other end of the spectrum they always know where you are so if you try and sneak it basically will never work. Ammo is not picked up off bodies but in certain specific spots the developers chose. You face ridiculously high amounts of enemies each part where you just headshot them from far away, sometimes which doesn't kill them even though it hits them in the head. I got to a basically unbeatable sand level where all the problems of the game came together. The level is super linear and you cannot go through buildings or open doors. The stealth does not work. The game tells you to stay away from the streeets but there are enemies standing on it and you cannot go any other way but the linear way. When you shoot 1 guy 10 guys come. After having killed around 60-80 guys I just ran out of ammo on my main gun and pistol, and since the developers have no tents or buildings you could find ammo in since it wasn't on the street I just lost. My ♥♥♥♥♥ teamate also didn't help, as he died one of the times I made it past the guys. Your teamate is worthless. He runs out into the open, never kills anyone (mostly because his sniper does absolutely no damage for some reason) he will not follow you sometimes. He also will stand there and take a ton of damage and then not use his medkits even though he needs to, for some unexplicable reason. The only redeamable features I can put is that this is in fact technically "a game" and that fun is too be had whenever your spotter partner says to sneak around or not engage with a group/area, and I just fire away and slaughter them all as if to say "fuuuck you" to my ♥♥♥♥♥ AI teamate. That was the only fun I had. This game has negative reviews for a reason, trust them. 3.5/10","December 29, 2014","false","2.8"," 134 of 155 people (86%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","86","134","155","17","0"

In a game about sniping having a render distance 200m out with a thick fog covering everything beyond is just no good.  Also, it's easy.\n\nIt's very, very, very, very easy.  Maybe it's because I played on normal, but I just shot every guy that came on screen in the head.  It's not even that I'm particularly good at aiming, I just waited for them to run in front of my targeting reticule.  Then once or twice I got attacked by guys in bushes I didn't see  They shot at me.  So you know, panic.  Then I realized they weren't even hitting me.  They were missing.  I walked directly into an ambush, and they completely missed me.  I have no idea if playing on a harder difficulty fixes that, but that happened two or three more times. Pretty bad.\n\nAlso, can I bring up again that this game somehow thinks space bar is f12?","July 11, 2014","false","0.3"," 68 of 81 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","68","81","6","0"

It's a little dated   graphically by todays standards, being around 10 years old, but what really  spoils the game  for me considering it's a  sniper game,  I couldn't see any cross hairs through the scope.  Checking you tube  videos of the same mission i was playing, it clearly shows  cross haris, so  whether the Steam version has a bug or whether it's my own computer  that's the culprit, i cannot say at this time.  I do update my  drivers regularily and  I've got loads of graphics RAM (6GB)   All I get when  using the sniper scope, is a  distance  indicator.  When trying to snipe OpFor it's almost impossible to hit them.\n\nI've played  loads of  dedicated sniper games as well as  games with sniper rifles and have never had a problem  hitting my target, whether it's a basic FPS game with no real bullet physics or a game like ArmA II or 3 where you have to take account of  bullet drop.  In Marine Sharpshooter II,  the only way I was able to kill an OpFor was to stick the barrel in  his  faces at less than 10 feet.\n\nIf this is a  global problem on Steam, I cannot recommend the game.\n\nIf i'm able to fix the cross hairs problem, i will  re write this review.  You can see a You Tube video of what the game should look like HERE\n\n","November 5, 2014","false","2.2"," 60 of 86 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","60","86","8","0"

The story is incredibly in-depth, easy to follow, nor is it generic. It's really something a person has to experience, the BREATH-TAKING experience of looking down your scope and placing the enemy in your crosshair. The AI is incredibly realistic, accurately depicting how any average individual would react in such a situation. For example, when you shoot your teammate (the story is so good and original I can't even remember his name) he responds with "Receiving fire!", or maybe even "Returning fire!", yet he never does. Now, you may ask yourself, "How is this realistic if he never returns fire to you, the teammate who shot him?", when you look at it from a psychological level, he sees you as a father figure in his life, he originally thought someone in the treelines in this dangerous world took a potshot at him, but then when he knew it was you, he realized his mistakes..

I have this game for about 1 years now, but i haven't play it until now. It took half an hour from my life. But let me tell something about this "game".\n\nStory:\nYou are an american sniper who is fighting against the evil rebels of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ country, because the rebels have taken the president as a hostage. That's it. I know it's an old game, but seriously... For example this game is older than TES Morrowind... I know it's not the same genre, because this is an action game. At least the developers say it's an action game.\n\nGameplay:\nYou have a mate, who is a spotter... or something. He randomly says that he sees an enemy, and put a marker on your ♥♥♥♥ing tiny minimap. And sometimes when the enemy sees you, he fires back, but he is like a stormtrooper from star wars, so don't expect that he can protect you.\nThe entiry game is ♥♥♥♥ING SLOW. I mean you can't sprint, nothing happens while you are walking, and you have the chance to get an eye cancer from the poorly designed map.\nAnd the game if fairly easy even on the hardest difficulty. There is just one rule: If you keep 100m from your enemy, they will not fire at you.\n\nWeapons:\nYour main weapon is a sniper rifle, which is a very slow, and doesn't have much ammo. It's not really accurate, and but it acts like a shotgun. Because if you fire, sometimes you can hear the shooting sound twice, and even if you shot next to the enemy, it still counts as a hit. And as any other sniper related games, you have the always mooving crosshair.\nYour secondary weapon is a beast i should say. It's an accurate, silent, killing machine. Even though it's just an M9 pistol.\nYou also have a knife, but it sometimes works, sometimes not.\nThere is more weapon in the game, but i didn't get to the point in the game where i could use them.\n\nControls:\nIt's the worst part of the game. I don't even know where to begin... The mouse sensitivity is too damn high, and you can't lower it. The zoom on your main rifle is controlled by the scrolling wheel. I think this was the "innovative thing" in the game, beacause I haven't seen this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in any other game. But these are just the tip of the iceberg. THE KEYS ARE MESSED UP!If you try to jump, steam will make a screenshot which is not just annoying, but also means if you jump too much, your harddrive will be full of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pictures of you jumping. And it's messed up whithin the game, because no matter what key you have the jump on, it will always do that. And it's not the only case. You can't use the quickload feature, because it will shoot for you automatically.\n\nGraphics:\nYou can't change the aspect ratio, and you have very few options to choose from in graphics. Just as many as on a console. The grass sometimes light, sometimes dark without transition.

A forever going loop of mixed sound files with no variation whatsoever.  3/10\n\nCinematics - Unskippable, if I am watching a game cinematic and I want to skip it, it means that there is nothing of interest happening or the dialogue that you have implemented isn't progressing the overall story. Well this game does just that, a frame where subtitles are moving and they are telling you the same thing for the 4-5'th time. 4/10\n\nStory - Cliché, you are the *chosen* one, who has to go and save the president, you have to go through a bunch of rainforests and deserts, battle fearsome africans, who for some reason all wear camouflage clothes, but never blend in with the terrain. A story used way too many times, in mediums more than one, just this particular use is badly implemented. 3/10\n\nContent - Could have used some more, some rainforest as well as deserts, guns galore (3), the fiercest africans you have ever laid your eyes upon and let's not forget the best new thing in games ever, bushes which provide cover. For a sniper, who should always be in the tall grass and killing enemies from a safe distance, the addition of cover bushes, wasn't a smart one (sarcasm can be hard to understand through text). 4/10\n\nControls - Stiff, I don't need to go in depth here, just one little detail that amazingly covers it all, they just had to make the movement a little less robot like. 2/10      *Bonus detail: Never make the screenshot button the same as jump*\n\nGameplay - The pace of the whole game, was a problem, either it is going way too slowly or way too fast, never inbetween. Also that you start a mission from the middle of nowhere and when you get to the end, you end in the middle of nowhere, are you teleported out of there ? 3/10\n\nOverall a game that had premise, but failed to deliver. It isn't anything revolutionary, that a game promised more and delivered little, but to this day, there are still games that do that, this had to end a long time ago. Futhermore, who in the right mind would give 9 euros/dollars for a 12 year old game ?\n\nFinal Score: 3.3/10","May 1","false","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

After 21 minutes of gaming I had 13 screenshots. The enemies have such amazing awareness it can not even compete with ARMA.

I really felt like the action was happening in my living room! No VR headset was on during this i have to add.\n\nAs I was playing it, I managed to completely destroy some black people that were completely oblivious to my presence, which made it much, much easier. It really felt like i was killing people. I thought about their family as I imagined them dying. I have to visualize the kill before commiting to it, so that was a hard task. After playing this game, I did no longer feel like I had to shoot children to compensate my hate for humanity. This is the best 59p I have ever spend. Thank Myself for this beautiful piece of software engineering.\n\nMany game developers could learn a lesson or two from playing this game.\n\nI would recommend this game for anyone that feels like shooting up a school. Even an office. Or a small shop maybe?\n\nYou could also go to the shop and support them by spending 59p on a chocolate bar. It will probably taste better.\n\nTL;DR: Don't buy this. It is trash.

The graphics are a little bit better than playstation 1, which doesn't say much. It seems to be a low budget title. However, after the introduction, the game crashed. Every time I got to that point, it would crash, giving me an error that said, "Clint MFC Application" error or something like that. I did a little research, and found that somebody had said that he fixed the problem by changing the settings. The problem is with the 32 bit color, which cannot be changed in the settings. You must locate the game local game files, then open a file called display.cfg (I think) with notepad. Change the color settings from 32 to 16, save the file, then close. This fixed the problem for me as well.\n\nThe game screamed low budget. However, the first level seemed like it might have potential. It seems that if you hide in the brush, the enemies don't see you until you shoot one of them. The problem is that they seem to detect you automatically, no matter how hidden you are. Other times, an enemy sniper is shooting you, and you have absolutely no idea where he is. I was getting shot, but could barely tell because the game does very little to indicate when you've been shot. Even after this, I saw what looked like a med-pack on the ground, but couldn't seem to pick it up and use it. Perhaps, these are things that get better or easier as you learn the game, however, for a quick trial, I was not impressed.","April 12, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
