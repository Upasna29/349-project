The developer is so hands on with updates, balancing, fixes, adding content and news of whats to come. I have played enough hours now to say that I am happy to be part of this early access game. Not to mention the addition of cards the other day, and achievments coming soon. It makes me a bit sad to see someone playing this game for five minutes and giving it a bad review. Survivors doesn't deserve that, it deserves better. It is fun to look forward to new buildings, and play changes week after week. There are issues sometimes, but it is always worked on fast.","April 28, 2015","true","12.7"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","46","52","0","1"

Survivors basically a god game. When you start playing the game, the main menu only has three options (Start game, Load Game, and Exit Game). There is no option for a tutorial, or options. Once you start a game, there are tons of buttons and options, but no explanation on what you are exactly supposed to do. Once you figure out what everything does and how to play the game is fun, yet extremely unforgiving. I believe this game would be a 100% recommendation if it had a tutorial.

You place a few structures and then let the game play itself, or try to as the AI seems extremely random and if it tends to bump into something then it'll interact with it.  The finished product may be more refined and polished, and the developer is relatively active with frequent (and major) updates, so keep an eye on it.\n\nI'd personally like to see the villagers have more freedom in building, where you can designate areas for types of buildings  to build, and they sort of construct their own little town based on population and demand, a sort of low-scale Sim City with more resource management.  and I'm sure at some point the game will offer a step-by-step simple tutorial for first time players to learn the basics of needed resources, but I imagine that'll come along later when more features are added so it doesn't have to be constantly revised.","May 1, 2015","false","13.0"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","8"

The play style and overall theme is similar to "Retro-Pixel Castles", albeit a more simplistic version. You don't actually control your subjects, but you can construct houses, build wheat fields, and so on.  My biggest gripe is the lack of a zoom feature...from what I told, such a feature would require the developer to recode the game.  I admittedly know little about programming, so I don't know how much of an undertaking that really is. Time controls would be welcome too as most of your time will be spent watching and waiting for your subjects to collect the resources they need for you to keep expanding.  It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's not a bad diversion for its current price tag.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4_skZVdI0M","March 22, 2015","true","10.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","4"

To shape your island you use mana, this mana replenishes over time (or as far as i can tell it does it seems very inconsistent). But i will return to mana later in the review.\n\nStarting with the good, the game offers you complete creative freedom in how your island is shaped where things are placed,and how big your population can get.  But mana is depleted with every tile of land you add. On every tile there will randomly be coal iron trees or a chicken. These are but a few of the resources you will use. Over all i think the mana for land situation is pretty good because as your population grows,and your production power as does your land mass. Because of this creativity steam sharing to share islands would be amazing.\n\nWhen you first start the game you really don't have much control, and this is jarring. In all honesty for the first 20  minutes it felt like i could do nothing to affect my creation. But after discovering the other mana ability aura, which allows you to lead your people for 10 seconds at the cost of 10 mana. When i first started playing i hated this but now i see that it does add strategy and depth of resource management, but i still am not a fan of having the cost be that high.\n\nThe graphics are cute and simplistic, very minimalist. Over all i like them they fit the situation. But animation is pretty much non existent. When you collect any resources you just walk by i would like at least a pick up animation.\nBut even without it will suffice.\n\nThere is no tutorial in this game. There are not any hints on how to acquire materials or what order is recommended. To add to this to increase or resupply your population you need a male and female if all of one gender dies there is currently no way to get that gender back, So that is a literal death sentence for that save. Even placing your buildings in the wrong order can cause restart after restart.\n\nover all 7/10 i will be coming back to this one","May 24, 2015","true","2.2"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","23","32","3","1"

Add a progress bar on the chicken pens, crops, mine, etc to be able to see when resources will be produced (even if it's only visible when hovering over the resource).\n\nStone and food were my problems, maybe add more stone to the land generation or lower the stone needed in the most basic buildings.\n\nAgain, nice game and keep up the good work~","May 5","true","1.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zuty/recommended/342970/","Zuty","Zuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zuty/","34 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'll start off by saying that I am glad I only spent $1 on this game. It's not that the game is bad, but it's also not good. As it sits, the game is a nice little time waster. There is still plenty of work to be done, but the developer(s) seem to be very involved in the game and listen to the community. In fact, when I first started playing the game there were a few serious bugs that were fixed within 15-20 minutes after someone posted about them on the forums.\n\nIn the game you create tiles of land that each generate a random basic resource: Stone, Lumber, and Food. Your only limit to creating more land is your mana; which is currently disabled, so you have an infinite amount of mana to work with for the time being. You start off the game with two villagers who spawn on one of the tiles you place. The villagers than gather these resources and you put down plots for buildings which the villagers than build. However, the erratic movement of your villagers reminds me of the ball from 'Pong'. They bounce around the map, collecting the resources they happen to pass through, and only work on a building if they touch it. So having a small map in the beginning means your villagers will actually do the tasks you want them to do, but also give you access to less resources. There is also a feature called Aura which allows you to direct your villagers to a single point at the cost of some mana. It can be frustrating at time to use and when mana is turned back on you'll end up spending more mana on moving your villagers around than on expanding the map.\n\nAnd even if you do everything correctly, be prepared for your villagers to die frequently. I've built houses for my villagers, farms so they can have food, and a tailor shop so they can have warm clothes; yet my villagers always seem to freeze and starve to death. The penalty for a villager dying is a good idea on paper, but it doesn't seem to work out very well in practice. Whenever a villager dies the number of zombies goes up by one. At night, that many zombies will spawn in and attack your villagers. The reason that it doesn't work out to well, is because the zombies move just as erratically as your villagers and they end up walking right past one another. Once the sun rises, the remaining zombies disapear and the number resets to zero.\n\nWould I recommend this game? If it were still $1 and someone I knew was really interested in it, I would recommend it. But that's not the case; there is plenty of potential and the game can only get better. As it sits right now, I would not recommend it. I'll continue to play it from time to time, especially when new updates come out for it.","June 7, 2015","false","2.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

I really enjoyed it.  I will say, the tutorial, is meh...it kind of gives you the basics, but at first I completely lost my first few colonies.  Kind of hard to find information, so pretty much figured it out myself...which in itself was fun when I finally got it...and have established a colony of 50+ ppl, on my way to 100.\n\nOf course I do have a few complaints, and hopefully they get taken care of in beta:\n1.  Slows down.  I put it in the fastest speed, and I find that it slows then picks up, and repeats.  I was playing it for a couple of hours in a row though, so, haven't tried to see if it goes away after a load, but hopefully that whole issue gets fixed.\n2. Placement of objects...I found for putting down most items you had to click the UI, then click where you want to put it, then if you wanted a 2nd, you had to click the ui again then place it again.  Wish I could select, and just pop as many down as I want until i cancel it (would be nice if right mouse button would deselect current building item...kind of how some other games do it).\n3. In some respects I wish I could assign colonists to wood/stone/coal/iron/etc gathering.  Because it's annoying seeing your guys gathering more than the current limit you have of say wood, when you are severly low on rocks or something else.

Nevertheless, this game is still in very early beta.\n\nAs far as world builder games go, there are various games to choose from, from Populous to Dwarf Fortress, and as far as city builder games go, there are a ton of those, from SimCity to Banished, very rarely do games try to do both.\n\nSurvivors is a game in which you play as a god type figure and build an island and start a village on said island. You start with a couple of small homes and slowly build a giant society, with chickens, barley fields, knights and so on.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, this is decent for a city builder. It starts out relatively forgiving and kind, but by the time you have a couple of little pixelated soldiers ready to defend their village, the game starts giving you enemies to attack you and gradually gets harder and harder the bigger your village gets. It's pretty tame and shouldn't really mess up anyone.\n\nGraphics are kinda meh, simple and small, made to not eat up RAM. The in-game music is also pretty good, similar to Banished style of music and not too annoying, a bit loud yes, but not sandpaper rubbed on chalkboard annoying.\n\nAs for cons, there are some pretty obnoxious cons to the game. The main one is the fact this game is in early access. The game is raw, like fresh meat raw, it's glitchy, underfinished, and crashes at random. It's raw. However, the developer is working a lot harder than other early access title devs. While some devs just dump their games onto early access so they can rake in as much money as possible before getting shut down, the dev for Survivors has been putting out updates very frequently, which is good.\n\nAlso, the price for this game is a lot nicer than other Early Access games. A whopping $3.99. Not a lot in comparison with other game titles on Steam now is it.\n\nTL:DR: Survivors is a promising early access city builder/god game that has some really good ideas behind it and has a very dedicated game developer behind it as well. While at the moment the game is incredibly bare bones, it has enough potential to be a good game in the future, and it's only $4.","April 18, 2015","true","6.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

While it has a lot of promise, it needs far more work to actually be a game I would suggest to a friend to buy. It reminds me a lot of other, similar games but lacks a key feature that those city-builder/survival games have and that is a motivation to the AI controlled villagers.\n\nIn a game like Banished or Dwarf Fortress, which I am greatly reminded of, the villagers are outside of your control, but they have various jobs or tasks that they prioritize which allows for you to create a thriving village without having to hope that your villagers bump into the things you need them to bump into, as is the case with this game.\n\nIt's possible that the randomly roaming villagers is actually intended to be a feature and that you should design your cities around that, but in my opinion that is a flawed premise and does not make for enjoyable gameplay.","July 28, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You can also build houses to get more villagers.\nYou can build Tailors, libraries, and much more for improve the survival of your village.\n\nTailors needs Cotton and Leather to craft clothes, Blacksmith needs stone and wood to make tools, and so on.\n\nYou can build graves for your villagers when they die so they don't lay around on the ground, and if they do they turn into zombies and you are pretty ♥♥♥♥ed if that happens early game.\n\nThe problem with the game is that your survivors are quite stupid. They do fine in the start with collecting of resources, but after a while they just walk around and only focus on food, even tho you have max food insted of looking for resources.\n\nIt could have been better and it needs more improvement of the AI.\n\nI know this is an Early Access game, but i can't recommend it.\n\n\nAdditional Infomation :Developer: Sachonski , Renamilanesi , Sith\nPublisher: Patagoniart\nGenre: Casual, Indie, Simulation\nReleased on Steam 21.

The gameplay is ok for a survival game like this, but after you figured out how to deal with the game it's more like:\n"Ok, let's get some more citizens ... oh no, food is missing. Let's produce some more... ok, now you don't have any clothes.   Here are some cotton fields. Oh wait, i don't have enough wood at the moment, because for some reason I need wood to build crop fields" 10 minutes later "Ok, here are your cotton fields. Now I can build more houses, but first I need more wood" and so on.\nSo after a while it gets boring and annoying, because it is really only survival part, without being creative like in other survival games, where you can build a city with individual houses for example.\nIf you still want to buy it, then keep in mind that this game is only good enough to fill up like 1 or 2 hours.","December 24, 2015","false","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The idea is to grow up a little civilization on an island and avoid to let them die.\n\nStrategy games are not my favorite ones but I like this one because it's not so complicated like others and it's fun.\n\nThe game has a very intuitive interface, anyone could play this game with no need of reading a lot of tutorials. In some way seems to be too basic the tutorial, but for me is just what I need, of course always could be improved. The rest? Well, it's practise. Also has a complexity, maybe I'm not good in this kind of games but I lost the population several times and only once I could reach 10 people. I sail trying an army! I hate the winter. Kills all the chickens! So, you have to carry on the economy of the game, provide shelter and food. I suggest expanding in a foresting tower, a barn, and a chicken pen at the beginning, because you'll need a lot of stone and wood for houses then, wheat, barley, etc. Try to focus on the economic balance, and don't forget the medicinal herbs and.. the graves! Yes, you have zombies here, and that's fun. The use to kill the population if you don't have a proper army.\n\nWhat I didn't like... Well, is too small maybe, the island, the tiny houses, but that's a personal looking about the art. The idea was about retro 8 bits. The population grows so slow, seems to. The music... It's quite low, I don't ask for heavy metal but something different, maybe something that changes the course of the game and not so sad. I noticed, but maybe this is sort of bug, the AI doesn't work well. I'm trying the hard mode and the of the guys refuses to go and do something or he's on strike I don't know. apart from that, as I said I liked the game. Hope you can improve with my comments!!

Another thing you can't do is build a circular island that’s 1 block wide as villagers will just pace back and forth on corners even if there's a viable path in front of them.\n\nNext off you have the villagers themselves which are the dumbest things in existence, they wander aimlessly in a zigzag pattern rarely getting resources unless they happen to bump into them making building structures near impossible. You do have little flags you can place to make villagers move but once they reach the flag they wander off and don't collect the resources. Another problem with the flags is the fact you have two flag colors red and blue, red of soldiers and blue for workers though only 1 flag can be placed at a time and if you have no soldiers or no workers you can get stuck with a red or blue flag on your island without the ability to remove it.\n\nThis game though in early access shouldn't even be here, I wouldn't even consider this game to be out of the alpha phase yet which is pretty sad. I paid 99 cents for it on sale and still asked for a refund because I'd rather keep my dollar then support this game as is.\n\nI will admit that this game might get better over time but seeing as this is just utter garbage right now it has put me off of it forever and will never pick it back up.\n\nI suggest getting Banished instead if you want a good god-like game.","August 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I'm usually so biased towards them that they could literally be sucking my soul out from my tear ducts and I would love them anyway.  That said, I cannot play this game.  I want to!  I really do!  But right now, I just can't.\n\nMainly, the issues for me boil down entirely to UI / UX so the issues are completely fixable for the future.  So that's good!  But as the game stands right now, the UI makes me want to kick puppies.  It's clunky, slow to respond, and hard to find what I want in.  And it makes it hard to see when the game is glitching and/or doing something it shouldn't be.\n\nThe game does have potential but if you are looking for something that doesn't feel like sheer work to play, this is not the game for you.

However the developer and I were able to come to an agreement to leave my review from over six months up as long as I wasn't making any monetization off my video review for this game.\n\nIt looks like all is well, and I wish the developer all the luck and future success with this and any future games that he decides to sell here on Steam.\n\n\n\n************ Original Review on March 20, 2015  *************\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e54tTEyI9Ms\n\nSighs.\n\nGraphics are horrid, yes.\n\nSo it's got a deep, compelling gameplay to make up for it right?  Nope.  You put out horrid looking graphical things and watch blips walk around and erase the horrid graphical things that give you numbers (resources) in the upper right corner.  Then you use those to build more horrid graphical thingies.\n\nUgh.\n\nBut it's a lot of fun, right?  Uhh ya, about the same amount of fun as watching paint dry.\n\nLook people.  I know it's under $3.  But you can do so much better as there are much, much better games with actual military advencement, computer AI competition, better graphics, lore, classes, and a thousand other things this game just doesn't have for less or around the same at any given time with the Steam sales.\n\nNot to mention, this is a game made with Game Maker.  Gamer Maker is solid.  But somehow they've managed to code this so horribly in Game Maker that it hard crashed my PC three times, and stopped with a Fatal Error another time.  I haven't had any game crash my computer in over two years.\n\nJust put your money into something else.  That's my advice.","March 20, 2015","false","1.2"," 23 of 54 people (43%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","43","23","54","10","19"

Here we go.\n\nGameplay: Not much to say, you start by adding land, which form people, it's very raw from where it is, assuming you can progress without the failure of bugs or crashes ending your game. Currently not worth the effort.\n\nSounds: Really basic, although it's an early access, i'd much appriciate some basic sounds, to highlight your people are alive down there.\n\nWhat I thought?\nThe game currently at it's given state is tricky, bug infested, and simply unplayable until further fixed (pathfinding, worms, most to all buildings unusable...) I like the concept of being a god, envolking the people with your powers, good or bad, and see how they react. I'd say give it a couple updates, then i'll update my review. Until then i'd say support the Developer, constant updates/listening to feedback are always a good idea for early access.\n\nEdit 2/22/2016\n\nChecked in many more hours into this..
