The difficulty escalates nicely, making for a great test of ability. The game goes along with the rhythm so the soundtrack is more than just background music.\n\nCONS: When it comes to Lumines OSTs, this is probably the weakest in the entire series. Very disappointed in the music, considering the fact that I've loved all tracks before this game. This game could benefit from intuitive leaderboards and the occasional sale, as 9.99 USD for a subpar installment is rather expensive.\n\nOVERALL: Don't buy this game at full price. It's alright, but if you own a PSP you'll want to pass up this port all together. If you don't, at the very least wait until it's on sale. (It doesn't go on sale often at all, though.) There are better puzzler/rhythm games on Steam.\n\nSCORE: 5/10","June 9, 2015","false","13.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

As it ramps up it has you trying to think 3 or 4 moves ahead to setup and create the most satisfying block combos.\nThis game is easily one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. The captivating music and sound effects fit it's addictive nature very well.\nThe only thing I don't like about this title is the lack of global leaderboards :(\nSo if you're into puzzle games and like to think on your feet while under pressure.

Each stage clears the lines for you at different rates which can keep your on your toes and trip you up(On slower stages you have to really think further ahead as you can drop a lot of blocks before the current set clears)  It's a meh port but still holds up and probably one of the better puzzlers on steam.  The only complaint I have is that games can easily pass an hour once you are good at this game.  The difficulty/drop speed goes up very slowly so it can be a good 30-45 minutes of gameplay before it starts feeling difficult, making it a bit harder to pick up and play for a quick session, the time attack mode helps alliviate this a little, but I wish the main game was slightly more difficult","March 18, 2014","true","1.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

That's how good the core game is.\n\nLet me clarify; it's the worst version out there because it has the least amount of content, not many options to tweak, and worst of all doesn't support custom content. The PC version could have stood apart and allowed custom songs/themes and instead it recycles some of the most generic songs from previous entries.There's also no DLC, so although you get to save some money buy not buying extra songs, you'd better hope what little is there will satisfy you.\n\nPut in simpler terms, if you've played previous versions of Lumines, avoid this entry, because you've literally played/seen all that it has to offer. If you've never played it before, and PC is your only option, then sure, pick it up. It's a great color matching/block busting game with a unique clear-bar mechanic.The first 2 entries on PSP were known for having pretty good soundtracks. Every entry since then has gotten a little worse in my opinion regarding music.","July 29, 2013","true","1.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tokuokatime/","38 products in account","An excellent PC port of one of my favorite puzzle games for the PSP, only hampered by the choice not to implement gamepad controls as an option. The modes are as entertaining and challenging as their original counterparts, and the music is an eclectic mix of some of the best Lumines & Lumines II skins. I highly recommend, if you don't already have it on PSP, Vita, or other Playstation consoles, that the PC port is a great way to go.","July 21, 2014","true","1.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/11900/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","The port isn't very good, but man, I loved this game back when it was first released on the PSP. The clean graphics, good music and addictive gameplay; it all made sense. The goal is to create cubes (by using cubes). The cubes that fall down have two colors so you have to match them and try to make as many cubes as possible before the 'beat line' moves over them. It's really a line that moves from the left to the right (apparently on the beat of the music, but I'm usually too focused to notice) and clears the cubes. Of course things speed up after a while until you are overwhelmed. It has a lot of similarities to Tetris actually (it's hard to create a game like this these days that doesn't use Tetris elements so I can live with it. Besides; Tetris rules !). Anyway, the game itself is definitely worth it, the port itself, however... not really. If you can get it cheap, do yourself a favor and get it immediately though.\n\n[Rating: 80/100]","July 7, 2011","true",""," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I wish more were available on Steam. Maybe Meteos. Rezz would also be cool to see.\nLumines started on the PlayStation Portable but translates well to PC.

If you've played the PSP or Vita releases, the gameplay is largely the same: rotate the 2x2 bricks to match up colors for the timeline to pass over and delete. Changeups in the speed of the timeline and of the falling bricks keep you on your toes.\n\nNow, while the gameplay is still as fun as ever, unfortunately this port is a bit gutted: a lot of the best songs from the first two titles unfortunately didn't make it into the game, since many are licensed tracks, nor did the incredibly fun (and frustrating) VS Mode of LUMINES II. The difficulty also doesn't seem to ramp up quite as quickly as it does in the handheld titles, even on the higher difficulty tracklists. While this can be great for new players, for seasoned experts, it does mean you may not be playing this one for long, and the few alternate puzzle modes don't too much to alleviate that.\n\nBut, if you haven't picked up a handheld LUMINES title before, or if you don't happen to have a PSP or Vita, I highly recommend it.","March 15, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Tetris-ish, but a different style of block removal: instead of lines, each completed 4x4 square is removed by a vertical line, sweeping from left to right, allowing for chains and interesting geometric combos. With variable speed, eye-bending palette shifts and single power-up, LUMINES rides the line between monotonous and mesmerizing. Despite how few hours I have on record on Steam, I played this game non-stop on my PSP on a tour in Iraq as a soldier. It's the perfect game for zoning out the world, whether 5 minutes or 8 hours.","June 20, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
