See Conclusion\nNOTE: I clocked around 5-6 hours in this game but mostly while Steam was OFFLINE. Steam does not count game-time in Offline Mode.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Battle Fleet 2 is a top-down turn based strategy game by Capital j Media. It was made for both the mobile platform and the PC which was released simultaneously. The game features multiple ship classes, each having their own unique weapon systems and abilities with a tactical and strategic map you can play on.\n\nThe player can either be an Admiral for the United States Pacific Fleet or the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Second World War. The game has an open world map including most major areas during the war like: Japan, Philippines, Australia, Wake Islands, Hawaii and many more. Lead your fleet into victory through careful planning, precision attacks, Navy composition and proper positioning.\n\nPROS:+ Acceptable graphics with very detailed ship designs. (although the water graphics is nice, the land texture could use a little more work.)\n+ Good core gameplay\n+ Ship variety with different abilities\n+ Historically accurate names and details of the ships\n+ Simple game with an adequately complex game mechanic (range finders, bearings etc.)\n+ AI (Also a Con): Tactical Map AI is competent on Hard mode\n+ Hotseat Multiplayer (two or more players taking turn using one computer)\n+ No Microtransactions (specially since it has a mobile counterpart)\n+ Customizable hard points when building new ships\n\nCONS:- Short Campaign (could have used more maps to extend gameplay)\n- No tutorial\n- Land texture is horrible\n- No ship upgrades during campaign (I've been told Captains level up though)\n- AI (Also a Pro): Strategic Map AI is brain dead and leaves important territory poorly defended\n\nCONCLUSION:Its a NICE GAME, good for passing the time and a good way to satisfy an urge for a 'not-so-deep but also not dumb strategic game. For a mobile-pc multiplatform game, Battle Fleet 2 is COMPETENT. It plays nicely, has decent visuals, easy to understand game mechanic and it can run with almost all modern computers.\n\nI would RECOMMEND this at full price ($10 USD or your regional equivalent) if you're really into this kind of game, but if not, WAIT for a SALE.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Why?\n\nCampaign is excellent, battles are fun, if slow, and its a great concept for a game - news of an atlantic campaign is very exciting, would love to see some Royal Navy and German ships in there. But it has a critical problem in campaign mode - once you destroy the enemys capital ships they dont produce any more. They spread their ships around instead of concentrating them, so you build up a couple of strong fleets and then wipe out all their ships. They replace them with only frigates, the odd destroyer, very occasionally a cruiser, and sometimes a submarine. I havent seen them build a single battleship or carrier. So i switched to "hard" mode. Nothing changed except accuracy of enemy ships and gauges for my own fire.\n\nThis game would be brilliant with the following simple changes:\n\n- in campaign mode, ensure the enemy builds all types of ships(!!!) - people want to fight battleships and strong fleets, not lowly bands of frigates.\n- concentrate the enemys fleets, dont have them spread out with one or two ships to a region to be picked off.\n- have a speed button enabling enemy fire to be sped up. It can be very dull watching 10 individual shells at normal speed.\n- have an atlantic campaign with RN and German ships!\n\nI really hope the devs can fix these bits because if they can this would be a superb game and I'd happily support it with more money.","December 29, 2014","false","24.8"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","43","56","0","1"

Both are turn-based.\n\nThe naval battles are fun if you enjoy turn-based fights based largely upon positioning your ships and estimating distances. Though unfortunately, you don't choose the starting formation of your fleet. It is definitely satisfying to see the shell hit from over a mile away, you can really feel the distance between the ships, and then see it crash into the ship and possibly disable some critical component such as one of their guns, or engine. The armament of your ships will also play a role in how things go. For example, the submarine can be shielded from most damage by being submerged, but can only hit the enemy from 1500 yards while the largest guns have a range of 4000 yards. It pays to have a versatile fleet. The enemy may have a tightly formed fleet with many AA guns, making your carriers less effective, or battleships with big guns but few/no torpedos, making your subs more effective. The battleship can otherwise outshoot anything, but can fall prey to repeated airstrikes from an aircraft carrier that is too far away to shoot. Ramming is possible and could be fun, but I've only accidently rammed my own ships. Try not to do that. When your ships can destroy the enemy from miles away, you tend not to end up getting so close.  The AI on hard provides enough of a challenge to be interesting.\n\nThe overall battle map is fun, but the AI doesn't play it well. Oddly, America is the more challenging side to play. New ships can be built, but only about one per turn (or every other turn, if you want a battleship/carrier) while each side starts with over 20 ships. New ships can be customized in terms of their armament to some degree, to make the ship better against regular ships, aircraft, or subs. You can make the right side of your battleship able to fire torpedos at subs, with the left side specialized for regular ships, with all standard turrets to complement the heavier turrets on the front and back. Or replace regular guns with a few AA guns to help fend off airstrikes. There's always tradeoffs, and you want to consider what your enemy has and what supporting ships you already possess.\n\nYou earn points to build new ships by controlling sea zones, and some are worth 2-6 times more than others. These valuable zones tends to have coastal defenses and ports where ships are repaired. You do control the defenses and they can make a significant difference in battle to favor the defender.  You can send a lone sub or frigate to capture undefended sea zones while your main force blocks the progress of the enemy fleet until they bring the fight to you. You win by occupying all sea zones in the pacific.","December 11, 2014","true","51.0"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","22","22","0","0"

But then again who has the time to invest ina game like Harpoon. Battle Fleet 2 is a mix of fun, some light strategy, a little bit of tactical thinking and the satisfaction of watching your salvos hit the mark. It isn't for someone that wants total immersion, but it does give us elements of everything that one needs to to lose themselves in the S Pacific or Atlantic while waiting for the kids to get home from school or on that boring flight to Tampa for business.\n\nHistorically accurate, up to a point and interesting enough to hold the attention of a military history student such as myself, I think that the developer has hit the right mix to appeal to someone who otherwise might not purchase or be inclined to play a war game on any level. Furthermore, the developers do care about what the customers say...more than I can say for some companies.\n\nPros:\n\nFun\nDecent Enough Graphics and Sound\nSome Good History\nEngaging, but not demanding\nHas replayability\n\nCons:\n\nNot deep enough to appeal to real military hounds\nFeels a little 'appy'\n\n\nOverall, This gets my thumbs up for the way it can fill in the void of stupid apps to a pretty darn serious PC gamer like me. Like I said before: Fun, Engaging enough and fills the niche left between dumb apps and super serious strategy.","October 16, 2015","true","12.9"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","25","29","2","0"

I've been looking for a naval strategy game, so I took a flyer on this.\n\nAs I understand it, this is a game designed for mobile phones and has now been ported to PC. It's turn-based and pretty basic, easy to learn, and fun to play. My first time playing, I spent five hours without even realizing; that's about the price of a movie ticket, so it's already worth it to me.\n\nMy biggest complaint is getting saddled with random ships at the start of the campaign with no way to modify or mothball them. The only way to delete them is to get them destroyed, and that gives your enemy build points (and experience?). There's no way to 'refit' the ships with different hardpoint options (some destroyers and cruisers don't take advantage of being able to mount medium guns - 1 and 3 respectively, and sometimes even battleships don't have heavy guns mounted - one of the biggest reasons to have a battleship at sea as they outrange everything, sans aircraft, and are invaluable in taking heavily defended ports). When you play a one-shot skirmish you can build your whole fleet out of points (higher point battles, please!) and designing your fleet is easily half the fun.\n\nAs I understand it, this is a growing and still developing game, so I hope these things improve. One way to help that happen is give the game your money. Less than $10? Totally worth it.","November 21, 2014","true","28.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/recommended/332490/","chlorique","Chlorique Queas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/","696 products in account","TL;DR Battle Fleet 2 is a rather serious recreation of naval fleet battle set in a turn based settings where you have manually control every ships as distance and shot power data had to be taken from the test firing itself. Enjoyable for the armchair armada commander.\n\nGame Detail\nName: Battle Fleet 2\nGenre: Literally Chess, Naval Command, Turn Base Strategy\nPersonal: Rather unpromising in the beginning but catches your attention relatively easily.\nHas multiplayer.\n\nWhat is Battle Fleet 2? I went into the game without any prior knowledge as to what its predecessor is and so without any expectation set. With that said i hated the game in during my early times with it marred by weird UI, incredibly cheating AI and various other factors that could have been avoided by taking the tutorial. Which i ignored. Then again after hurdling through without any idea the base game is good fun if rather lacking in content at the moment.\n\nTo simplify manner Battlefleet 2 is a either a fleet turn base simulator or an armada turn based simulator depending on which mode you happened to click at the menu. Lets go in depth shall we?\n\n1:Gameplay\nLike any good pair of old comfortable sock Battle Fleet 2 proceed to destroy you in its brutal, harsh and unrelenting gameplay during the early hours you struggle to find your wet feets in the game. The 2 main mode are the skirmish mode and the campaign mode with the skirmish mode further divided into custom matches and quick battle which is my favourite of the lot. Custom matches allows you to choose what type of ships you and your nameless fleet commander bring into the foray. While it is fun to simulate certain historical battle witht the abundance maps shipped within the game the real highlights are of course the battle itself.\n\nGameplay starts you and your foes ships are dump into the oceon in a random formation with in the case of quick battle you wont know what kind of ship you ended up with until the battle starts. Everything is played in top down view seeing as you have to make all the range estimates yourself. Incidentally you can somewhat influence it by choosing the ship budget during the map selection menu but thats not very fun. Just choose the full budget and let it rip.\n\nEvery ships turn to act are determined by their onboard commander with battleships of course going first but resulting in them acting last in every other turn. There is fog of war so recon the area searching for the enemy till you obtain visual is a must in which case you move on to the firing phase. Setting the gun on every part of your ship manually you have to guess based on the range indicator given what angle and power you need to set them to and if a hit occur the enemy status will be displayed with either only a damage occur or a module is taken out with it that could range from being deadly exploding munitions bringing you whole ship down to a mere incovenience with damaged munition that prevent that gun from being use next turn. There's are also engine damage and so on and specific part of the ship can be targeted albeit a bit unreliable at times with shots going all over the place the farther they are. Past their maximum range the shells and torpedo simply stop working.\n\nNot contend with only a battleship the game also comes with several other type with each suited to a different role. Battleships are the behemoth or 'tanks' of the ocean dealing death with their broadside bombardment, the historically accurate destroyer with their torpedo launchers and sub killing depth charges and the aircraft carrier with their deadly plane delivering bombs which are the only thing battleships fear. A few other unmentions are the submarine, cruiser and frigate. Admittedly the heart of the fleet will always be the aircraft carrier and battleships and during the story mode where it is possible for both to be present in a single battle it is often a struggle to eliminate them.\n\nSpeaking of campaign mode this game has one! Even though  the skirmish mode would have easily suffice but the addition doesnt hurt it in the slightthest. Essentially you play the pacific campaign with it being US vs IJN in a grand battle risk style to take out the whole board and claim victory in a historically innacurate way. You can either choose to play the premade 'inspired by the historical fleet formation of that time or you can say darn it all and build howerver many battleships your funds or prestige point will allow you and finally kick those dirty yanks with 20 yamato on the tile based map. Campaign mode introduces extra elements such airfield that will bombard your fleet and coastal artillery which surprise surprise will bombard your ships. The reverse is true if your enemy decides to attack the tile containing these modifier and these fortification can be destroyed to stop their harassment during the battle.\n\nDid i mention you could also customize your ships armament? While historically destroyer are the sub hunter of the fleet you can always remove everything to add more cannons to blast those yanks off the water or you can install more AA gun to help your poor pitiful 12 gun battleship from the harassment of the aircraft carriers. At the end of the day nothing beats a broadside to a crippled ship while listening a particularly melodramatic violin composition.\n\nOf note is the difficulty and what it affects. While the AI do regain part of their lobotomized brain the higher you go the interesting thing is the distance marker starts to be less useful and at the highest difficulity simply dissapear requiring all the calculation to be made with the gut instinct. Or you know, fire a shot and go from there, like a true armada general.\n\n2:Sound\nNothing to really praise here, the sound department did a good job of making the ambient sound easily tuned out as you do all those calculation in your head and second guessing every mouse click confirmation. Seriously i'll give it a 8/20 for ambiency.\n\n3:Graphics\nAs with most turn based strategy games the graphics are not that high on the checklist [with exception such as xcom come to mind as you basically staring at your soldier throughout the game so they better be good] but Battle Fleet 2 surprise this reviewer with rather well made water physics and ships models [the landmass is ugly but this is a ship game not land battle].\n\nChoosing the highest setting showcase high level of details on the ships and the water being more believable although performance does take a hit with mid being the best of both world. With even the barrel of the ship being distinguisable instead of lump of clays slapped together in some shady backroom it fulfilled its requirement well enough.\n\nConclusion\nYou have well detailed ships set in WWII for heaven sake blasting each other with volleys of shells and sinking magnificently so what did you think the score would be?\n\n8.5/10\n\nCould use a bit more content although there are online skirmishes if you got bored bombarding the AI with shells. Just dont get too cocky.\n\nVerdict? : Buy it if you ever felt like being a narcissist armchair fleet commander who wants to control what their ships does. And losing that expensive Yamato, priceless.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

This one was a pair of 6's.\n\nThis is a fun, top-down tactical wargame. While there is no tutorial, one really isn't needed since the controls are intuitive. Movement is done in turns, with one "move" and one "attack" command available per turn. Fog of war is present, so some "attack" moves have to be used for the purposes of recon.\n\nAttacking is done by way of aiming various weapons (guns of several different sizes, torpedos, depth charges, etc) and then setting their range. Near-misses do small amounts of damage, just as they would in reality. It can be nerve-wracking to watch your opponent shoot at you multiple times during a turn, each round coming closer and closer and closer...\n\nThere are standalone battles, custom battles that you can create on your own, campaigns, and a multiplayer system.

Set during the pacific war you can play either the Americans or Japanese. Has a single player campaign, multiplayer and quick player modes. The game is set around a group of pacific islands. There are two stages to the game. The first is set on a large campagin map where you can move / engage fleets or build / repair ships. The second takes place after you engage an enemy fleet. These battles are not over quickly as the larger ships move slowly and the range of guns / torpedos varies. At your disposal are submarines, frigates, cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers.\n\nThe graphics are not bad and has detailed ships. Controls are very simple and the use of a range guide helps give you an idea of how far you should fire the guns. One nice touch is that if you miss, the detonation points are recorded so you can see how far you missed before planning the next attack.\n\nThe damage model is realistic with different ship parts capable of being destroyed or disabled. Your individual ships will earn prestige as they survive each battle so it pays to keep them alive. In my first battle I was heavily outnumbered by both land, sea and air. Although I won pretty much all my ships were damaged. Back on the campaign map you have to move damaged ships back to the nearest friendly port in order to repair them. Thats where the game can become tense, especially if your fleet is a few moves away from the port and the enemy starts pursuing you. Just like it was in the real pacific war things become a game of cat and mouse.\n\nThis game will give any naval strategist hours of gameplay. I only really have a couple of moans and one is that despite seeing a nice close up of the ships in the stats mode you can't actually zoom right in during a battle. The other is that I would have liked to have seen some historical scenarios as the pacific had many well known battles. I'm probably sounding greedy now but I would have also like to have seen an atlantic campaign with the British and German navies.\n\nUpdate: You can ignore my last part about the Atlantic campaign as apparently there is one on the way.

I really like old school, tactical wargames with some decent graphics, a good dose of action, and non-heavy strategy (not so much into base building or building up my empire or civilisation). Battle Fleet 2 is a fun game. The graphics are pretty ordinary but moving your fleet around while trying to torpedo the enemy fleet is exciting. The single player campaign is quite good which you can't say about many games. The AI attacks you strongly and in my last battle the enemy zoned in on my carrier and sunk it with the minimum of fuss despite my attempts to stop it. I haven't tried multiplayer yet but this kind of game would be very good to play against friends. It is quite simple to play and a great way to relax for a few hours.","April 15","true","26.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Distance is calculated not with rulers or yard sticks, but with the imagination and a slight advantage of range circles. Battles are fought by turn and the actions played out in real time, and there is nothing more agonising than watching your painfully 'calculated' shots fall short or long. Thankfully, you can speed up gameplay so these moments are short-lived.\nIt took me a while to get around to playing this tremendous title for the simple omission of an in-battle save feature, as believe me the battles can and do go on. Ironically, since this has been addressed and there is indeed an in-battle save feature now, I tend to complete the battle...it's that "Just one more turn" phenomenon known so well to turn-based gamers.\nSo, you have the Campaign Map, where you plan your advances, reinforcements, build cues and assaults. Then when battle is joined, you go to the top-down tactical map. One immersion-breaker is the use of "Strategic Command Cards to surprise your enemies with special actions like deploying mines, sabotage, enhanced aiming, airstrikes and more!", as while these are fun to use, the enemy AI always without fail makes a beeline for them instead of their objective. In fact it becomes a race to pick up cards. That aside, you attack, defend and send airstrikes against the enemy, and there is nothing more satisfying than pulling a hopeless situation from the jaws of defeat into a tactical withdrawal by the enemy with only a shore gun and a lone destroyer sinking an enemy battleship, starting a panic in the AI. Transports I still don't understand. They are obviously important for holding acquired territory, but just clutter the battle map and waste time getting them the Hell out of Dodge. Perhaps they could have been left from the battle, and their loss rate simulated instead based on victory/defeat conditions (as done in "Victory At Sea").\nWhile not as attractive nor immediate as "Atlantic Fleet", this is a far more engrossing and long lasting game for naval enthusiasts. If you re even mildly interested in W II naval conflict, and would like to test your skills from Admiral down to gunner...pick this up. You won't regret the hours lost playing this fine strategy simulator.","May 9","true","3.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I was just gonna try it out for a couple minutes; three hours later my wife is telling me dinner's ready.  It's kind of a combination of Panzer General, the old Great Naval Battles series, and classic Battleship.

It takes a little experimentation to figure it out.  The skill is in timing, angular positions and movement and estimating distance to target. You can target specific areas of a ship if you know the distance.  After 50 hours there are still a few unknowns like - the order of turns from ship to ship - it is predetermined and you do not get to pick which individual ship goes next be it Allies or Axis. Care must be taken in moving as you can collide with friendlies or enemy alike, the AI even has collisions. I am not sure I like the floating rewards in the water where the first one to get close to it gets the prize be it a free recon, air strike, repair a ship or put out an array of mines.  Perhaps if they could be turned off as an option.  As soon as I think I have mastered this game I look forward to my first multiple player experience. Last, it is really fast at saving the game but you are forced to exit the game at that time and while you get put back to the exact circumstances on restart the last range finder setting is lost for the last ship to ship encounter, a really minor annoyance. Overall, the replayability is great, it is a lot of fun and you are never rushed to do anything.  The highest of 3 difficulty modes is a challenge to most gamers. If you like fleet level WWII sea battles you'll like this.","May 26","true","117.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is turn based so one can leave it running and do turns whenever there's a hole in the schedule, during lunch break, coffee timeouts etc.\n\nIt is a mirrored setup wargame with no asymmetry, meaning all nations have access to the same ships with the same capabilities. This leads to a very "alternative" version of nations but it is by no means a deterrent. Quite funny to see Nazi Germany with a fleet of carriers...\n\nI like the "scorched earth" mechanics although it has ample space for further development - IMO the torpedoes should not be fire and forget but rather arm them for a distance.\n\nAll in all a great buy and great "little" game with extensive replayability.\n\n","January 12","true","27.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After 14 turns (2h) I finished the campain, and I was not interested in playing more after it.

I just think the game is too easy and shallow.\n\nMinor things that I didn't liked:\n\n1. The movement of the ship is controled by a heading+distance, but the trajectory is not shown before advancing. Conclusion: I ended up sinking my own ship by sending it to the shore.\n\n2. the campain is too simple and has funny things, like allowing capturing the whole pacific with a single frigate.\n\n3.

You need to estimate the firing range of enemy targets (except when firing torpedoes or launching Airstrikes).\n\nThere are 7 ship weapon types in the game (Depth Charges, Torpedo, Anti-Aircraft gun, Deck Gun, Standard Turret, Medium Turrent, Heavy Turret).\n\nEach weapon type has a certain firing arc, does a certain number of damage points (varies slightly in actual use during combat), has a certain maximum firing range. has a certain number of guns (if any), and has a certain number of times that it can fire each combat turn.\n\nSome territories are defended with a certain number of Coastal Artillery and/or an Airfield that need to be destroyed before the territory can be conquered.\n\nEach territory requires the attacking fleet to have a certain minimum number of transport ships (if any) in order to be able to conquer that territory.\n\nEach turn, you earn Prestige Points equal to the value of all of the territories under your control.\n\nYou spend Prestige Points to build ships in any territory with a shipyard that is under your control.\n\nThere are 7 ship types in the game (Transport, Submarine, Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, Battleship, Carrier).\n\nEach ship type has a certain number of certain weapon types that are mounted in certain fixed directions (either Fore, Port, Starboard, Mid (i.e. can fire to either port or starboard), or Aft).\n\nEach ship type has a certain number of Hit Points, a certain maximum movement range per combat turn, a certain turning radius, and certain abilities (depth charges, sub detection, recon aircraft, squadron aircraft, territory capture).\n\nEach ship type has a Bridge, an Engine, a Rudder, and Ammunition (the Carrier also has a Flight Deck) that each have their own individual Hit Points.\n\nSquadron Aircraft from Carriers can perform 1 of 3 possible action types (either Defend, Recon, or Airstrike).\n\nConclusion: If you like very slow-paced, turn-based tactical movement and combat, and having to estimate firing ranges of targets, then you will enjoy this computer game.\nPersonally, I think that this computer game is okay but I can't recommend this computer game because it is too slow-paced for my liking, I don't like the way that aircraft function from aircraft carriers, and I really don't like having to manually estimate the firing range of targets.\nI recommend that you buy, install, and play the naval combat computer game Victory At Sea instead which has a lot more ship types and, in my opinion, is a superior and more realistic naval combat computer game.","May 14","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphics are cool and it's fun blowing ships up. That being said as it is now, you will play it 2 or 3 times and never look at it again. As others have said the A.I. only seems to build frigates. Basically all you need to do is wipe out there main fleet at the start. Which is not hard to do. Then build 3-4 fleets of a destroyer for subs and the Capitol ship of your choice and choke them off. At the end you will need a descent fleet because of the airports and ground artilliary but it's not that big a deal.\n\nThe first thing I thought of was how cool would it be to have a Star Trek game like this?\n\nI slightly recomend the game but I could just as easily slightly not recomend it because of the replay value.

If you attack a sector and then retreat it actually makes the Enemy abandon the sector.  I actually won teh campaign just by having my Japanese destroyers blitz the American sectors with this tactic.\n\nIt's a promising idea for a game but it'd be great to see a bit more depth.  There's a limited amount of armament so each ship feels generic.  A few things like giving the Japanese Long Lance torpedoes with extended range, or maybe a Radar upgrade for the Americans (which would add more range circles) would make the ships feel more unique.\n\nOverall it's worth the money if you really love games about naval battle, but there's still a lot of room for improvement and expansion.","December 1, 2014","true","13.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What I mean by that is that its a good offline game that I imagine most laptops could handle and can kill a fair amount of time while waiting at an airport, or the like. Its not bad, but there is still a fair bit left to be desired so I could only recomend this as a on the cheap game.\n\nThe parts that I like most is the gameplay mechanics. Having to use your brain and calculate distances by dead-reckoning brings a good level of strategy into the game. I also like how all new ships are customizeable, at least to a point. Plus having various parts of a ship destructable adds a good touch.\n\nThe main point that I did not care for as much was the point system to fund new construction. I found it to be too limited and too difficult to save up points for high-teir ships. Additionally, I felt that the speed of the ships were lacking, and it made it tedious to get fleets into a good matchup. To follow up with this complaint I did not like how the game auto-deploys the fleet, usually spreading your ships all over the map without much rhyme or reason (at least to my mind).\n\nThis is not by any means a high-paced action game, this is a sit-down thinker and for some people this game should be a good match. For everyone else, it is probably something to walk away from. Personally, I will probably put in a few hours into it here and there still so I will recomend it for that reason.","June 14, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've only had this two days now and have played as many games, one on Easy mode and another on normal.  Both levels were just the right agressive level for the AI, though the AI doesn't make very good decisions; I hope that there are fewer stupid choices made by the AI in hard mode (such as moving all 6 of it's fleet vessels out of it's home port worth 25 points to capture a space worth only 5 points when I have a fleet of ships sitting just outside his home port).\n\nFrom a new player's point of view, the initial game was a bit confusing.  Commands weren't quite clear and I didn't know how to work the interface.  It took me a few turns to figure out how to attack with a carrier, the listed commands while limited, don't give the right vibe as to the correct couse of action, at least not initially for me.  First bit of advice, make your first game on easy mode just to get used to the controls.\n\nThat said, LOVE the graphics & details, sound effects and music are awesome.  I even had the graphics up on max spanning three screens and it looked amazing.  Once you figure out the controls, the game is quite simple and easy to play, it boils down to strategy and good range guessing.\n\nThere were a few features of the game I didn't care for and would like to see a future update for.\n1)  The aiming line from your ship is lost over land targets, it would be very helpful if it didn't stay limited to water level.\n2)  Each map has a few strategy cards hidden on it, and for the most part they are placed in the travel lanes of the AI ships (so they can pickup while en-route to me), any of these cards near my ships require that I turn completely around or go quite out of the way to obtain.  This game features heavily favors the AI, and just gives me a negative feeling about that particular game feature being fair to both parties.\n3) It would be nice if the game allowed a joint attack option, if I have a fleet on opposite sides of a section I want to take over, it would be great if both could attack the sector together and meet up in the middle as opposed to only being able to move/attack with one fleet at a time.  Still, not a deal breaker but I have a feeling I'm going to wish I had this ability in hard mode.\n4) I'm concerned about the replayability of the game, my early impression is that I'll get bored with this over time due to a lack of variations of play, but the multi-player aspect will help with some of that.\n\nOverall, it's a very good game, appropriately priced, and so far pretty garsh darn fun to play.\n\n*Addendum*\nFinished hard mode, sadly the game is still spitting out only frigates.  Once you knock out the the initial nasty fleet, it's easy peasy so hopefully we'll see an updated with an improved AI purchaser.  AI continues to be horrible, higher skill levels just translates to fewer misses by the computer, not smarter game play.\n\nI also tried out the multi-player and nobody is ever showing up.  I hope this is a bug and not a sign that nobody else is playing or interested in this.  I also hope they come out with an email turn  based PVP campaign mode, taking it back old school but this game could really benefit from that and add some longevity to game interest.\n\nI've found that my old ratio's class I had waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 5th grade has really helped with range estimation.  If you're pretty good with math or geometry, you'll be hard pressed to miss a shot in this game.","February 13, 2015","true","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"
