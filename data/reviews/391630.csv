Your fellow spacefriends at the bottom walk to some bunkers, if they get snacked by the evil spaceships coming from above they turn into zombies and spread the infection to adjacent fellow space friends. It is your job to not let that happen by shooting the baddies out of the sky. Later levels have some walls that prevent the lil guys getting to the bunker, unless you bomb these wall things with your secondary weapon. Theres some more enemy types I havent seen yet since it also has defender style  difficulty.\nDelivers what it claims to, Defender style gameplay. Didn't encounter any bugs so far, had decent fun flying the lil spaceship around.\n\nI'd recommend it tho I have only played half an hour. Picked it up at a 40% discount.","October 27, 2015","true","1.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","3"
