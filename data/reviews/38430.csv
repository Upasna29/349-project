"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/recommended/38430/","BloodCultist","Creeping Flesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/","645 products in account","Kingpin: Life of Crime is really interesting, what starts off as a tough as nails, slow paced, atmospheric first person experience which hates you quickly turns into an all out guns blazing fast paced action game that hates you even more. This is far tougher than the average 90's FPS game and will require luck, strategy and a skillfull approach to progress through it's big, open, levels.\n\nThe gameplay is varied, you can approach combat situations in different ways, going slowly and picking off enemies one by one or go in guns blazing like a typical FPS game from the 90's but don't expect to live for too long that way, the best approach is to use a mixture of the two.\n\nThe level design is somewhat reminscent of Quake 2's with non-linear layouts and multi-levelled structures that overlook area's of the map you're soon to visit or have already, mixed with some Half-Life's design choices. The levels are extremely well thought out and designed with not only looks but gameplay in mind and similar to that of Quake and Doom require you to look around for keys or items needed to progress and does not hold your hand and pull you through the map. The combat situations are often tough and leave you to overcome disadvantages which adds to the difficulty in a good way.\n\nThe AI is insane, the enemy will shoot you with almost instant, deadly accuracy as soon as you poke your nose around a corner which will frustrate a lot of people but I was able to overcome this by outsmarting the enemy in many ways such as luring them around corners and into your commandable gang members line of sight who will then mow the enemies down with the same ferocity the enemy AI shows towards to you which is really fun to watch. The AI is far from perfect, but in my opinion is WAY better and more interesting than what we see in modern shooters today, instead of artificially/dumbly taking cover behind barrels,walls and other forms of cover which makes them sitting ducks and actually easier to pick off, will run around, retreat then hide somewhere on the map, jump down from higher levels, climb ladders and attempt to out maneuver you which sometimes works to their success.\n\nThe visuals are amazing and take full advantange of the Quake 2 engine, with great lighting effects and detailed environments, there is literally nothing wrong with them but 50$ says this gets the bland, soulless HD remake along the line. The sound effects and voice acting are good, the weapons sound deadly and the AI has tons of classic lines, many including the 'f' word multiple times.\n\nOverall this game really impressed me through-out, took around 8-9 hours of tough gameplay to complete, I wasn't able to finish this as a child due to it's crushing learning curve but if you stick around you'll experience a time when gaming was at it's peak but BE WARNED, a lot of patience is required!","June 30, 2014","true","14.9"," 67 of 80 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","67","80","6","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/38430/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Kingpin is a very 90's game. It's a game very in-line with the "screw the censors let's have violence and swearing" mindset from around the same time that gave us games like Doom and Postal. Unfortunately this backfired for the game since it released around the same time as the Columbine shootings. Which gained it a great deal of controversy and seemingly didn't improve the sales of the game.\n\nThe premise of the game is you are a criminal who is beaten by several thugs in an alley. You pick up a lead pipe and decide to get revenge on the criminal organization that runs the city. The storyline is extremely minimalistic and there isn't much to get attatched to. The main protagonist isn't particularly well fleshed out and the motivations of the characters are never elaborated upon.\n\nThis gets into the brunt of my complaints with the game. The game feels like it lacks focus. The game starts out as a semi-stealth game before you get any good weapons or upgrades. Once you get access to a few decent weapons it turns into a straight up run and gun shooter. There's a mechanic where you can talk to NPCs in the world and even enemies if you put your weapon away. But it feels a little half baked since you typically trigger their aggro by accident and have to quickload. The writing of the characters was also pretty terrible. With enemies yelling "♥♥♥♥ER" frequently as soon as you're spotted.\n\nHowever, I can see why Kingpin got a cult-like following after release. The game takes place in a 1930's styled dystopian city. All of the characters resemble 1940's mobster charicatures and you eventually gain access to a tommy gun. However, all of the dialogue is very 90s, and you see more modern inventions like monorails and helicopters. It has this strangely surreal vibe to it that reminds me of similar games like Manhunt although I don't know if it was intentional or not. It also has wonderfully good AI for the time that actually follows you through vents and up ladders. The game also does have this unique sense of progression. Where you start out the game waking up in the gutter and progressively become more powerful and influential. Lastly there are a lot of clear influences from films like the Big Lebowski and Pulp Fiction. With the antagonist of the game being a clear parody of Marcellus Wallace from the latter.\n\nI wouldn't say Kingpin is a bad game but you have to go into it being aware it's a very mediocre one. I only recommend this game to people who are overly curious about old first person shooters who are willing to accept the game for it's very rough edges.","January 11","true","7.5"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","30","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pibz/recommended/38430/","Pibz","Cap'n Red Ivan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pibz/","348 products in account","Please note, I played this game primarily with the "Rags 2 Riches" mod as it fixes how much of a slog the game becomes in the second half.\n\nThe game's bread and butter is shooting criminals in the face. The formula for the game is you go in an area, visit the bar, talk to some people who can get you access to a part of the map, maybe recruit someone. You go to the newly available area, murder basically everyone and loot bodies, then   after doing whatever you need to do after, you go to the second part of the map, murder everyone, fight a guy with incredibly high health, then you move to the next level. Repeat. Each level has its variation on how this actually plays out but when you play you can easily see the formula. There are 7 levels, amounting to around 9 hours of gameplay, more if you play the base game. In the base game, your weapons are pathetic and are quite ineffective as the enemies have absurd amounts of health. You rely on the 1 or 2 goons you can typically get in all but 1 level of the game, and place them on corners, then you bait the enemies to the ambush point and they get smoked. Charging in all willy nilly is going to get you murdered, because the enemies have perfect accuracy and incredibly high health. In the Rags 2 Riches mod, you can still do this and on some parts its very helpful, but its much easier to just charge in gung ho with your crew and try to take on the bad guys.\n\nBesides slowly increasing your body count with your crew, you'll be doing a few other things in the gameplay. You can Visit a shop called the "Pawn-O-Matic", despite not being automatic, is a store where you can buy armor, health, weapons, ammo, and mods that wear out over time without Rags 2 Riches. You can also talk to random people on the street, a select few will tell you stuff that can be incredibly helpful, others may do stuff for you for money, most will just tell you "Another freekin' night and no ♥♥♥♥♥." You can also visit the bar, found in all chapters but 1, where most of the helpful npc's reside, and where the recruitable goons usually are. You can also go exploring which can net you even more surplus cash to spend at the Pawn-O-Matic, ammo, armor, and health. Theres not a whole lot to be done outside of the main shooting bits of the game.\n\nThe plot sucks but its all you need. Some guy named Nikki had his shmucks beat the snot out of you in a back alley for unknown reasons, and you vow to get revenge and go around either a city or multiple cities, its not very clear, ravaging gang after gang. The Kingpin is like "yo kill this guy". Excuse me, he's more like "you ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥♥s better ♥♥♥♥in kill this ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥♥ or ill ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥♥ up you ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥♥s." Seriously, this game has a lot of swearing, and violence. The dialogue is great, almost every line in the game has a cuss in it, and the main voice actor did a great job of making the lines memorable. Seriously, the line "♥♥♥♥ YOU ♥♥♥♥" that enemies sometimes yell when you alert them has been burned into my mind for 3 years now.\n\nEasily the best part of the game is the atmosphere. The graphics, music, voice acting, and design of the world all are great. Forget I said music, the CD Music setting didn't work for me on the steam version, not surprised, and theres like 3 songs that loop on the radios you find in the game, albiet I do actually like one of the songs that loops. The lack of music helps create this forboding and tense and sorta creepy atmosphere. You could just be walking in this silent apartment building or run down area, and you have no idea where the enemies are hiding, while the ambient noises of cars in the background and a tin can dropping let you know that you're not alone, but you're not welcome either. The graphics don't help, which is a great thing. Almost every enemy you face is either some tattoo'd up thug looking for a fight, or some guy with a messed up face and demented smile, usually with some strange uniform to go along with it. The more regular looking people in the game are broad shoulder'd and taller than you, and the other model for the male characters is a short fat guy, it adds to the surreal feeling the game gives you.\n\nThe short version, the gameplay is a frustrating grind and eventually is hard just for the sake of being hard about 6 hours in, with Rags 2 Riches this is more or less remedied, still challenging though. Don't expect a gangster Deus Ex or anything, just a unique shooter with a nice setting. The plot is nothing special, but the atmosphere is incredible.\n\nI say give this game definiately give this game a go with the Rags 2 Riches mod, I wouldn't say theres too much replayability in doing the whole game over again, but I would definately play the first level or 2 over and over.","October 3, 2014","true","11.1"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","24","24","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ercicin/recommended/38430/","ercicin","erc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ercicin/","873 products in account","'I'm gonna bury those two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.'\n\nKingpin opens with a cutscene in which the player character utters the above line after rising up from a beating with a swollen face. It tells a simple tale of revenge, or rather, -taking a cue from the Cypress Hill album that the game borrows tracks from- a tale of going from 'Rags to Riches'. You'll be going from town to town -taking down small-time mob bosses along the way- until you confront the current Kingpin to exact your revenge and usurp his throne. As for the journey, right from the first moment it becomes apparent that it will be a raw, brutal, harsh and above all else, very messy one (and unashamedly so).\n\nEven though it is gritty, Xatrix's underdog may very well be the most aesthetically pleasing game to date utilizing the idTech2 engine. Where the other games that are based on the same technology are quick to betray their Quake II origins, Kingpin has a style and feel of its own thanks to the developers' meticulous work on the visual side of their creation. Beautifully textured and elegantly lighted, every single map therein has a life-like scale and quality to it. Though the meshes themselves are not more than a handful, the stylized characters also benefit from the top-notch 2D art, offering a great variety due to the three-way skinning that Xatrix coded in. The sound design is also of high standard; from the footstep sounds to the voiceovers of the NPCs, everything fits perfectly to the fictional world the developers try to portray. Simply put, the game oozes with atmosphere. The fact that this is the one and only shooter of the period that feels better without background music should alone be enough of a testament for the said quality.\n\nBut make no mistake, even within its era's boundries, Kingpin is a hard and unforgiving game. Rather than going Quake, it expects you to play in its own terms, that is, to traverse carefully and try to get the upper hand on your enemies. If you do not comply to that, don't expect your experience to be any different than a novice's in the midst of an old-school deathmatch wherein all the other players are seasoned enough to navigate the map perfectly and are capable of ripping you to shreds in a matter of seconds. Play it as intended though and you'll quickly discover that Kingpin is one of the most visceral and satisfying shooter experiences of the 90s.\n\nXatrix adds a few touches of their own to the engine to spice it up and expand its functionality. The most prominent are  the ability of robbing the downed of their bucks which you use to buy weapons and stuff from specialized shops known as 'Pawn-o-matic's or hiring goons (two max) to back you up, alongside interacting with NPCs through the use of positive and negative conversation commands. But the most pleasing of it all is surely the impeccable pathfinding of the NPCs, especially the ones to be hired to fight alongside you: they run, jump and crouch their way through every single obstacle without a hitch to keep up with you. In fact, I spent two-thirds of my seven-hour trek with two on my side and there was only a single time where they needed extra care on my part. I was constantly surprised by the fact that they were able to traverse the map from one side to the other without an additional command to find me, as if they were not computer but human-controlled.\n\nI believe Kingpin is one of the better shooters of the late 90s. It doesn't reinvent the genre like Half-Life did. Instead, just like its engine-brethren SiN, Daikatana and Soldier of Fortune, it aims for a more classical approach. Its strength lies not in its ingenuity, but in its solid design sensibilities. It has an overarching theme that is full of style and backed up by a ghetto tale told through cutscenes, offers a highly visceral yet never offending combat experience on top and builds up on an already solid engine without introducing any bugs or breaking it. I only wish that it had a longer campaign or an expansion pack of sorts. If it had been kept, the slightly non-linear feel of the first episode would have been welcome too.\n\nRecommended for fans of old-school. Don't forget to answer the phone.\n\n'What's the count?'\n'Good... Real good.'","January 17, 2015","true","6.9"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhsgsg/recommended/38430/","samhsgsg","The Cups","http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhsgsg/","154 products in account","In my opinion, kind of a mixed bag. On one hand, it does have a pretty solid singleplayer campaign with detailed levels and amazing AI for the time (companions can jump across platforms, crawl through airvents, and usually find you whenever they get lost. Half-Life 1 must've been so jealous). But on the other hand, it's got bullet sponge enemies with almost godlike accuracy. The first level is by far one of the trickiest parts of the entire game, since you're armed with nothing but a drain pipe, and you have to take on these obscene fat goons wielding firearms of grief and destruction.\n\nIt's still a good game overall, but if you're not a "bayudaayus mothahfockah", which I'm not either, there's no shame in playing on a difficulty lower than Normal if you get the feeling this game might beat you to a pulp. I should also say make sure to look at the keybinds menu if you want to know how to "interact" with NPCs, some of them have special skills which are needed to get through the level.\n\nFans of Return to Castle Wolfenstein might feel right at home while playing this, since it was made by the same company and contains a few of the same sound effects and the art style feels reminiscent in places. Although after playing both games I kind of get the feeling that gang members and criminals who constantly dropped the F-bomb were more dangerous than the Third Reich...","November 8, 2014","true","9.3"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","0"

Don't come into this expecting A thrilling plot with twists and turns. Kingpin starts off with your character, a nameless thug, left beaten in an alley in a ghetto named ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by some cronies of a guy named Nicky, and being told to never enter a place called Poisonville again. From the now infamous "Im gonna bury those two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s" to the ending, this game is a bland revenge tale told from cutscenes randomly placed in the game. You go on a chase to find Nicky and become the new Kingpin and gain respect. But half the time you don't even know who it is your even shooting at. But the story isn't the charm of the game, and the main appeal is either going to come from the violent combat, or from the sheer difficulty of the title.\n\nThe game uses profane lanuage most of the time with "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" this and "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" that. And follows up with brutal combat. Seriously, the wounds that appear on enemy corpses are just plain gory, and enemies leave a trail of blood when they move, which is useful for tracking down fleeing enemies, which is pretty impressive AI for the time. To add to this, Kingpin splits amor into various areas, like head, torso and legs. So natrually, you can shoot enemies body parts for different effects, like blowing limbs clean off. The game's shooting mechanics are nothing speacial, and amount to nothing for than pointing, and shooting, but the game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed difficult. Really, even on it's lower difficulty settings, this game will tear you a new one. You'll get your ♥♥♥ handed to you time and time again, but that's how we rolled back in the 90's and sometimes you'll just have to sigh and hit the quickload button. You die very easily in the game, and the enemies early on just are bullet sponges. There is no difficulty curve.\n\nKingpin Life of Crime is a great game, despite it's apparent flaws regarding it's story, and combat aspects, and I would reccomend it to anyone that enjoys old school shooters that are violent and difficult.

I'd been waiting more than fifteen years to finally get a chance to check this game out, and it is completely not worth it.  Even forgiving the fact that the Quake 2 engine is showing its age, hard, the graphics in this game are terrible.  It's virtually impossible to tell friend from foe apart, aprticularly from a difference, the game paints with all the colors of the sewer, and all the modly have this odd wobbling to them that's supposed to make them look good, I guess, but just makes the people and weapons look like they're made out of Jell-o.  The story is non-existant, you start the game having been beaten down by unnamed thugs working for.... another guy without a name, for no reason that the game ever tells you.  From then on it's just your basic revenge plot.  Go find the guy who ordered your failed hit, and kill him.  There's boss fights, but that only constitutes enemies that have even MORE hit points than the general thugs.  Which already are bullet sponges on their own.  On top of that, most of the enemies in this game have hitscan weapons that have perfect acuracy from across the map, no need to reload, and sometimes won't stagger.  There's almost no point in exploring as most dead ends have nothing in them anyway.  There's weapons, ammo, and medical rooms here and there, which becomes a fight from one of those stashes to the next.  And that's when the stashes aren't right on top of each other for no good reason.  The Steam version also ships without music.  You have to be a really hard core fan of 90's shooters to even WANT to play this one - like I am - and even then be prepared for disappointment.","May 15","false","8.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I saw that it was on sale for 5$ and after reading the onslaught of positive reviews from other steam users, I decided to give it a go. I went into this game knowing it was dated, and perhaps a bit overpriced - but after reading the countless reviews saying it was a great game, with great voice acting, superb A.I. and had an awesome soundtrack - I was sold.\n\nAfter beating Kingpin (which took a mere 5 hours) I came to the bitter realization that all these positive reviews were written by people nostalgic about this game and had played Kingpin when it was initially released. I'm sure this WAS an amazing game when it first came out -- but now it's not.\n\nThe graphics are playable, the A.I. is good and very advanced for the time it was released. Those are about the only positive things that I can say about Kingpin. The sountrack is literally the same 2 songs which can be heard playing thoughout the duration of the game over and over and over and over and over again. The storyline is atrocious, it gives the players little reason as to why our protagonist was left for dead at the beginning of the game, or why Marsellus Wallace (from Pulp Fiction) is the Kingpin and wants to kill him. There was a small selection of firearms, all of which were weak and barely did any damage to enemies. The difficulty of Kingpin ridiculous to say the least - there are 5 levels, ranging from Easy to Realistic. I tried Normal to begin with and after 10 deaths within the first 10 minutes of the game, decided to drop down to easy. The voice acting was bad, they didn't even match the characters they were for (with the exception of the Kingpin).\n\nFor me, the most negative aspect of Kingpin was the amount of foul language - it just wasn't used appropriately. I'm sure it was a shock factor back in the day, but it was used and abused to the point of tedium throughout Kingpin where it just becomes annoying to hear.\n\nKingpin was not worth the time or the money that I spent on it. I would suggest Postal 2 over Kingpin to anyone looking for a game that is similar to Kingpin, but far superior in every aspect.\n\nI hope this review was helpful.","February 14, 2015","false","6.0"," 15 of 39 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","15","39","0","2"

Nowadays, this is all completely common, so the game must have been ahead of it's time.  Aside from the fact that the combat kind of sucks, and the enemies can take a crapload of hits before they die (even on the easiest of settings), it's kind of fun in a ghetto sort of way.

Doesn't deviate from norms too much but has the nice additions of weapons shops and NPC cooperation, this achieved early on in the development of suchlike in gaming.  Gets quite tough, still haven't finished it, also it doesn't work on Windows 10. Really good flamethrower effects.","May 19","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
