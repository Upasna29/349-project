"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azaghal/recommended/10270/","azaghal","Azaghal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azaghal/","410 products in account","This game is what you could call the "definitive" version of Disciples 3. It takes a lot from the first two iteration of D3 and revamps it to make something that is actually enjoyable to play.\n\nThe biggest problem with original D3 is that it tried to be as close as possible to Disciples 2 in some parts and something completely different (mostly a HoMM clone) in others. The result was an inconsistent, bipolar mess that was neither a proper successor to D2 nor a good rival to Heroes franchise. Not to mention buggy.\n\nD3:Reincarnation tries to reconcile the two dysfunctional aspects of the earlier D3 games, and, in my opinion, succeeds in doing so.\n\nFor those who never played Disciples 3 before: this is turn-based strategy game in the vein of Heroes of Might and Magic. You start with a capital city and a hero, and your job is to recruit an army, explore the map, gather resources, capture new cities, level up yourself and your army, and eventually defeat whatever is the boss of that map particular map.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from HoMM, Eador and similar games is the fact that your "army" consist of only a few characters (the actual number is determined by your hero's leadership skill, but caps at six), each of whom gains experience and levels up independently. For that reason it feels more like leading a party of characters in an RPG, than leading an army in a strategy game.\n\nThis impression is enforced even further by the inventory/equipment system for heroes.\n\nCharacters don't die permanently unless your entire army gets wiped and can be revived by potions, spells or by paying money in a controlled towns. After gaining three levels, a character "upgrades" to a more powerful class, granted you built the appropriate building in your capital. Some characters have mutually exclusive upgrade paths, allowing you to customize your army composition to better suit your play style.\n\nWhen playing single player campaign, your hero retains the levels and equipment from the previous map, but the army starts from square one.\n\nThis version of D3 includes 4 playable factions and a campaign for each of them. Campaign themselves were redesigned from the earlier versions and now include water traveling. Character stats were also changed substantially to better fit the new hex-based combat (earlier versions just took the stats system from D2 and tried to make it work in a completely new combat system, with not so stellar results).\n\nOverall, this version of D3 takes all that was good in previous versions and reworks the rest. If you have an interest in this genre, and weren't irreversibly scarred by earlier D3 versions, you should find this to be a very enjoyable game. It may not be Disciples 2, but I can wholeheartedly recommend it.","February 14, 2014","true","97.7"," 176 of 191 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","176","191","0","1"

Well Optimized. (Not last gen tough).\n-Good Campaign Storyline.\n-Almost no bugs or glitches (so far).\n-Leveling system is addictive and dynamic. Can have different builds.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Horrible AI. Seriosuly.\n-Strategic approach is fine, execution is terrible. Weird and unfair issues with CPU enemies.\n-Extremely slow paced gameplay.\n-Difficulty is based 100% in the raw power of the enemy armies and it scales poorly as the game goes on.\n-Once behind it's almost impossible to recover.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow, explaining with more detail:\n\n1.- Disciples is a franchise that relies heavily into the management of the encounters you have. The main strategy of the matches rely heavily in how you develop your troops WITHOUT DYING, mainly because the game punishes you hard if you loose a leveled squad. In the past, this kind of difficulty was appealing, but by today standards, it's just not well implemented.\nThe game is more about choosing the right targets to level up and not about the strategic combat. This means that the difficulty is developed by the way you approach the leveling and not about the challenge of battling or developing the resources.\n\n2.- The AI is just broken.\nDuring the map phase, all the enemy armies just clean the mobs and level up in a certain rate, making few mistakes, while you need to see your way trough the random neutral troops that can range from easy to impossible. While the idea of having a linear leveling experience is boring, making you roam the map searching for the right mobs seems hardly an improvement. This is worsened by the fact that you can't afford to loose a single troop from the squad, so you will be repeating certain battles just for the sake of keeping the squad alive and not loose time in healing (wich, too, can be punishing in certain situations). And you can add to this the fact that while you loose time choosing targets, the AI already knew the right path so now it's 3 levels abobe you and still power-clearing camps.\n\nIn combat is worse. Melees will approach to engage, ranged will target the nearest high priority target (weakest).\nNo much variation there. All the difficulty relies in you having to clear the lesser troops because usually the neutral enemies will have an outstanding threat that you need to carefully engage if you don't want to get one-shotted. And that is all. It's an easy clean or a fight you will have to repeat until the mobs behave the way you needed or until certain platforms that give you power spawn in better positions for you (wich ends up being the only strategy that the field of battle provides and that is completely random. The AI will rarely use them well).\n\n-While fun and useful when you level and clear the map, spells are rather secondary. They can be extremely necesary in certain maps that have incredible neutral camps difficulties; and be just a fun thing to do in other scenarios.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong with this review. Reincarnation is still a good game. It pretty much is a revamp of disciples 2 with a new combat system that is not really that cool. But i can hardly recommend it with all the issues it haves. Gaming has gone a long way from the games that had broken gameplay and weird AI issues. D3 should have been the improvement in those departments and not just the downfall because they not only couldn't fix them but maked them worse.\n\nThere were other minor issues, but i settled with the most important in my opinion. To do this review i waited to play enough time, but now I felt like I was ready to give an honest, objective opinion about the game.\nCheers!\n","August 4, 2014","false","92.1"," 186 of 208 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","186","208","3","1"

Buggy, unbalanced trying too much to copy from Heroes of Might and Magic it strayed far for Disciples 2. Reincarnation is an attempt to redo the game. Most bugs were squashed, balancing was redone, battlefields were made much smaller (so it is closer to D2 choice of who to attack instead of running around the field). If you haven't played D2, do so, it is still a much better game. But if you played D2 to death, this version of D3 is actually quite decent. Unfortunately the developer went bankrupt before they finished a planned Mountain Clans DLC so this faction is missing.","February 14, 2014","true","3.8"," 129 of 152 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","129","152","0","9"

It comes to Steam Store...\n\nReincarnation is the real Disciples 3. It's Renaissance+Resurrection, with refined tactical system and magic. Its combat is more like an advanced version from Disciples 2. The Combat area is smaller now, and every unit has their own limited movement and attack range, which makes formation extremely important. Ships and thief abilities are back, too! How could a old Disciples Fans miss all these features!!??\nAlthough there are still a few balance issues (poor Alliance QAQ...), and a little bugs as well (we have some non-official fix. don't know whether the steam version has fixed them or not), the game has the whole mechanic remastered and fixed all the buggy and annoying problems from the old 2.\n\nMoreover, Reincarnation is very mod-friendly. It provides map editor and file-export function. Players could make mod themselves in a very convenient way. Don't miss it! (Really hope it could provide Workshop support\n\nAlthough, not sure if I may see the Clan back agian in this series.... I really don't want to see them just stand in the wild to give you experience like the green skins do.......

It's no wonder this studio has crashed and burned.\n\nAs a longtime fan of the Disciples franchise who has been with the games since first release, I was excited for months after hearing about Renaissance. Like a lot of folks, I was legitimately upset by the poor quality of the finished game: Other than the beautiful graphics, nothing was right. The feel of the old games was gone along with the Mountain Clans and Undead Hordes factions, and gameplay was plagued by bugs and design flaws. I bought Resurrection in the hope that it might include patches and balancing to fix the vanilla game, and was let down again.\n\nWhen I saw Reincarnation in the Steam store, I managed to get excited yet again, and bought it on impulse.\n\nIf you like Disciples, don't make that mistake.\n\nGameplay is smoother and the game runs a little better, yes, but the combat alone is ten times as frustrating. I can't count how many times I've loaded a save because just one or two low-level enemy units can chew through your entire force, in campaign mode. Also changed for the worse is the character advancement system, where previously units would upgrade into new, more powerful forms so long as you had the proper structure built in your capital; now, units must level up 3 times before transforming. Good luck surviving that long, and that's from a veteran player and a pretty decent TBS tactician.\n\nOverall, even with improvements, Reincarnation is almost too exhaustingly irritating to play, especially in the long sessions for which you might normally enjoy a TBS.\n\n4/10","February 17, 2014","false","3.9"," 48 of 63 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","48","63","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheTinyMan/recommended/10270/","TheTinyMan","TheTinyMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheTinyMan/","384 products in account","I wanted very, very badly to like Disciples 3.  The art is as stunning as Disciples 2, perhaps even more so.  However, the balance is all off - XP gain is not proportional to threats, combat is a slow and frustrating affair (unless you're losing, at which point it will end in two rounds), and even after battles that I've won I had to make a trip back to my capital every single time to resurrect people.  And then, if I'm unlucky, sit and mash "END TURN" until I have the money to afford them.\n\nThe fact that I can only claim land in specific points also adds to the tedium, as I have to watch my territory ponderously expand toward resource cites that I've cleared out for dozens of turns before they are claimed.\n\nOf course, the quest dialogue and voice-overs are terrible.  Fortunately there's an easy way to turn unit voices off.\n\nThere were plenty of improvements between Disciples 2 and Disciples 3, by the way.  Combat is now on a tactical grid a la Heroes of Might & Magic.  Each grid has randomly-determined sites that can increase the effectiveness of one unit type, and leveraging these effectively can make a moderate battle into an easy one (although they still don't make difficult battles into reasonable threats).  Some overworld spells can be cast into runes, which can then be used to cast a scaled-down version of the spell during a battle.  Heroes have something not unlike a very toned-down version of the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X, or the leveling system in Final Fantasy 12 - basically a grid in which each square has some sort of bonus, and you can claim any square adjacent to an already-claimed square when leveling up.\n\nBut ultimately I'd give this one a skip, even as a fan of the genre.","July 12, 2014","false","11.8"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","0"

You control a hero and a small party, and you walk on a fogged map discovering locations, enemies and quests. I've had a lot of fun with a similar one (Expeditions: Conquistador) and so I thought I'd try this one out.\n\nYou start with a kind of cliche history about demons, the end of the world and all that. Since I'm not a native english speaker, I felt like they could've added sulbtitles so I wouldn't get so lost and disconnected about the history. After the intro, you get a nice tutorial, which explains pretty much all the basics of the game (altough the different factions and units are not explained at all, so each one you play with you'll have to see it for yourself what suits you better by trial and error). After that, you're all set to play the campaign.\n\nFirst of, I think the narrator did a very nice job. All of them read pretty nicely the texts that open each act from each faction. Problem is, that's al lthe voice acting you get. The rest is just at the beggining or after battles and it's the same sound over and over again. The history is presented to you at the beggining of the acts and while playing them, by non spoken dialogue.\n\nFor me the game started fun (on hard mode), I would walk and take my time to kill every monster and discover every part of the map (which is what the developers wanted, I guess). But some monsters are impossible to beat on any given map on the early stages of the game, even with a full party with max lvl soldiers.\n\nThe graphics are neither top notch nor bad, they fit decently into the game's theme. Only visual problem I had was with some long dialogues being cut by the "continue" buttom you must press after each characther has spoken. So you kind of miss some information. Couldn't the devs have made a scroll bar or just have the person say something in two dialogues instead of one?\n\nAnyways, the fun I've had in the previous 30 hours gave place to a feeling of boredom. I mean, after all you just go from map to map doing the same thing over and over, there are two or three secondary quests tops and the only thing keeping you forward is a little piece of history given to you before each act. And there are a lot of acts from all the factions. So you play each act for about 5 hours or more (if you kill every guy like me) and then there is 5 more lines of history and then 5 more hours doing the same thing. It gets boring pretty fast, especially if you don't like this kind of game.\n\nWhat keeps it better is that you can kind of "auto-resolve" a battle to make the game run faster, but the AI is so stupid that even aganist the weakest enemies you can lose one or two soldiers because the AI chooses to advance with only one guy aganist 7, even though you have 5 guys to attack (Idk why its so stupid since the AI of the enemy computer, altough not very bright, isn't that stupid).\n\nMy veredict is that, if you like this kind of strategy games, give this one a try, especially if on sale. I'll be fun for quite a while. But be warned that you'll be bored before knowing how the history ends. If you're going to go all the way to the end is up to you. I, myself, don't know if I will.","September 22, 2014","true","56.0"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Boats\n\nNow the fails between Older versions of D3 and this pile of poo.\n\n1. The character info screen. Tab #2 to see my XP? It's the stat I look at most often. Wait... WTF! Tabs!?!?!?! The right click character info from the older D3 editions were closer to D2 (and better).\n\n2. The 3 tier levelling process of your support units. Again these guys made changes where older D3 editions got it right. I don't want to dump that much combat experience into a disposable unit before he upgrades. "Look! I only need to play 643 more hours before my squire levels to paladin"... Go die. This also makes it harder to have multiple well supported leaders, so Lambert has the paladin while your other leaders rock squires and knights.\nSide note: Your characters that die in combat also gain experience... This felt strangely like cheating.\n\n3. The smaller battle map. Either copy Heros of Might and Magic, or stick with static formation turn based combat like D2 and old classics like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. The smaller map makes it near pointless to move around and puts your ranged units and magic users in harms way like never before.\n"Oh, Look! You got creative in an uninspired game". Your creative efforts have gained you a hybrid, akin to the crap you take that comes out like you've been eating cheese for a month, but leaves your butt dirty like Taco Bell diarrhea.\n\n4. The ranged/magic user unit's attack range has been limited (which was never a thing in any previous installment). Ranged units were weaker, but could hit anything on screen, so you never had to move them into melee combat, or off bonus tiles (in D3). This further weakens an already weak support unit. I assume this was meant to draw ranged units off the bonus tiles by having your melee units "Run Away!". Pro Tip: concentrate attack on bonus ranged/magic unit. They will not have that bonus after 1 => 2 rounds of combat. Limiting range of ranged units = EPIC FAIL!!!!","February 19, 2014","false","3.1"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","27","45","2","1"

The game isn't good enough to warrant the extra challenge it entails. If you're playing because you liked Disciples 2, then you're probably playing for the story (which admittedly isn't very good either). Took me about 120 hours to finish the first campaign. That's with less than 50 turns used per mission, minimal potions and spells, and full clear every map. Pretty brainless for me overall aside from occasional battle rigging, watched One Piece while playing this.\n\nGameplay:\nConcept changes all around for the most part but the core difficulty remains approximately the same. A lot of battles need to be rigged to be won or return when higher leveled. Tactics and proper magic usage will for the most part win most battles. If we're comparing difficulty between this game and Disciples 2 (hard difficulty), they are approximately the same but functioning off different systems. You still had to rig battles in Disciples 2 until your hero was OP and magic was also pretty important as well. The critical strike system is pretty bad though. Some new features like the "guardians" are pretty terrible, rodbearers were exponentially better.\n\nOverall, might be worth buying on sale if you were a fan of Disciples 2 otherwise stick with HoMM series. Game wasn't bad, but it's not worth recommending to the average player.","February 14, 2015","false","142.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I like that I can Alt-Tab out and do other things; the sound stops, the game stays static and contained, totally dependable. I have often kept my Disciples campaign running for days, just clicking into the window to make a few moves and then going about my business, not unlike how I play chess.\n\nThere are threads and threads of bad press about this game in its past forms. I tell you, this game is gold -- extremely reasonably priced -- and a great work of art the series of which has culminated in something I am absolutely enjoying.

I prefer the larger arena's of Disciples Renaissance over the smaller Arena's in Reincarnation. The one advantage of small arenas is the battle seems more personal. The downside is in larger arenas you could have a couple small battles within the arena, and obstacles would have a greater impact. The dev's claim that Reincarnation's maps are more open.  I don't agree, the maps seem even more cluttered. The only difference is you may have a shortcut path to cut across between 2 longer paths. The paths are still extremely linear. The seas ended up just being rivers and are as linear as you can get.\n\nReincarnation does have more settings that help to tailor the game to a player's preferences. An example is a setting to adjust attack animations within the arena. They have added some skills to the thief or fixed skills that didn't work correctly in previous versions. Certain arena skills are now triggered by critical hits or other events. This maybe helps the ai slightly but does not add any new strategy to combat.\n\nThe lighting and shadows are improved but then they decided to have the shadows rotate 90 degrees every 1/4 day. This begins to get annoying after 50 turns. I wish they would have had a feature to turn this off.  Another design decision I don't like is that you can't zoom out as far on the worldmap as you could in Renaissance. To me,  this makes the game feel less epic in scale. It also hints to the fact that this version really has no world map strategy to consider.  You can only see about 7 move points out from your hero in any given direction.\n\nIf this had been my first version of D3, the graphics would have really impressed me. However, since I had already played 2 versions of the game, it was no surprise.  Personally I don't think it any better than Renaissance. It has a different flavor, some new units. I feel Renaissance never got a fair shake because it was released essentially in beta state. Renaissance patched to 1.02 is as good in its own right as Reincarnation.  I don't like that the dev's made 3 separate versions of the same game. It is because there are things I like better from each version, so when I play either one, I always miss something from the other version.\n\nReincarnation is not quite as moddable as previous versions as system files can not be modded.\n\nPros - New units include 5 new orc types, wild boar, and a few sea creatures.\n- Stellar Graphics that aid in creating a totally immersive environment.\n- Same campaign is slightly rewritten and takes place on new maps.\n\nCons - Tutorial is close to useless\n- Still very linear maps even if they have a couple more shortcut paths\n- You can usually take as many turns as you need  before attacking difficult enemies.\n\n","February 19, 2014","true","41.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It feels like the game was reborn. Visually, it's the same. Internally, it's a new game.\n\nIt has become more complex, more complicated in terms of combat: party-to-party battles are more diverse, action-filled, and enjoyable now. RPG elements grew a bit stronger, being felt more distinctly than before. But what's the most important, endless bugs that haunted the players of original Disciples III: Renaissance are now fixed. Maps are loaded instantly, parties are never teleported to the city they have last visited, bottomless treasure bags with hundreds of potions inside are gone, a party can now enter the city (and not just stand next to it), game doesn't randomly crash anymore...\n\nPlaying Disciples III has finally become a pleasure.\n\nIf you had painful experience with the original game, never hesitate, get this. Troubles are gone in this edition.\n\nIf you are new to Disciples, then I'm telling you that this is a step-by-step strategy slightly influenced by RPG genre. It tells a story of several races fighting for dominance in the world of Nevendaar. Each of these races has their own goals, but their paths are constantly crossing, resulting in fierce battles. Control the resources the map has to offer, make small parties of soldiers where every fighter has their own unique skills, choose the way they will progress by means of building certain structures in your capital, and fight numerous foes to gain experience and treasures (including new weapons, armor and other stuff for your character and other party leaders). Some people say that it resembles Heroes of Might and Magic; of this, I cannot tell anything, because I never played the latter.\n\nSo, this day has come: I can now recommend Disciples III.

Same goes for fans of HoMM series, this version of Disciples can give you a fresh experience.\n\nThis is the most recent and best developed version. Reincarnation binds all Disciples III content together (Renaissance + Ressurection), with heavily revamped maps, completely changed gameplay(Back to the old style, more like the first 2 games), and is not as unforgiving as before. (Ironically the first mission of the easiest campaign(Imperials) was the most difficult mission in the game)\nMaps are now a lot more open, you're no longer limited to a single path, and enemy armies twice as strong as you no longer come for you after just a few turns. If you are used to the challenge Disciples Series has given so far, I do recommend highest difficulty, as the only downside to this version is the challenge has been lowered considerably - But this is also a huge upside, as some missions and places simply were too difficult (I do enjoy a challenge, like old skool games gave, but at some point it's no longer fun to either keep restarting from scratch or act like a save junkie to abuse your way trough a single battle.)\n\nI've spend hundreds of hours on Disciples II.

I purchased it when it first came out and the combat system was terrible. It takes like 10 rounds to beat goblins and imps. The enemy always has the advantage moving onto conveniently place focus points to screw you over and running like a little crap if you even get near killing one of its spell casters to another conveniently place spell power focus area. The computer will score criticals on your units and then immediately get another turn it seems due to "good initiative." I am sure the units get much better and each time I try to play this game it just flat out cheats. I will be a level 1 hero in the campaign and it will throw me against rogues and I have no chance of hitting them where they just take turns wasting my units.\n\nYour hero is supposed to be the leader of these armies and to me they feel like a bunch of weaklings and it really takes away from the epic feel the game is trying to bestow. I was really hoping this would be a good patch and it started promising, but it failed again. I agree with many of the users that gave a negative review or even a posititve review, JUST PLAY DISCIPLES II IS A MUCH BETTER GAME! I don't understand how pitching six to eight units in a quick style combat is so hard for the Disciples III team to make. Start the battle and just have the units hit one another!

Early-game heroes are weak as day-old kittens - no more being the equivalent of a tier 2 from the start! - and the neutral units seem heavily biased toward a fast hero with high accuracy. Meanwhile, at the end of a campaign you'll stomp through the highest tier enemies like they weren't even there.

But not anymore, they are now nightmares for your all tier 1 troop which mostly have around 8 to 12 Accuracy while those Imps have 43 Invasion (you will miss - a lot), and 140 health and 33 damage and 30 Accuracy (they do CRIT a lot, almost all the time) and 28 Initiative... basically, you just can't win against them without using some spells.

Too bad this game wasn't launched in this final state, it would would've undoubtedly gotten a way better reception than it did. It's estethically drop dead beautiful, the mechanics are mostly sound and it's LONG.\n\nThe change from a simple Disciples 2 combat to a full-blown 3D HOMAM-style arena is controversial. In the original game the arena was way too big, the fights too long as a result and the whole game felt like a grindfest. Now the arena is significantly smaller and the fights are snappier. But a whiff of grind is still there.\n\nAn issue that bothered me more was the economy. You simply have way too much money in this game. It's not uncommon to have 30k-40k gold from mid-game which makes levelling up units trivial. You simply buy a rookie unit, go to a Training Camp, sink several grand in and voila, you got yourself an elite. It's like Diablo 3 auction house all over again. Maybe the devs wanted to make up for the fact that units level up quite slow on their own but they should've lower the XP requirements instead.\n\nAll in all though if you love D2 this version of D3 is probably gona be your cup of tea too. Definitely a very good HOMAM-like game and a very good value too.","March 27, 2015","true","115.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Are you a Disciples fan? Have you found yourself lost in the previous versions for hours on end? Then buy this game. Its better than all the other new "R" incarnations I can't spell (Renaisance, Resurecction, whatev) since it takes the best from all of them and leaves the rest out. I read some of the negative reviews on here and like a fool I let it delay me from having the best Disciples experience since Sacred Lands Gold. This is polished, flowing, and builds on the previous games while adding modern mechanics and TONS of new artwork. People giving negative reviews can be listened to but their complaints are mostly about Disciples in general. Is it hard? Not nearly as hard as the first Disciples was. Is it tedious? Not nearly as much as Disciples 2 was. The magic is very specific, as in certain spells may sound all-powerful (and be bloody expensive) but there are many times they will be useless in battle. You have to be careful and cherish everything you find. There's lots... LOTS to explore and discover. It will take you a long time to develop powerful characters that can face anything (as in, multiple levels and countless hours), but yeah that's Disciples for you. The game is all about power-matching and countering, like any good magic fantasy, but Disciples was always famous for ramping things up and this version is no different. You will be forever out-matched, that's the point! Courage and charge on! Also, get good at healing and using powerups. Again, if you liked the original Sacred Lands with all its glitchy headaches and miserable gameplay (ie. always being outgunned), then you will like this game. Also, you can now carry forward two heroes with 9 items each to new campaign levels (!!!)  Oh and when you resurrect a unit, they retain their experience from the previous battles and will level up upon returning to life if they can! Yay improvements! The art is fantasic, worth it just for that imo, and also if you're obsessive compulsive like me and love a good, complex, interesting and ultimately satisfying game (your souls are MINE you damn dirty elves!)\n\nHints if you've never played before or its been a while;\n- When upgrading your leader skills, you should ALWAYS been gunning for the extra leadership point. Adding another member to your team is the best possible thing you can do.\n- Set difficulty to easy and leave it there.\n- Legion was always unfairly powerful, its the same this time, so play as them I guess if you're having trouble. Invest in Fiends and have them do the dirty work.\n- Pretty everything you do should be geared toward upgrading two good, balanced teams. When a member dies you gotta go back and resurrect/heal, yes every time. Pump all experience into the same 8-10 units. Spend all extra cash on leveling up dudes in training camps.\n- The easy enemies in the beginning are very valuable. Save them as easy pickings for your newest recruits.\n- Turn the music off or you're going to drive yourself insane!

Yes, it's not the original D1-2 style kind of game, combat particularly, probably they intended to get more HOMM-mish gameplay but still a very descent game after all.

What awaited me, though, was one big unbalanced mess.\n\nFor one, interface and new approach to castles we already know and love were steps in the right direction. Also the new approach to the character upgrades with some minor boosts to troops pleasantly surprised me.\nOn the other hand, the battle-system is maybe the most broken one I've encountered to date. I don't know if I somehow played it wrong (but considering I've read through tutorials and such, I think it wasn't my fault after all), but battles were just lenghty, repetitive chore. In every and each one of them you need to have one hell of luck on your side, because enemies are "tough". And the reason for quation marks is simple. I thought maybe I just chose bad enemies for the beginning of a map. Then I realized it's the same story with every enemy unit I attack, not only you have to pray so your troops actually hit something every now and then, but also you have to deal with the illusion of some strategy on that little Heroes rip-off action map. I understand that change is very important part in everything, but for the God's sake don't change that one kind of unique thing, which was perfectly functional, simple yet fun to play with.\n\nTo summarize it, I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, especially not to the Disciples fans.

Even so, I went ahead and purchased this based on the positive reviews that indicated a lot of the issues have been resolved.\n\nI expected simply a better working, better balanced version of the original but I'm happy to say that this is an entirely different game all the way around. Not sure I'm happy with the new battle mechanics, though, but I suppose I'll get used to it. I can already tell that the balance for the Empire army has drastically changed - not nearly as overpowered as it was, which gives me hope that perhaps the balance of the Legions and the Undead Hordes has improved so that they aren't so weak. On the other hand, I will probably not use auto-combat in this one as much as I did in the others. My army tends to get decimated if I'm not in control.\n\nAnother hope is that I won't experience as many crashes as before, although the game did freeze up after one battle. Once I got the game to minimize, there was a low memory warning on the screen that doesn't make sense since my computer is built to be a gaming computer with as much gaming power as HP could give it.\n\nAlso have to mention the opening, which is phenomenal. Much better than the original. The storyline seems much improved as well. Kind of makes me wish I could read Russian so I could read the book that was written based on the game.\n\nDespite the nerfed battle system (only my opnion, though), I believe this is going to be $30 well spent and I do recommend the game.","May 2, 2014","true","409.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The previous two games were much better evan though they containd a lot of bugs.\nI am "Discples" fan and i have played in all of their relises, have to say, this is the worst one so far.\nI am very disapointed!!!","October 31, 2014","false","27.0"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"

It plays like an old school HoMM, but it is just broken.  The AI will gobble up mobs (and almost always be higher level), yet when you fight it behaves incredibly simple and very easy to predict/control.  There is very little deviation in troop layout, the battle maps are extremely small, and movement is very limited.  All combined makes for almost no deviation in strategy.  You'll find one (maybe 2) strategies that work and that's it!  Don't bother trying to have fun, just repeat the same strategy for every single fight and walk around the map some more.  Oh wait, sometimes you have to buff your army before a fight.  I guess that makes it refreshing and new.\n\nI really wanted to like this game.  I liked the first 2 Disciples, and I like the HoMM style of gameplay.  The graphics are nice too.  But, this game is just broken.","January 7, 2015","false","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fantastic now and deeply enjoyable. It's a shame it took so long to get it right, I feel many people have left the franchise.\nIt's a great game though. I adore the music, the art, the story, the battle system. The customizable leaders. They added some great stuff in here.\nHowever the AI is exceptionally bad. The version hard is essentially giving you opponents 12 levels higher. I'm not sure what goes into making AI's but both the opponents and the general monsters on a map could use a serious intelligence boost, not level boost.","January 20, 2015","true","113.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Way more in=depth. While it has some of the basic functions of other Disciples. it has major differences. Still fun to play and it will challage you. The ai will try to flank you use "Feign" force to draw you away from it main goal. You will be on your toes the whole time.","June 22, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
