I was stunned by the narrative quality, atmosphere design and character depth; yearning for more as it comes. Sadly, after the third game, there was radio silence from the creator of Gabriel: Jane Jensen, the novelist and game designer extraordinaire. After years of suffering that silence, Jane Jensen returns to create Gray Matter, a wondrous stand-alone adventure game with a captivating world of its own: a modern folktale.\n\nDuring a hellish storm in the middle of the night, riding on an old motorbike towards London, we meet Samantha Everett. She is a brilliant young woman who's been on the road for quite a while, travelling the cities of Old World, collecting tricks and illusions, aspiring to become a great magician one day. As the fickle finger of fate turns the road sign during the storm, Samantha ends in Dread Hill House, an old mansion that resides on the south of Thames Valley, Oxford. The accursed bike gets busted, and without much hope for any other shelter for the night, Samantha rings the doorbell and introduces herself as the new "assistant" that Dr. David Styles, world renowned neurobiologist and the master of the household's been expecting for. From that point onwards Samantha will find herself in a web of mystery, distrust and intrigue, building lies big and small to protect David, as David will become frustratingly trapped within the events of old that's been haunting him. Is there a light at the end of this tunnel for them?\n\nGray Matter is a story of mystery with incredible character design and story depth, melting science and magic within the same pot as an expertise of Jane Jensen. There is a vague two-ways transition between the real and the illusory in the tale, making you question what would be mere trickery, what would be rationally explainable and what would be... actual magic, perhaps. Such masquerade is the direct subtext of the name of the game, aside a component of the central nervous system if you ask me. We have no idea what it is, or better: we have many ideas without solid answers. Such is the beauty settled in this mystery.\n\nThe display of anecdotes borrowed from folktales and mythologies of the world brought together to present a lovely environment design, illustrated with a selection of haughtily beautiful artwork. The places reimagined within the game carry real life ties and authenticity, bringing in wondrous historical details to your attention in every turn. Characters are unique, charming and quirky in their own way - and with marvelous voice acting, I must say - making you warm up to them faster than you'd realize. At the end of the first chapter, I guarantee that you'll get captivated by the story, the design and characters, pushing yourself to see more of them.\n\nThe gameplay is basically your old school adventure. You explore the environment and interact with people, locations and items. But I must warn you: there is no hand holding. You will encounter riddles, puzzles and logic tricks, expecting you to think outside of the box. When you are playing this game, keep in mind the kind of relative reality used in Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll. The simplest answer, hidden behind a heavy curtain of misdirection will always be your friend. As Sam being a magician, you will sometimes be expected to pull of magic tricks to bend the events towards your favor. For that purpose, you'll be given a magic interface for you to plan the steps of your trick. You will also be given the opportunity to play as David from time to time, learning more about him as you play. The map is fully interactive with action indicators and there are also some bonus actions you may take in each chapter to reveal a bit more as you play.\n\nGray Matter is an adventure game done right: challenging, intriguing, empathic and immersive. My only complaint would be that there are no Steam achievements yet. But there really is a suitable substructure of the game for achievements already, so I hope we can see them here around one of these days. This is a hidden gem that both adventure gamers, and anyone with an appreciation for either art or narrative building would love.\n\nBecause he's safe in arms now, what luck have I that I should see\nSafe in arms now, my bloody boy returned to me\nFrom Jericho back home to me...*\n\n*Lyrics by The Scarlet Furies - Safe In Arms, from Gray Matter the Game soundtrack\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 17","true","16.4"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","54","60","0","13"

If you're a fan of magic (as in magic tricks), then this is also a special treat.\n\nThis title is made by Jane Jensen of Gabriel Knight fame from the "golden age" of adventure games. As far as writing a compelling adventure game, she knows what's doing.\n\nTechnically, there are some issues, and lack of polish in places reflects the limited development budget. But all this is forgivable, I think.\n\nMentioned in the description, but not shown in the screenshots (probably rightfully so, to avoid spoilers), the chapters actually alternate between two playable characters. This ability to play "two sides" of the story is a major feature of Gray Matter.\n\nThis isn't a puzzle oriented game. You won't be stuck hunting pixels. Progress is mostly straightforward. Each chapter has several main tasks you need to accomplish that are sometimes dependent, but sometimes allow you to explore in an order of your choosing. Note that sometimes the game expects you to arrive at a particular location to progress (this confused me twice).\n\nBe warned that the game starts off somewhat slowly in the first few chapters, but gradually picks up pace. Stick with it until at least the third chapter before deciding to give it up.","June 20, 2014","true","100.5"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","6"

Clunky interface choices that make it hard to know how to interact and perform tricks. I enjoyed the game and liked the artwork which reminded me of J.M. Linsner at times. The plot is a slow burn that demands patience but is rewarding as you progress.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/recommended/260570/","tinyturtle","Tiny Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/","870 products in account","This is not a game that's easy to review for me as it's easily the most internally polarizing game I've ever played. It's a game that I both love and hate in equal measure, one that makes the most obvious, horrible mistakes, while still managing to dazzle you with its heart.\n\nThe game starts off really well with a beautifully rendered slide-show cutscene that looks as if it were painted by hand. It does a perfect job of setting up a mood and introducing our protagonist, and is immediately followed by a very simple and easy tutorial. It's a tutorial that nearly lies to you though, starting you off with a couple of puzzles, only to then bind you to what comes to be something like two hours of primarily dialogue, wandering about and looking at things.\n\nThe game is slow. It's insane how slow it is. The story gives you almost no hooks to catch you with other than the hope that you'll enjoy the characters and the -promise- of a mystery enough to continue. The actual puzzles in the first two chapters are all very simple. The game does a good job of telling you what you need to do in order to progress, and as you figure out the methods, it'll hint towards the means. They're (mostly) well designed and a joy to unlock, but they never quite feel like they're the main focus of the game.\n\nThe main focus is the story. It's not a bad story either, it's sweet, it's got its mystery and its build up, but the pacing is glacial. Finishing the first two chapters took me about four hours and in that time I learned extremely little. Yes, you do find out tidbits about both Sam (the protagonist) and Dr. Styles (her employer), but none of it is surprising and none of it carries the shock that the writers seemed to intend. The 'accident' is mentioned very quickly in the game and you're told not to ask people about it (and the game doesn't let you, either), but when it's finally revealed what happened -- it's completely predictable and almost disappointing. A cutscene shows Sam responding to it with shock, surprise, grief and empathy, whereas the player's reaction is more likely that of; "That's it? Really? That's the big reveal?"\n\nYet, like I said, the story isn't bad. It's just not good. The characters are fine, admittedly even if they feel like they're taken out of a teen romance story, with the orphaned sorta-gothic tough girl acting as the lead, who ends up living with a dark, mysterious and secluded, brooding man with a dark secret and-- yeah. You see where that's going. Along the way she gathers around herself a group of social stereotypes, all of which feel entirely two dimensional. Yet, again, they're not bad. They're entirely likeable even.\n\nThen there's the graphics. Another point that really has me struggling to make a decisive judgement on it. It's gorgeous. Mostly. All the environments you go to are beautifully rendered, clearly handmade with so many little touches. I can only think of a couple of locations where I actually wasn't impressed with what I saw. Some of the locations are straight up amazing, even. Check the screenshots and you'll see exactly what I mean. Yet I did say that they're gorgeous, mostly. Mostly. See, all this amazing art is actually given to you at a surprisingly low resolution. Playing at 1920x1080 I was exposed to gorgeous art that had been muddied by being stretched out across the screen. It felt like such a waste. It's only a 5gb game too, it's heart breaking that they didn't just up the size and add higher resolution backgrounds.\n\nThis is then combined with another good & bad, the character models. They actually look just fine. The resolution is high enough and the details are good enough. The lighting in the scene illuminates them well and the shadows are actually rather pretty. Yet despite this, the fact that you have a high resolution 3D character in a lower resolution environment causes them to pop out horrendously. Not a single character in the game ever looks like they're a part of the world they live in. You're constantly reminded by how the world is nothing but a 2D plane. To make matters worse is that every once in a while the models are given idle animations that are way, way too exaggerated. One scene has the American sitting on the grass, constantly going between leaning back and sitting forward, with him kicking his leg into the air in between. As the conversation goes, he'll do this constantly.\n\nAnother up and down is the voice acting. The voice actors themselves were very likeable. Their voices fit their roles and they did their lines well. The downside is that this game is stuck with the ye olde adventure game type of talking. It's the kind where as they talk, a box of subtitles pop up. Once the character has finished speaking those lines, they stop. The subtitles go away and a new box opens. Then the character continues. Every time this happens there's this weird and awkward pause that completely snaps you out of it, and really shouldn't be happening in a modern game like this. Conversations should be fluid, especially with such a lovely cast; people should actually talk like they're talking to each other. Not like they're by themselves and reading subtitle boxes one at a time.\n\nSo what's the verdict? Honestly, despite everything, I want to like this game. I do. Every part of it just shines with heart and effort. You can tell that on every front, the developer put their heart and soul into the game. They worked -hard- on it, and that fact gives it so much charm and likeability. This shows best in the art I believe, but also in the puzzles themselves. They're rather simple, I admit, but they're a joy to solve. They're fun! I wish the game had more of them, a LOT more. It's fantastic to chase after Daedalus clues! It's equally fun to flip through the book of magic tricks to apply them to a situation, then map out the choreography. Simple, yes. Easy, yes. But fun. Charming, clever and full of character.\n\nSo I really believe I can suggest this game to people that enjoy adventure games. If you're okay with slow pacing, if you enjoy an easy story and you'd rather have fun puzzles instead of difficult ones, this is a game I can recommend to you. Like I said, this game is a labour of love and I want to see more from the talent behind it. :]","January 19, 2015","true","10.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

The truth is that it doesn't really have challenging puzzles at all; they are all pretty simple and even I could say lame. However, I loved it, for the following reasons:\n- The artwork. It seduced me from the very beginning. The videos seem to be a sequence of oil paintings, beautifully done, starting with the protagonist. The whole atmosphere is a work of art.\n- The story. It was cool and original, even though it had a couple of cheesy moments. If I heard Dr. Styles saying "Laura" one more time, I would have snapped, and it is my name!\n- The music! I want the soundtrack!\n- The lack of illogical "inventory-based puzzles", which is usual in adventure games and forces you to pixel-hunt the entire screen, looking for items that make no sense, until you need to combine a baby rattle with a crystal glass and pepper spray to open a door. Not here. Even though it could have used more challenging puzzles overall, I am glad that the usual nonsense of other games wasn't present here.\n- Well, I guess this is kind of a spoiler... Including magic tricks was, for me, very cool.\n\nNow, on the downside, besides the lack of challenging puzzles I could mention that the story, cool as I found it, has a couple of "holes". There were, particularly close to the end, a couple of things that didn't make any sense and that weren't explained. But, in general, I loved this game and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys artistic / story-based adventure games.","June 26, 2014","true","14.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","2"

I think the devs did a nice job overall, though the game does have some flaws. In particular, I think they did a nice job of steering away from the standard genre cliches and doing something different in terms of characters, plot, setting, etc.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent story. Fairly unique plot. Good pacing. Kept me engaged throughout. The story alone is enough reason to play, at the end of the day.\n+ Good characters. Chatacters were distinct, and were not simply the standard cliches you see in every other game.\n+ Several pretty innovative elements (both in terms of story and gameplay). Most notably, the main character is a stage magician and is able to do magic tricks to solve certain puzzles. (This mechanic is not very well done, but still nice to see something fresh.)\n\nCons:\n- The game is unreasonable in terms of expecting you to do very, very specific things at certain points in the game. At several times, I got 99% of the way through a chapter only to get stuck on a single action because I didn't do something very small (like look at something or go back to an area I had already searched). As a result, I had to consult a walkthrough several times. In each case I was very annoyed at the "solution."\n- I appreciate that the cutscene artwork in the game is unique and different, but it is not very effective at conveying what is actually happening. Some of the cutscenes can be pretty confusing in terms of following what is actually going on.","January 4","true","15.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

It felt like a dumb treadmill, with puzzles being pretty much unrelated to the rest of the game /narrativ. The game wouldn't have needed that artifical time stretcher, quite the contrary.\n\nIf you're searching for a decent, albeit somewhat old fashioned adventure, go get it.

Its strengths are beautiful backgrounds and objects, well-developed characters, and a great mystery story that keeps you guessing until the very end. There aren't many puzzles that will stump you; the focus is on exploring this fictional Oxford and discovering the next part of the story. Sam, the protagonist, can use magic tricks to manipulate people, but this mechanic doesn't let you be as creative as I first imagined; you just choose tricks from a book and execute them according to the instructions. Still, it's a nice way to continue the themes of the game--illusion, deception, and magic--into the point-and-click gameplay.\n\nNow that I've finished the game, I find myself really missing the atmosphere and the characters. (FYI, one character is a bit of a "funny Jewish guy" stereotype, and the main romance in the game isn't developed at all, but these are small complaints.) The voice acting is solid; the soundtrack is great; the animations leave a bit to be desired, but the still art is fantastic. The game is broken up into chapters, and two chapters equal one in-game day: first you play in the morning as Sam, then in the afternoon as Dr. Styles, another neat feature.\n\nOverall, Gray Matter is definitely worth purchasing for anyone who likes the sound of adventure-game-meets-graphic-novel. It has some of the best writing of any modern game, and boasts a surprisingly complex plot that takes time to unravel. Lots of buried clues and rewards for an observant player. I was surprised to find that this game hasn't reached a more general audience, because it's fantastic. Both sad and funny at times (sometimes unintentionally funny), it's also a great experience to share with a friend.\n\nP.S. I ran into a bug where cutscenes at the end of the game kept repeating, but was able to choose "skip scene" in options to overcome this.","August 12, 2014","true","13.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

However, one of the main protagonists feels like a Japanese anime supervillian, and there is not a single likeable character in the story. The story occasionally craps itself when the characters do something completely against their established personality, which makes it difficult to immerse yourself when you just can't understand why anyone acts like they do and eventually you just have to give up and observe everything at a distance, which is a shame.\nThe game also commits the cardinal sin of objects you've already looked at suddenly changing function when you poke at something else somewhere else that magically furthers the story, without letting you know. Which means you're constantly running around rechecking every clickable thing you've already clicked, looking for the one thing that'll now allow you to continue.\nGameplay is frustrating, but that's par for the course for most adventure games. Considering all the running around you have to do, it would have been nice if the running controls worked consistently. Sometimes you can double-click to run faster, but it doesn't always work and there's a big animation delay.\nI had massive performance problems with the game, as have a bunch of other people on the forums, but setting the game to WinXP SP2 Compatibility mode fixed it for me.","December 31, 2014","false","1.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

You play as two different characters, one of whom is convinced the events are due to paranormal activity and the other who is convinced it is due to a magician's illusions which really helps tell the story form the different perspectives. The puzzles are mostly straightforward, you just mainly need to go round and talk to everyone and look at everything to progress the story. There are a few convoluted puzzles but not too many. The length of the game is pretty good too for a point and click game. The locations are beautiful as is the cut scene art, only slightly marred by how the 3D models don't quite look like the characters do in the cut scenes.

It reminds me a lot about Fahrenheit in a way that a mysterious and captivating story gets ruined by a rushed up and shallow ending. At least all the mysteries are explained. Kinda.\n\nWhy have I finally decided not to recommend the game? While I have certainly enjoyed the voice acting and the story (except the ending), the production values of the game are not really that high. The visuals, especially characters models and animations are subpar for 2014. The cutsences are just a series of images. The puzzles are pretty boring and obvious for the most part. And you have to visit the same locations again and again in the first 7 chapters (only the last chapter has a lot of cool new content).\n\nThere are also some technical issues related to the perfomance. Also there's no autosave feature which is really bad since these days you are accustomed not to save your game manually.\n\nBottom line: while Gray Matter is not bad, there are so many great adventure games these days (from Daedalic and King Art specifically, not to mention Broken Age and Sherlock Holmes series) that have higher production values.

It was worth the wait.\n\nYou play as Sam Everett, a struggling yet talented young American magician, who seeks to join the mysterious Daedalus Club, an exclusive magicians’ society. On the way to London, her bike breaks down and she takes refuge in a beautiful gothic mansion, pretending to be an Oxford student sent to assist the mansion’s resident, Dr David Styles, a physically and emotionally scarred neurobiologist who is in deep mourning over the loss of his wife from a tragic accident.\nThe game has eight chapters in which you will alternate between Sam and Dr Styles perspectives as they try to unravel the mysterious and spooky events that are going on in and around Oxford. The story is, for the most part, really interesting and the core mystery keeps you guessing. Unfortunately, the final chapter, while full of the more interesting puzzles that are on offer throughout the game, offers an unsatisfying and rushed conclusion that leaves several questions unanswered.\n\nThe voice acting is well done, especially from the main protagonists Sam and Dr Styles. So too from the supporting characters with the exception of the bit part characters who are laughably bad.\n\nThe gameplay is a classic point and click experience. You look for information and clues for the situation at hand and search for items that will later come in handy for solving a puzzle as well as talking to a host of colourful characters. The puzzles, for the most part, are logical and well tuned and, bar a few, overall not too complicated to solve. I felt the difficulty was just right and left me with a sense of satisfaction after having worked them out.\n\nGraphically the game is beautiful. The pre-rendered backgrounds make all the locations in the game gorgeous, the character models are not too shabby either being fairly detailed and the hand drawn animated cutscenes are just as attractive as the in game visuals.\nThe music too, is beautiful, I cannot stop listening to the soundtrack. It fits in with the game's mysterious and haunting theme perfectly.\n\nOverall this is a wonderful point and click adventure and I highly recommend you play this, especially if you love adventure games.\n","July 13, 2014","true","17.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I loved and enjoyed it very much. Do I recommend it? Yes, absolutely! If you love adventure game, this is your game! You must have it in your library!\n\nI could give a brief introduction of it but one of its strong points is the discovering of the development of its story step by step while you're playing it. So I'll give you only a list of its pro&con.\n\nPRO:\n1) The plot is enticing, brilliant, original and good structured and developed. It "casts a spell upon you so that you will be enthralled by it and held in its power"\n2) Graphics are very good both during gameplay and cutscenes\n3) Gameplay is good: there is an initial tutorial and whenever you find a "new situation" the tutorial will show up and explaing how to deal with it. Also when you move the cursor on top of the screen the inventory is showed (remember that objects can be combined) and on the left corner there is an icon that works as main menu also there are two buttons: one whit a series of horizontal lines that show you the "paragraphs" of the chapter and your progress of each of them in percentage (it's very very useful! So you know on which you must focus to get story going on) and one whit an asterisk that shows the map of the places you can visit. Spacebar shows the hotspots.\n4) The soundtracks are good\n5) Dialogues are well written just as the voices of the characters are well acted\n\nCON:\n1) I think a much more younger voice for the main male character would more fitting, but it's just my opinion\n2) The scripts and style of them are, in same case, blurred or tend to overlie each other\n\nIn summary, my rating of the game is 9/10","January 22, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was drawn in be the art style, the music, and the pleasant usable interface. Then I began to realize the depth of the story. The characters are all multifaceted and interesting. The painstakingly designed and rendered scenery suggests a deep familiarity with the area and makes me curious about the inspiration for the story. Oxford was never on my list of places to visit but after that glimpse it may well be. The detailed backstory available in the game was interesting and educational.\n\nThe puzzles were really good, not being entirely apparent but always with ample clues if you read things. I did find that I wound up using the area hotspots more often than not as i was too interested in the story and the puzzles to worry about playing pixel hunts but a couple of times I was dissapointed that I had as there are some cleverly hidden zones that would have caused me some enjoyable frustration. The idea of Samantha's magic tricks was a really novel presentation and seemed to add some extra dimension to the adventure. In general none of the puzzles weren't overly routine but the fresh feel of it and the great detail helped anytime it was too obvious.\n\nI'd also like to give this game a nod for making some efforts to offer some positive messages through the actions and choices (or refusals) of the protagonist. It's refreshing to see good values and health being given a positive light in gaming. Not to get on a soapbox and wave my cane or anything...\n\nIt was a very moving and immersive game with a well written if extensively foreshadowed story.\nYou probably wouldn't like it. I really did.\n\nThanks for making this. I'm looking forward to future works.","August 5, 2014","true","21.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The voice acting and dialogue is good and it would probably have made a good tv series or book but as a game it's really bad in almost every possible way.\n\nMost of the puzzles are pretty straightforward in the actual steps required to solve them, nothing gets mechanically more complicated than combining two items and using the result on another or typing in a code on a keypad. This can be seen as a good thing, you'll never get stuck trying to figure out what particular order to combine items in or stumbling through some complex order of inputs on a machine, but to cancel it out it's generally complete nonsense what puzzles you're actually supposed to be solving. Interactions with your environment is limited to one action per interactable environment object so you don't accidentally miss picking something up, but this is canceled out by having some random items equipped overwriting this one action (but not all items) creating moments where you have to use an item on a door but don't realize because the cursor only tells you to walk through it. You can hit space to make titles appear over every interactable "if you get stuck", but it's pretty much mandatory to have these on all the time since there's otherwise no indication most things can be interacted with aside from the mouse cursor changing and there's a lot of stuff overlapping that you could easily miss being seperate interactables. There's also the occasional offscreen interactable that you'd have no clue was there without seeing half the title for it poking out since 99% of the game is static single screens and there's no other indications for which are dynamic long screens that will pan when you walk to the edge of them.\n\nThe narrative does a really poor job of directing you to where you should be going, unlike something like Monkey Island where Guybrush will say all his thoughts aloud the characters in this will keep most of their ideas and motivations to themselves so you'll be expected to be rooting through someones stuff to look for incriminating evidence when to the player there's no reason to suspect them since the character is being paranoid without vocalizing it. The motivations make perfect sense for the characters but not the player so I spent a ton of time wandering around wondering what exactly I was supposed to be doing. The map lights up areas you need to visit to progress the chapter but it lights up EVERY area with important things to do for the entire chapter so that isn't helpful until you're wrapping things up at the end. Each area's progress is not independent either so you can have three areas lit up that you can't actually do anything in until you complete some arbitrary action in the fourth. You can also see a listing of your progress towards the chapters "questlines" but that just gives you a very general idea of what to do. For anyone who takes a break and comes back a while later mid-chapter you're basically screwed and stuck trying to use every item on everything. hell that still happened plenty to me and I did all my play back to back.\n\nTo top all this off, the game doesn't even run very well. It's got a couple bugs that will cause it to drop tons of frames unless you restart your computer and sometimes that won't even fix it. At a few points characters I was supposed to talk to didn't render on screen and I had to leave and reenter the area. For an adventure game with prerendered backgrounds and very few fairly ugly models on screen at any time this kind of performance is inexcusable.\n\nIt's a shame every single aspect of what makes this a game is so poorly executed, it has an engaging enough story and characters that it could have been a decent book or movie but the mechanics ruin the pacing and make the whole thing a greuling experience. Worth a watch on youtube, not worth a playthrough no matter how cheap it is.","August 27, 2015","false","9.0"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","15","27","3","0"

That's not to say it's perfect though, but it's defintiely one of the best.\n\n9/10\n\nPros:\n- beautiful art\n- great music\n- a well-done and interesting story, if a bit cliche and cheesy (in an addictive I-have-to-know-what-happens-next sort of way)\n- a unique and fun gameplay mechanic with magic tricks, which had me wishing I could do more with it (hoping that if there's a sequel they expand and enhance this feature! it was a lot of fun). I've never played, or heard of, a game featuring a magician (as in, a stage magician, where the magic isn't really magic) and it felt different and exciting and was a lot more fun than I expected!\n- the puzzles feel intuitive and fun but still provide a challenge. I really, really like the implementation of highlighting locations depending on what can/has been completed there. The progress list was also very helpful for the once or twice when I would get stuck and not know what to do, and be able to suss it out based on what my progress list said was only partially completed.\n\nCons:\n- the quality of the voice acting varies, and took me out of the game a few times when it made me go "huh?". Occasionally a character said something in an odd inflection or with no emotion. It reminded me a lot of Cole Phelps interviewing people in LA Noire, where his reactions didn't always fit the technique choices of 'truth', 'doubt', and 'lie'.\n- the animations surprised me by being lower quality than expected. I've recently replayed The Longest Journey, a game that came out in 1999, and Gray Matter's animations reminded me a lot of TLJ. I guess the screen shots made my expectations higher? Certainly not awful, but not what I expected from a game in 2014.\n- I experience no bugs/glitches EXCEPT one that effectively prevented me from continuing the game, forcing me to reload a save from hours earlier. I recommend making at 2-3 saves per chapter and keeping them, just in case. This was the only time I was forced to consult walkthroughs, in order to try to figure out what went wrong. Eventually determined it was not necessarily due to me but something just went wrong in the game... I suspect I did something in an odd/unexpected order and messed something, a la King's Quest. Don't expect this to be something that happens often though, as when I looked into it it seemed like a rare problem (but it's still a problem that exists, and a big one at that).\n\n\nI got the game on sale for ~$3 and felt like I got way more than my monies worth, honestly. Even with what I consider to be 'cons', I'd have happily paid the full price for the game and am recommending it to my friends.

No, this is a story about two humans, two souls, two destenies. Both of our heroes have their agenda, but there is also a mistery in old British castle that will affect both. But they look at it differently. One is a sceptical, another fatefull. Actually, let's take a closer look on our heroes.\n\nSamanta Everret is an American red haired dare beast of a lass, who acidentely get involved into a working for famous neurobiologiest. She's a sceptical, tough, antihero like persona. No remorse or a second thought if there is something needed to be done! She can lie, trick people, go into extremes, argue... and bloody hell she's amazing at what she does. It also help in her life style, that she's magician (not real though, just ye standart showwoman trixter). In her chapters, player will come into situations and events, wneh her art will help her get the job done. Unfortunately, there are no experiments... You just taking trik from a book and perform it step by step. But still this is a nice little addition and somewhat of a unique play mechanic. But this lass have a dream, to became a part of Dedalus club -- a very discreet, magician community. Will she achieve her goal? Up to player to find out.\n\nDr. David Styles on the other hand is a misantropic, socialy awkward, hermet... And who can blame him? Telling his story would be a spoiler thus a crime! He lost his wife, he really cared about and loved, and after some acidents, dedicated his life to neurobiology, in attempt to... Some may call him boring charecter, but for me, he alweys will stay one of a perfect example of those mad scientist, that don't see to destroy world or have revenge on someone. No, he just wants to do his job, he seek some remedy for a broken soul, he gave up on life but still have faith. it's hard to describe this charecter, you should just see for yourself.\n\nWhat about an actuall story? Well, the game is developed by Gabriel Knight creator; So be ready for a mature, dark and actually frightning game! There are no gallons of blood of jump scares. No the mystery and keeping player in dark is scary enough. The real fear comes from what you can't see, thus giving birth to fear of seeing what was mystery. Again, this is a story of people, not world. Oh yeah and soundtrack! The musik in main menu sets the mood already... and it will continue throughout the whole game.\n\nThere are no video cutscenes, their place are given to a comix style. Are they good? Yes they are. unfortunately that could not be sayed about the game animation itself. Charecter models and amimation is bulky, and there are lack of animation for deeds you perform. But those can be overlook, if only you are not some kind of animation maniac. Saying that, locations on the other hand, look astonishing! The are bloody amazing! The amount of details can be overwhelming at times.\n\nWhat about puzzles? Game is easy, really easy. Not in it's favor, but yes... I doubt anyone will need solution for this. Most of puzzles are point 'n click items based, and those are not quite easy to solve. But on the other hand, compared to modern "Adventures" -- that are either too dumb (not realising what made old adventures great), or without any actual puzzling or adventuring (hello Telltails), I would say it has a balance between story and puzzles, and there are actual thinking must be involved.\n\nSo yada yada yada. Do I recomend this game? I had disk with it back in 2011... Lost it... Was sad... Now i have it on steam, and would buy it again for sure! So yes. If you like Gabriel Knight, if you are up for a mature, dark and frightning story, if you like oldschool adventures. Then this game will remedy your hunger.","April 18, 2014","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is aplyed from the third person POV and the player controls a female character.\nWell, the story is great and charming - you have a magic protegonist and it seems oh-so-lovely that she can do these tricks. However, do not get attached to the simplicity of illusions. Things will get pretty undergound when  you get to the later plot twists.\nThe general positives of this game are the classic P&C-ness, the dialogue and of course, the magic.\n\nIf you're not into slow, P&C games, then this one is not for you. Another thing that I personally find as a negative side is that sometimes you need to visit a specific place so that the story can continue. This is  abit off, but oh well.\n\nGenerally, this is one of the top P&C quest games I know.","January 5, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just like Gabriel Knight, Gray Matter is a mystery story that deeply involves the supernatural and paranormal, while exploring real locations, talking to a lot of characters and solving multiple inventory puzzles.\n\nThe Pros:\n-Unique  story, involving life beyond death, magic and the power of the mind. It starts a bit slow, but it quickly picks up the pace and becomes quite intriguing.\n-Interesting characters, with their own motivations and personalities.\n-Decent voice acting\n-Most of the puzzles are pretty straightforward, yet challenging enough that you'll feel accomplished if you figure them out yourself. The game also includes a screen that tells how far you are into each chapter, and even into each puzzle.\n-Although very simplistic, the magic tricks puzzles and fun to do.\n-Superb music by Robert Holmes, very reminiscent of Grabiel Knight.\n\nThe Cons:\n-The graphics. The backgrounds are ok, but the characters are really ugly. Specially when you get a close-up of them whenever they talk, they look horrendous, like lifeless Second Life models. It's really jarring when you compare them with the beautiful traditional art that you get in the cutscenes.\n-Some veterans might find the puzzles too easy.\n-Some times the game will require you to see a particular thing, talk to a particular person or visit a location before allowing you to continue. It results into having to sweep through the entire map, clicking in every hotspot when you're at the end of a chapter and you've completed 97% of it, not knowing what's left.\n-At the very end, the game falls into the Point & Click common mistake of throwing you into a series of puzzles that have nothing to do with the plot and only slow down the pace of the story in a moment of critical climax, just so it feels like a last challenge, a "final boss" before the end of the game.\n-There are a few obscure parts in the plot that are never explained, but it's not too frustrating. The game seems to be set for a sequel, but for now there's nothing about it.\n\nIn conclusion, it's got its flaws, but the story and enjoyable gameplay makes up for them. Gray Matter might not live to Gabriel Knight standards, but to be fair, what does. It's still a very recommendable title for any seasoned fan of the genre, and even for newcomers.","April 11","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A secret society. A series of unexplained accidents. A mysterious experiment. All come together in Gray Matter, a charming adventure game that hearkens back to genre classics, namely Syberia and The Longest Journey. Like those games, Gray Matter is headlined by a compelling female protagonist, the magician Samantha, who journeys through an Oxford seeped in atmosphere and intrigue. As she adventures throughout Oxford, Sam meets a curious cast of individuals: the mysterious magic shop owner, Mephistopheles; the sultry foreign exchange student, Helena; the shy and superstitious nursing student, Angela; and the infamous neurobiologist, Dr. David Styles, just to name a few.\n\nThe game's story, while not without its loose ends, is the strongest feature of Gray Matter. Happenings begin to coincide that force the player to question: Are these events supernatural in origin? Or scientific? Are they parts to an elaborate illusion, carefully orchestrated by a puppeteer lurking in the Oxford shadows? Or some combination of all three? Suspicion is thrown onto all core characters and the solution to the mysteries in Oxford remains elusive right up to the game's closing act.\n\nThe game's visuals will likely be disappoint to some, given that the game originally released in English around 2011 and the game looks more like it was a product from the early 2000. That being said, if this is something you can look past, the game's scenes and area are still a delight to look through. Less enjoyable are the close-ups of the in-game models, displayed in the bottom left whenever a character is speaking. These close-ups make some characters appear strange and wooden and this becomes particularly jarring when the player sees depictions of the characters in short, illustrated cut scenes between game chapters, where they look much better, but also very different from their in-game models.\n\nThe game also suffers from one of the classic weaknesses of adventure games: progression is often dependent upon clicking or finding a very specific area/object, sometime multiple times. Several in-game features actually offer the player help with this, however, if needed. Pressing spacebar enables labels for clickable areas/items of interest and the game also features a "progression bar" for everything needed to finish and complete a chapter. It's important to note that this isn't a checklist, but rather a tool that tells the player if they've done everything that needs doing for a specific task or quest line that chapter.\n\nThese quibbles aside, all in all, I would wholly recommend Gray Matter to adventure game fans, especially those who are particularly fond of certain classic games within the genre. Gameplay is fun, if simple in the traditional sense - puzzles are largely limited to collecting items and selecting which items to use or combine in specific circumstances. The graphics, while also simplistic, do not impede the true strengths of the game: the characters and the storytelling. The game truly left me clamoring for more, which is a shame, as the game, as well as its creator, has hinted towards a sequel, though any such project seems to be in limbo, at least as of now.\n\nHappy adventuring!","January 28","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters themselves, while not immeadiately likeable, are very well portrayed and are given life with surprisingly good voice acting. The dialogue is often ripe with cultural references and the bonus challenges a la "DaVinci Code" will be a delight for the cultivated gamer.\nThe soundtrack is quite adequate too, mostly composed of classy, although sometimes repetitive, piano pieces than fit the mood of the game. Although the camera angle is fixed, the graphics are quite detailed and colourful and it is not rare to find neat little details that add to the enchanting vistas (such as a tiny spider hanging in its web in a dungeon or a tree leaf blowing in the wind in the distance). The gloomy sky above Oxford is particularly beautiful.\nOne last thing to note about this game is that there is next to no hand-holding: most of the time, you rely on your own logical and common sense to solve the puzzles or advance the story. There is no objectives table and you are often required to thoroughly inspect the surroundings in order to find out what you need to proceed. This can lead to some frustration along the way but is also quite rewarding in the long run.\nIn the end, Gray Matter's intriguing and thought-provoking story and atmosphere more than makes up for any small shortcomings, making it a worthwile aquisition for any action fan or even casual gamer.","January 23","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Adventure games, for me, have to provide interesting characters and a good story, and in this they are like a book or movie.  Yet they also require not just interesting puzzles, but puzzles that are neither so easy as to be boring, or so hard or nonsensical as to be frustrating.  No, to borrow a phrase 'Put wax lips on moose'.\n\nGray Matter's game play does have a few hitches.  My main criticsms would be that it was initially hard to get into the interface, and too often in the game, you have to sort of muddle about, clicking on stuff to figure out what you are suppose to do.  The progress meters are very helpful in this regard on occasion, as are the ways the different locations text gets different colours based on what can still be done there.  Still, the game could use some refining in this regard.\n\nHowever, the game gets my recommendation for the story-telling.  You don't come to a game by Jensen and expect to get bad storytelling, and true to form this game had amazingly evocative sets, characters and plot.  With a short cast of characters I was deeply involve in the story, and it's ending had parts that were genuinely emotional.  A game that can push buttons and evoke emotions like a good movie or piece of music is worth the price of admission in my book.","August 12, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has a certain nostalgic charm to it and most of the puzzles are well designed. You play a wanderlust magician who has ended up in a small English village, and ends up working for a mysterious researcher.\n\nBeing a magician, you have the ability to pull of sleight-of-hand tricks to overcome certain puzzles (like swapping an item with another without the other character realizing). At first, it's quite enjoyable - you get to plan out your moves in sequence and then play it out. Too bad it's introduced quite late in the game. Also, once the novelty wears off, it becomes tedious - you first need to find the correct trick to pull of from inside the magic book, then you simply follow the steps. There are no alternatives and you must do exactly what the book says, or you fail.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere, puzzles and story are enough to keep the player engadget and mystified (my attempt at a clever ending).","August 20, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I used to play all the Gabriel Knight games and loved every one of them (although the one playing in Germany loses a lot of its flair if you are actually German and know how bad the German of the "Germans" in the game is... quite hilarious).\n\nSo I was really looking forward to this and picked it up as soon as it got on sale (okay, I'm a bit cheap..). Anyways, I have 2 main problems with this title:\n\n1) the progress in the game. The game is an adventure that is separated in chapters and to finish one chapter means that you have to do certain tasks. The problem with that is that you often end up with not knowing what to do to progress. For example you can end up having done everything that seems reasonable, but the game waits for you to do a not really motivated phone call or talk to a certain character again. This is albeit the main tasks in your list are all finished. What it means is that more often than one would like, you find yourself walking around all locations and trying out all possible things to get that extra point that lets you progress in the story.\n\nWhich takes me to my second point:\n2) The story is awful. It feels like a mix of a cheesy soap opera and teenage horror story. I never watched or read Twilight, but this is pretty much how I expect it to be.\nYou have the young female outcast who accidentally comes to the house of the much older (yet not older looking) professor, who has a dark and sad secret.. blabla. The actions of the characters are really poorly motivated and downright don't make sense ( like the one girl you meet, steal her ID, break into her room, search her stuff. She barely knows you, but she still considers you as a true friend after finding out about it and even goes to quite a length to warn you. Which is also rather ridiculous, because finding and gaining entrance to the place where she actually warns you, is the main task of your character and takes her quite a length to achieve, but apparently every other person in the game can immediately accomplish that task without even breaking a sweat.) There are plenty of plot holes and when the whole story unravels and is revealed in the end it feels even more ridiculous. It also feels very rushed towards the end.\n\nThat said, I like many of the riddles in the game. The difficulty is quite low, so you can play it and finish without much help (except for aforementioned minor and unmotivated tasks) and I liked the idea with the magic tricks you sometimes use to accomplish some things.\n\nSo,  I feel quite mixed about this game and would have given it a mixed rating if it was possible. If you like point and click adventures and don't mind (or even like) cheesy highschool romance/fantasy stories, then I can recommend it. If plot holes and poor stories put you off, then don't get it. Although sometimes it is so ridiculous that it almost becomes a satire and is funny again. The reason that I opted for negative and not positive is mainly due to the lots of positive reviews that are also quite mixed, so I want to balance it out a bit.","September 3, 2015","false","16.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I was expecting to be blown away, but although the game was good, I don't think it entirely lives up to the hype.\n\nThe thing that bugged me most of all was actually the writing.  Much of the dialogue, especially Samantha's, felt choppy and flippant.  I didn't really get a sense of personality from her other than "generic upstart teenager with delusions of grandeur."  I also didn't like that her character talked big about her "magician's code," and then wantonly broke it at every opportunity for her own personal gain (although maybe that was intentional to show her immaturity).\n\nBeyond her character, I was let down by the overly predictable plot.  The premise of the story is solid, and blends together a number of canon paranormal and horror themes, but the way it unfolded left me disappointed.  It is frustrating as a player to so easily figure out what the ending is going to be, but then have to watch your character blindly ignore the clues and run around circles for hours.  I also felt that the ending was entirely avoidable, and the tragedy was shoe-horned in for emotional effect.\n\nDespite these issues, the other aspects of the game are top notch:\n- There is a unique cast of well-developed side characters that have interesting backgrounds and talented voice actors.\n- The puzzles are creative and varied, with the magic tricks bringing an innovative and novel twist to the genre.  Even veteran adventure gamers will find it both challenging and refreshing.\n- The art and cutscenes are beautifully rendered, with a blend of hand-painted flashbacks and 3D CGI.  I also appreciated the thematic touches of magic and fantasy that were woven throughout.\n- There is a good mixture of seriousness and humor within the overall suspenseful atmosphere.\n- The colour-coded map system is a nice gameplay feature, allowing you to instantly teleport to various location hubs, and informing you of where you still have available actions.\n- There are several hidden bonus quests and actions which add flavour and depth to the story.  (Although I was sad that there is no in-game reward for 100% completion, nor are there any Steam achievements.  An alternate ending might have been nice.)\n\nOverall, I would give this game an 8.5/10","October 25, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visual style adopted in the cutscenes really add to the sense of mystery and drama that unfolds, as well as the unnerving events and atmosphere created. The soundtrack is beautiful, never overwhelming but always fitting the moods as you go exploring deeper into the plot. Robert Holmes did an amazing job.\n\nMy only gripe is the final parts, it felt a bit rushed and inconclusive. But I've heard rumors of a sequel so maybe it will be resolved then.

If the cut-scenes and animations were better it would be by far a much better game, too. It really is a shame.\n\nBut none of these flaws make the game unplayable or not entertaining. I played it twice (only once on Steam) and always enjoyed it. I rather liked the main character - Sam - and her character design. Those magic tricks were a nice game play gimmick, I only wished we'd have seen more of it (thanks to the shoddy character animations we can't really see the tricks being done). But they give a nice explanation how we (as the PC) get away with "borrowing" so many items, something more point & click adventures could use. ;)\n\nGray Matter begs for a sequel and I hope it gets it!

In my opinion this game is worth at least $14.99, which exceeds it's regular price of $9.99, so whether this game is on sale or selling at regular price, BUY THIS GAME.\n\nPros:\n1.) The story is fantastic and you can tell that the developers really respect their characters, especially the main character, Sam. (I will however mention that some of the voice acting is a little cheesey, but nothing unbearable.)\n2.) The artwork in this game is on another level. Rarely do you see such beautiful water color-esque work put into a PNC game. I really dig this trend I'm seeing in more and more PNCs.\n3.) Puzzles range from easy to difficult. In addition, during each chapter you're going to be working on various puzzles at once. Afterall, Sam is playing TWO roles in the game, so she has to do puzzles for both (e.g. magician & assistant). The last chapter is particularly thoughtful in its approach to the puzzles.\n\nCons:\n1.) The ending was a little quick and felt slightly unfinished. A ninth chapter explaining how everything fit together would have been a nice touch.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy that I picked up this game and I'd recommend it to all PNC gamers.\n\nScore: 9/10","June 29, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having now put almost 12 hours into it (having let the game run a bit, it was probably closer to 11), I have to say I ultimately enjoyed the game, and might seek out more of Jane Jensen's works (a writer on the game).\n\nThe game follows Sam/Samantha as she interacts with David and the other characters we meet. As she is a magician, the puzzles mostly involve her performing tricks or solving puzzles as she gets closer to her goal of becoming a master magician. However, the focus of the game is not on the tricks, but rather the story.\n\nThere are some interesting twists as the story progresses, and it had me shivering in a few spots. I definitely recommend this game if you're looking for an interesting story, and have at least a passing enjoyment of point and click adventures.\n\nGray Matter gets 4 of 5 stars, only because of very slight control issues in a handful of scenes.","October 26, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some are better about integrating the puzzles into the story than others, but most strike a good balance.  This game gets it exactly right.\n\nThe story and characters are very engaging.  The two characters you play as each have their own takes on events, and interpret things to match their worldview.  As the player, I still couldn't tell who was right, right up until the last few scenes.  Every time I was leaning one way or the other, someone would find a piece of evidence to throw it right back up in the air.\n\nThe puzzles mostly flow naturally from the story.  Some are shoehorned in - but they're shoehorned in in the game world, as part of a deliberately set up series of puzzles.  Pretty much everything else is just a matural flow of combining what you have and doing magic tricks.\n\nI only have two complaints about this game.  The first is the character's movement speed - after the first hour or so, I was always doubleclicking to get them to run, and it still sometimes felt too slow (and occiasionally accidentally skipped a piece of dialog, but luckily everything is recorded in your character's journal to go back and review).  The second is more of a wish - like in many games which have special subsystems like this one's magic tricks, you only use each trick in your arsenel once.  It always makes perfect sense why you're using it (although there's a few that could be interchangeable), but you never have the opportunity to reuse them, and you can never pick the wrong one.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to any fans of the genre, and to anyone who finds this type of game hit-or-miss.  This one will be a hit.","May 26, 2014","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Grey Matter has a strong, darker, almost gothic visual style. All the scenes are remarkably well thought out and portrayed. The obtuse camera angles and foreground props really immerse you in the locations. The characters are decently developed. The only real weak point in my opinion was the voice acting of the minor characters, Helena and Angela especially. The main cast was solid. The cutscenes were kinda weakly done and some of the character animations were lacking in quantity and alignment. The soundtrack is very good, compelling, and even catchy. It fits the atmosphere of the game well. The story was great and really had me guessing until the end even tho everything did "wrap-up" a little too quickly and conveniently. This game is very worth the $10 and will keep you entertained for a week at least. Jane Jensen proves she's still got it! I'm glad this game came to Steam, otherwise I'd have never played it and I'm looking forward to her next one.\n\nIf you like adventure games, this is highly recommended. It has a more serious tone than say, Golden Age, but still has it's light humorous moments. The style is reminiscent of the original Gabriel Knight- one of the first games that I purchased on CD-ROM back in 9th grade, 1994. There is a cool magic angle for alot of the puzzles and some riddle type stuff. Don't cheat! If you're stuck, just go back to look and interact with EVERYTHING again. Use all your inventory items on everything and everybody. I think we are witnessing the return of the Adventure Game!\n\nSource: I've played almost every adventure game from Sierra, Lucasarts, Westwood, ect.

While you work as an assistant, weird events take place and you try to figure them out.  During the process, you rely on your magic tricks to manipulate people and events to your advantage.\n\nThis game is literally 10/10 on story. It is very story rich like a visual novel with a lot of suspense because you play as the magician and the professor to gain different sides of the story.\n\nThe music and the background are great also. Beautiful scenary.\n\nGame play isn't too solid, this is simply point and click but you often need to complete one event completely before you are allowed to advance.  The riddles are simple up until the end... which becomes extremely difficult.  The magic tricks that you pick don't always make sense and for a magician, you don't use tricks enough.  This is the only major flaw in the game but if you prefer plot, then this is perfect game for you.\n\nThis is by far one of the best point and click I've played. This isn't a hidden object game though.","January 25, 2015","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is beautiful, never overwhelming but always fitting the moods as you go exploring deeper into the plot.

Having now put almost 12 hours into it (having let the game run a bit, it was probably closer to 11), I have to say I ultimately enjoyed the game, and might seek out more of Jane Jensen's works (a writer on the game).\n\nThe game follows Sam/Samantha as she interacts with David and the other characters we meet. As she is a magician, the puzzles mostly involve her performing tricks or solving puzzles as she gets closer to her goal of becoming a master magician. However, the focus of the game is not on the tricks, but rather the story.\n\nThere are some interesting twists as the story progresses, and it had me shivering in a few spots. I definitely recommend this game if you're looking for an interesting story, and have at least a passing enjoyment of point and click adventures.\n\nGray Matter gets 4 of 5 stars, only because of very slight control issues in a handful of scenes.","October 26, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the cut-scenes and animations were better it would be by far a much better game, too. It really is a shame.\n\nBut none of these flaws make the game unplayable or not entertaining. I played it twice (only once on Steam) and always enjoyed it. I rather liked the main character - Sam - and her character design. Those magic tricks were a nice game play gimmick, I only wished we'd have seen more of it (thanks to the shoddy character animations we can't really see the tricks being done). But they give a nice explanation how we (as the PC) get away with "borrowing" so many items, something more point & click adventures could use. ;)\n\nGray Matter begs for a sequel and I hope it gets it!

With some trickery she becomes the new assistant for a reclusive professor of neurology, Dr. Styles. Styles sends out her out to gather some Oxford students for some research but when strange events start going down Sam and Doc Styles have to work together find out what's going on.\n\nGray Matter is a beautiful game with a great soundtrack and environments. The character portraits look rather janky though but they don't drag down the great atmosphere. The writing is some really good stuff.  Sam and Doc Styles are likable and interesting protagonists and the plot is interesting throughout. Jensen’s passion for researching history and real places like she did in Gabriel Knight is still prominent here and learning about Oxford really helps to immerse you in the game's events more.\n\nThe puzzles for the most part are good though Sam’s magic tricks tend to end up being busy work. The game also kind of trips over itself at the end with a weird heavily puzzle-laden final area that really doesn't gel at all with the rest of the game and has nothing to do with the story at all either so because of that the ending comes off as pretty rushed. Overall though Gray Matter is a well-written game with fantastic atmosphere and a likable cast that is well worth your time","May 9, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, it  spoils the game when you feel forced to use that option.\n\nThe time spent in the game isn't accurate.

It has to do with a  paranormal case that people try to ground it to normal phenomena. They try to explain it through everyday life and proof. The bondage between those two is fascinating. We also have a love story, a friends story and a mystery case one too in a single game.\nYou'll love all that complexity in a title!\n\nGraphics are very good for an adventure game of course. Even the walking to the stairs is like really getting up or down and when you pass things or take them you see it like never before in an adventure  game. The developers' try is GREAT! All the game except cinematics is completely 3D with a very good point on detail.\n\nSounds and music not to be mentioned. Fantastic. Great soundtrack,cool music between love and mystery and the sounds are REAL! If only everyone played the game with a PC connected to a Hi-Fi system.\n\nThe riddles are normal to a today game. Didn't find them difficult. The game has a help system in multiple ways but it doesn't give you completely clues about solving it. It has a map with places you go that is always updated about if you have finished all the tasks in an area and it has also a catalogue with the themes you are supposed to be involved and how much you have gone into so far  in percentage. Of course it has immediate help if you need to but you won't. It has good riddles inside. NOT crazy but good. For a hardcore adventurer the riddles are NORMAL. The second chapter has a good one and the fourth a silly one.\n\nThe game has eight chapters and you change between two characters. The most of the game will be solved by Samantha. Dr Styles is mostly to keep up the storyline. When you play with him you will be more relaxed.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone.

The gameplay was reasonably intuitive (although the labels didn't completely fix the pixel-hunting issue and it was so infuriating waiting for characters to walk around to where you needed them to go that I actually ended up watching a movie in fits and spurts while waiting), and the last puzzle was the only one that was majorly difficult of the lot.  But the storyline tried for so much and built expectations so high that it couldn't help but flop in the ending.  There are more questions than can be reasonably and satisfactorily answered, but basically boiled down to "but who was phone?"\n\nAll-in-all, worth playing just for the interesting Daedalus Club puzzles and the lofty goals the main storyline went for, but skip the last chapter if you feel like you need full closure.

Backgrounds are beautiful, but pre-rendered; characters are modeled in 3d, but strangely robotic. Inventory is another callback to the grave: a top-down interface that just feels old and is tiresome to use.\n\nDespite not shining in the technical front, the slow-burning story does make up for it. While containing a dangerous lot of pseudoscience about neuroscience and quantum mechanics being passed for actual scientific consensus, it's very interesting to see how both fronts (rational and mystic) are tackled by the game, and become, effectively, the driving force behind the mystery.\n\nAs a final note, I'd recommend a walkthrough, since like pretty much every point and click in existence, the game does feature things you need to do for progress that are just beyond reasonable logic.","January 8","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With some trickery she becomes the new assistant for a reclusive professor of neurology, Dr. Styles. Styles sends out her out to gather some Oxford students for some research but when strange events start going down Sam and Doc Styles have to work together find out what's going on.\n\nGray Matter is a beautiful game with a great soundtrack and environments. The character portraits look rather janky though but they don't drag down the great atmosphere. The writing is some really good stuff.  Sam and Doc Styles are likable and interesting protagonists and the plot is interesting throughout. Jensen’s passion for researching history and real places like she did in Gabriel Knight is still prominent here and learning about Oxford really helps to immerse you in the game's events more.\n\nThe puzzles for the most part are good though Sam’s magic tricks tend to end up being busy work. The game also kind of trips over itself at the end with a weird heavily puzzle-laden final area that really doesn't gel at all with the rest of the game and has nothing to do with the story at all either so because of that the ending comes off as pretty rushed. Overall though Gray Matter is a well-written game with fantastic atmosphere and a likable cast that is well worth your time","May 9, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Look, this is a Jane Jensen adventure game (she of Gabriel Knight) and if that name means anything to you then you know what you are getting into with this title. If not, well, prepare yourself for some great adventure game writing and (mostly) fair and interesting puzzles. I don't recall any puzzles that commited that required the dreaded "adventure game logic" and, honestly, I think the puzzles in Gray Matter are some of the best I have seen in regards to being tied to the game's setting and writing, albeit a little too easy for hardened adventure gamers.\n\nSpeaking of Gray Matter's setting, is it ever dripping in it. Yes, the Britishisms are a touch to kitschy, but a secret society of magicians that have left esoteric clues throughout the university and town is great. You solve some puzzles by repurposing magic tricks that the main character knows (she's a magician) and then there is the mysterious mansion with the possibly mad, certainly bereaved, scientist experimenting with dreams.\n\nRight then, enough gushing. Let's get into the faults.\n\n1. There's a weird framerate problem that I encountered on startup. It seems to (somehow) be tied to the uptime on my Windows 8 machine and rebooting fixed it every time. Watch out for that.\n\n2. Occassionally the game wants you to trigger a specific cut scene or conversation before it will let you solve a puzzle/proceed. This isn't usually a problem, but if you make a logical leap here or there you might hit it. I certainly did. The frustrating thing with this is that there are two main hubs in the game: the mansion and the town/university and sometime the trigger you need to hit is not where the puzzle you are working on is. If you get stuck try going back to the mansion and wandering around.\n\n3. As I mentioned earlier, the puzzles are (for the most part) easy to solve. I'd have liked a few proper head-scratchers in the mix, but it's hard to complain when they fit the story and characters so well.\n\nAll said, I loved Gray Matter. I can't remember the last time an adventure game enthralled me like this one did. Play this game.","January 4","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gorgeous graphics, interesting story, intelligently designed riddles and a lot of suspense, combined with a masterpiece of a twist at the game's ending, make this game a piece of art.\n\nThe main heroine is a introvert goth girl that ends up in a rich doctor's manor during her trip around England. Being the manipulative sociopath we soon get to experience fully throughout the game, she lies her way into becoming his assistant. Most of the gameplay comprises of Samantha forging IDs, putting a plug in someone's phone, manipulating people into helping her and breaking in. The other part of the game is collecting memories and doing menial tasks as doctor David Styles, who lost his wife in a car accident that also left him terribly scarred.\n\nThe amount of riddles is amazing and they are neither too easy nor too difficult. I didn't have to find a walkthrough for any of the riddles, which made me like this game even more, but dispite that, I got stuck TWICE. That was because playing as David you can get very frustrated as what to do next. At some point I clicked through almost every available location to make the story progress. I consulted a walkthrough to find out that there is an MRI room in the basement's main room that  has a computer David can operate. Okay, my mistake. I missed the location that was previously inoperable when Sam loitered around it. But then I got stuck again and couldn't get the story to progress, as I've learned where the Deadalus Club was located, yet it didn't show up on the map. I thought that it was a glitch. After I've checked the chapter's walkthrough step by step, it turned out that I didn't print out a file that was among the files in the folder on David's computer, that suddenly became printable in one of the chapters, so I could use it in... the same place I got stuck before. That made the chapter go to 100% and the Deadalus Club location suddenly was showing up on the map after David left the manor. That was actually rather awkward considering that for Sam the Deadalus Club was on the map and she would refuse to go there saying that she has something to do before.\n\nThe fact that an errand to-do-list kind of parts of the game require you to click through locations semi-randomly searching for the thing that makes you progress to the next part ruined the game's continuity for me and I was disappointed that I had to look up a solution, because I wanted to figure out the game without help yet I was stuck at trying to figure out what the thing that you're supposed to find at the moment was. It turned out that I could solve every riddle, but I got stuck because there are moments that make you confused as to what you should do - and some parts of thegames were made in a way that there were blatant clues added as what should be done next. The locations re marked with colors ranging from gold through silver to greyed out, showing whether you've done everything in there required for finishing that chapter. This makes me wonder if the people testing Grey Matter requested that to be done, because of the amount of confusion coming from certain actions opening up others in places you've already clicked through a few moments ago and now they suddenly have an NPC that wasn't there before.\n\nThis goes only for the short chapters where you get to play as David, and Sam's part is pretty much flawless.\n\nThis is a 9.5/10 game for classic point and click adventure game fans.","April 23","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite some minor flaws, a must buy for all adventure games fans.\n\nThe good:\nStrong writing that keeps player entertained throughout the entire experience\nInteresting magic puzzle mechanics\nNicely rendered backrounds blended seamlessly with wonderfully done 2D art and cutscenes.\nSuggestive voiceover and decent music\n\nThe bad:\nCharacter models are very dated with animation that is sometimes almost painful to watch. Character portraits that pop up during conversations look like they all had "egg" shaped head as a base model to which different noses, eyes and hair had been plastered into later (think kinda mid 90's fallout style). Full sized models you otherwise interact with resemble these potato men portraits only if you crank up your imagination to the point where you start seeing a white rabbit with a golden watch popping up from under random furniture in your house.\nPuzzle design has some rough spots here and there. On several occasions you can come accross objects which you cannot pickup before having perfomed a number of unrelated tasks, forcing a player to back-track for no apparent reason.\nSome of the bonus objectives feel pointless and combined with the technical issues mentioned above bear a feeling of project lead used to large budget realizing half-way through production that the actual budget is too small for the projects ambition.","May 29","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the idea of placing the object in certain positions in order to get them to play correctly when you trick your victims. The story line and artwork were beautiful and just left me wanting more. I highly recommend this game to those who love adventure, point-and-click, a bit of mystery and puzzles.","June 3","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
