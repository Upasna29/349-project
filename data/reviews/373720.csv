Mobs also drop materials for crafting\n\nsame goes with crafting, they can sometimes *fail* somewhat so you end up with a quality lower than you wanted.   you can customize your crafting to add stats like increased parry or increased HP etc and specalize in these, you need to learn each equipment seperatly you don't go *learn armorsmith... have access to all armor* you will need to learn to craft shoulder, chest, then quality, and ontop of this you can learn to craft other races armors and wear them.\n\n\n--------\nOther Bits\n---------\n\nRyzom has seasons changes, weather and day / night. which can determine which mobs are available in some area's most other mmorpgs don't have this to the same extent.\n\nRyzom has different factions and reputation you can align to.\n\n\nDespite what I keep reading, Ryzom does have missions / quests but its not linear story guided holding your hand like most mmorpgs and there is not 100,000 of them. if you don't want to do them you don't have to and they are mainly for fun / get some coin etc (beyond the starter zone which has tutorial quests to help you out)\n\nthere is death penalty for dying, which can stack up to 10x ( need to regain xp before you can xp towards skills) so dying does has its downfalls unlike most games.\n\nAs for graphics sure it is not the most up to date, but it is better then alot of eastern grind clones, and if you use gfx injectors / software like SweetFX to tweak it to hdr/enhance it yourself. personally i don't care about graphics on games, it is a silly thing to judge by, its all about game mechanics.\n\nThere is housing, guilds, achievements, occuptions seperate from crafting for moneys etc,\n\n----------------------------------\n\nafter all this and more, if you still don't like the game then that is unfortunate, but the game won't be for everyone. however those leaving silly reviews like *this is ♥♥♥♥, it sucks, not an mmo, etc blah blah clearly havnt played the game past the loading screen to actually provide any reason or proof for their troll reviews.","May 7","true","119.5"," 63 of 86 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","63","86","5","0"

It has a diverse skill system that eventually makes the entire game classless. You level up your skills individually, making for a very specialized character suited to your style of play. The world is very much alive with the local fauna attacking prey, tribes patrolling the world and attacking enemies, and even the plants will attack back if provoked. The community is also very friendly and helpful, and will answer most questions. Do not be afraid to ask. :) Also, don't complain about the graphics, the game is from 2004.

The possibilities are endless!\n\nRyzom does have a learning curve, it can be complicated for new players - but don't give up. Soon everything will start making sense and you will be a master in no time...if you do run into trouble use the "universe" chat and one of the amazing homins or CSRs will help you find your way.\n\nTips for new players:\n\n1) Research the factions - especially before joining a guild.\nYour faction (Kami, Karavan, Ranger, Marauder or neutral) will have a huge impact on your game play. It is very important to decide how you want to play and who you want to be on Atys. There are many players who will help you with weapons and gear without the requirement of you joining their guild. If you feel pressured or rushed, something is not right!\n\n2)The forums are a huge source of information. You will find the lore, guild registries, reports from regional/factional meetings, ideas for Ryzom, occupation help and recipes. They can be a very crucial element for learning your way around (but they can be easily forgotten).\n\n3) Don't be afraid to ask for help. As I mentioned before Ryzom has a truly unique community full of amazing helpful homins. We just want you to enjoy Atys and will offer help whenever we can.\n\nCongratulations Ryzom for making it to Steam! I can't wait to meet some of you new players!","May 14","true","215.0"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","26","28","4","0"

The characters aren't bound to classes, you can learn whatever you want, as long as you spend the time to level it up. The crafting system is quite complex - the economy is 100% player based, whatever you use will be made by other players or yourself, except for some basic starter equippment.\n\nThe ability-system is also noteworthy. You get to build your own attacks and spells too in a way: They are made out of elements you can swap and adapt everything to your playing style. For example you can raise the time it takes to cast a spell and in exchange make it cause more damage.\n\nThe community is by far the best I've come across in any MMORPG. The playerbase is mostly mature, friendly and ready to help newcomers. The way the economy runs teamwork is a must if you want to get your hands on really good equippment. Some of the places you get your resources from are pretty dangerous and should not be travelled alone...\n\nThat being said - yes, there is PvP in certain areas and guilds can fight for outposts, but it's your choice to join or not.\n\nWhat else... NO CASH SHOP!\n\nThe only thing you *can* buy is a monthly subscription. The game is free to play up to lvl 125 - more than enough to see whether you like it or not - and with the subscription the lvl cap is 250. Also subscribers can rent an apartment in one of the cities PLUS they can own pack-animals - the only way to get more storage ingame.\n\nSo - go ahead, give it a try!","May 6","true","26.6"," 69 of 103 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","69","103","4","3"

The players are very friendly and helpful. The wild life range from cute and inquisitive to mean and vicious. People maybe complaining about the graphics but I think the world is very pleasant looking and detailed. I have seen only a very small part of the world so far, but like what I have seen.\n\nFor me it is also great that PVP has to be consensual. This adds to a feeling of community in the world and you are not ganked everytime you step foot out side of a city or town (although there are predators there to catch the unwary).\n\nWhile the free to play does have some limitations, regarding level caps and some storage features, it really does allow you to get a real feel for the game before you decide if you want to subscribe or if you are happy to continue to play for free. So far I am over half way to the 125 level cap of 1 skill (only because of exstensive support and help from my guild), but there are many, many more that I am really only just starting to develop and understand.\n\nThis games is definitely worth playing.","May 13","true","357.2"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrobject/recommended/373720/","mrobject","Object","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrobject/","192 products in account","The NGE or New Game Experience for new players in this game is absolutely terrible and is the reason for all of the negative reviews.  The fact remains that this game isn't easy to get into and isn't easy to learn.  The developers have refused to convert this game into a cash shop based free to play model and so it's still a freemium model.  These are the two main reasons for the negative reviews, other then people complaining the graphics are out-dated. (they are 10 years old so ya...)\n\nFreemium means there are two tiers, a free tier and a premium tier, since this game isn't pvp focused at all being restricted as a free user means absolutely nothing.  This game can be played free forever and a lot of users who play this game have never subscribed.\n\nI honestly never expect this game to ever get a high review score purely because the majority of the users don't use steam nor will they, so the only people posting reviews here are steam users exclusively and since this game has a steep learning curve and the newbie island essentially hasn't changed in years all new players will get a stagnated experience...\n\nAfter actually giving this game enough time to really see what the game is all about though I can say that the depth of it is impressive and I've been playing mmo's since they were text only (muds mushes and moo's oh my), so not that much impresses me anymore.\n\nI'd actually go as far as to say that this game has actually done a lot to steer away what most modern mmo's try to do, which is to endlessly dumb down their gameplay (coughWOWcough) until anyone with half a brain can play their game.\n\nIf you are truly looking for something refreshing then you need to really give a good long hard look at this game, and please give it a chance, don't spend 5-10 hours on it and quit because you will still be confused after 5-10 hours.\n\nJust wanted to add something as well since there does seem to be a LOT of misinformation about it, this game is 100% open source, google Ryzom open source and check yourself.  Now to those attempting to state that the current devs are 'riding high on their money train' you really need to do more research on this game...as stated this game is 100% open source so you can download the code and run your own server.\n\nSeriously...the current server administrators of Ryzom don't want your money, they want you to try out this unique experience that they've saved from disappearing into obscurity and I honestly beleive they've done a damn good job at it, I doubt it was an easy task to get an open source mmo on steam...","May 12","true","84.7"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","1"

I can't recommend this game enough, but I wouldn't say it's for everyone. If you're looking for a straightforward carrot on a stick type game then this isn't for you. This is a sandbox game. It's for people who want a creative and challenging experience that requires you to think for yourself and encourages collaboration with other players. The community here is amazingly friendly, welcoming, and helpful.\n\nThe graphics might look a bit dated compared to some other games, but I am still in awe at the unique beauty and originality of this world. I love the interactions between carnivores and herbivores, and the animals themselves seem to have personality. Some herbivores will take an interest and follow you for a while, and some will actually pull aggro towards you to take it off themselves. Herds migrate with the seasons and there is a lot to learn about their different behaviours and traits. Some creatures resist certain attacks and some will swarm you if you attack a member of their group. You learn through experience which are dangerous and which are not, and which strategies to use for hunting different creatures. The wildlife can be ruthless and even an experienced player has to watch their step.\n\nI see some reviews from people who have only played for a few minutes or a few hours and didn't like it. Ryzom has a bit of a learning curve and you really won't understand much if you just dip your toes in and judge it by your first impressions. There is a lot more to it than meets the eye, and I highly recommend giving it a chance. There is a complex crafting system and a huge number of skills to train. You don't have to commit to a class and can change roles in a team on a whim. Harvesting and crafting are complex activities requiring thought and planning. You can customize all your actions to make the most of your skills, rather than just pushing premade buttons.\n\nThe game is free to play for half of all levels. That's 125 out of 250 levels, for every skill in the tree. That is a LOT of gameplay with very few restrictions and is nothing to complain about. There is no "pay to win" system where you buy stuff that gives you an advantage over other players. When I first started I played for about six months for free and was quite happy, so decided to subscribe not because I felt restricted but because I was enjoying the game and wanted to support it.  The subscription costs less than going to see a movie each month and personally I get a lot more out of this.\n\nRyzom takes time to learn, and you shouldn't expect it to be like other games you've played. Talk to any experienced player and you will see that the game itself is like a beloved friend to them. It is well worth getting to know :)","May 14","true","0.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

They all seen to fall into 2 main groups: That is it older game (with older graphics) and that is it not a true F2P game.\n\nSo the first issue, the graphics, let my just say so far what I have seen of the game I have been impressed with. The day-night changes, The season changes, the sun rising and sun setting. At one point in the game (on the starting island) I just stopped and watched the sun set because the way the red to purples mixed with the sky was so well done. It might not be that most upto date game out there, but if you really look, damn does it have some beautliful detail work to it.\n\nAnd now on the F2P, most people are wining about the lvl caps at 125, etc. because they will not beable to 'max' their toon out on a F2P account.  But not a single one of them is taking in the amount of time it will take to even get to lvl 125.  By the time anyone gets any of their skills even close to lvl 125, they will have a VERY good idea if this is the game for them. To me that is a HELL of a lot better deal then any other F2P game out there that is nothing but a F2W in truth. No real content is blocked, you are free to play just about anywhere you want (The only place that is blocked F2P is the top end area which you would not want to be in anyway). The is no time limit like with 21 day trails or anything like that, and you can completely play at you own pace to lvl your skills in whatever why you want. Honestly, I wish more MMOs were like this so that I had a real chance to try them out before deciding if they deserved any of my money later on and with a sub fee of only $10 if I do make it passed lvl 125, I have a very strong feeling that Ryzom will be deserving of that money.","May 12","true","235.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","0"

And while the water itself looks nice enough (you can swim but not dive), everything underwater is barren land with not even plants or rocks.\n\nApart from the landscape the graphics haven't suffered that much over the years. The character animations are all natural looking and don't leave much to be desired and most mobs animations are quite convincing too. Harvesting effects couldn't look much better imo but the magic effects are a bit bland and combat effects are minimal - which makes for better FPS on older machines in return. The weather effects are also quite nice for an 'old' MMO.\n\nRyzom has a unique way of letting you create your own combat, magic, crafting and harvesting 'ablities' from actions, effects, upgrades and restrictions. Everything can be done as long as it's balanced. For example you can create an all-out attack that is very precise and powerful but eats up a lot from your stamina pool so you won't be able to use it often during a single fight. Or a 'pulling' spell that doesn't eat up a lot from your magic pool (called sap) and has quite a long range but is weak and has a long casting time in return. And when it comes to crafting, you can choose to imbue your object with a big bonus on your life, sap (spells), stamina (combat) or focus (harvesting) pool - or a small bonus of each. This versatility however has to be acquired with skill points that are earned in actually crafting something and also from crafting quests. Not a new concept but it works well (although it can become a chore some times).\n\nLuckily there is no inter-dependency in Ryzom. Every character can harvest all the materials needed and learn all the crafting plans (kind of blueprints) for every single piece of equipment on his own. Specialisation still pays off, because it would take an unreal amount of time to train everything to the maximum. The system is simple but effective: If one wants to be a fighter in heavy armor wielding a two-hander, he can buy the blueprints and craft the weapons & armor  with a HP bonus - and if one wants to become a battle mage, he can buy the plans and craft armor pieces and amplifiers (gloves that increase spell efficiency) with a bonus to the sap (=magic) pool.\n\nIt is also possible to 'enchant' weapons so that spells and effects can be cast from them but it's quite complex and it doesn't pay off in the beginning to put a lot of time and skill points into it.\n\nThe AI has features no other MMO yet offers, like non-predatory animals walking over to you and watch you (out of curiosity) or large herds of animals moving across the map in natural-looking patterns.\n\nPersonally I can deal with all of Ryzoms minor flaws but there is still a BIG one - the inventory and shop mangement is terrible. Comparing items efficently is practically impossible and although there are filters both for inventory and shops, there is no way to sort anything - except for the games own enigmatic way.\n\nIt will be fun again for some time but it will not last for long I'm afraid.\n\nStill I would recommend everyone to give it a try - if for nothing else, than just for the challenge of it. Surviving on Ryzom is not so much difficult but complex.","May 30","true","94.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

This is different"\n....\nI have seen some rather harsh reviews from people that have played less than an hour in the game, trust me you wont have even scratched the surface of this immensly deep game in such a short playtime.\n...\nThere has been some inevitable client and server bugs screwing up some log ins and character creations and to the best of my knowledge have either been dealt with or are being fixed as we speak...the dev team are responding rapidly to the reports so just hold on and be patient much like any other MMO release there are are always some "stress load" "server" issues that get ironed out quickly.\n...\nThe starter island is the same as it was back in the day and is suited to teach the core elements and strategy of the game until the player is comfortable to leave and start in the main world.\nGraphics dated?...of course but anyone that is a veteran of gaming will know that graphics whilst being nice are not absolutely essential to a great game ...nice? yes , critical? no\nEverquest1 was never ever cited for its graphical content but is still rated amongst veterans as being one of the best MMO to date.\n\nUI cluttered? ... the UI is in my opinion actually rather comprehensive and you need only have at the forefront the layout that you require.\nToo be honest the UI is so customisable I think it is rather harsh to pull this as a point of critique.\nMovement jerky and combat clumsy? ... sorry i just do not get that feeling at all. I lost the "buzz" from fancy combat moves with every keypress many years ago and always like a minimalist set of combat graphical actions especially when you encounter many mobs.\n\nThe levelling up of skills, professions, stats and combat repertoire is where this game differs greatly from the regular MMO.\nI cannot do the game critical justice in attempting to describe it but instead suggest that you actually try this yourself.\nIt is unlike anything else out there.\nincredibly customisable and you can have a vast array of roles for different situations.\nPreviously I recall getting to combat/magic/crafting skills of around 100 and after starting the game afresh on Steam i must admit this is one hell of an enjoyable journey again.\n....\nThis game is FREE for now so what is the harm in giving this game a go and see how you get on...\nYou will need to give it at least a couple of hours before you start to sense how deep this game can be.\nThis game should really be in the MMO "Hall of fame" for it was truly one of the original Sandbox games.\nIt is undoubtably unique and if you really do need to be handheld through each and every step of MMO character progression then this game is perhaps not for you...\nHowever if you really do have the ability to think and create "outside of the box" and have no aversion to Sci-fi setting then I urge you to download this game and get character creating !\nThank you all that are involved in this rerelease ... I am enjoying this !","May 8","true","13.1"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","27","42","2","0"

Like a survival sandbox, you start with nothing and have to make everything yourself.  The focus is on exploration and harvesting/crafting, and farming mobs. Some highlights:\n\n- skill based, no classes\n- all items are player crafted, there are no armor or weapon drops from mobs\n- there are no quests, except some for cash and faction (the beginner island has tutorial quests)\n- there are no instances or dungeons\n- real day/night cycle, weather, seasons. These make a real difference. You might only be able to find a certain mat in the fall, at night, in the rain, for example.\n- advanced mob AI, mobs migrate depending on season, and have their own routines\n- consensual PvP, Outpost PvP wars, PvP zones that have the best mats\n- housing, mounts, packers\n\nLowlights, this game is not for everybody\n- no quests, no storyline. There is no hand holding, and a fairly steep learning curve.\n- graphics are from 2004, scenery still looks good, character models are somewhat primitive\n- tab targeting, no jumping, not action combat\n- difficult to solo, except for diggers\n\nThe game is at its best when you team up and go kill mobs or bosses. Or when you saddle up for a night of exploration and digging. Or when a group escorts some diggers into the Prime Roots (PvP zone) in order to dig special mats.","May 7","true","1.4"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","29","46","0","0"

Due to other MMO's (like WoW, which came out after Ryzom so you can't say it is a WoW clone) taking the spotlight this one has faded into obscurity. With this on Steam now however, it may gain the fame it truly deserves.\n\nRyzom doesn't hold your hand as soon as you are finished the tutorial island (A place so cosy a lot of players never leave) you are thrust into the harsh reality of that if you don't be careful you will die. From the Varinxes of the desert to the Cloppers of the wetlands you must traverse the harsh world of Atys (yes the world is called Atys not Ryzom). With a branching skill tree that makes it so that their is no definite level for a character, mix and match skills to create your ultimate attacks and by the end of it you maybe just maybe will be able to invade the Kitin Lair and take down the ones who made you abandon the Old Lands.\n\nOh and CHAOS FOREVER!

The game has a freedom not typically seen in any other mmo, sandbox or not.  You can do what you want when you want.  This inevitably leads to a high learning curve but the community is extremely helpful. any question you have already has an answer and you will get that answer almost immediately.  Yes, the game does have a paid component for housing and skills above 125 but that is not an issue.  With 63 seperate skill branches it will be a longtime before you earn all 7875 of those skills, years in fact. So you will always have something to do including being self sufficient. playing in a party or "teams" is reccomended but you can do just as fine solo.  62/63 skill branches can be leveled alone with the healer skill branch being the only exception\n\nThe game is not without its flaws however, as stated earlier there is a huge learning curve.  Even experienced players will admit to still learning things after 3 or 4 years of playtime.  as a free player you are limited to one mount and your regular backpack for storage, these can fill up fast as you play and progress down the skilltree.  Mob aggro range is pretty far.  you might sight aggro one mob and that one mob would chase you to the ends of Atys before it finally disengages.  Also for me the largest flaw, the monsters are just butt ugly.\n\nIts a great game, difficult in the early game but with a good guild for constant free help in the form of gears and experience catalyzers (2x exp coupons for F2P) as well as 3 different chat areas for help (Region, Universal, Language specific universal) sticking with the game will be more than worth it.","May 11","true","82.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

Community was helpful and it seems like there are GMs online helping players and shutting down trolls.  The quest system is overly complicated.  There is no way to re-read the quest details unless you abandon it and then re-take it.  Even worse when you have taken and accepted a quest but you don't have room in your bag for the item.  It would be fine if I had to free up some room to continue but no... free up room, abandon, re-take quest.  Top that off with a mini-map that is essentially worthless unless you add all of the notes to it on your own.  There is rarely a compass direction besides north or a town.  Also, the quests only seem to give you dappers (money) but no experience.  I stopped playing because there was no incentive to run any quests since I frequently progressed better just by grinding the equivalent of boars.  Frequent lags or PMs as they call them, especially at 7:00PM PST which is when I login.  They say that it is due to server backups but idc.  Almost every mob runs over me due to the lag making me work the camera to get faced in the right direction.\n\nI do want to return to Ryzom but it needs help.  It is lacking players and it's recent Steam release will help, but most casual players will not continue playing due to the overly complicated game play.","May 15","false","36.5"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","18","27","2","6"

I have played this game on and off for many years.  The Saga of Ryzom....I guess they dropped the Saga part now and just call it Ryzom, is a very unique world.  It is a living world where the npc animals interact wiith each other and you.  Often while sitting digging up resources a curious animal will wander up and stare at you...and sometimes pee on you. Carnivores eat herbivores and you...herbivores won't attack you. .I'm glad it has come to Steam as it could use an infusion of players that this offers, just in the few minutes I logged in I saw loads of new players in the tutorial area.  I'll get to the point...or points.  Here goes.\n\nPros:\n\n- Living world that interacts with itself and the player.\n\n-One of the best Craft systems any MMO has to offer....on par with Star Wars Galaxies (may it rest in peace).  Each ingredient has a level, quality, and color that all affect the final product.  As well as stats  for various things like hardness and flexibility depending on what you are crafting.  You don't want a flexible sword....\n\n- "Craft" your own skills and spells.  When you learn a skill you get a set of parts that make up the skill.  Want it to do more damage?  Ok...but you may need to make it cost more mana.  Want to find 3 harvest nodes instead of 1...sure but you will need to balance it out with something.  You can use the premade ones...or tailor them to your play style.\n\n- A classless and leveless system.  Gain exp in what you are doing.  Make your character the way you want.  Mix and match skills at will.\n\n- Two different..."religious" type sets that affect the players in interesting ways.\n\n- Four races that are not elves and dwarves....each race has it's own craft style.\n\n- Colorful and interesting world to explore with unique monsters.  No rats or bears here.\n\nCons\n\n- It is an aging game so the graphics are a little out dated, but not that bad.\n\n- Once off the tutorial island....the player density drops....I am hoping that with the Steam boost it will change.\n\n- The UI is a little...wierd.  You can move stuff around and such to make it more on par with what you like.\n\n- More like a free trial than free to play, although you can go fairly far without paying into it and have a good time.  If you manage to make out your skills on the free account...you probably want to buy it anyway.\n\n- The classless/leveless skill system is great....but it has always felt a little flat to me.  There is no reason to pick one race or another, no advantage other thank looks.  I feel it would be more...individual...if you were limited to how many skills you could learn.  Then there would be some thought into the process.  But as it stands everyone can get every skill to either 125 for free or 250 for paid.  This is probably more something that bothers me and most won't care.\n\nOverall well worth downloading and trying it out.  At least run through the tutorial Island and missions for the various skill sets and see how interesting the world is.  It has many unique features that we still don't see in other games.  If I had to pick a game that it is most similar too....I would say Star Wars Galaxies for it's crafting system, harvesting and skill system (before they ruined and killed SWG that is).\n","May 9","true","0.1"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","27","44","0","0"

You can drag, add, remove and resize everything, and some panels have multiple styles.\n\nAlso, which is kind of unique (or I haven't seen it many times elsewhere), there are web-based "apps" which you can download and use in-game.

I don't fully understand some of the negative review's reasons but i guess it just comes down to taste. Anyway, as of yet I cant say much about the game because I'm trying to do all of the starting area tutorials. I'll try to list out a "pros" and "cons" list.\n\nThe community is extremely friendly and veteran players and GMs are very helpful! (this long-term player messaged me one-to-one providing me with lots of the basics to help me find my way around the game- thank you!)\n\nPROS:\n+ very unique and interesting story if you care to read what characters have to say.\n+ the world is very interesting and greatly differs from an mmorpg's more bland "fantasy" setting world with an overabundance of mediocre forests and uninteresting creatures plaguing the starting areas.\n+ there's lots of lore accessible in-game that you're able to read.\n+ equal importance and depth placed in the gathering and crafting classes as well as the combat ones.\n+ the max level is 250 (125 for F2P players) and you seperately level up 4 different vocations instead of your character as a whole.\n+ the 4 races have a very unique background and history to them, further adding depth to the game world. It's also nice to have something that isn't the "cookie-cutter" elf, human and dwarf race.\n\nCONS:\n- outdated graphics (i don't mind personally seeing as it's old and i don't think graphics matter too much if other aspects balance it out).\n- some people may find the game's interface quite confusing and different from more modern rpgs and mmos.\n- playing for free cut's some amount of content from the game (but that's to be expected, really).\n- Many people will see the character models as being quite ugly (me included but oh well).\n- some may find the available races quite uninteresting and too similar to each other,\n\n\ni hope you find this (albeit very bare-bones) review helpful and feel free to jump into the world of Atys!\n","May 7","true","13.8"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","0"

So I wanted to share my experience.\n\nFirst of all, the universe is so compelling! The graphics may look a bit oldish, but the artistic direction is just stunning. The different feelings you may experience when traveling these unique landscapes can really move you. It is full of life, from the fauna to the weather and to the seasons.\n\nNext, comes its community. For sure, Ryzom deserves to be called an MMORPG. Here, you will always find someone to help you, to hunt, to travel, to find something you are looking for, and so on. This is not a nowadays so-called MMO where you can just play solo. The force of Ryzom comes from the fact that you need the others players to progress, and that makes it a deep social experience. May you be shy at first, no worries, someone will propose its help soon, and friendships will come.\nAnother important point about the community is the roleplay. A lot of events are organized, by both players and event teams. This engages you so much.\n\nNow, let's talk about the gameplay.\n\nOn one hand, I have to admit, the fighting system is a common one. But still, it's pleasant to play with. On the other hand, there are a lot of gameplay features making this game very deep and challenging to master.\nFirst of all, the class-less design: this allows you to experiment with whatever you want. Want to be a master fighter? There are tens of weapon types, with their own skill trees. And not to mention, ending only one skill tree is already a challenge in itself. Want to mix some range weapon skills with healing skills? Do it, nothing will stop you combining the talents you have. What keeps it balanced is the equipment you wear. Don't think about doing magic with a heavy armor and a sword in your hands. You will have to put your light cloths on and your magic amplifiers to be efficient.\n\nAnd about the peaceful activities: again, the harvesting and the crafting systems are very deep.\nHarvesting won't consist in picking up some resources spawning here and there each 2 hours or so. Instead, there are dedicated skill trees which will allow you to gather rare resources. Also, you will need to learn where to harvest, at which time, and how to harvest efficiently. And every harvester has its very secret receipe that they may share with you.\nNext comes the craft system, one that I never saw anywhere else. Here, the possibilities are endless. Creating the perfect sword will take you "ages" of research to find the receipe. The statistics of an object all depends on the statistics of the materials you use and their genuine combinations.\n\nWith all these activities, you will see that, everyone needs each other. You need a better axe? You will need a good crafter that knows the ingredients. You will need a harvester that will find that rare wood bark. You will need a team of high level fighter to kill that rare beast that will drop those very sharp claws. You need to harvest some rare materials that only appear once each winter at mid-night, deep under ground in the prime roots? You will need a team to protect you against the fierce kitins or against other player that want it too.\n\nThere is so much more to say, but I hope this review will make you want to come by on Atys.\n\nBest regards.","May 31","true","0.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It's at least not the most boring text I've yet to read in a game, so that's good.\nIt's definitely dated though, and there are just plain better "survival" games than this.\nThe one truly unique feature that this game has is that you can customize the actions. Basically, you can add modifiers to an action like "accuracy" for an attack, or "survey range" for prospecting. It's neat, and I'd love to see that sort of stuff in more games.\n\nSo, basically, if it's free when you read this, it's worth checking out for yourself.

I am excited to see this title being available on Steam, and I hope my review is helpful to those interested in playing Ryzom.\n\nThe first section of the game is the tutorial island. This is a rather guided experience which showcases the features players can engage in when they leave. You are given quests by the master of a given discipline or the leader of the outpost. Many people enjoyed the layout and flow of this experience. Once you leave, however, the game changes remarkably. This is not to say it is good or bad, although many gamers can be caught off gaurd by it. You are no longer progressing via quests from trainers. Quests are few and far between and are NOT meant to be the rail from which one develops within Ryzom. The game expects that, once you leave the island, you are ready to engage with what you enjoyed there in the larger world scene. It is now up to YOU, not the quest giver, for direction. Ultimately, it boils down to grinding -- which is not necessarily bad. If you enjoy what you are doing, even if it is grinding, then you are enjoying yourself. Some people dislike it while others love it. That choice is yours to make.\n\nThe combat system itself is rather basic although combat is not sterile. You create your own skills through a basic formula of costs and spenders. For example, a cost could be adding a DoT while the spender could be you can only use it after you successfully dodged. A lot of possibilities are here although it will still condense down to a smaller amount of optimal skills.\n\nCrafting is a beast all of its own. Each ingredient has a unique set of properties that, when combined with others, creates an unqiue collection of secondary stats which help refine various playstyles.\n\nI could continue on, however, I think one can tell that each section of the game is like this. It's deep, yet someone has to peer through the layers to notice. The difficulty for a new player (especially those familiar with modern MMOs) will be to plummet the depth of the game instead of thinking the surface layer is all that exists.\n\nTry it out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kazagarth/recommended/373720/","Kazagarth","Kazagarth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kazagarth/","2 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThe game itself hasn't changed since I last played, hopefully with a steam release they'll get the players they need to start making the game great again (see what I did?). Ryzom is an AMAZING MMORPG, and I have no issue with the ART STYLE at all. The graphics may not be the most high end, however the game looks amazing because of the art style they chose to go with it. And the non-high end graphics also mean even very old PCs/macs/linux users can almost certainly still play Ryzom on. This actually is very smart as far as gaming goes, because it allows far more players into the game.\n\nAnimals interact with you, each other and even the world. On mainland, when it rains, animals go for shelter under the trees. On silan (the starting/tutorial island), you'll first notice Yubos examining you, looking up at you with their cute faces or a herd of animals migrating depending on the day. Animals (some of them) migrate depending on the season, or even the weather. There are herbivores and carnivores, and the carnivores will attack the herbivores and the herbivores will group together to take down the carnivore (or sometimes the carnivore gets away). You never see that kind of VERY advanced AI in even singleplayer RPGs, and Ryzom came out years ago.\n\nAnd crafting. If you played SWG (star wars galaxies) pre-cu...and loved the crafting there. You'll love this just as much. Different resources give different stats/bonuses to each crafted item, and there is quality to think of to. There are hundreds of thousands or even more, of items of different qualities, stats and bonuses you can craft. Its very much like SWG in that regard.\n\nHarvesting (digging) however is pretty unique in Ryzom. But they didn't have much funding for art of each resource. So it feels pretty meh, when all I do is harvest the same thing and get different items out of it. As far as I have seen, each resource looks exactly the same. A green cluster of blobs. No blue blob, no yellow blob, not even different shapes. They just re-used the art of one harvest "node" and copy/pasted it to each and every single one. So even if you are harvesting shells or whatever, its just a boring green blob of resources. Feels like they didn't have funding for an artstyle for each type of resource. They probably put in a lore reason (I'm sure there is) for that to hide the fact they couldn't afford it, but...well... still feels like they couldn't afford more art for different resources. Or even different colors of it. Of course, that is just the "looks". But it does make it feel meh to me.\n\nWhen digging, you can interact with said resource. You can "gently" harvest, where you probably won't get as much out of it, but you won't take damage if it "explodes" in gas (that happens and you CAN die when digging). And then there is "harmful" digging of said resource, where you get more quality overall, and the potential to get 2 (or more) of that resource. However, you'll have a bigger chance of a gas cloud, and a higher chance of destroying the resource.\n\nOf course, there is a lot more to harvesting. Different types of resources appear in different seasons (some only appear in winter for example), only in day, or only in night. Its quite involved. And like I said, can even die when harvesting.\n\nThere WAS a severe lack of content update...not just for months and months...but for YEARS. I looked on the forums for any significant content update and saw none.  Last big one was being able to create your own dungeon or something with Ryzom Ring, but it was abandoned (lack of funds?) and it also didn't give out any rewards or anything at all, so pretty much most lost interest quick. So like the harvesting artwork (whether there is "lore" reason for the lack of it or not), they haven't had much funding for big updates. With that said, there have been other MMOs (free to play) on Steam that were in the same shape Ryzom is/was in, and then benefited so much that the developers were able to start putting out significant updates to them.\n\nAccording to wiki's (google search "define free to play") definition of what free to play.\n\n"Free-to-play (F2P) refers to video games which give players access to a significant portion of their content without paying. There are several kinds of free-to-play games, but the most common is based on the freemium software model."\n\nAs for the "free to play" negative reviews. That definition is exactly Ryzom's free to play model. There is no wrong advertisement or cheating of words that Ryzom is using. It is literally free to play as defined by wiki and google.\n\nI highly recommend Ryzom, despite a lot of negative reviews, I'd say try it for yourself :) Especially if you like harder MMOs or SWG. Might end up liking it :) Or might not, its very different and very challenging, so won't be for everyone.","May 10","true","28.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","2"

There are also no real classes in Ryzom, player chooses what to advance on there characters.\n\nThere are four playable races in Ryzom, the Fyros and the Matis, both very human like races, the races remind me of human, and elf races of standard fantasy games respectively. The Third race are the Trykers, a short dwarf like race, and the fourth and final race are the Zorais, a tall race who permanently wear a mask.

The only difference is The Ring, their "custom content creator for the players", has been non-functional and in fact removed for years now.\n\nThe only thing that has kept this game going is the same couple hundred Linux users who can't seem to make their toasters run better games, so they've stayed latched to this one. Otherwise the game would have stayed where it belonged the last 2 or 3 times it shut down. Dead and buried.\n\nSave your money, and more importantly your time. There are newer and much, much greater "sandbox" games out there.","May 6","false","7.2"," 31 of 69 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","31","69","2","12"

It was one of my first MMO loves alongside EQ and WoW. So naturally when I saw it on the 'Free To Play' section, I hit downloaded and waited with excitement.\n\nFirst thing you notice is absolutely nothing has changed from the old days, and while that sounds appealing and nostalgic, the reality is a ‘clunky’ movement system, a horrendous UI, and the lack of many basic things that you’d expect from a MMO.\n\nIt dates the game terribly and just saps away all the enjoyment.\n\nThe only saving grace is what made Ryzom such a star back in the day.

It appears that little thought has gone into the design of quests. Interaction with NPCs is no more than default font text in speech bubbles, and the setup of the UI is awkward and confusing. It's a shame, because the lore and actual graphics are quite nice, just the UI makes it very awkward to play. Additionally, the game was quite laggy and I had to force-quit it to make it stop running.","May 10","false","0.6"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

Do not waste your time unless you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer and can't play anything else","May 8","false","0.1"," 9 of 101 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","9","101","2","10"

I played it not much at all, so maybe it's fab. But it looks it's age, I didn't like the controls, the UI just feels wrong, so I abandoned.\n\nIn fairness, it all seemed to work OK, not the case when hit steam a couple weeks ago, so well done devs for ironing out whatever initial issues. Also, I have to recommend this game based almost entirely on one shining example of amazing customer service.......THERE WAS A GM IN GAME BY THE INITIAL SPAWN POINT!\nThat gives me hope that it's well run by people who care, so maybe I'll give it another whirl some bored winter.","May 8","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The crafting system is deep and character development is limited only by which skills you choose to level; there are no classes to limit you. The combat system seems simple at first but like the foraging/crafting system, has enough depth to it to make for interesting PvP for those so inclined.\n\nThe tiny starter island (Silan) does a good job of teaching you what you need to know to play, but the *real* game begins when you finish your lessons and go to the Mainland where there are far more opportunities, no matter what type of character you are trying to play. Hunters have a wider variety of prey, digger/crafters have better mats to dig, casters get spells that are unavailable in Silan... in short, Silan is only a glimpse at what Ryzom really has to offer. Any review based solely on a short time spent in the tutorial does this great game a disservice.\n\nHowever, it's not for everybody. The graphics are a bit dated, the mechanics take more than 12 seconds to learn, and you can't get a maxed out character without grinding. If you are looking for a simple game with lots of eye candy that doesn't make you work for rewards, then Ryzom is not for you. But if you are a gamer that doesn't mind spending a few minutes learning who can tolerate graphics simple enough to run on a five-year-old laptop and is okay with not having things handed to you on a silver platter just for existing, it's well worth a look.\n\nThere are very few MMOs (RPG or otherwise) that I stayed with for more than a couple of months, but I've been playing Ryzom for about four years. If something is good enough for me to stick with, then it's good enough for me to recommend the game to others. So here I am, recommending that you give Ryzom a try.","June 2","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
