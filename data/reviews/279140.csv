Here is the run-down:\n\n1.  Allied forces are HEAVILY favored.  What do I mean by that?  Simple, all the units on the different sides of the conflict are equivalent.  A German infantry is equal to that of a French or Russian infantry.  The German military was the best trained, the best equipped, and the best supported army in the conflict.  Some would even put this military on par with the greatest militaries of all time.  Russia, on the other hand, was supposed to be slow to mobilize and ill-equipped.  I played a game where AI Russia was in Berlin before the end of 1914.  Because the units are equal in strength, the Allies, with huge size advantages, will likely always win.\n\n2.  Serbia is too weak.  Historically, Serbia lasted a surprisingly long time.  In this game, Serbia doesn't have even close to enough resources to supply its comparatively huge military.  Austria-Hungary rolls them up as a matter of course, because the Serbians starve to death and run out of guns.\n\n3.  Belgium is too strong.  I played a game where Belgium completely repelled Germany (one of the greatest militaries in history), and even took ground in Germany.\n\n4.  The Allied forces start with Great Britain already involved.  GB wasn't keen on getting in on this war, and only planned on doing so if Belgium's neutrality was violated.  GB also only had the expeditionary forces on hand to wage a land war, in this game they seem to have a pretty healthy army from the start.\n\n5.  Austria-Hungary is too good.  The Great War is the tale about how Austria-Hungary constantly did the exact opposite of what Germany wanted, and as a result, they were getting pummelled by everyone, including the Kingdom of Serbia.  The only force AH knows how to fight is Italy, which leads to the next point:\n\n6.  Italy is too strong.  Historically, Italy failed to take the exact same river 9+ times against Austria.  In this game, it's only a little harder than taking any other position.\n\nI'm sure there are other problems, but let's move on to mechanics:\n\n1.  The Great War was insane.  Battles went no where, and the defenders always had the advantage.  Hence, both sides would put up trenches, and fortify, fortify, fortify.  Attacks were suicidal.  This game doesn't do trench warfare well because the units and regions are too large.  These trenches were separated by only a few hundred yards, loaded with barbed wire, and supervised by machine guns and artillery.  Units would stand at a stalemate for months at a time, with no progress being made, constantly under a hail of shells.  In this game, you have to commit massive armies to an attack, and the attack lasts until one side loses.  Smaller units or smaller regions would help solve this issue.\n\n2.  You can always see all the units of the enemy.  Observation planes and observation balloons only give your artillery bonuses to hit (which they need, because they can barely ever hit).  This is not a good feature for a game where air superiority meant you knew where your enemey was, and they didn't know where you were.\n\n3.  Big, important advances (such as metal helmets) aren't commented on in the game.  You also can't upgrade units (as far as I can tell), which makes no sense, considering the only different based on technology would be equipment.  Upgrading a units defense by giving them helmets sounds pretty easy to me.\n\n4.  Diplomacy is difficult to achieve, because it takes place over lengthy, incremental time periods.  Far longer than the scope of the game.  I tried playing the US in the 1912 campaign start, with the goal making a Western Hemisphere alliance, but for some reason only Nicaragua was interested.  I offered aid to many countries, and every couple of turns, they cancel the aid (why give up free money, I ask).  The AI just sells you stuff until they run out of stuff, and they buy stuff until they think they have enough stuff.  There is not indication of a desire to reach sustainability.  Aside from war, that is every diplomatic choice you really have with them, except for the absolutely pointless support factions options.  I say it is pointless because I couldn't find a point.  I couldn't see any change over time whatsoever.\n\nThis is just a short list of what I found disappointing about this game.  What I wanted was an accurate, defensive shlog that would reflect the Great War.  What I got was a game where offensive movement is far too easy to accomplish.","July 15, 2015","false","11.7"," 465 of 579 people (80%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","80","465","579","19","36"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VeersXII/recommended/279140/","VeersXII","Veers XII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VeersXII/","134 products in account","I start out my game as the Kingdom of Bulgaria, the year is 1914. For the past decade or more Europe has been increasing in tension and agressiveness. Germany Russia and France seem determined to drive the world to war and destruction. In the last two years Bulgaria has expanded its holdings in the Balkans to include the region of Thrace thus giving us access to the Aegean. However this is not enough, there must be more. Bulgaria shall be a great and respected power on the world stage once more, no matter how many of our neighbors will have to sacrifice themselves to attain our goals.\n\nI begin by increasing our military training capabilities by construction many recruitment centers across the land. The Bulgarian people shall be trained in the ways of war and will never be compared to some lowly militia. However it will take several months before the army becomes a true war machine worthy of its name.\n\nYet it seems that fate has other plans. News reached Sofia early on the 29th of June that the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary was assassinated by Serbian nationalists. The cabinet and several high profile generals were assembled quickly to decide what to do. It was soon declared that the military would move all forces to the Serbian border in case of war between Serbia and Austria.\n\nWeeks pass and it seems that things have taken a turn for the worse. Austria is demanding terms that no leader of a respectable state would accept. And the Serbians have categorically refused to meet the Austrian terms. As many countries move to  some state between war and peace Bulgaria call its reservists to their posts for an indefinite period of time.\n\nThe date is July 29th. News reached us that the Austrians have declared war with Serbia and are intent on making them pay for their crimes. Over the next few days Russia, Germany, France, England and all her subjects are at war. News has also reached us that Italy has abandoned her alliance with Germany and A-H. Japan has invaded Germany's Pacific holdings intent on claiming them for itself. As of now America. Romania, the Ottomans, and Spainards are neutral in the war. We are not sure whether or not any of these countries will intervene in the war.\n\nIt is now August 13th. Events have snowballed faster than we could have imagined. Germany and Austria have won astounding victories in the east over the Russians and Germany has completely taken over Belgium and Luxembourg and is now advancing into northern France. Germany offered us an alliance and a chance to form Greater Bulgaria out of the Balkans. We would not pass up the chance as we knew that Austria would soon swallow all of Serbia and might not stop there. We launched an invasion that had been planned many years ago. We sped into Vardar Barnovina and Morava. However it seems that we were too late and could not get any more of Serbia as our forces soon met with our Austrian allies.\n\nA month passes. Our forces have smashed into Albania and taken the country by storm giving us access to the Adriatic Sea. However our forces were surprised and horrified to learn that the Russians had launched a naval invasion of eastern Bulgaria and had taken Southern Dobruja and Eastern Rumelia from us. They were marching on our capital and that would not be allowed. We used what little train rails in the region we could and sent our elite forces to create a wall 30km east of the capital. The rest of the army arrived as fast as they could. With our new artillery captured from the Serbians and Albanians we strike the Russian lines and push them back to the sea. Bulgaria is safe once more.\n\nSeveral weeks later Bulgaria is better than ever. With the crushing defeat of the Russian invasion troop morale is higher than ever. The public is also happy as we have disbanded 15 divisions of farmers being held in reserve to go back to their farms and families. These men are being replaced by new Bulgarian Infantry being trained by German military advisors lent to us by the Kaiser.\n\nIt is now January of 1915. Under the cover of winter we have launched an invasion of Montenegro and captured the country. This mountainous land will be a good proving ground for our Alpine units. With this our Balkan aspirations are almost complete. Bulgaria is once more a great power on the world stage. Germany has pushed the French and English armies out of continental Europe. Their victories in the east have shaken the faith of the Russian people and many of their lands are in out right rebellion. The Uzbeks. The Kazaks. The Finns. The Armenians. The Germans have also granted the Poles a land of their own and have joined us in our fight against the encirclement of Europe.\n\nIn March the next phase of Bulgarian expansion is put into action. The invasion of Grecce has started. This will be the true test of our miliary skills. Even the Kaiser himself has travelled down here to observe the invasion in person. We start with a full out invasion of Macedonia complete with our entire artillery arsenal. However the real strike comes when our elite veterans smash into Epirus in western Greece. It works fantasically, the Greeks send the majority of their forces to Salonika while we head straight for Athens.\n\nHowever, it seems that fate again would have other plans. The Greeks hold out much longer than expected in Macedonia, they are indeed worthy opponents. Our new young recruits are sent straight into the baptism of fire as soon as they have gotten a basic sense of survival on the battlefield. We are wearing them down, slowly ever so slowly. Word reaches us that the Greeks have crossed the Aegean and invaded Anatolia. It would also seems that because of agressive German submarine tactics America joined the war on the side of the Entente. It matters not they are an Ocean and three Seas away they can do no harm to Bulgaria.\n\nIt is now May of 1915. Events have taken a turn for the worse. In our brash rush to invade Greece we have overlooked our eastern territory. The English, it seems, have staged a massive landing in Gallipoli. However, most of the Turkish forces that would be guarding the capital are in Anatolia trying to establish a link with the rest of their empire in the east. The damned Brits quickly spread out their invasion reaching the Romanian border and linking up with the Greeks outside of Salonika. The Italians have also invaded Albania seeking to claim what they see as rightfully theirs. Our forces are spread too thinly across the land and we start to lose land.\n\nQuickly our cavalry forces are pulled back from the siege of Athens and charge to Valona. However it seems that the Italians have already come and gone and word reaches us through the terrified civilian populace that they have headed north. For once in this campaign fate has smiled on us. The Austrians, sensing a larger Italian force coming shortly behind have sent troops to their southern border and help us reclaim our lands from the Italian.\n\nOur brave soldiers have finally taken Greek Macedonia and the rich port will help to improve the Bulgarian economy. Our battered army heads eastward to confront the British menace. Though we have taken many a beating we still hold our heads up high as we have yet to lose a battle in the war so far. And we are right to be proud. Our brave young men destroy the English at the Second Battle of Plovdiv. We free Constantinople from dread Russian rule and return it to the Turks. We reclaim our coastline on the Black Sea and turn our heads east again, ready to finish the job of conquering Greece.\n\nBut it seems that fate has a cruel hatred of Bulgaria. The Greeks have pushed into Southern Bulgaria from their holdings at the south of the continent. The Italians have taken the Albanian coastline and have begun to march inland. The Romanians have launched a full invasion of our lands. All we have left is the land of Montenegro to hold out until the end....It is near.","September 18, 2015","true","130.8"," 204 of 245 people (83%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","83","204","245","61","7"

In this game (it is a turn based strategy game with each turn taking 1 week) you can choose any country in the entire world and lead that country, industrializing it, modernizing it, engaging in diplomacy with other countries, waging war, facing crisis such as rebellion, invasions, and famine. This game also implements an event system with some events that follow actual history such as the building of the Panama Canal, and others that will be triggered by drastically changing history such as the unification of Scandinavia or the resurrection of the Byzantine Empire. Another interesting thing is that at any time in the game you can save your game and then resume it playing as another country (even countries that didn't exist at the beginning of the scenario you are playing) Another thing that this game possesses is an internal editor that can be used to change many aspects of the game, from creating new countries to changing the values of regions such as nationality or religion. Using the editor you can create amazing new scenarios of alternate history that you can then play and publish to the main website. After about 70 hours of this game I can definitely recommend it,","March 23, 2015","true","116.8"," 99 of 108 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","99","108","2","0"

I really wanted to like this game, set exclusively in the First World War.  But the problems with it are too great to overcome.\n\nPROS\n- It's nicely complicated, like the Paradox games.\n- The graphics are as good as one would like for this type of game.\n- Naval warfare is better than any of the Paradox games.\n\nCONS\n- First and foremost, there is no concept of supply, really.  The AI sends units to the most outlandish places with no hope of being supplied.  For instance, I was playing Austria Hungary and late in 1914 I was attacked by several Japanese infantry units coming from Finland.  That is not an isolated incident.\n- Provinces are empty, leading to constant whack-a-mole in your rear areas.  Bad enough with rebel uprisings, but when a random cavalry unit from a country 12,000 miles away pops up and conquers half your nation, (see above), it's a real problem.  Every game designer should program the EU model where every province has some sort of garrison automatically.\n- The AI in general is just poor.  No concept of depth in defense, reinforcing weak areas or bottlenecks, and so on.  Pretty common in these types of games.\n\nSUMMARY\nNice ideas, nice-looking game, but hamstrung by bizarre AI, lack of supply, and various small bugs with units popping up in the middle of nowhere.","October 25, 2015","false","50.2"," 152 of 182 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","152","182","9","4"

The game can be a little overwhelming at first, There is a bit of a learning curve but can easily be learned even with out the tutorial if you have played similar games.\n\nI love the amount of depth this game has, Although war is a major focus point it is far from being the only point. One thing i dislike in similar games is a vast amount of waiting around with nothing to do. This game has plenty to manage while you are waiting for troops to build. If i had to compare this game to another game Supreme Ruler comes to mind as far as what you can do micromanaging wise. As much as i love the Supreme Ruler series this is in my opinion a superior game for the sole reason that i find this game more of a  joy to play.\n\nIf you are looking for a strictly historical game you may be a little off put as the game is guided towards world war 1 events however it is only a suggestion, I have yet to play a game that was the same, There were times that world war one happened without a hitch and i was fighting off Germans in Belgium, Other times I became the cause of a World War due to my military expansion of Romania. There were times that other conflicts would prevent world war one but start other conflicts around the globe such as Colonial territories rebelling against their owners. The randomness of this game can be a blast.\n\nThe game also comes with an Editor that anyone can use, This means that if you want to build a world war two scenario you can, Do you want to recreate the Roman Empire you can, Whatever your imagination can come up with. These scenarios can also be uploaded on the Making History website for all to download.\n\nThe Developers are extremely active and listen to the community, I have never experienced the amount of help that is given by the developers to the players than in this game. They have made it clear that this game will continue to be a major focus with continued updates and added features for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf you are looking for a game in which you will keep telling yourself one more turn and you realize that was the 30th time you said that then here is the game.

Now that time has progressed, and I felt that this game has come a long way, I would like to update this to give possible buyers a better perspective of what they are getting themselves into.\n\nOne of my favorite things so far is the uniqueness you find among the buildable armies. Typically in strategy games such as this, you are often handed a few sprities for a variety of nations. This somewhat lessens the visual appeal of the game because how fun would it be when "everyone" looks like a german soldier. In TWG, the visuals are better such as when you play Japan, your troops look unique compared to what they would look like in Korea. They approach this in a cool way and while minor I think it goes a long way.\n\nNext is the micromanaging and complexity. In previous MH games, players were able to research and produce one item per city which could be a soldier, tank, goods, and so forth. But in TGW, players can actually assign individual factories to produce goods, weapons, or tanks while also training your next batch of troops. Research is going on in the background while you focus building a nation or war machine. This expands the possiblities when it comes to determining how your nation will go but can be consuming to the average joe who just wants to build stuff and fight. Players also must also keep in mind the resources in which you must have to keep your factories turning out new stuff and goes into a new system of trading.\n\nOverall, this game is headed in the right direction, and from a gamer whos been gaming for ages, and a long time MH fan, I feel this game can be the next great stepping stone for this company. The AI is getting better, and has at times made me bang my head because it actually out smarted me on several occasions. If you are into strategy and nation building games, TGW is for you.\n\nIn my opinion, it brings a new breath of fresh air to a genre i've long loved and has provided something new. Hopefully they continue on the path to success!","April 4, 2014","true","231.8"," 63 of 74 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","63","74","4","0"

It's what RISK would be like if a group of Professors and history buffs modded the hell out of it and pumped it full of steroids. In fact, that's not far from the truth. Muzzy Lane are without doubt *the* academic game developers with an undeniable academic and gaming pedigree for historic sandbox strategy gaming. Their line-up includes MIT grads, noted world-famous academics and some of the best coders and designers around.\nThis is a well-researched, very well-constructed strategy game for thinking people and warlords alike.\nWhile it's possible to go-for-broke and unleash the dogs of war from the start, you can also roleplay your nation historically (or ahistorically) and fulfil your desire for world domination, domination of a sphere, or run your empire or nation benevolently and attempt to prosper and grow. The game covers economic, scientific, diplomatic and military areas with detail and puts the controls of your nation at your fingertips.\nEach power has it's own sphere of influence, and if you start becoming involved in areas of the globe in which they hold an interest, then you will be warned and war might even follow. It's a game where you cannot just bludgeon through without facing consequences. Armies must be supplied and also fed. Food plays a vital role (which is not covered in other games of Grand Strategy) and transport of that food is vital if you ship it from abroad. This is where control of vital areas comes into play, and also trade warfare such as unrestricted submarine warfare. You really have to think strategically in broad strokes to achieve your goals.\nAlso, the technology of the warfare of this period is unlike anything you may have been familiar with before. Warfare is in a new era that renders the old Victorian style of warfare (which didn't change much from Napoleonic times) obsolete. The machine gun changed all of this, making wars long, costly and with terrible attrition. A nation has it's War Weariness measured in the game, which affects the nation's will to fight. You can wrestle it out on long fronts, hoping for a breakthrough or you can try to end the deadlock by pouring troops into your meat-grinder and waging a war of attrition. Technology plays a vital role in gaining an edge, as new weapons and methods of waging war, like gas attacks, better artillery, assault troops and aircraft can turn the tide of battles. Eventually, one side will break and they will gain that extra territory. You need to make sure it's you.\n\nThere is also a wealth of demographic map overlays to satisfy the most obsessive map fiends. They cover amongst other things, religion, ethnicity, trade, infrastructure and so on. It's also worth noting that the economic and trade parts of the game are highly enjoyable and you can make a lot of money or gain precious resources this way. The market also reacts dynamically to supply and demand, so, you can  do things like buy a lot of one resource on the market to drive the price up, and vice-versa. If you have the added privilege of owning major sources of that resource, then you can effectively destabilise other nation's economies without firing a shot.\n\nThe UI is typical for Muzzy Lane: uncluttered, easy to process, easy on the eye and with ease of access to all info in a very sleek and classy-looking way. You can go deep into the sub-menus for all kinds of interesting and vital info. The in-game encyclopedia is thankfully in-game and not online. This contains all info on unit stats, buildings, and everything else you would want to know. The manual also has extensive info on this and it's not a two-page leaflet with install instructions, a screenshot and key commands.

It has a very high level of economic detail. It is a micro-manager's paradise.  The learning curve is sharp, and the game doesn't seem to try very hard to help you.  There are a bazillion messages popping up on the screen after every turn, and you just cant read them all.  They tell you trivial things, like unit recruitment, but not that your towns are not developing and such.\n\nThe real snag is the gameplay.  This is such an old school interface that it seriously interferes with gameplay.  You are constantly merging and reforming armies... armies that you can't even drag a box around!\n\nThen the fighting... well it certainly captures the charnel house effect of the great war, but what it doesnt do, is readily identify the size of enemy forces roaming around.  Some are a unit or two, and others are hundreds... this should be very obvious on the map.  As for balance, it seems messy.  France is easily defeated in Europe.  Conversely, Russia feels conspicuously powerful.\n\nBut after a a healthy 40 hours of gameplay I have to conclude it is a bit lacking.

It is done simply, but with stacked units.

I have been waiting for a WW1 game for a long time; I finally have one. It is very detailed and there is plenty of stats and data, i.e. Diplomacy, Research, Economy, Resources, Trade, Government, Military, and much more. Pretty much everything you would expect from such a game.  But what i really like about this game is that its simple enough for new players to learn quickly, but not to simple that hardcore players will be bored or disapointed. The UI is clean and crisp, easy to read and to understand. Army managment is easy and streamlined compared to other games of this genre. A welcome improvement IMO.\n\nNow of course this game is still early access so there is many features that are absent or not working as it should. The AI still needs improving and tweaking also. But that is to be expected with any beta. I am very much looking forward to the fully completed version of this game. IMO i like this game more then any of the Paradox games i have tried because the UI is beter organized and easier to interact.\n\nMaking History: The Great War has huge potential and will not disappoint when it becomes fully operational ;)","April 18, 2014","true","200.0"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

A bit like Paradox's grand strategy games like Victoria 2 this strategy game is however tightly focused on the Great War, so you have observation planes, trenches, observation balloons, bombardment artillery, airships and even gas attacks.\n\nIt's got a lovely simple GUI, which for a game like this is very important. You need to be able to control all your production etc in one place. This game does that really well - one screen set to control production of factories, infrastructure and resources - its really easy.\n\nMessages are well presented with popup screens and clear notification icons, you are given opportunities to make grand changes from these popups as well like when playing as the Austro Hungarian Empire you can choose to ask Serbia for harsh terms or go easy on them. Interesting diplomacy options then, but there could be more choices like being able to raise bad relationships or insult other countries, which would just add a bit more gameplay into the diplomacy.\n\nGraphics wise lovely looking clean map, sprites all have authentic uniforms. Externally applied anti-aliasing works well here to improve the whole look of the game (but it should be made configurable from within the game I think) - BUT choose enhance game settings for AA in the Nvidea Control Panel, not override game settings, which seems to blur the text in the game for me.\n\nYou can trade for food and other resources that you need which is good, its taken me two years of gametime but my economy is now pretty sound in the game - it is a struggle when you start a new game getting your production and resources working well. But dealing with that stuff is more fun than it sounds and it all works well.\n\nThe AI is quite passable - it tends to attack pretty well and goes after badly defended provinces, it keeps you on your toes - I am presently fighting on four fronts! But it doesnt seem to protect its high value provinces very well - I walked straight into the Ottoman's Constantinople without a fight. There are some other AI bugs like countries taking trade agrrements then cancelling them again next turn. But they are relatively minor. Combat seems to go on for ages and it should be lengthy where trenches are utilised, but perhaps should be made a bit quicker for small skirmishes in open ground. I know this is being looked at by the devs at the moment trenches are a bit to easy to build so battles drag on too much.\n\nTurn generation for me has been very fast i am up to 1915 after 130 hours in my game and the generation is no different to when I started - takes at most ten seconds which seems very fast to me.\n\nI am playing AustroHungary and wouldnt even think of playing such a large country in Paradox's Victoria II but in this game its dead easy. I really got the game though to be able to play Great Britain which has so many colonies that in more complex games it looked a nightmare. In this game though I think it will be possible.\n\nMy present epic game as AustriaHungary has me fighting quite a historical war although Russia is starting its civil war in 1915 (thank goodness) and Italy is proving to be rather stubborn to fight on when it has no chance of taking my mountainous provinces. So enjoyable watching how these sorts of things pan out, watching the Chinese Communists fight against the Nationalists, and watching small countires like Bulgaria, Greece and Montenegro banded together against me (not that it made much difference in the end).\n\nOverall is a nice simple looking, but deceptively complex, game that is more immediate and less faff to play than Paradox's offerings. It is only going to get better over time as the devs tinker with it - and they are very dedicated to make their game as good as possiboe which is very nice to see. So yeah I like it, nice to see a good WW1 game at last and this is certainly the best WW1 game out there by far.","January 31, 2015","true","160.8"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","24","30","2","1"

Often they will refuse help if you're trying to send some, and there aren't really much other options.

But I still feel like I have control of most areas of my "Empire" . I have played as New Zealand, and attempted to conquer the world.

Unfortunatly poor AI and performance make for a marred experiance. I'd recommend only picking this up when it's cheap and to not expect much out of it.\n\nPros:\n-WW1 time setting. I'm a sucker for this time period.\n-Managing troops deployment is hugely important as are deciding what fronts to attack on and where to defend.\n-The arms and manpower resources provide interesting dynamics.\n-Excellent early/mid game.\n-Managment of the economy, infrastructure, trade routes, resources and populace happiness increases the depths of the strategy required.\n-Diplomacy has a significant impact and is very dynamic.\n-Good trading system with managment of trade routes important.\n-Good soundtrack, if not a bit short.\n\nCons:\n-Poor tutorial. Reading the PDF manual is a MUST and even then some mechanics are poorly explained.\n-Performance is pretty bad. Frequent crashes due to 'running out of memory' including wiping out 8 hours of my German campaign. Changing map overviews or moving large distances often requires alt-tabbing for it to display correctly.\n-Relatively poor AI.  Defense is much stronger than an offense, as in real world WW1, however the AI does not seem to know this. The AI also does silly things like not supporting their troops with artillary, fighting completely unwinnable offensives, not reacting to artillary/air raids/sea barrages. These allow for OP strategies, hence why Serbia was able to defeat the Balkan states, Austria-Hungary and Germany.\n-AI refuses to surrender despite having no chance of winning a war, even on surrendering on 'pre-war' conditions.\n-AI allies largely only provide milltary support. Could be improved if they provided resources such as America did irl.\n-Joining an alliance is quite difficult. The impact of 'an enemy of my enemy is my friend' is not as great as it should be.\n-Huge amounts of artillary or bombers are overpowered.\n-AI does not mind or react if you're building ridiculous amounts of troops or piling them on your border.\n-Conquered regions are generally pretty happy and do not require as big of a military presence as I would like. This means if you break through the enemies line you can steam roll through their nation.\n-Late game can become a bit stale.\n-Populace happiness does not have as big of an impact as I'd like. If a population has been starving for months they should have a bigger impact then the occasional protest. This is easily demontrated by the fact that I've never seen the Russian revolution succeed. Likewise you can basically ignore your money resource if you want to while at war.\n-Colonies do not provide as much of a buff to the nation state as I'd like. They seem to have terrible incomes and produce little to no resources.\n-Score only reflects absolute worldpower, would be nice to have a before/after when not playing great powers.","May 20","false","141.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The Germans that did attack on the western front stuck to the Schleiffen-plan religiously and kept on punching their way thru Belgium to the channel coast even as they where cut of behind them by my counter attack.\nIn the meantime the eastern front was a complete mess with Germans advancing as far into Russia as the could at the same time as the Russians was doing the same to them. Nobody seemed to try to build a sustainable frontline but was always trying to exploit any breech in the front they could to advance as fast and as far as they could.\nThis is complete nonsense when you consider the history and disastrous for the game as Germany of course is much smaller then Russian. The Russians can loose a lot of territory like this - it barley hurts them. But a single Russian unit running all over German provinces, disrupting production, knocks Germany out of the game pretty fast.\n\nSo next I tried playing Germany myself, thinking that would balance the game.\nOk, so this game (started in 1912) Russia decided to build the largest army in the world and pretty much ignored industrializing. They also ignored internal factions and by the spring of 1914 they where collapsing from inner turmoil, with massive amounts of unrest. Then half of the country broke away in the new "Republic of Russia" which I quickly recognized and started supporting. So now we had two Russia - and this was before the actual war even started.\nI kept to my plan and just kept on improving Germany for the war I knew would come, but I spent some money fueling the unrest in Russia even further.\nSoon enough Lithuania broke away, then Poland and Finland and a number of smaller states. Russia was disintegrating in inner strife when I think is was Greece who for no reason at all declared war on Lithuania (which I don´t even think they bordered to), which prompted Russia to declare war on them to defend "their" territory (which they didn't control now anyway). Exactly whom declared war on whom in which order is lost on my now, but any way we all ended up in war with each other as we would in the original Great War - with the exception that Italy this time stuck on the side of the Central powers.\nI couldn't do much in the east as I didn't even boarder Russia anymore, but Poland and Lithuania, and I preferred to let that mess go on without me for a while - thinking I could always go in and mop up the rest later. I wasn't really prepared for the war I thought would come half a year later, but walked into defenseless Luxemburg on the western front and used my massed artillery (artillery is vastly overpowered in the game now) to blow the few French units away from the front - simply walking in to the province unopposed.\nBehind that was... nothing.\nI kept on advancing but there was no French army left to fight. Some units on the Italian boarder where fighting them, but no one else.\nWhen I advanced onto the channel coast a single British unit tried to do a landing straight into the same province and was obliterated.\nBut soon more British showed up - in Russia! Or more correctly, in Lithuania where they first fought Lithuanians to advance to the German boarder where they where quickly annihilated by the massed German artillery on the eastern front.\n\nAccompanying them where a chunk of the British navy who ended up fighting me right outside my main naval base in Kiel. Meaning I had all the advantages of being able to send fresh units into the battle and retreating damaged ones, while they kept on fighting with the same units.\nNeedless to say they where soundly beaten.\nThe Russian Baltic navy in the meantime hung around outside St Petersburg (or Petrograd, as the city had been renamed to by then) since they had lost control of their capital and every other province with a port in the Baltic region, unable to refuel, rearm or repair - just waiting to die.\n\nSo that's´s some of my experiences with this game.\n\nNow some historical facts:\n\nNothing where more important to regimes and the military doctrine of the day then ORDER. Everything had to be done in an orderly and traditional fashion. As things "always" had been - so should they always remain, was the conservative thinking of the time.\nThere was absolutely NO acceptance for risk taking or gambling in either war or politics. (A side note here is that we today of course see the outbreak of war over the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand as completely irrational risk taking, but that is not how is was viewed at the time).\n\nNo country should advance at the cost of loosing their own defensive frontline. Defense is the most important thing - not attack. Troops should build thick defensive lines before they even think about attacking.\n\nNo country should (in peace time) collapse in inner turmoil as Russia did in my last game. Nothing was more important for the old regimes holding the power at the time then to stay in power. In peacetime they should prioritize keeping their country happy or at least content. I don't know what the Russian AI did in my game to get those levels of unrest but I have played Russian before and never had anything like that - not by a long shot.\nWhat I do know is that the AI spent heavily on the military - money that should have gone to developing the country.\nIn the end I or Austria-Hungary or any other big power didn't even have to attack them for them to collapse - they did it all on their own (long before I started fanning those flames).\n\nThe British navy would never have fought an open, massive battle with the German high sees navy right outside Kiel. It's highly questionable if they ever would have entered the Baltic with any capital ships at all - it's to far away from safe bases.\nAnd landing the main body of the British army in a Russia engulfed in a massive civil war while they send almost nothing to help defend France?\nI don't know where the French army went either - maybe they where somewhere in Russia as well while I was marching down Champs-Élysées? Doesn't really matter - they where not where they should have been anyway.\n\nSo right now the AI is way to aggressive and stupid to make this a working game.\n\nBut I am nonetheless recommending it as I hope the developers will fix this.\nGet it on sale as I did and don't expect it to be perfect but see the money as a way to support the developers. One day they might get it to work.","January 5","true","488.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Fortunatley, a serbian with a jumpy trigger finger was able to give me a chance to enact revenge for the Franco-Prussian war. Allies swarmed in to take over Germany, and eventually Russia ended up taking most of Eastern Europe, and I was able to take former Luxembourg and parts of West Germany. I eventually was the last country to fight Germany, and left my alliance to destroy the dogs. Germany was left to one small region, eventually becoming part of a new alliance...\n\nThen, our friends from the east betrayed us...Italy declared war. Japan was first to get a slice of the cake and take over rome. I was able to take the remaining parts, and now Italy is a tiny nation north of Albania. Russia is now leading the Allied powers, and has started a war with America. America teamed up with Nicuaragua and Cuba, which the US would lose East Texas and Puerto Rico. Then, the second civil war starts, with the New Confederate States fighting the Union, Texas takes this as a perfect oppritunity to secede and becomes the New Texas Republic, fighting both sides in the conflict.\n\nAfrica would be taken over by Spain and the UK, leaving only our trusty colony of Algeria left.\n\nCountless new states and rebellions would form to fight russia and their growing power.\n\nAs the world becomes unstable and war torn, France remains strong, though now a Regional power, France has settled down and became one of the last stable places in the world and settle down with their new land in Africa and what used to be Italy, as her economy comes back after being destroyed from the war. Along with the remains of Germany and Austria-Hungary, France would re join the Allied powers after leaving in 1915. It is now 1917, while the world is still at war, France strives to become a world power once again.\n\nThat is my story my friends. Because of army expansion, I caused the world to become a deadly place with empires pulling apart each other to gain power.","August 22, 2015","true","19.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","10","15","7","0"

I am happy to say that after having reported this bug to the devs, they promptly responded and fixed the bug. So what about the game itself?\n\nIn short, this game is a huge improvement on Making history II (2010), which I really didn't like. So should you buy it? If your an Grand Strategy buff most defenatly! Are you a Linux user, the short answer is absolutely! This title WORKS on Linux ;).\n\nThis game is more in-depth, is more dynamic and feel more addicting as a good grand strategy game should do.\nIn-deptness:  The economy much improved form MH2, you have more options and in my view it's more realistic. The UI is also improved and redone which contributes. They have also kept the option to freely create vassals, chose their gov type, name, number of provinces etc. which came HUGLEY in handy while trying to keep newly conquered China in check. Simply split China up into smaller vassals, if one rebels, you don't have to deal with retaking the entire country. Plus the other Chinese vassals will help retake the rebellious China. :)\n\nDynamic: In one out of four games things have gone historically and launched WW1 when the Archduke got shot. In one game Europe fell into looking like a mosaic plate and a bunch of civil wars out of which Nazi Germany rose. This  Germany subsequently invaded me (Romania) from the north while I was fighting the Turks in the south.\n\nThe addiction: When you started getting things going and building your Empire you have already put so much effort into that Empire.

However, it should be dutifully noted that this game is still in a playable Beta stage. Most of the parks are working and mesh well together, but there are still some bugs and kinks to work out before the final version is released.\n\nTo be fair, the game will probably continue to be updated throughout the period of it's lifespan due to the forum community and the amount of time the Developers spend there. Unlike some larger game companies, Muzzy Lane actually takes its time to listen to their customers, their fanbase, and does their best to implement suggestions that are made by the community. Personally, I have paid tribute to several suggestions that I have made being directly implemented into the game, quite often within the next two updates (which are fairly frequent for such a small staff).\n\nNeedless to say, I believe this is the game that we all hoped Making History II would/should have been. Thankfully, Muzzy Lane is rather quick to realize what works and, quite often, what does not.

Not hours or days later but help right now.That was a pretty good intro to M.H:T.G.W.Thanks Chris.\nThe game itself after a modest 14 hours is proving to be excellent.The map ,oddly is much better than it appears in Steams add, the choices of countries you can play as is amazing,the detail quite  stunning.Ok if you just want to roll the armour ,the good  old Command and Conquer tank rush this isn't  your kind of game. I'm still trying to get my rail system up and running correctly, learning how one problem effects so widely and how to solve it is the brilliant part of this game.Micro management,sure, but great fun.

Its  a clever, functional game.No crashes,no long load up times,all good.\nThings I don't like about the game but can certainly live with..Scrolling,sometimes it works sometimes it requires zooming way out,scroll,zoom back in .Not a biggie . I think combat  est la Victoria 11 would be better, it's a little hohum in this.It works fine but having gone to so much preperation to get your merged, well fed,superbly armed, paid, happy buggers to the front line via your splendid railway I'd  like a bit of a show.Yep,sure, I know WW1 was not a lot of fun and maybe this reflects that.\nHow does it compare with" Commander the Great War'?

TGW is no different and i highly recommend it to any armchair general worth his salt. Muzzy Lane the relatively small and unknown studio behind this series is fantastic for customer support (i've exchanged direct emails with the developer team reporting bugs, they explained in great detail why these bugs existed and how they would fix them) They are professional and love the subject matter with a deep passion. The updates never cease as well, adding additional fixes and content with each new update. The forums are filled with passionate and friendly people dying to discuss history and tactics, overall a very welcoming and friendly community. Modding support is built into the foundations and this shows with the map Editor which gives you the ability to rework the game entirely as you see fit, with the built in option to upload mods you create directly to the steam workshop or to the making history website. Multiplayer is also available and is incredibly addicting to play with friends. This game truly makes you feel like YOU are making the history.\n\nI recommend this game at a STRONG 11/10 for those wanting a serious and rewarding world war 1 RTS unlike anyother in terms of playability and satisfaction.","May 2, 2015","true","167.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Altough its a promising game its lacking in almost every aspects. The number of available faction is HUGE (which is great) which would in theory bring a lot of replay value. However, this game is extremely hard to grasp and understand, it seduces you with its promise of economic and political management but without offering any way through a tutorial to get to understand them. Sure, there is one, but it explains you how to move units, recruit them, buy and sell on the internationnal market (which is btw broken imo because the AI either refuses most offers and when it does accept one, it is quickly cancelled because "it doesnt have the ressources" so basicly you waste time finding a buyer/seller who breaks his contract 2 minutes later) act on a political scale invade etc etc.... BUT this stupid tutorial never ONCE explains how to actually manage the country, what expanding/ and prospecting coal and metal actually do and especially HOW THE ♥♥♥♥ i suddendly get a minus 114 in coal per turn while the turn before that it was -10 per turn!! Building industries and reserching techs are a drag, because they take 20 turns each, thats 20 time you have to press a ♥♥♥♥ing button to get 1 building up in 1 city. You have to take each and every single individual city and choose what you wanna build in each of them. Its a micromanaging paradise, but for someone looking for a less complicated approach to strategy, this game is infuriating, tedious, and unrewarding. The soundtrac is the same 2 "musical themes" (if you can call them that) that repeat themselves AGAIN AND AGAIN. Either soft piano, or whatever the instrument for the other one is.  Battles are so incredibly annoying, I attack a region but then I cant see anymore what the enemy forces im engaging are!! I There are some indicators showing who is winning but ive quiclky learned not to rely on them because they show terrible odds for me on battles im sure to win, OR incredible odds on armies IM CLEARLY SEEING THEY LOST ALMOST ALL THEIR MEN.

Furthermore, the battles are not that exciting. I picked two units and just mass produced them and threw them at the enemy, which I would win almost every time.\n\nWhile I prefer a more in depth game than a lot of the games offered today, this one is a miss in the end.

The ability to use combined arms. I spent many hours playing this game. Trying to change history and Have the central powers of Europe come on top. The gas attacks.  I love it. Most games of this type are usually the same. You simply move all your units to one province and let them have at it. But this game concept allowed artillery pieces to remain in adjacent provinces and rain death upon the battlefield. This was my favorite part of the game.  The game actually built a realistic WW 1 battle strategy game.  It is a pure slug fest of vast numbers of casualties.  You can\'t simply overwhelm a province or run throught it and the battle for europe is done in so much time.  The amount of resources and men needed to take a province that is well defended is quite staggering.\n\nNo other strategy game I have played has better simulated trench warfare on a massive scale than this one.  I have had a lot of fun with this game.\n\nFor the negative part of the game. Theyre are some very critcal flaws. No matter how much fun and enjoyment ive had with this game. You simply can\'t recommend a game that has some severe problems. But if you want to enjoy some serious simulated trench warfare. The game is very available. Just do not have any grand visions of conquering the whole of europe.\n\nEventually the game will become unplayable. I have never finished a game before the game breaking flaws come in. Its a real shame that it is severly unpolished.  Initialy the game will run smooth enough but due to the continued numbers of troops. The game simply breaks.\n\nIf these critcal flaws could have been addressed. This game could have been one of the best simulated strategy games of its kind.","May 31","false","89.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

My force was over 300 attack points in each scenario and I could not defeat an army of 100 defense points. The battle will last SO LONG that the enemy replenishes its hit points at 3:1 of your attack points. Then there is the single-army scatter plan of the AI. I quickly learned to also put 5 armies on every territory I owned, and then attacked with 300 point army. My army was bogged for the entire game never won its battle (including I was bombing the enemy with 30+ artilliary), yet the enemy would bomb my territores with 5 troops with their 2-5 artilliary. within a few turns my troops would be gone even if I replenished them fast as I could, and the enemy would walk in with ONE troop and defeat me.

It is fun for World War 1 fans and has interesting methods for production of resources. It is fun but the problem I am having is that the AI is too easy to beat. There are no difficulty settings for the AI at the moment so you really cannot draw out a long game. Playing Germany, I had taken over France within some 12 turns unlike how World War 1 was a large stalemate taking years. I do recommend this game but the developers need to add AI difficulty settings.","February 21","true","24.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I mean, It's not a triple A title, but it isn't Indie garbage you'd find in the Gamestop Dumpster. It's turn-based, meaning you do what you're gonna do first, then you hit next turn and voila, it's the next turn. Magic, I know. But the game is centered around, well, World War 1, If you could guess from the Cover of the game. Now the main game is fun and all, but what really makes it interesting is the relatively big sized community of editors who put their own mods of the game on the workshop.

I find that they interact with me community quite well. There are a lot go great features that come along with this game such as being able to declare unrestrictive submarine warfare. I feel it really adds to the realism that this game imposes and makes it feel more enticing.

After 6 hours, I'm actually starting to enjoy myself. This isn't an intuitive casual game. It takes a looooooong time to learn and a loooooonger time to play. The gameplay itself is very rewarding however, especially for Civilization fans who are upset by the recent dumbing-down of the series.\n\nGraphics aren't great.

I am a huge fan of Paradox games like EU4, Darkest Hour, Victoria 2, etc. If you know how to play those games, this game isn't that hard to figure out. Play through the tutorial first and you shouldn't have too much trouble!\n\nLove the depth of the trade, units, politics, etc. I have only scratched the surface though so I look forward to what's in store.\n\nOnly issue is I wish there were tooltips so you know 'what is what' when you mouse over buildings and resources. In Paradox games when you mouse over a resource you see exactly where it's going, while in Making History, it just tells you very little. But it's just a knitpick.\n\nSo far I say this game is well worth it if you like grand strategy games.","June 17, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the spirit of the period, reminding me of a young lady of my acquaintance: solid pedigree, very pretty, yet - let's face it - not too bright?\n\nI attempted a somewhat 'historical' game as Germany, villainous invasion of Belgium and all. This effort revealed that the A Iapparently  has no sense of continuous frontlines; after a couple weeks of grinding down the Belgians in Wallonie, I then found nothing standing between me and Paris. No taxis, no Batlle of the Marne .. the French army did faithfully execute Plan 17 with the requisite battering against my static and entrenched lines in Elsass-Lothringen, but that was it. I never even found the BEF, so no memories there.\n\nMeanwhile, myeastern forces (denuded by transfers to the West) still found the motivation to push the Russians completely out of Poland, while colonial units ravaged South Africa and Kenya.\n\nIt's a pretty game, and I'd hope for uniform and helmet changes at Infantry II etc. -  haven't stayed serious long enough to verify. But when I return to it, it will be to push What-if limits.  For alt hist devotees, this might work well - Sweden rebuilds her C17 kingdom, etc. Goofiness like "Denmark rediscovers her viking spirit" - which might work in this environment.\n\nI did run a control by playing a round as Switzerland... here Germany elected to push her mobile army East, into as small a cauldron as possible ...\n\nDespite misgivings, I still give the thumbs up as I want to believe the issues I mention are correctible ...

The game is easy to get into, but slightly harder to learn. I quickly figured out how the game works after a 40 hour long campaign with Japan. The game does not give you a great tutorial, but it does help you with the very basic stuff.\n\nThe strategy regarding the  economy  in this game is the hardest to master. You could have the greatest military strength in the world, but your tanks and ships may not have enough fuel to fight. Taking control of your country's resources is the key to winning the game. Without metal or coal, your nation will not be able to build anything. Invading a country and taking it over is a great way to boost your resource stockpiles for a little bit.\n\nThe strategy regarding the  ground combat  is a bit too easy in my opinion, but once the world hates you it does get harder. If you keep large amounts soldiers and tanks on the border, you will not have much troubled defending. I find armies of at least 30 divisions can hold any line. It is only later in the game that you have to worry about being outnumbered and outgunned by large enemy armies.\n\nThe strategy regarding the  naval combat  is what can make or break a nation. A nation without a navy is a nation that can be attacked from every direction. I would say that having the best navy is the most important thing in the game other than the economy. You will not be able to expand far and secure and land without a navy to make an opening for your troop ships. I failed to have a navy during my first campaign and that really caused my downfall.

The research and changing of production is interesting and has a real effect on the nations power.

Many nations require you to play a more passive role as you don't posses the military or economic power to take on superior empires, and will make you take a much more political approach to avoid all out war that would devestate your empire and the enemy's empire alike.

A good wargame need to focus also in economy because no nation can achieve victory without a strong economy which can produce weapons but also commodities for trade, armed forces and national population. If I consider this game very good you definitely should play also "Making History II: The War of the World" from the same developers, because I give it a mark : Excellent !! One last note about these two games, they are so realistic that they even use the nazi German flag of the epoch without any prurigo , but in another hand don´t promote the nazism in any form. BUY THESE GAMES YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY !!!","April 15","true","240.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately I can't play it becasue of constant ctd's which appears to be a windows 10 issue only..? I'm stuck playing mh2 until they can fix the issue. I've read some forums where there is disucssion about the issue being with nvidia or windows 10. I say bs, it's the game dev's responsibility to optimize the game accross all systems and hardware.\n\nYup, can't even play the game, but still recommend. As seen with the lack of marketing of these games I assume they lack resources.  I have faith they will resolve the ctd's  and applaud them on creating such magnificent games.","May 12","true","32.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Whereas the last game spoke to a more simplistic view of the economy that was nevertheless very fun, this game greatly expands on that, capturing the feeling f developing a global empire of resources and colonies, trying to develop, research, industrialize, and wage war across the globe. It is certainly harder than its predecessor but it captures WWI grand strategy very well. It is like the inversion of the hearts of iron series, where modifiers and complex military systems reign. But only this game lets you use poison gas.\nIt's definitely worth, playing, it's accessible and fun, although I prefer Making History II for its easier management of the economy, where everything could be expanded infinitely and colonies didn't revolt en massse.","May 14","true","155.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
