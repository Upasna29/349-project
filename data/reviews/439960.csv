This game fails at that.  I was intrigued by the similarities with Twilight Imperium and the game just seemed like it had so much potential.  Unfortunately, the UI destroyed it for me.  Key to this game is loading troops onto carriers and moving out into the universe.  Sadly, there seems to be no way of knowing which of your carriers actually have troops.  This made the game start totally frustrating and I was lost there.\n\nIt was a bit like if you started a game of Civilization for the first time and were totally excited by the environment and concept but when you went to build a second city, your settler would only move in random directions.\n\nI desperately hope they finish this game.  Seems like something great hiding here.\n\nREVISION -- They did a patch so I gave this another try.  Initially, I thought they had fixed the carrier UI problem but on turn 2 of the game, it simply wouldn't let me move ground troops at all.  Said my carrier was full when it wasn't.  Still not there.  (To carry forward my earlier analogy, now my settlers don't move in random directions, they just don't move).","April 27","false","1.7"," 51 of 84 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","51","84","4","10"

The latter two are very complex, longer-to-play games. The designers of 'Falling Stars' never intended and advertised it as such. They conceived and promoted a simple, casual game which is easy to learn and easy to complete under an hour of time.\n\nThe problem of the lack of information concerning "carriers" (which transport ground troops or fighters) has been adressed on the game's Steam forum, and it has been promised to be resolved in a patch, soon.\n\nThe problem of pricing is a legitimate one. It is advertised as CAN$ 44 and I bought it at its reduced launch-price of $ 33, which some customers might still consider too high.  A valid point. If the game's developers have made a pricing mistake, they will have to re-evaluate. It is not for me to say, especially since I can afford to buy both 'Falling Stars' and 'Stellaris'.\n\nBut to come back to my very first point: those two games cannot be fairly compared. I will eventually play both games, depending on my mood and on the time I have. I predict that 'Stellaris' will be more time-consuming, and I am not always in the mood to manage complicated pieces of software.\n\nSomewhat between those games, in terms of complexity, is the remake of 'Master of Orion' -- which I love to play for nostalgia's sake. If you have the cash at hand, I recommend the three of them, and also, 'Offworld Trading Company'. In the end, it is a question of mood and of available time for gaming. Each Steam customer has his own equation concerning those gaming parameters, but if you have the cash, what the L : purchase all of them :))","April 29","true","5.5"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

It's a 4x "lite" game, which isn't a bad thing. You can jump right into a quick game on default settings or make the map much bigger for longer, more drawn out games. There are plenty of start up options to choose from. The AI seems very competent and I've lost more matches than I have won so far. The developer has already released the first patch and another one is on the way in a day or two. They take feedback well and have been active on the forums. I've had bug or two, but was immediately contacted so they could take a look at the log files. I know some have complained about the UI, but I find it very easy to learn and utilize. If you are looking for a space - 4x lite - type game you can tailor to a quick 30 minute game or expand to a much longer game, give FS: WOE a look. I have no doubt it's going get better and better. There are some youtube videos you should check out if you are on the fence.","May 1","true","3.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I was passing on this one from the early reviews.  I think the early reviews got this game  wrong.  People really need to play the game before they write a review.  The fact they allow us to download and play the game before we purchase should be pointed out and says a lot to me.  This is a great 4X strategy game that I can play without a life comment.\n\nThings I didn't like was the inital price, at $40.00 it was to high.  The new price of $20.00 makes it more then worth the purchase price.  I must say its the first time I have really see a designer listen to the public.  I read that some feel this game is like Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium board game but I do not think it a clone.  I play the board game a bit and its more different then the same to me.  For one you have more fleet ship types and options.  Over all the game strategy is different and I mean that in a good way.\n\n\nMy other real issue was the Fleets not showing what items I had on what fleets.  How that got past playtesting is beyond me.  The first patch was out quickly and really corrected this problem and added a few other bonuses to the game.  The manual is a little light but the tutorial was straight and to the point.  They need to update the tutorial so it shows better how the fleets now work.\n\nI can highly reccomend this game and think any Straetgy 4X or empire building fan will really enjoy this one.\n\n","May 1","true","18.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Falling Stars is a great bridge.  It allows me to enjoy the feeling of playing a complex board game even when I don't have friends over for a game night.  Beautiful and extremely intuitive for those who play Twilight Imperium.","May 2","true","1.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

I think the thing I like most about this game is that they managed to layer in really deep strategy with quicker gameplay.  My main gripe was how fast battles were over, but they seem to be working on that in patch 2.  The synergy between the various strategic actions, diplomacy, barters, tactical actions, etc makes every game unique, which is refreshing.\n\nI simply don't have time to spend 40 hours on a single match of a game, so it's nice to just hop in and play a quick and challenging match.","May 2","true","0.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Falling Stars: War of Empires  is a fun game and I've put I believe 5 hrs into it  now so if they keep updating it , it will be a extremely fun game more then it already is. They have some bugs which they seem to have already addressed so I guess I do not have to worry about it being bugged forever. I find it enjoyable and fun and after the tutorial (which is straight foward might I add) and a couple of rounds under your belt you will to, the mechanics and tech builds are fun and easy to do. Especially when you  know a bunch and can just make a plan in your head. Combats fun and after the tutorial  I encourage you to buy it and play it get some fun out it for yourself as I have and will in the future.","April 28","true","5.1"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","38","10","26","4","0"
