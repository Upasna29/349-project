One of the best, most charmingly clever, point & click titles I've ever played, a masterpiece of a game. The rustic hand drawn graphics are genuinely exquisite and really help disguise the click areas of this game. Features a really touching twisted fate mecha-folkstory, of a young robot living in a steam-punk dystopian wasteland, trying to save an enslaved princess robot. The only dialog between the characters are small animated scenes inside thought bubbles, which I think is a cool way to help tell a story without literal or verbal ques. The music is beautiful, very original and thought provoking, it really helped set the tone. You'll come across the occasional puzzle here and there and they're are some tough ones, but none are too frustrating. Unlike many titles in this genre, Machinarium consistently had me at an "aHa!" moment, great game 10/10","December 3, 2013","true","0.9"," 121 of 139 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","121","139","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/40700/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4903 products in account","Machinarium is unique in so many ways, which makes it difficult to write about. It's also one of those games that is best experienced firsthand rather than after reading a spoiler-ridden review. As much as I'd like to lecture on about something that impacted me so greatly, I'm left with very little to work with; but what's there to discuss paints a picture of a masterpiece.\n\nVisually, Machinarium takes a Victorian children's book illustration style and blends it with dystopian psuedo-steampunk imagery. It's not only as striking as that description suggests but it adds layer upon layer to the gameplay and storyline. Characters and scenes are beautifully hand-drawn and painstakingly animated to bring life to the citizens of the eponymous metropolis. When I say life, I mean it metaphorically as the cast are entirely robotic; their endearing movements and actions convince you that they're genuine creatures, acting out of circuitry or as puppets.\n\nThe whole game is a juxtaposition. The pure and sweet protagonist stands brightly against the grim, dank underbelly of the city whilst the dark despair of obsolescence and helplessness is often paired with love and hope. There's a great story to be discovered without ever uttering a single word, written or spoken. That alone is a remarkable feat but the characters you meet along the way are just as impressively fleshed. From the musical troupe in need of new instruments to the brutish and bullying pair that serve as antagonists; so many moments will ring in your mind when you reminisce years later, which is a powerful statement.\n\nI don't personally enjoy point and click adventures very often as I find they can sometimes be generic, predictable and require great leaps in logic. There are always exceptions, especially when it comes to LucasArts game, but lumping Machinarium into that category does little to help explain just why it's something every gamer should experience. It's on a par with the bests but ultimately nothing like them except in some key ingredients. The puzzles are frequent and never bordering on torturous like say 7th Guest, but they will certainly test you at times. It's a story-focused experience without sacrificing those times where you need to take a step back and hope for a eureka moment.\n\nThere are moments where I wish you could walk across scenes a little faster, but the protagonist's gentle hobbling is endearing and easily forgiven. Puzzles that prove an irritation are quickly overshadowed by the sheer genius of the next. I'd have liked less of the retro-gaming elements but that comes down purely to preference. I can raise minor criticisms but there are no dealbreakers, nothing that will make distract from how compelling it becomes to see through Josef's quest to reunite with his girlfriend. What Machinarium does, it does extremely well.\n\nAs with many games of the genre, it's a fairly brief journey, clocking in at around two hours if you're adept. It's not the longest game by any means and the ending is abrupt and slightly underwhelming but it manages not to overstay its welcome. The brevity does nothing to impact a powerful tale that had me smiling at several moments; you can put a value on the length of a game but it's much harder to put a value on something that makes you feel.","April 22, 2015","true","6.7"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","50","56","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBnBB/recommended/40700/","nBnBB","[nBn] Beebs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBnBB/","175 products in account","Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure game in the old fashion of "click inventory items against everything on screen until it works". You play the role of a tiny little robot dude whose first task is to rebuild his body, having been unceremoniously dumped into a junkyard.\n\nThe story is told without any words, instead using the charming artstyle and clever worldbuilding to convey what's happening. It's a risky venture, especially in story-driven games like these, but Machinarium pulls it off very well; Little Robot Dude's attempts to sneak back into the city are easy to follow and very cute.\n\nSome of the puzzles can be somewhat obtuse, as is the norm for adventure games, which may put off some players, but there is a hint system built into every puzzle which lets Dude give his own insight on the solution. For times when this doesn't suffice, a short walkthrough can be unlocked with some skill at a minigame, which will give the player a storybook guide on what to do next. The wordless presentation makes Machniarum a game that can be enjoyed by all-comers of any language, age, or skill with words.\n\nFinally, the Robot Street Band's performance will stay with you forever.","December 28, 2015","true","8.4"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","38","39","6","0"

A robot that has been abandoned by his city in pieces must pull himself together and return to not only confront some rather bad robots, but save his robot girlfriend in the process.\n\nThe Good\nThe first thing I noticed about Machinarium, as a first impression, is the music.  The soundtrack by Czech composer Tomáš Dvořák[floex.cz] really stands out in the task of impressing a strange new world without alienating the player from what they are engaged in.\n\nGraphically, the art style for Machinarium is quite striking, with hand-drawn animation hauntingly evocative of works by surrealist Jan Švankmajer, and seeming to be another achievement for Dvorský that fans of Amatina Design will be encouraged to see.  With their pencil-and-paper 'living comic' art style, the organic appearance of the background and characters helps to round out the artificial world with a warm and almost human sense, which helps the player to get involved with the characters quite readily.\n\nFor an adventure game without dialogue at all, the plot is quite memorable and involving, with the characters having both impact and personality.  By removing dialogue from the game, the designers also allow the game to be accessible to players who do not speak English, using thought bubbles and pictures, authentic instruments and short beeps or buzzes to illustrate what characters are thinking or asking.\n\nPuzzles throughout the game are both thought-provoking and challenging, sometimes requiring the player to think outside the box to complete tasks without pushing for weird feats of skewed logic present in some games of the genre.  Should the game prove to be too much of a bother, an in-built 'hint' system allows players to get some suggestions to how they can complete the task.\n\nThe Bad\nFor some players, the puzzles will be a bit too challenging, though thankfully a short minigame can help to unlock the puzzles if you are more of a mind to do a reflexive shooter than a point-and-click puzzle solve.\n\nSome players have reported having issues with transferring the game from fullscreen to windowed mode, though this seems to be more of a UI confusion than a bug issue.\n\nThe Ugly\nNone to speak of.\n\nSuggestions\nTurn out the lights and enjoy the immersive, imaginative world.\n\nThe Summary\nWell deserving of the awards it has recieved, Machinarium is a beautiful game with something special for art and music lovers, as well as fans of the point-and-click puzzle genre.  10/10.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 4, 2015","true","14.3"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","43","47","3","2"

If you like a good adventure game with lots of things to explore, some hard puzzles and beautiful artwork, then Machinarium is your game.\n\nWithout a single spoken word the story line is set very well in a world where machines have feeling too. The ambiance is amazing and the puzzles very original. You just gotta love the main character and the creative ways he finds to defeat the bad guys. The humor in the game is great too.\n\nFor me this game could have lasted for several hours (days, weeks!) more, without ever boring me. The game also offers a unique hint system, so there's no need to search the internet to be able to advance in case you're stuck. I recommend not using it too often though, because the game is much more fun by solving everything yourself.\n\nIf machines ever take over the world, I sure hope this is what it will look like. The downside? Maybe the fact that there's no Steam achievements. Really can't think of anything else.

It's a point-and-click adventure game about Machinarium - an ancient city of robots. You take control of Joseph, a robot thrown out of the city and dumped for untold reasons, and you'll lead him trough hours of great drawing and animations, story great yet simply told and soundtrack that you just have to love and admire as he makes his way back to the top, rescues his "girlfriend" Bertha, saves the city and escapes from it.\n\nPoint-and-click adventures are highly relying on their story, yet this game doesn't feature a single line of text (exception to main menu and credits). Instead, it explains it with simple comics which appear in classical speech bubbles. This adds to a feeling of really being a robotic being that doesn't need any words to explain it's thoughts, even though I don't believe the creation such a feeling would be truly intentional in it's nature.\n\nThe gameplay is simple as well, featuring locations with several puzzles and riddles you need to complete in order to advance further trough the city and the story. However, they aren't in any way dumb or repetetive, and can provide several hours of fun for those who enjoy solving these. And if you don't, the game always has a helpful guide for the location you can unlock trough fulfilling a simple minigame.\n\nThe graphics and design are the most awesome things about this game, providing you with beautiful sceneries, impecable characters and detailed drawings of the city and it's parts all along your path to the top. The city looks industrial and mechanical, creating a kind of a depressing feeling, with rust and metal pipes everywhere. The graphics are a true art, and that is not a statment I make lightly. Same of course goes for the soundtrack, so get ready to stay looking at the scenery and listening to a music, balancing at the edge of falling into depression or starting maniacally laughing. The feel is something many "horror games" of today miss - and yet this game doesn't even have to try to achieve it.\n\nSo my recommendation is simple - Go for it.","August 23, 2014","true","15.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

The puzzles themselves were often convoluted and some just outright infuriated me when I found out what you had to do to solve them. If I had not been so invested in this adorable little robot and watching him move around this world my game time would have ended after about 45 minutes.\n\nIf you love what you see in the screenshots, and are not totally averse to the Point and Click genre then I think there’s a ton of enjoyment to be had with Machinarium. However, if you find this genre of game insufferable or don’t find the same charm in the art that I do, then steer clear because there’s nothing here that you’re not expecting.","November 24, 2014","true","7.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Machinarium is no exception.\n\nThe game is set in a strange world, where cyberpunk-style city slums and rust heaps meet very friendly, children’s storybook-like character design and story structure. Even the story is childishly simple, from a certain degree: you are a little “boy” who must save his girlfriend from a band of good-for-nothing hoodlums. These bullies not only managed to throw him out of the city after hurting his mentor(?), but also plan to cause further havoc among the peace-loving citizens.\n\nMachinarium has an interesting difficulty curve. Initially, all scenes are self-contained puzzles, but after a while it switches to traditional point ‘n’ click format. You suddenly have a somewhat decent-sized city to search for items you can use, but it won’t be easy. The world is quite alien despite the somewhat human-like elements, and there are no descriptions anywhere. This can make identifying objects quite tricky sometimes, so prepare to resort to some brute force trial and error.\n\nDespite the difficulty, the game is surprisingly short; if you start it up again knowing all the solutions, you can enjoy the full story in about two hours. As an Anamita game this length is pretty much expected, and you can know that you get a sweet, fun and charming little gem– with a memorable soundtrack– for your money.","August 31, 2015","true","4.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

A sombre meander through a beautifully stylized, decaying robotic and alien world.\n\nHighlights\nThe reason Machinarium works so well is that it's very simple, what would normally be a flat flash game has been given life with tone, interaction, soundtrack and art style all marrying together to create a truly solid little game.\n\n* The lack of dialogue and the fantastic sound and music, when placed together with the rustic, dystopian art really give the world a strong but still alien character to the world and make you want to explore and see more of it\n* Little detailed works like the mini-games for hints add a fun layer of light wonder\n\nMistakes\n* Genuinely none that take away from the game other than perhaps a lacklustre ending\n\nRecommendations\nPlay time clocks in at 5 hours, and there are better indie titles out there for less than Machinarium, and with more replay value, of which Machinarium has very little, but at £7.49/8.49€/$9.99, it's still a reasonably priced and is a good buy when on sale.\n\nThere's also an Amanita Collection, which matches the prices of the separate games, but adds the value of the Machinarium soundtrack for free, but since it's soothing and ambient, but not a particularly amazing soundtrack, buying the titles separately is going to be the better choice for most.\n\n* There's a free demo available on the store page\n* You can play Samorost (a previous flash title by Amanita) on their website for free[amanita-design.net]\n* [spoler]The bricks with the spiders in the hint-book sometimes spell out the word rebol..[/spoiler] ..if you type "rebol" on the start screen you will gain access to a developer menu where you can select all levels and access all items\n* There's was a limited edition Machinarium Fan Edition[forum.amanita-design.net] which may still be available on Amazon\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/40700","June 1, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A sombre meander through a beautifully stylized, decaying robotic and alien world.\n\nHighlights\nThe reason Machinarium works so well is that it's very simple, what would normally be a flat flash game has been given life with tone, interaction, soundtrack and art style all marrying together to create a truly solid little game.\n\n* The lack of dialogue and the fantastic sound and music, when placed together with the rustic, dystopian art really give the world a strong but still alien character to the world and make you want to explore and see more of it\n* Little detailed works like the mini-games for hints add a fun layer of light wonder\n\nMistakes\n* Genuinely none that take away from the game other than perhaps a lacklustre ending\n\nRecommendations\nPlay time clocks in at 5 hours, and there are better indie titles out there for less than Machinarium, and with more replay value, of which Machinarium has very little, but at £7.49/8.49€/$9.99, it's still a reasonably priced and is a good buy when on sale.\n\nThere's also an Amanita Collection, which matches the prices of the separate games, but adds the value of the Machinarium soundtrack for free, but since it's soothing and ambient, but not a particularly amazing soundtrack, buying the titles separately is going to be the better choice for most.\n\n* There's a free demo available on the store page\n* You can play Samorost (a previous flash title by Amanita) on their website for free[amanita-design.net]\n* [spoler]The bricks with the spiders in the hint-book sometimes spell out the word rebol..[/spoiler] ..if you type "rebol" on the start screen you will gain access to a developer menu where you can select all levels and access all items\n* There's was a limited edition Machinarium Fan Edition[forum.amanita-design.net] which may still be available on Amazon\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/40700","June 1, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game's creepy but also eerily beautiful art sets it apart from other games and makes it a totally unique and engrossing experience. The difficulty is well balanced; challenging but completely doable.\n\nPros:\n+Beautiful art that really takes you into another world. The paintings in this game have so much character. Together with the music it feels deeply atmospheric and it's a great experience.\n+Nice soundtrack that fits perfectly with the game.\n+Excellent gameplay. Great puzzles with the perfect difficulty; challenging enough that I was racking my brains but not impossible. Occasional minigames also enhance the experience.\n+A simple story that, through the atmosphere created by the art and music, is told beautifully and seamlessly.\n\nCons:\n-The game doesn't support right click, which would be a really nice way to let the player send items back to the inventory. Right now right clicking yeilds an "about Adobe Flash Player" tab, which slightly cheapens the look of the game, which is so beautiful otherwise.\n\nAs a side note it took me about 7 hours to beat the game.\n\nThis game is so perfect, so beautiful, that there's no reason why anyone on Earth shouldn't experience it for themselves. I can't stress it enough; this is really one that you have to play to experience.","February 24","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It wraps all this up in an immersive world of decrepit technology and cute little sentient robots.  One thing that works well in this game is the complete absence of dialog.  And I don't mean just spoken dialog - there is no spoken or written language at all.  The story and game progression is communicated through hand drawn diagrams and trail and error.  The game is entirely in flash, so your controls are usually limited to left mouse button and mouse movement.  Although, the game has a built in hint system comprised of a very short SHMUP sequence that allows you to use the keyboard.  Strangely an end game action sequence forced me to use mouse control which was the only real point where I experienced significant frustration while playing the game.\n\nOverall, this game is easy to recommend even at full price.  The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating and the pace of self discovery is excellent for a point and click game.  The art style really makes you feel like you are discovering a new world, and invites you to participate in it with its quirky characters.","January 10, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Machinarium doesn't pull its punches. It's unabashedly old-school tough, and there are many moments where the adventure can come grinding to a halt while you spend a solid hour agonizing over what random widget needs to be fitted where. Even so, the puzzles littering this troubled mechanical realm are astoundingly designed. The game also sports one of the coolest hint systems we’ve ever encountered. You have to play a side-scrolling shooter mini-game each time you want to unlock the tome that contains elaborate hand-drawn sketches detailing how to attack the tougher puzzles in a given level.Helping a robotic jazz band repair their damaged instruments so they can jam out again, racking up a high score in a pedal bike-powered arcade to gather money for a vending machine, and distilling sunflower seed oil to fix an old-timer’s rusty joints are only a few of the myriad tasks you’ll accomplish en-route to saving the city. Many of the game’s challenges are multi-step affairs that require a mixture of exploration, item hunting, and straight-up puzzle solving.Machinarium’s distinct visual style and seamless animations are etched with a staggering level of detail, and few games come close to possessing the sheer beauty found here. Each setting and the peculiar robotic characters populating this futuristic land is brimming with dark personality. Seeing how different areas of the game, the characters, and the plot itself connect in surprising, circular ways makes the journey all the more wondrous. Even if adventure games aren’t your bag, you’d be remiss to pass up giving this one a spin. It might just change your mind.","February 15, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Normally I'm not a fan of point and click adventure games but Machinarium has sold me on the idea of them. Great art design, captivating world, and imersive story that unfolds without even a single word being spoken all build something greater than the sum of their parts. If you like point and click adventure games Machinarium will make a great addition to your collection; If you don't it might just change your mind.","November 3, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamerVel/recommended/40700/","GamerVel","Vel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamerVel/","461 products in account","A product from an indie studio, Machinarium is an adventure game and is suitable for Gamers aged 8+.\n\nTo start, the gameplay is subtle and can be played easily. The graphics presented are mostly clear and clean in appearance while clues are hidden as a slightly visible easter egg in each scene, typical of an adventure game.\n\nA clean crisp sound of robotic sound effects was immediately noticed and was pleasant. On the eardrums, the musical score was sweet and velvety. Neither overpowered the other making for an enjoyable sound track that gently caressed the inner ear like a lovers whisper.\n\nThe mini puzzles could be a bit challenging, but nothing the average gamer couldn't finagle their way through. The mini games were a throwback to the 80's, when a young gamer could spend hours in front of classics such as Space Invaders or Adventure.\n\nOverall, Machinarium performed perfectly and would easily be considered an adventure game classic.\n\nSCORE -  8/10","July 28, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The puzzles are not too difficult, and fairly logical... you rarely have that awful adventure-game experience where you're moving from room to room, clicking on random stuff, trying to get lucky. The game starts you out slow - one room, one puzzle, and gradually works you up to several rooms with several simultaneous puzzles.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is very good... a little robot exploring a run-down robot city. And the sound is fantastic, with a variety of full-length songs and themes for each area you explore.\n\nThere's very little not to like, here. The length of this game is about 6-8 hours. Maybe a little less if you're an adventure game junkie. Overall, Machinarium is a finely-tuned gem.","September 14, 2011","true",""," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It draws you in with a well done sound track and surprisingly good character development. The puzzles range from relatively simple to fairly complex. The help system is a nice addition, as the developers must have realized that if people got stuck they would just go to the internet. Although being able to get hints before the solution would have been preferred. The penalty for looking at the solution is taking the time to play a short mini game, which is much better than other games simply having a countdown timer. The length decent, it tells it's story without rushing or overstaying it's bounds.  Simply put, I absolutely adore this game and would recommend it to anyone.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeAvybtuos4","December 5, 2013","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Combined with a perfect atmosphere, you'll easily be immersed in the mechanical world.\n\nAs far as how it plays, you do actually walk around and, when you find useful objects in the environment and click on them, you will either use them or eat them, which places them into your inventory to be used later. You can also stretch yourself vertically and will need to utilize that ability to solve certain puzzles. While there is some hidden object, the game is light on it; it's more a puzzle adventure and figuring out what you need to do on a few screens at a time to progress. A good variety of puzzle types and minigames. Sketch hints available if you're stumped. Highly recommended.","January 29, 2012","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The adventure starts with you laying in a scrapheap figuring out how to piece yourself together. And once you get past that little puzzle, you quickly realise this is not an easy game... The puzzles are definitely more inline with the difficultly of the 16bit area of video gaming, not that it is a bad thing thing. The difficulty of the game naturally fits in with the aesthetics of the art, one can spend so long on certain puzzles, it gives plenty of time to admire the sheer beauty of the hand drawn art. The puzzles are creative and fresh, with a strong touch of quirkiness and humour with every completion. The music is easy on the ears and integrates with the games deep atmosphere. My criticisms of Machinarium would be that pointer can be a little imprecise, also if you move Josef while he is in tall or shot form, he hobbles along at a tedious pace. And the game does not offer any video settings, on certain monitors it can appear 'boxed'. Besides these minor setbacks, Machinarium is a beautiful work of art and a solid puzzle game full of humour, unique surprises and character. I strongly recommend this one.","December 21, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You must guide an adorable robot through many puzzle rooms, done in the point-and-click style of nineties game companies like Sierra. Now the puzzles themselves get far trickier than King's Quest, and have much more in common with the 7th Guest, Safecracker and Professor Layton. This makes some of the rooms feel more like an IQ test, or maybe even a Mensa entrance exam, as you reconstruct entire tangled mazes and play around with lighter physics. Unfortunately it carries the same curse that all point-and-clicks do, meaning some "pixel hunting" and some seemingly random answers here and there. You might have to have Google handy to look up some of the harder solutions. But all in all Machinarium is a charming game for the puzzle minded, and while cheap on Steam is often sold in the famous "Humble Indie Bundles" elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.","April 23, 2012","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Decided to finally get around to trying it.  The art style is very cute, and for the most part fits the environment well.  Unfortunately, some of the puzzles are very nonsensical, which tends to happen with point and click type adventures such as this.  Also, the game is extremely finicky about where you can click to use certain things.  The game requires you to be standing in range of anything you can interact with, as opposed to being able to click on an item across screen and have your guy walk across to it.  This is especially frustrating when trying to use items, and you happen to not be standing in the specific spot required.\n\nThere are some small arcade type parts that do not really add or subtract from the experience.  A fan of puzzle type games may have more fun with this as opposed to a casual player.  I would have to recommend if you are a more casual player, to be ready to reference a walkthrough if needed to help with some of the more difficult combinations of items / puzzles.\n\nI'm going to say yes to recommending the game, but with reservations.

The artstyle appealed to me most, though. A rough and rusted metropolis serves as the backdrop for adorable, hand drawn robots, in an assortment of quirky shapes and sizes. The story is uniquely depicted in animated thought bubbles: You control Josef, a rickety, humanoid robot with the ability to change his height at will (dragging the mouse up or down) and swallow objects for use later. Josef must traverse the city of Machinarium to save his kidnapped girlfriend, Berta, and defeat the evil Black Cap Brotherhood.\n\nThe game certaintly isn't lacking in endearing characters or levels, nor can I fault its puzzles, which are challenging in their own way, and I do love that it includes several mini arcade games within the game for Josef to play. The riddles seem to alternate between the basic "untangle the red and black wires" and borderline bogus, which doesn't bother me personally but might be a turn off for some.\n\nBut unfortunately  ― although I would love to recommend the game, especially at such a reasonable price ― I cannot bring myself to leave a positive review.\n\nIt is extremely fiddly. Any point 'n' click veteran will be familiar with the click on every pixel with an inventory item until something just happens cliché but Machinarium's inventory is difficult to locate because it blends in with the game's black border, so a mouseover where you guess it's supposed to be while solving a riddle doesn't always work. This is awkward at best and frustrating at worst.\n\nThe muted colours make finding items that you can pick up potentially impossible and I generally found myself gliding the mouse across the screen until I discovered something interactable. The game is also never fullscreen, despite having the setting to change it. It's debatable whether the hints even count as hints, but that's a minor complaint compared to some of the aforementioned. As is the fact that Josef's animations when he's short or tall are far too slow. It's cute at first, but it gets annoying real quick.\n\nFinally, the save system DOES. NOT. WORK. If you frequently delete your cookies, use a program such as CCleaner to... well, clean up your computer after use, it will delete your save file and at no point does the game mention this. You have to play this in one sitting, keep backups of save files, or google workarounds for this but you should NOT have to and I refuse to recommend Machinarium because of it, as much as it breaks my heart not to.\n\ntl;dr\nshort & lovely point 'n' click with some mildly frustrating features that is ultimately ruined by its save system.","May 2","false","6.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

This adventure puzzle game doesn't just give you puzzles to complete, but a story line. The story line may not seem very present at first, but builds up into an interesting story as you learn more and more about the character you play. These puzzles can be challenging, but the game offers a nice way to get hints and if you are really bad it will give you a walk through right there in the game if you so choose. In addition to the the great gameplay this game has an amazin sound track. I found myself sitting in the plaza listing the band play their whole song before I moved on to the next room. I highly recommend buying this game!

I can't say the gameplay does much original; it's a standard point-and-click game with a few other puzzles thrown in the mix. The narrative isn't particularly unique either, though being told entirely without dialogue is perhaps an interesting spin on it. But the game world looks and sounds beautiful and the game has charm to it. The puzzles rarely get too obscure (or at least, as far as I can recall, since it's been a while since I touched this game). I can't really help but recall this one fondly, for whatever reason.

Worth playing just for the music alone. None of the puzzles are undoable, and are enjoyable to see play out. Some people have complained about the difficulty of figuring out the puzzles, but remember that as an animated game that it utilizes cartoon physics at times and require that you use your imagination to put together the solutions. The game can take 5-8 hours depending on your problem solving skills.\n\nThe weakest part of the game is the flat, sudden ending.

It starts ok (I did play the demo!), but then it becomes "click on everything ad nauseam until something works", which is the worst kind of point and click ever.\n- That alone wouldn't be that bad (I played a lot of those...), but the steps needed for each trial and error become incredibly annoying after a while.\nThe way the character walks slowly when you forget to put him back to "regular" size is adorable... the first hour.\n\nNow, IF you enjoy this kind of "click on random pixel hunt until something happens" games, you will love Machinarium and its really beautiful hand drawn environment.\n\nEDIT: I understand most people disagreeing with me; it's a truly beautiful game, and I see how people wouldn't find this "helpful", especially when helpful/not helpful is the only way Steam can allow us to like/dislike a review.

You play as a cute little robot in a point-and-click adventure with added puzzles like "move these pegs into a certain pattern" or "fill in all the lights on a grid" to help you progress to new areas of this robot-inhabited world and avoid/foil villainous robots.\n\nPros:\n+Good story, despite the lack of dialogue. Everything is done with thought bubbles and grunts and sounds instead of speech. Cute.\n+Interesting art. Hand-drawn feel with an interesting pallete of mostly brown with splashes of muted colors here and there. The variety of robot character designs is fantastic.\n+Wide variety of puzzles. Not just point and click, but logic and spatial reasoning puzzles, and you even get to play Space Invaders.\n\nCons:\n-There's no really good way of finding interactable items other than skimming the screen with your mouse. There were several puzzles I had to get a hint for (see below) simply because I didn't notice that tiny little item I was supposed to pick up because it was so well integrated with the art. Object highlighting in the art or a keyboard shortcut to highlight them would have greatly helped. Thus, for me, it was a steep learning curve trying to get a feel for the kinds of puzzles the designers were intending because the goal was obvious but the means of attaining that goal were obscure.\n-Only one pre-set hint per level, which means if you're stuck on a part that happens AFTER the hint, you're screwed. There's a way to unlock the entire solution, but it requires playing an annoying mini game first. The internet is faster, honestly.\n-The interface is annoying, as you can only interact with things within reach. You want to use this thing over there, so you grab it from your inventory and try to use it, but it's out of reach. Is there an easy way to put things back into your inventory? No, of course not! So then you've got to manually put it back in your inventory, which doesn't always pop up on mouseover and is hard to see because it's black, the same color as the border around the image, which is not fullscreen despite the settings. Then you've got to walk your guy over to the spot, hoping you're close enough this time, then get the item from your inventory AGAIN and use it. Very frustrating.\n-On a related note, there's also a mechanic where you can stretch your body up to get things high up, but sometimes you have to physically do it yourself, and other times (if it's close enough), it does it for you automatically. And if you accidentally start walking while you're stretched, God help you, because you walk around really, REALLY slowly that way, and it's hard to cancel out of a movement once it's initiated. There are ZERO puzzles where being tall while walking is needed, so the designers should have made it automatic to shrink down before attempting to walk and saved themselves some animation time and the players some frustration. And although the tutorial teaches you that you can be tall, it DOESN'T tell you that you can make yourself shorter, which is required for an early puzzle to reach an item I didn't even know could be accessed and looked like part of the background.\n\nOverall: 5/10\nIt may be worth it for the story and the actual puzzles themselves (the non-point-and-click variety), but the frustration and amount of cheating via the internet I had to do robbed me of the joy I should have had.","February 21","false","7.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/40700/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","That awkward moment when a good friend gifts you a game that you're just not that into.\n\nI first played this a few years ago, shortly after it was released and had a wealth of critical acclaim surrounding it, but made the difficult and uncharacteristic decision to abandon it half way through as it was bugging me way too much to be bothered with it anymore. A combination of grindingly slow pacing, tedious, unsatisfying puzzles and downright depressing atmosphere put me off it way too quickly. But after receiving it as a birthday present, I felt I owed it to both the game and my friend to give it another shot and play it through to its entirety. Unfortunately, all that did was further reinforce my opinion that this game really isn't for me.\n\nPlaying as a tiny, little robot, in a big, bad robot world, you'll point and click your way through sections of the city of Machinarium as you try to thwart the plans of a nasty gang of bullying, nogoodnik robots who've placed a bomb on the tower of your former place of residence... or workplace, it's hard to tell for sure. But apparently robots and their dwellings are pretty grim. Pretty much from top to bottom, everything feels dingy and bleak, like all hope is lost and everyone is now resigned to living a pitiful existence with no sign of ever getting better. Everything just felt so soul-crushingly oppressive and didn't make me want to stay a moment longer than I needed to, really not a good quality for a game.\n\nNormally dark tones in games don't bother me in the slightest, and if anything, really appeal to me. I felt right at home wandering the wastes of Fallout, or scavenging among the leftover detritus of humanity in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., but this just felt like too much even for me. At least Fallout has its dark humour laced throughout, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has its sense of mystery and vague suggestion that the outside world is a better place or people are building towards something better inside the disaster zone. But there's no such optimism here. It isn't even like it's a fictitious dystopia here, more like a way-too-close-to-reality feeling of dire finality and going through the motions. To their credit, the hand drawn art that makes up every part of the game is incredibly well done and feels like a real labour of love, like something much more personal that you don't get in other games. I just wish they had've chosen another direction for the aesthetics and made something less downbeat. Though I guess that's just going to come down to personal opinion more than anything.\n\nAside from the opening introduction to the controls, there isn't a single line of text or dialogue throughout the game, with everything expressed through animated speech/thought bubbles or observing cues from the world and the robots that fill it. But, again, this only adds to tone. The subdued, mood music and low-rumbling barks and grunts of every other character further drills home how morbid everything feels. Yeah, in case you didn't already get it, I think this game is grim. There's something about Eastern European developers that makes them way too good at capturing those feelings in a game, with a sense that some studios are almost in a race to try and outgrim one another. Well, this feels like it could be their crowning achievement. Yet, even had the overall mood of the game been different, that still wouldn't have helped my issues with the slow crawl of so many parts of the game, or the fact that most of the puzzles felt like a chore to do, either because of the execution once you knew the solution, or finding the solution itself... and then executing it.\n\nI'm a fan of the studio's other works, Botanicula and the Samorost games, and I look forward to more titles along those lines if more point and click games are what they're sticking with.

The art style looks like it was sketched with colored pencils, the protagonist is a cute little robot that stores items in his belly, and the story is told through little cartoons in thought bubbles. The only reason I can't recommend this game is its difficulty. Perhaps it was intended for veteran point-and-click gamers but I found many of the puzzles to be difficult and confusing. Luckily, the developers decided to included hint for each level in the form of a cartoon bubble to help you understand what your primary goal is in each level. Unfortunately, most of the time I had no idea of how to get to that goal with whatever was placed before me in the level. The developers also included a walk-through for each level in the form of a book which you can unlock by playing a mini-game. The walk-through helps a lot but I found myself turning to its guidance for most of the levels (especially later in the game). It may have just been difficult for me but I don't want to continue playing a game where I constantly have to be taught how to play the game. That being said, you can tell that a lot of heart and soul went into this game. So if you're in to point-and-clicks, you might give this one a try.","May 24, 2015","false","4.0"," 8 of 30 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","8","30","0","0"

Unless the object you want to pick up is in the character's reach, there's no indication that the object is even something you can pick up. Not sure if it's because the game is made with Flash.\n\nThe puzzles were mostly logical although some of them had a trial-and-error aspect. Hardest part of the puzzles was actually finding the items needed. There were a few quite challenging puzzles too. The game has an in-game walkthrough, but it requires you to play a mini-game every time you want to access it. Also the NPCs give some hints about the needed items when you "talk" to them.\n\nI found the story to be uninteresting even though it's told without words and is open for interpretation. Basically you're shown thought bubbles, which show a "flashback" of an event that happened. The story just didn't feel any fresh and it didn't make me care for the characters at all. Quite many people seem to find the plot great, which I find weird, because the plot is very generic. You can find similar plots in many other games as well as in many movies.\n\nI probably belong in the minority with my opinion about this game as I now think that it's overrated. It has a pretty nice art style and fairly good puzzles, but it still has somewhat clunky mechanics and a bland story. In my opinion Machinarium is just an average game and nothing more. I also managed to delete my save twice by using CCleaner, which cleared Flash cache.","December 4, 2013","false","4.0"," 7 of 29 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","7","29","0","1"

I'm severely neutral about this game, which is a shame given how enjoyable its atmoshpere is.  It is a pretty game, with an interesting touch of characterization on your little gizmo.  There are two reasons why I can't quite reccomend this game though, and while they don't make the game bad it definitely makes it worth less than the 10 USD price.\n\nFirst is a more personal peeve, it's made to immitate old-school point and click adventures in that there's a thread of logic that usually makes sense in the game world but doesn't if the immersion is broken.  That thread of how to progress can feel arbitrary, like the developers have contrived a reason why you can't just do a simple solution here, or why this device's switch is in a nigh-unaccesible alcove.  And that adventure game logic has always peeved me, but it's perfectly fine so long as you're immersed.\n\nAaaaand that's the two of it: the immersion.  This game has a great soundtrack and needs it, because the gameplay is far from enough to pull (in my experience) the player in.  The tokenism and the obviously contrived puzzles are a big part of it, which encourages players to click around looking for what can and can't be used, but the other part is a bit more subtle.  Your character's competency changes, and that always pulls me out of a game.  Sometimes your character (Read: the game) will do something automatically that in a less-padded puzzle would have required you to hunt for an inventory item to do.  So occasionally I'm looking for what I believe is the last piece and then when I can't find it just rub my inventory against itself and give birth to progress.  That, or the gizmo guy can squeeze into or stretch to reach something that in a previous puzzle would not have been possible.\n\nTwo faults, yes, and two major ones that the 10 USD price cannot afford to have.","October 2, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 20 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","3","20","0","0"

Why are these robots gendered, anyway? Probably the same reason they still have human religions! Incidentally, that was my favorite part of the game. Cute, funny, clever, refreshingly inoffensive, and a good puzzle to boot. At least this review is ending on a positive note.","July 7, 2014","false","8.1"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","18","0","0"

That's where the good stuff ends. The puzzles are convoluted and excessive; because hey, why do a puzzle once when you can do it four times? The character you control is painfully slow at moving around and it takes a good 10 or 20 seconds just to move from area to area. Every scene has annoying ambience that endlessly loops. I ended up turning the sound off  because I was so sick of the bloody noise. There are several points where you have to twist your mouse about awkwardly to do stuff; eg turning a wheel. Rather than just moving the wheel with the cursor, you have to circle around it twenty times. The worst point came when there was a puzzle that demanded that you flicked the mouse up and down really quickly. It took me twenty minutes to get the damn thing to work and I had to switch to a different mouse because the puzzle was so broken. The game is frustrating and tedious. I can understand why people would enjoy the story and interesting world it takes place in but the gameplay is more stressful than fun.","April 20, 2014","false","6.4"," 9 of 34 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","9","34","0","0"

A genre that by now only lives in the indie development scene. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is still up for debate.\n\nYou play as a little lovable robot that seems to have been made out of mostly trash. As an entirely mute protagonist, as are every character in the game, mute that is, you experience the entirety of the storyline through little memory bubbles that pop every now and then to explain your connection to a particular item or individual. You may or may not understand them however.\n\nGameplay is entirely point and click. You click on an object in the world to interact with it and on occasion pick it up. Items you collect can be used to interact with those same objects and occasionally can be combined with other collected items to form a new object. It is all very tried and true having been done this way for ages. Unfortunately Machinarium always keeps around some the failings of this genre. Many times you will find that you have to interact with a very specific part of a larger object with no discernible way to see which small place on the screen you have to click to make it work. The logic of the various puzzles, in true point and click fashion, marches to it's own drummer and if you approach the puzzles without being able to adopt this often bizarre method of thinking you will find your stumped quite often.\n\nMachinarium is quite a pretty game, despite being made entirely in flash it manages to produce a beautiful steampunkish environment that is very pleasing to the eye. Being made in flash however means that the occasional accidental right click can often ruin your day.\n\nAll in all Machinarium is a fun little game if you're a fan of adventure point and clicks. It is however not a game that stands out in the genre or makes any attempt at even being playable for someone that is not a fan of the genre already.","December 24, 2012","false","20.2"," 20 of 59 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","20","59","0","0"

But when it comes to this one, I can't recommend it.\n\nThe art style makes everything extremely difficult to make out one item from another. Somethimes they hvae a VERY subtle glow, but even that isn't hepful. The game mechanics are interesting to say the least. You can only interact with things in your reach, and you can extend or retract your robots body to add height-specific puzzle solving. My complaints with the height changing are extremely lengthy. My main issue with it, is the walking speed. There's time sensitive puzzles you have to do early on in the game. And if you forget to retract your body (or raise it) you end up walking extremely slow. Lo and behold, you find yourself hobbling back to the original point of interest to restart the puzzle.\n\nThe game does a terrible job of explaining anything to you, and the controls often feel clunky. Though the game is fun for a little bit, it finds itself repeated quite quickly.\n\nIf point-and-click adventure games are your thing, I recommend anything but this game. It wore me out to the point where I don't even want to play any of the other games that do what this is trying to do, better.\n\nThe normal price is $9.99 but is 65% off for $3.49 during the winter sale. I can't say it's a waste of money, because it's inexpensive and after an hour or so (give or take based on preference) pays for itself. If you can avoid buying it for full price but still want to pick it up, it's better to get it on sale, or wait for one. Otherwise, I don't feel it's really worth the trouble for $10 (or regional equal to USD)","December 23, 2013","false","0.6"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","5","25","0","0"

Mostly because if the puzzles and controls aren't perfect then you can waste alot of time trying to find a solution that you already found. For example, an early puzzle invoules putting something on some train tracks. This was the very last step of the puzzle, and I spent maybe 5 minutes putting this thing on the tracks, trying to solve the puzzle, and having it fail. After many annoyed clicks I discovered that if you lower your mouse down to the other side of the tracks you can put it there. The problem is the click box for the wrong side of the tracks was so big, that you would assume that that is all you could do with it. Suffice it to say, I was very annoyed at this. I played through, and figured that was an one off event.\n\nIn the very next screen I figure out the puzzle in a reasonable amount of time, but the very last step was bugged. As in I would click on the thing, and it wouldn't work. After maybe 10 minutes of cursing at it, I quit out of the game, and come back to it the next day. The exact same action I was trying to do before works the first time. It was just that the game wasn't reading my clicks correctly.\n\nOn the very next screen, I get stuck again. This time because the puzzle wanted me to stand if a very exact spot for it to work. After reading a walk through, and finding out that I was doing the right thing, I tried different spots and quickly was able to continue.\n\nI play the game for about another 45 minutes until I run into the same bug of the game not reading my clicks. At this point I've had enough of the game.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but the fact that the game could ruin the experience in many different ways put me off in a very bad way.","December 26, 2013","false","1.3"," 1 of 16 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","16","0","0"

Has a couple of action game puzzles - space invaders, and an annoying little room crawl shooting 33 little baddies, and a timed puzzle that really doesn't seem to give you enough time - I prefer my puzzle games in the Myst tradition of having no urgency aside from that driven by plot concerns, since it's a puzzle game and thus designed to be cryptic, and non violent.  Also, its a flash game, and thus much more limited in its interface than most games for sale these days.\n\nIt was, at times, amusing and perhaps a little charming, but for maybe 5 hours of gameplay (significantly less if you're not missing clues along the way - most of my 3.3 hours of playtime was a wild goose chase trying to figure out which screen this particular oddity in my inventory was for.

Did I have $10 worth of fun?  No.  I picked it up during a holiday sale for 2.49, and that might be worthwhile.  No replay value to speak of - as you might expect, the puzzles don't change, and I didn't get invested in the characters enough to want to replay for the story, like I did with Myst and Portal (perhaps unfair to compare this game to those, though, given that they're abnormally good games.)","January 24, 2014","false","3.3"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","23","0","0"

I am not normally into Point & Click or Adventure style games, but this one really is a cut above the rest.\n\nThe art and style of the game is really interesting and unique. It also doesnt try to be too obvious with all of the objects and clues, but it does have them. Its style and the world created by the visuals really gives the game some depth and character. The areas are varied and unique, but still remaining cohesive. My only possible complaint with art & visuals is that I wish it would fully scale & stretch up to 1080P, but with the way the game is designed and with the way the game's art is made, I understand and accept why it doesnt.\n\nThe music is very good. It fits the areas in the game very well and gives it so much personality. All of the tracks are long enough and are composed in a way that wont become grating on your nerves, even if you get stuck or stumped by a puzzle for a very long time.  one of my favorite soundtracks I've heard recently.\n\nThe puzzles are all well designed, and they tend to be fair and dont fall into the trope of being needlessly obtuse in the illusion of being "challenging." The difficulty progression of the puzzles is fairly gradual and it tries really hard to teach the player its style and how you should be approaching each puzzle as you go. Only a few of them really took me a while to figure out and even if you get stuck: theres in-game hints and when you are 100% stumped: it has an unlockable walkthrough (you have to do a mini side-scrolling shooter to open it up) and the walkthrough doesnt completely spoil the puzzles.","December 1, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For now, general information\n\nThe Good --\n- Good Aesthetic -- It looks nice, and it creates a very mellow atmosphere. The art style fits well.\n- Intersting puzzles -- The puzzles are fun and challanging, with only a few that I would call bad\n- Interesting story -- The narrative of the game is fun, interesting, and fairly light hearted. It's also kid friendly\n- Good Hint system -- Both hint systems in the game are good in their own right.\nThe Bad -- (mostly nitpicking)\n- Same old adventure game problems -- has many of the problems old adventure games had\n- Some puzzles have odd solutions, goals can be a bit random, trial and error, and backtracking a thing you missed.\n- Some puzzles are hard to contextualize -- making the sequence of events occur correctly to get something can be tedious and hard to figure out. Not in a logistical way, more in a, "how was i supposed to know the object would do that?" way.\n- No verbal communication can mean confusion as to what the game wants, which forces you to use both hint systems.\n- Moving some objects will force you to follow through with the action. When you misclick, this can mean waiting 40 or so seconds before you can do what you were supposed to do. In a few cases, this would also reset a puzzle and force you to do it again.\n- Some of the background noises grate on the ears a bit. Not a game i would recommend with headphones on.\n- The controls are much more fitting a touchpad then a PC\n\n\nFull thoughts --\n\nThis game was fun. Not the best thing I've ever played, and certainly nothing new. The art design is interesting, but everything else has been seen and done before. This isn't a bad thing, however, as the game delivers on what it promises. It's a puzzle game with no verbal feedback.\n\nThe story is simple; you solve puzzles, move forward, and right the wrongs brought about by some bullies. You save a girl you know, and help the citizens who are bummed for one reason or another. It's a simple story, especially by adventure game standards, but it delivers on some really good puzzles and explaining everything without a word of spoken dialogue.\n\nThe gameplay is point and click gameplay combined with puzzle solving. It's fairly standard and familiar, but still challanging. Mostly, you walk into a room, collect objects, and solve puzzles in the room to find more or allow for objects to interact with one another. In most cases it's easy to deduce what to do and where to start, though there are a few instances where you will resort to the hint systems to see what the game wants you to do.\n\nAs for the hint systems, there are actually two in this game. One is a one per screen type of deal. It will rarely tell you what you do next, so much as what you need to accomplish in the room. Sometimes that's enough, but if you need more help there's a second option. There is a wallet that will let you play a short mini-game. After beating the mini-game, you will be shown (with pictures and diagrams, which are great for puzzle solutions) everything you need to do within that room. It won't show you how to get objects in other rooms, but it will show you if you need an object you don't yet have to complete a puzzle. This takes a lot of frustration out of the puzzling, and gives you a place to go if you don't have a clue and don't want to resort to a walkthrough.\n\nAs for the port, it isn't great. I mentioned some aspects are build for a touchpad, and this is true. There are some puzzles whos parts are a bit unresponsive, or work poorly with a mouse. Other parts work just fine or better. Some puzzles integrate keyboard keys (though they don't every tell you which keys will work and for what), and it's generally self explainitory as to which keys to use (the arrow keys and spacebar are the most common when they can be used). You cannot rebind keys (though you can play entirely with the mouse), and there are few options. Adjusting your options is very easy, however, as they're at the bottom of the screen if you mouse over them. The port is what you would expect of a game ported from a tablet. Not bad, but not very good either.\n\nMy opinion --\n\nI enjoyed the game. It was a short and fun puzzle adventure game that didn't overstay it's welcome. I felt like only one or two puzzles were bad, but none of them were game breaking or too frustrating. I really liked the hint system in this game, as it ment I never needed a walkthrough. If the puzzle solution was rediculous or too tough, you can find the solution ingame (even if getting to the second hint system is a bit tedious). Most Adventure games have a few points where they lose the player, usually because they didn't know they missed something, or that they simply can't progress yet and have to go to a new area to get a new item to get futher. This hint system lets you get over that hump, so that frustration is kept to a minimum. Most of the problems i have with the game are nitpicks, with no really bad things to say. If you like puzzle games, and don't mind a little UI fiddliness, this game is great.\n\nOverall, buy it if you like adventure games, puzzle games, or mellow games that don't stress you out. Also, decent game for getting the brain working after so many years out of school =)\n\n","December 11, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only downside, imo, is that some of the puzzles can be solved only through pure luck and guessing, and not logic, but that is where the built in walkthrough comes to the rescue.

It is visually gorgeous, with a very well-told story, albeit not a 'talkie'. The music and soundscape is truly masterful, and ranges from passively complimentary ambience to exceptionally crafted interactivity. The game is also quite difficult at times, as most of the puzzles are at least moderately challenging, and the hint and/or solution option usually present a quandary in and of themselves (the solution option just requires a little atari-style minigame, but is illustrated so cryptically as to be useless at times). If you are looking for something casual, this is not your game. Even if you consult the walkthrough, it can still be maddeningly hard. But when you solve puzzles in this game and as the story progressess and you see more of this strange world, all the tenuous stuff is worth it. The drawbacks of this game are glitchiness and obtuse interaction: glitches are glitches, and I need not clarify that other than to say they are not game ruining, but when I say obtuse interaction, I mean that a good portion of the game involves combinatorial or timely interaction with elements that are just not obvious. Case in point: (minor spoiler) in a certain encounter, the robot band's instruments are broken; what to do? Of course you go up a few flights of stairs in a certain direction, disrupt a few robots in very specific ways, accost an owl, and electrocute a cat, then take the cat and bring it over to the band robot dude's didgeridoo and stuff it inside so it can scare the small animal that nothing has indicated was present out of the robot's instrument. If I had not looked that up, I probably could have gone months without knowing what to do with either the cat or the didgeridoo robot-guy. All the same, I don't mind those inconveniences, as the game is an amazing and fantastic experience. I just can't give it the highest of recommendations, despite being extremely fond of it.

I am not normally into Point & Click or Adventure style games, but this one really is a cut above the rest.\n\nThe art and style of the game is really interesting and unique. It also doesnt try to be too obvious with all of the objects and clues, but it does have them. Its style and the world created by the visuals really gives the game some depth and character. The areas are varied and unique, but still remaining cohesive. My only possible complaint with art & visuals is that I wish it would fully scale & stretch up to 1080P, but with the way the game is designed and with the way the game's art is made, I understand and accept why it doesnt.\n\nThe music is very good. It fits the areas in the game very well and gives it so much personality. All of the tracks are long enough and are composed in a way that wont become grating on your nerves, even if you get stuck or stumped by a puzzle for a very long time.  one of my favorite soundtracks I've heard recently.\n\nThe puzzles are all well designed, and they tend to be fair and dont fall into the trope of being needlessly obtuse in the illusion of being "challenging." The difficulty progression of the puzzles is fairly gradual and it tries really hard to teach the player its style and how you should be approaching each puzzle as you go. Only a few of them really took me a while to figure out and even if you get stuck: theres in-game hints and when you are 100% stumped: it has an unlockable walkthrough (you have to do a mini side-scrolling shooter to open it up) and the walkthrough doesnt completely spoil the puzzles.","December 1, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plenty of puzzles within the game, some of them can be pretty tricky and take your many minutes. Story was OK with the bubble supported narrative. And you don't have to alt+tab the game to look for any walkthrough on internet, because the game already includes its own, which you can access via a mini game. I loved the drawings of the backgrounds btw. The only con I can think is the short length. This game deserves a 8/10.","December 31, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I'm expected to just figure out that I'm supposed to use the duct tape on the cat to get hair and combine that with the glasses frames to create a Groucho Marx disguise to sneak into the party, I'm pretty turned off. That's not a puzzle, it's an exercise in tedious trial and error, and for me, table-flipping frustration.\n\nMachinarium mostly avoids this, and as such I'm willing to say that it, along with Botanicula, hold the title for best adventure game of all time. Seriously! Amanita Design avoid the key pitfalls of adventure game design and substitute that with killer visuals and fantastic music. As far as I'm concerned, Machinarium does everything right.\n\nIt's a bit short, and I wont deny that there are a few puzzles that are too esoteric to be praised, but overall I really, really enjoyed myself, which is more than I can say for a lot of games. I'd pick it up.","November 13, 2012","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Machinarium is your atypical point and click puzzle solving adventure. You will find yourself, more than once, just pausing to listen to the ambience of the world around you.  With no actual words used by the characters, Machinarium manages to transcend the language barrier, using a pictograph styled language instead. Unlike most of its genre, Machinarium comes with a hint guide within the game, locked by a small minigame each time you reference it. This allows you to avoid tedous frustration that prevails in so many point and click adventures.\n\nIf you are looking for a simple game that has many beautiful layers of complexity woven into a succinct plot, Machinarium is the game for you.\n","July 5, 2011","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like 2D point-and-click adventure games, I'd go ahead and just buy this for that reason alone. Keeping this in mind, the game is full of mind-bending puzzles which could certainly have you breaking out a walk-through every few steps of the way, if you're dumb like me, although I did find some of the puzzles simply not plausible, but interesting nonetheless. This game can't be talked about without mentioning the beautiful art-style. It has very detailed (what I think are) hand-drawn backgrounds and characters that all resemble things out of a painting. In addition to the striking graphics, I find the musical score to be brilliant and one of my favorite of the hundreds of games I've played. With those two huge assets and especially considering it's a 2D, this game is surprisingly immersive and really takes you to another place that the artist has sewn. 9/10","April 12, 2013","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There’s no voice acting throughout and the use of thought bubbles is a clever way for the characters to communicate with each other and just adds even more magic to the game.

That's not a puzzle, it's an exercise in tedious trial and error, and for me, table-flipping frustration.\n\nMachinarium mostly avoids this, and as such I'm willing to say that it, along with Botanicula, hold the title for best adventure game of all time. Seriously! Amanita Design avoid the key pitfalls of adventure game design and substitute that with killer visuals and fantastic music. As far as I'm concerned, Machinarium does everything right.\n\nIt's a bit short, and I wont deny that there are a few puzzles that are too esoteric to be praised, but overall I really, really enjoyed myself, which is more than I can say for a lot of games.

Each area has readily accessable hint and a full walkthrough of the area at the cost of playing a somewhat tedious mini-game to keep you from looking at it unless you're really stuck.  The robot you control can be stretched shorter or taller with a mouse drag which gives you the ability to reach areas you couldn't without it and adds complexity to many of the game's puzzles.  Most of the puzzles are pretty simple and produce, at most, a moderate challenge.\n\nThe real appeal of this game though is its art.  Almost everything is made of metal and the way it's drawn and painted gives the abstract looking structures a touch of realism that shows each ones age through how rusted or weathered it looks.  The ambient music helps to set the darkish tone of the game with mechanical and lo-fi sounds. While I'm on the topic of tone despite the dark atmosphere, the character you play as, and many of the ones you meet, are quite peppy and charming which gives an interesting contrast that made me feel as if the robots were living it a different paradigm.\n\nIt might just be nostalgia, but I miss adventure games, and I really feel the medium still holds up today; at least on PC's.","February 11, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathminister/recommended/40700/","deathminister","DeathMinister |LAB|","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathminister/","356 products in account","Machinarium is a Flash based point and click adventure game that is unique in its execution.  Each area has readily accessable hint and a full walkthrough of the area at the cost of playing a somewhat tedious mini-game to keep you from looking at it unless you're really stuck.  The robot you control can be stretched shorter or taller with a mouse drag which gives you the ability to reach areas you couldn't without it and adds complexity to many of the game's puzzles.  Most of the puzzles are pretty simple and produce, at most, a moderate challenge.\n\nThe real appeal of this game though is its art.  Almost everything is made of metal and the way it's drawn and painted gives the abstract looking structures a touch of realism that shows each ones age through how rusted or weathered it looks.  The ambient music helps to set the darkish tone of the game with mechanical and lo-fi sounds. While I'm on the topic of tone despite the dark atmosphere, the character you play as, and many of the ones you meet, are quite peppy and charming which gives an interesting contrast that made me feel as if the robots were living it a different paradigm.\n\nIt might just be nostalgia, but I miss adventure games, and I really feel the medium still holds up today; at least on PC's.","February 11, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Length is pretty good as well.\n\nMeh!: Some puzzles are annoying(Looking at you King's brain action mini game) or difficult(Bomb).\n\nBleh!: The fact that your character can only interact(or know its clickable) with objects with in reach of its arms is annoying. This has you basically moving the chacter around the screen at his snail pace to make sure you have everything. Wish there was ability to skip screen transition animations to speed things up.\n\nVerdict: A gorgous point and click adventure that is just right in difficulty most of the time. A few of the mini-game puzzles do annoy and seem out of place in the genre but can be overlooked in the overall picture. Not worth full price, but was worth it via the humble bundle obtained in.\n\n***/5","February 10, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music and sound are perfect for this game. Some of the puzzles are easy while others will make you go back and forth to look for items or actions you could have forgotten. The game runs very smoothly and as expected with this kind of game, the pace is rather slow and calm and the game is rather short (but not too short).\n\nAmanita hasn't fully solved a very annoying issue: sometimes you cannot resume a saved game and the main menu shows only the "Play new game" option. They provide a solution where you can start from pre-saved files with the basic progression of each level and continue your adventure from there, but this falut is honestly very frustrating.\n\nThe game is beautiful.

Machinarium is your atypical point and click puzzle solving adventure. You will find yourself, more than once, just pausing to listen to the ambience of the world around you.  With no actual words used by the characters, Machinarium manages to transcend the language barrier, using a pictograph styled language instead. Unlike most of its genre, Machinarium comes with a hint guide within the game, locked by a small minigame each time you reference it. This allows you to avoid tedous frustration that prevails in so many point and click adventures.\n\nIf you are looking for a simple game that has many beautiful layers of complexity woven into a succinct plot, Machinarium is the game for you.\n","July 5, 2011","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game proved to be everything I had been hoping for in that one.\n\nIt tells you right off the bat all significant controls and limits, instead of immediately having you start the game blindly clicking. There are two options to get hints if you get stuck - the lightbulb will make your little robot think of the clever end game that you're attempting to achieve, and hopefully that will help you figure out what steps to take to reach it. If, however, you just aren't getting it, there is the walkthrough book. It won't let you read it right away - it features a little mini game to unlock it, which I found an interesting touch to make you a) earn your help and b) consider if you really want to bother, or maybe you'll try a little harder after all...\n\nThe puzzles are challenging but not so much so that you turn into a madly-clicking rage monster. The art is simply adorable, the music suits the tone and won't grate on your nerves after prolonged play. The little animated speech bubbles as means of communication are simple and effective. It's a great little puzzle game to relax with and I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far.","January 4, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Adds many great features that modern P&Cs should have: taking away useless inventory items, giving a general clue for every room, giving an in game walkthrough for those who are truly stumped, and mixing in challenging puzzles that are simple in concept. The downsides? It's a flash game, so resolution options are terribly limited and wiping your brower data can erase your save.

It's nice to see a fresh take on the point-and-click genre. It's not a game changer in the sense that no other p&c plays like it, but more so that no other feels like it. The experience is hand-drawn, a feature that adds a true stylized grit to the characters and environments. The music is a blend of jazz and ambience, a combination that really adds life to the world. Often times I found myself just listening to the music hanging out in a room watching as my character day-dreams about his happy life before all of the puzzle solving mayhem. Overall Machinarium is a challenging, classy retake of the point-and-click genre filled with beautifully realized environments that will keep you clicking until the end (which unfortunatelly is a couple hours into the game).","September 8, 2011","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are clever solutions to many of the problems, and if you run into trouble you can play a mini-game that takes you long enough to be discouraged to use it, but not torturous if you are legitimately stuck.\n\nVisuals: The style is very detailed and seems like every scene was painted purposefully. This game is certainly easy to look at for the entirety of the play through.\n\nAudio: The sound track for this game is absolutely fantastic. Not only does it insert you into the scene's, it's also good to listen to on its own. I often use it as my background music for studying.\n\nReplayability*: This is a hard one to verbalize.

The animation and character designs are well done. The use of color is kind of sad and kind of reminds me of that AstroBoy movie from 2008. It's actually not that bad though. I mean, isn't the setting supposed to look like a junkyard? Each stage has some sort of puzzle, like any other point and click game, and each is challenging, again, like any other point and click game. I feel really bad for the protagonist, Josef. He's freaking adorable, but his past life is so sad. He's been bullied and pushed around all his life. Even the police hate him. The ways he gets bullied, though, are hysterical. He's been slingshotted at off of a lamppost. I kind of see why he gets bullied though, coming from experience. He is small for one thing, but he has a tendency of putting things in his mouth. Toilet paper, puts it in his mouth. Someone's arm, puts it in his mouth. Traffic cone, puts it in his mouth. Every item to pick up in this game goes right into Josef's mouth. I guess it doesn't affect him, though. I mean, he's a robot. Why couldn't he just put the bullies in his mouth? You are able to change his height in the game, which makes it easier to grab things higher than you. There's a little lightbulb at the corner of the screen, and when you click on it, it tells you what your goal to the level is. I always click on it just to make sure. Right next to it is a picture of a watch-like object. When you click on that, it makes you play a mini game that makes no sense at all. Here's what happens: You're a flying key that shoots pellets trying to avoid hitting the side of a brick wall and spiders. IT MAKES NO SENSE! Other than that, this game is good and it is under my approval! :)","December 4, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visually this thing is killer and a ton of fun to experience. The concept is just very well thought out and the puzzles are clever and frankly some of the smartest I've ever played. Mechanically, this game is just awful at times which is silly since it's a mechanical world (face-palm for dumb pun). It's a flash port so don't expect it to be super well optimized for any system. The thing that just cranked my gears the wrong way was that I would click to go somewhere and realize I had left the robot's body elongated or shortened which makes him travel at half the pace. You can't redirect him back mid-travel, as far as I know you can't speed up the game, and you can't readjust him to normal height while he's walking either making for a lot of headbanging on my desk waiting for the stupid robot to get to the place he needed to go. Other than that, it has a killer aesthetic and a fun dialogue free story which is just fantastic and you should definitely give this game a try if you're at all into these kind of adventures. The docked points were for the time wasting oversights and not for the actual puzzles themselves which were easily some of the best I've ever seen in any game.","December 22, 2013","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a fun little adventure and very, very cute. Some of the puzzles are pretty intersting and time consuming but still quite fun. Wish the game was longer but the storyline was nice. Love the soundtrack too.  9/10 <3 definately a fave. :)","July 16, 2012","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Haven't been able to complete any level without help of youtube. Puzzles depend so much on small visual details which are hard to notice because as you can see it is very rich in graphics.","January 1, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
