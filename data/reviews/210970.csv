It's easy enough to appreciate getting the solution after struggling with a puzzle for a while. Games like Portal make great use of this. Portal is about finding the solution that will let you move on.\n\nThe Witness is different. The Witness is a game about understanding puzzles. Understanding a puzzle is about more than just finding a solution. It's about knowing how the puzzle works. It's about knowing what makes a solution a solution.\n\nYou could be shown the answer to many of the puzzles in the game and be immediately and totally stuck on the next puzzle. Why? Because you didn't understand the puzzle. You don't understand why that solution is a solution. Without that knowledge, you cannot move on to the next puzzle. You may even have to go back to a "solved" puzzle in order to try and understand it better.\n\nUnderstanding requires questioning. Understanding requires probing. Understanding requires observing. You will be questioning, probing and observing every panel in the game, and indeed, the island itself, all in an attempt to understand.\n\nIf you do not enjoy trying to understand puzzles, you will not enjoy this game.\n\n\nIf, however, you have a love for discovery and understanding, this game will entertain that love in a beautiful and fulfilling way.","January 29","true","32.1"," 1,368 of 1,604 people (85%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","85","368","1","35","34"

As has been noted, it is a fiendishly difficult puzzler.  It has garnered many negative reviews, mostly from people expecting it to be a puzzle-adventure game, which it is NOT.  It has suffered in it's comparisons to Myst, but it really isn't like that at all.\n\nEVERY SINGLE PUZZLE consists of drawing line-path through a grid or symbol.  Every one.  Nothing else.   Every interaction with the world is triggered by drawing a line-path through a grid or symbol.  You cannot interact with the world in any other way.  The environment itself often plays a key role in the puzzles, whether it be clues to the puzzle lurking in the environment, or driving the solution of the puzzle itself.\n\nYet... and here is why the game is great and totally worth the $40 price of admission... something subtle starts to happen to you as you complete puzzle after puzzle.   HOW you solve the puzzles -- the thought process required arrive at a solution for each -- starts to take on meaning and become metaphoric.  There is a palpable sense of MEANING in the puzzles you solve, and that is reflected and reinforced by ALL the environment details and art and media snippets found on the island.   The game begins to speak to you in a language you have learned by playing the game.   And the sum total of THAT experience is profound.  It's not like anything I've ever experienced in a game.\n\nExcept perhaps Dear Esther.  In Dear Esther you did nothing but walk around, look at stuff, and listen to an intermitent narrative as meaning started to emerge. In Dear Esther, you were an observer.  That game TOLD you a story.   In The Witness you walk around, solve puzzles, look at stuff, and begin to understand WHY you're solving puzzles and what it all means.  This game SHOWS you a story.  It adheres to the old writing adage, SHOW not TELL.\n\nWhen it all comes together -- and HOW it all comes together -- is both intangible and epic.\n\nIf you're the kind of person whom what I've tried to describe makes sense or is appealing, you'll love this game.  Otherwise, you'll hate it as many reviewers here apparently have hated it.  There's very little in between.","January 28","true","7.8"," 536 of 661 people (81%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","81","536","661","12","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roninotter/recommended/210970/","roninotter","RoninOtter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roninotter/","111 products in account","I cannot begin to describe just how saddened I am by "The Witness." I had been anticipating it for so long, but ultimately it's been an awful let-down.\n\nThe short of it:\n\nThe Witness delivered on its promise of beautiful visuals and challenging puzzles, but while it contains thoughtful (albeit "borrowed") philosophical content that's beautifully presented, ultimately the promise of a deep mystery to be uncovered was a bold-faced lie. The game had been hyped for years, and ended up so depressingly disappointing to me that In the end I could barely bring myself to finish it. It is a glut of repetitive, meaningless, storyless puzzle-solving in an otherwise visually compelling environment that would’ve had the exact same impact on me had it been on the iPhone with pixellated 8-bit graphics. It wasn’t a game; it was a task. And it wasn’t one I felt any satisfaction from completing.\n\nThe description on the store states the following:\n"You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you.  You don't remember who you are, and you don't remember how you got here, but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home."\nEvery word of that is a lie, designed to draw you into an ultimately banal and repetitive walking simulator peppered with puzzles.\n\nThe long of it:\n\nI was anticipating playing The Witness literally for years, having followed the developer's blog from very early on. A rabid Myst series fan, I was chomping at the bit for another story-based puzzle game to sink my teeth into, especially when it was described as an island setting where you arrive without any understanding of why you're there. When it came out, I bought it instantly, literally purchasing a new gaming PC at the same time so I could experience it on modern hardware. (I was overdue for an upgrade anyway.)\n\nThe visuals are very pleasing to the eye in a bright and surrealistic way that walks a fine line between obviously unreal and bizarrely realistic. The lack of close-up shape and surface detail and overpowering color saturation mixed with believable reflections and lighting feel similar to the graphics of Team Fortress 2, oddly enough. Imagine if Aperture Science and a 5-star gardener with a degree in genetic engineering combined to create a manicured environment as an amusement park: Voila, you have the island from The Witness. It’s a wonderful environment to behold, and was clearly an exhaustive effort to create. There’s definitely a great deal of enjoyment to be had discovering the scope of the island and all its nooks and crannies.\n\nThe other area that the developers obviously spent a lot of time was the development of the puzzles themselves. Their logic is devious, challenging, and will require you to drag out a pencil and graph paper (or your chosen digital alternative.) There can be a high degree of enjoyment obtained from deciphering their cryptic composition, and the game does a very good job giving you just enough education on the rules to let you figure them out and reach that euphoric "eureka" moment. For a time it was wonderful, and at one point I even said to myself “If this could go on forever, that’d be great.” However, I was working off of the assumption that there would be a gradual revelation of the mystery of why I was there on this island, or at least some hints as to its purpose. As time went on, my heart sank deeper and deeper into despair as I realized that assumption was utterly and painfully wrong. It's clear they spent their efforts on the logic behind the puzzles and graphics engine, with no thought at all into building a reason for the player to actually _care_ about solving any of the hundreds of diabolical mazes strewn all around. I can’t say that I hated playing this game, because I only hated it after I realized that everything I was doing was pointless. Up until that point, I was loving it.\n\nThe only content which can possibly pass off as having “story elements" besides the unnerving statues strewn about the island are the live-action movies you can “unlock” by solving certain puzzles, all of which hail from a wide variety of sources and eras. Some are absolutely beautiful philosophical discussions on the nature of reality, human understanding, science, God, and cognition. Others are pure avant-garde art which can be thought-provoking, but ultimately only carry whatever meaning the viewer chooses to ascribe to them. Their most common feature, however, is that the game developers didn’t make a single one of them. They’re all from existing documentaries, interviews, and TED-like talks, and while I respect the developers’ inclusion choices, they took absolutely no effort to incorporate into the game. There is one exception of original content, but it's so banal and drawn-out with no visual component that I nearly threw my controller in anger when I realized after sitting and listening to it drone on for almost a full hour that it's only message was: "people like puzzles." The rest of the island is so devoid of meaningful story content that I found myself desperately trying to find and unlock all of the videos just to hear a human voice break the soul-crushing silence of the soundtrack-free environment. Indeed, the historical quotes and video excerpts are treats to someone who takes pleasure in philosophy and literature. However, if Jonathan Blow thought he could insert the words of great minds into his puzzle game to have them magically imbue it with deeper meaning, he's either deluded or just plain lazy.\n\nThis brings me to the thing which depresses me most: The Witness has no story, period. It's a beautiful venue with no party, no music and no people; a concept that actually has literal representation in the game at one point. After anticipating it for so long, the most powerful emotion I felt after completing The Witness was nothing short of betrayal. It felt like Jonathan Blow built it to lure in the kind of people who liked the games it was supposedly "inspired by," only to troll them with a game that itself has no more mystery than a book of sudoku puzzles. I felt like I’d been duped and lied to, and the “secret” ending doesn’t help one bit in changing my mind, nor was it in any way original. In fact, it made me even more angry, because it is one of the single oldest (and worst) cliché endings one can ever possibly use. You've probably guessed what it is just by me saying that...\n\nIn the end, The Witness has only one point: People like solving puzzles even when there’s no purpose to doing so. It literally even *says this aloud* during the most disappointing piece of unlocked content. If you’re the kind of person who just wants to use an expensive PC to do maze puzzles, The Witness is for you. Aside from that, it’s nothing more than a walking simulator set on a beautiful island that would serve as a great demo for the Oculus Rift. The remaining "meaningful" content can be much more easily acquired from the original authors, or YouTube.\n\nI'm waiting for Obduction...","March 31","false","55.4"," 676 of 858 people (79%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","79","676","858","43","38"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kixu/recommended/210970/","Kixu","Tau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kixu/","64 products in account","I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the "helpful" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't "fun"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than "fun," and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.","January 31","true","48.8"," 437 of 559 people (78%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","78","437","559","12","15"

The game is not entirely deaf-friendly. There are some subtitles, but the hearing-impaired will need a walkthrough for some small portions of the game.\n2. The game is absolutely not color-blind friendly. I'm not color-blind myself so I can't say exactly how bad it is, but I'd guess at least half the puzzles are color-based, and may be much more difficult (maybe unsolvable) depending on your level of blindness.\n\nThat being said, this is the king of all puzzle games. If you want a game that will throw hundreds of incredibly varied, deep, surprising, challenging puzzles at you for dozens of hours on end, you must buy this. I'm 32 hours in and I'm still excited to unravel the next few mysteries of the island. It helps that the game is gorgeous, so even when I'm stuck on a puzzle I can enjoy the scenery.\n\nIf you have a puzzle-loving friend, I highly recommend plugging in a second mouse and playing through together.

I completed the game only out of pride and curiosity to see if there was any kind of big reveal at the end. I was disappointed.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you will like this game depends on your philosophy about what a video game should be. If you haven't watched the Youtube video titled Jonathan Blow: How Mainstream Devs Are Getting It Wrong, I suggest you watch it before dropping $40 on this game. Blow is the lead developer for The Witness and Braid, and his philosophy about games is that they shouldn't be designed to be fun. Rather they should be designed to instill a particular emotion in the player. He also detests hand-holding by the developers, opting for an approach where the game lets players discover everything on their own. These principles are on full display in The Witness. Much of the game is not fun. It is often brainwracking and frustrating. The emotion he wants you to experience through this process is that "eureka!" moment from discovering everything all on your own. For some, that experience might justify the price.\n\nHowever, I disagree with Blow. I understand his desire to use video games as an artistic form of expression, but ultimately when I play a game that has over 600 puzzles and easily over 20 hours of gameplay, I want it to be a fun experience. I contrast his philosophy on game design with Sid Meier's. Meier would take an interesting concept and attempt to develop it into a workable game. He would have testers play the game over and over, making changes each time, based on player feedback, until it was fun. If he could not make it fun for the majority of people, he would scrap the game. Jonathan Blow doesn't do this. Fun wasn't a design consideration in the Witness. Therefore, he decided not to incorporate anything into the game that might distract from his themes of exploration and discovery, despite the possibility of making the game more enjoyable for the majority of people. So what we have in the end is Blow's vision of what he wants the game to be, as uncontaminated by player opinions as possible.\n\nIt's too bad because if these well conceived puzzles and pretty open world were incorporated into a suspenseful plot where details were revealed after solving each area, I would have really liked this game. Sadly, there is no plot here, and for the majority of people the puzzles alone probably aren't rewarding enough to motivate you to slog through it without resorting to guides on the internet. Thus, I only recommend The Witness for those who just really enjoy puzzles or who are willing to play a game despite it not being an enjoyable experience much of the time.\n\nIf you do decide to get this game, take my advice: savor it slowly. The puzzles are much more enjoyable if you do them a few at a time, rather than binge-puzzling through entire areas. If you get stuck on a puzzle, minimize frustration by taking a break from the game or exploring somewhere else for a while. And the puzzles in the ending area are the worst in the game. They are all either extremely difficult puzzles, or they are easy but unoriginal, tedious, and annoying.\n\nPros: Experience of discovery and exploration, beautiful scenery, clever puzzle design.\nCons: Hours of frustration, no plot to discover, ending puzzles are terrible, and the ending itself isn't great either.\n\nEDIT 3/10/2016: Many people didn't think I clearly stated my personal opinion, so "(myself included)" was added to the first paragraph to make it clear that my overall experience with the game was negative. I also clarified a bit in the paragraph which contrasts Sid Meier and Jonathan Blow's design process.","February 9","false","38.3"," 614 of 841 people (73%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","73","614","841","19","39"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/recommended/210970/","somnivore","Chewable C++","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/","2644 products in account","The Witness is a first person exploration puzzle game that is highly remarkable for a variety of reasons, some of which sadly can't be discussed easily (or at all) without risking spoilers.\n\nFor those of you considering the game, please take this to heart and limit or (preferably) just abstain from looking up more info about the game. Many reviews contain spoilers at some level (including the top reviews)! The forums and community hub also do (even though there is a Spoiler subforum, there are still spoilers in the other sub-forums). I will try to keep this review as spoiler free as practical.\n\nFirst and foremost, The Witness manages to evoke even in a seasoned gamer like me, the sense of wonder I felt when playing games like Myst for the first time.\n\nThat is, among other reasons, because the game is a gorgeous piece of virtual art. Most of us are no longer easily impressed by pretty, expensive, mass produced graphics. This is more than that.\n\nWhile indeed technically excellent, the world (well, island) of The Witness is crafted in a way that feels something like walking around in a masterpiece painting (or series of paintings, as there is considerable environmental variety). Aside from the overall beauty, there are so very many wonderful details to admire. I don't think I have played any other first person 3D game that approaches this level of artistry.\n\nSecond, the gameplay, which consists primarily of exploration, puzzle solving, and a sort of scavenger hunting is surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nThe classic CD-ROM game Myst is perhaps the closest comparison and the biggest inspiration for this game, but The Witness is much more accessible, less frustrating, more beautiful, and, I think, more rewarding an experience.\n\nIt is a game of epiphanies, repeatedly producing quite nice feelings of accomplishment in ways that not many games do, even most puzzle games.\n\nThis is largely because the puzzle solving mechanics are never directly explained to you, but the world presents you with ample visual and symbolic clues to make your own inferences. This is the core design principle, and, to me, indeed a key selling point.\n\nBased on preview videos I saw initially, I had significant reservations about the seemingly simplistic puzzle mechanic. Simple it is indeed, but it is presented in such clever, varied, often challenging ways that it never really felt tedious or overly repetitive to me (although, I am quite good at puzzles). And, yes, there is somewhat more to this than solving 2D puzzles on flat panels.\n\nGoing into more details about the mechanics would spoil the sense of discovery that is the highlight of the game, so I will not, but I will say that this game will exercise your mind in a wide variety of wonderful ways.\n\nIt's not an easy game. While getting to the "easy" ending can be done without much effort, the game holds substantial challenges for those that wish to take them on.\n\nDuring my playthrough, I ended up using three sheets of graph paper and taking numerous private screenshots for future reference. It's that type of game - the type of game (almost) nobody has dared to make in decades.\n\nIt takes maybe a 10-20 hours to reach the easy ending, and another 10-20 to reach complete the second achievement. However, there is quite a bit more to do, and doing all of it, even with a guide, would take quite a lot longer.\n\nSo, to those of you wondering about the $40 price point, the game has plenty to offer to justify it.\n\n\nConditional Recommendation\nI highly recommend The Witness to the right audiences. The trick is determining whether or not you are the right audience for the game.\n\nReasons you might not like The Witness:\n* You have a sensory deficiency (colorblind or deaf) - see Sensory section below for more details\n* You dislike puzzles.\n* You dislike thinking.\n* You want your game mechanics clearly explained to you rather than having to figure them out based on clues/cues.\n* You need games to have a coherent, "traditional" story. What is the game about? If you really must know, it's about epistemology\n* You would be overly uncomfortable exploring a mostly static world with only some environmental audio, but mostly no music.\n* You want to be able to do everything in the game without help (note: help is not necessary for the achievements, though some may need it).\n* You want to be able to do everything in the game in a reasonable amount of time (note: again, not a problem for the achievements)\n(including this in spoiler tags so others do not inevitably point it out in comments)\n* You can't stand being "lectured" on religion/science/philosophy/art/whatever. This isn't a required part of the game. If you don't like that sort of thing, you can ignore it, but if you do, you will be partially "missing the point"\n\nThere is a common complaint that, despite what I said, and despite the overall positive reception, that the core mechanic of the game (drawing a line) is too repetitive. I worried about this initially, but I after having played the game, I think it's fine and surprisingly well done, though perhaps not without some arguable flaws. I guess I have to mention that here because it's such a common complaint, but ultimately if this sounds like a concern to you, the only way to find out if it works for you or not without spoiling the game is to actually play the game for yourself.\n\nBesides these warnings, I highly recommend it to anyone else.\n\nMisc. Notes\nThe game is actually "optionally" DRM free. The Steam version can be run without Steam, if necessary (although mixing offline/online may cause problems).\n\nBuying it at the Humble Store will give you a choice between DRM-free only or Steam key only..\n\nThe game looks nice on High settings, for which you would need to meet the moderately high recommended requirements. I haven't tried it in lower settings, but I've seen some people say that the game loses a lot when settings go lower, so the experience won't be as nice.\n\nIs this game "indie"? I would say so. Here's a relevant quote from Jonathan Blow (from Reddit AMA):\n\n"I am not disappointed with anything from the game. If we had shipped it early, I would have been -- I would have stories like you hear from most game developers, "well, we originally wanted to do X but we had to de-scope the game because it was obviously too ambitious", or, "we tried to do Y but we just didn't get it right and then we had to ship". No, that is not how we work here. We built an ambitious game and we made sure everything was good and then we shipped it. When you aren't being forced to ship by a publisher or by financial constraints, you can feel free to make the best thing that you can."\n\nA Spoilerful Review by Someone Else\nIf you've already finished the game, or are for some silly reason resolved to never play it, then this is another review I'd recommend that discusses the nature of the game in a way that can't be done without spoilers:\n\nhttp://www.gamesradar.com/eureka-moment-what-witness-story-really-about/\n\nSensory Info\nThere are sections of the game where puzzles are sound and color based.

I don't mind how challenging it is. I really don't. I perservered and in the end, I finished it. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy myself. It was baffling to me that the game would do arbitrary things and then be deathly silent while I tried to figure out what just happened. I don't like how it guesses your solution to a puzzle and then puts another obstacle in the way just to make you frustrated. I don't like how it preaches esoteric themes about humanity and then scoffs at the player's humanity. I don't like how it builds itself up to be ethereal and high-minded and then....doesn't fill in any of the plot gaps. I have so many questions still. Who is my character? Why are they the only one not turned to stone? Why did everyone else turn to stone in the first place? Were those giants in the quarry? Why are there giants? Why are the giants doing the manual labor? Are they enslaved? (The giants were so strange to me.) What's with the huge scene in the castle courtyard? Why do I feel like I'm simultaneously in the 21st century and the 14th? Why is there an eastern temple when everything else seems incredibly western? Just.....what happened? At all??\n\nLook, game, I've taken Philosophy 101, I know the whole "I think therefore I am" garbage. Don't spike my curiosity with this elaborate, beautiful, story-telling scenery, then ignore it, and instead condescend to me like I'm a freshman in college. I am just.....so disappointed. I feel like if I straight up asked the game what the story behind it all was, it would snort and go, "Like you'd even get it." Don't bore me with lectures about peace and love and humanity, and then have no humanity to give.\n\nI have to say though, only when the end of the game flyover came around, and it started undoing and shutting off all my hard work, did I realize the game hated me. It straight hated me. It thought I was an absolute piece of garbage and it had no respect for me, my time, or my humanity. I am exhausted by The Witness. If someone asked me if I recommended it, I would tell them, if you like puzzles, go ahead and play it, but go in knowing that the game hates you and everything you are. Don't expect anything but frustration and confusion. Discovery and accomplishment may happen, but they are completely overshadowed in the end.","January 31","false","33.3"," 430 of 640 people (67%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","67","430","640","33","13"

It is confusing precisely why these critics had given the game so much praise considering just how repetitious, tedious and deeply unsatisfying these puzzles are to solve. This review is coming from someone who has completed and immensely enjoyed the original Braid, the Portal games, and the Talos Principle + its DLC.\n\nAll the puzzles I’ve encountered so far have the same basic structure; you trace a line through a maze governed by certain constraints and rules that you need to discover. The discovery of these rules is an application of the tools of the scientific method; you’ll begin by formulating a working hypothesis about how to traverse the maze, then you’ll test your idea by applying the rule to each of the series of thematically-related mazes that follows. Almost always you will find that you will need to revise your working-rule in favor of some deeper rule, going back to previous puzzles to figure out the commonality between a series of mazes. When nearly every puzzle you encounter is actively trying to defy your expectations, repeat this process puzzle after puzzle (ad nauseum) and you’ll soon begin to see just how frustrating and unfun these puzzles are to complete.\n\nOften you’ll be on the last puzzle of a series just to find out that what you thought was true is in fact incorrect, leaving you dumbfounded at what to do next. Sure, you’re free to walk away from the puzzle, but you’re disincentivized from doing so since – after returning -- you are likely going to forget about what the hell was going on in that problematic puzzle in the first place, forcing you to recapitulate the entire tortuous and stressful process again under the mind-numbing electrical droning of the panel upon which the maze is displayed. These puzzles are also difficult, both logically and cognitively. You’ll be applying deductions in formal logic while storing complex patterns in visual memory, mentally rotating them and retracing them onto the maze panel. Better for puzzle games to be too hard than too easy for sure, but mentally exhausting for the player.\n\nWell, the pay-off to solving these puzzles must surely be worth it, right?! Well, sometimes you’ll be rewarded with something tantalizing – e.g. a staircase descending somewhere mysterious or a stark change in scenery -- only to find that it is locked behind a door with yet another puzzle panel, this time with alien symbols upon them. Other times seemingly nothing happens -- at all. Or, perhaps you will be given a long, boring audio recording of a quote/monologue voiced by some pompous sounding ♥♥♥♥. Yay! Not even your experience of the feeling of insight will be a satisfying reward for you because that too becomes so routine that is becomes boring and banal. The sheer profundity of your epiphanies will begin to wane after your 11th insight.\n\nThere’s not much to do in the world other than the puzzles or taking in the visual scenes of the beautiful looking art-style. No discernible story, no ambient soundtrack, limited ability to wander through the world.\n\nI cannot recommend this game at all (unless you are a masochist). Maybe if you are a puzzle fanatic you will enjoy this game. I seriously considered getting a refund but decided to give the game a chance to unfold and prove me wrong. I had not experience any of the “brilliance” this game has been ascribed, so perhaps I am missing something that only shows up later in the game or in areas I have not explored. What I think most critics call brilliance is little more than the fact that some puzzles extend or are transposed into the wider world; something which merely requires one to be more observant of the surroundings the puzzle is situated, not genius.\n\nUpdate:  As a point of reference for how far I got into the game when this review was written, I played ~8hrs and completed 124 puzzles + 11","January 27","false","11.7"," 632 of 954 people (66%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","66","632","954","14","18"

I'll just say that at LEAST 95% of this game would be impossible without the island. People who are claiming that the island is useless are just plain wrong, and almost every single thing in the environment is placed there for a reason.\n\nAlso, people who are claiming that it's a "walking simulator" or a "$0.99 phone game" are completely wrong as well.

Nothing is what it simply seems on the first impression.

And sometimes those stupid people will stop playing less than 2 hours into the game and post a negative review complaining about how difficult the game is.\n\nI had to take a picture of my screen with Snapchat and use the paint tool in the app to solve the last 5 100 puzzles I just did.\n\nWORDS OF WISDOMIf you're stuck on a puzzle you don't understand the mechanic of, skip it, and come back later. There's no point in trying to brute force it, because there will just be more difficult versions of it beyond the door it unlocks. You will eventually learn how to complete it, at which point you can return and complete it with .\n\nAlso, if you reach a platform that moves you to a place it seems you can never leave, try to solve the puzzle on the platform in a different matter.\n\nInitial ReactionReally though, the bottom line here is that this is a massive puzzle-filled game which competes with the likes of the Portal franchise and The Talos Principle. If you're going to go ahead and sum up this game with, "so it's just mazes", then I'm going to go ahead and sum up Portal with, "so it's just portals". This is an atmospheric puzzle game through-and-through. The visuals are stunning, despite the complete lack of options related to them, which probably came about as a problem resulting from an indie developer trying their hand at creating a game engine from the ground up rather than using something already established like Unity, Unreal, Crytek, etc... If this game is "just mazes", I dare you to try and beat it without the assistance of somebody else. This game is hard. And while mazes are the core mechanic, just like portals are in the Portal games, there are plenty of twists on the mechanic that help change things up just enough, just like in every single other game with a core mechanic that is branched off of.\n\nAnd after looking over a whole bunch of the other reviews, I'm really confused because this isn't a situation like Amazon's reviews where people can just willy nilly review products they didn't purchase. These are all people who legitimately purchased The Witness who are giving it negative reviews. Are these based off of reactions from watching trailers? Did people want another Braid? Where's the audience that gave The Talos Principle a 96% on Steam? This is The Talos Principle on steroids. This is The Talos Principle if the entirety of the game's content was open from the beginning, and you accidentally stumbled onto the last few puzzles of the game.\n\nDon't chalk up the game's length to whatever amount of time it takes you to beat the game after having solved the first 5 puzzles on your own, and eventually breaking down and resorting to the use of a guide. These is Dark Souls-levels of difficulty and eventual satisfaction after having accomplished something you never thought you would. This is easily one of the biggest and most difficult puzzle games available on Steam at the moment, and don't let anybody convince you that it's nothing short of great.\n\nThis game is currently sitting at an 89% on Metacritic, and a 76% here on Steam, with various well-known critics like IGN, Destructoid, Telegraph, and Guardian giving the game perfect 10s. This game is a big deal, and hopefully the Steam userbase, being mostly populated by gamers playing a crate-opening simulator, recognizes that this is far more than just a bunch of mazes.\n\nAfter 10+ HoursOnce you've hit a certain point in the game, everything just starts to click. You begin to realize how crucial it really is to just straight up abandon a difficult puzzle and come back to it, especially if you feel like you're just brute forcing the thing at that point. This game turns into a unique kind of Metroidvania game right off the bat, in which every path is available for the player to explore, but the player soon finds out that some paths are more difficult or even impossible when compared to others. The game doesn't provide you with a unique ability that allows you to double jump up walls, or turn into a ball and roll through tight spaces. Instead, the game offers you the knowledge to go back to these difficult areas and know what you're doing through the use of little mini-tutorials that don't feel like they're holding your hand at all. They feel like they take the same approach that the start of the game does. They feel natural, which is once again why I must stress the importance of abandoning unfamiliar puzzles until you learn how to complete them later on.\n\nThis is as much a maze game as Dark Souls is a combat game. Sure, it's a pivotal gameplay mechanic, but it produces a much wider range of puzzles than I've ever seen before in a puzzle game, and you can't just take the word of someone who's put 1 hour into the game and called it quits.\n\nSummaryPros and cons of the game's release-day content.\n\nPros    600+ puzzles, with a very steep learning curve.\nNo handholding or boring filler content. No individual part of the island feels like wasted space. Nothing feels too similar either. Every area you visit is unique.\nEach individual puzzle takes a long time to solve, massive sense of accomplishment.\nAmazing visuals and sound design.\nInteresting overlapping story supported by hidden tape recorders with well done voice-acted dialogue.\nDifficulty curve set up like a unique Metroidvania, in which every path is available from the start, but you may not have learned enough about the game to proceed down certain paths until later.\nCons    Lack of any real options other than V-sync (there is no FPS limit) and standard "high", "med", "low" presets.\nYou're never going to beat this game.","January 26","true","28.0"," 332 of 514 people (65%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","65","332","514","29","16"

I wanted to like it. I really did.\n\nBut I didn't. Instead, it was a huge disappointment.\n\nIf you listen to me, maybe you can avoid the same mistake. Or not. Maybe you'll love it. This is just my opinion, after all.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe problem I have with The Witness is this: It's not fun.\n\nThe island itself is wonderfully crafted. I haven't seen an environment this colourful and well designed in a long time. You can tell that a lot of love went into bulding it, making everything line up just right or cast shadows in the perfect spots to do some fantastic perspective tricks. Maybe some branches will look like a pair of eyes, or maybe some statues will line up just right, that kind of thing. And while the island looks small, it feels absolutely enormous. You can go from one end to the other in a few minutes, but each area feels huge. The aesthetics of the different zones are absolutely beautiful, too, with each area having a distinct colour scheme and biome. The glowing wires that link all the puzzles together are really cool, as are the lasers that shine from each finished area. Visually, it's amazing.\n\nThere are some areas that I saw but never went to. Locked doors I never opened. A whole underground left unexplored, and many more hidden things that I didn't notice and certainly don't have the drive to seek out. The island holds lots of secrets.\nUnfortunately, the island also holds lots of dull, lifeless line puzzles.\n\nA puzzle game lives or dies on the quality of its puzzles. The Witness, without doubt, contains more puzzles, and in a higher density, than any other game I can think of. The game does a fantastic job of training you and making sure you understand how the different rules for each puzzle work, and all without a single word. It's just a shame that they're not fun.\n\nYou see that trailer up there? Those line puzzles in the first 20 seconds or so? That's it. That's the game. Hours and hours of doing that.\nYou might have seen people sarcastically quoting critics, saying "It's nothing but line puzzles!" And they're right. No matter how you slice it, every single puzzle is based on drawing a line from a start point to an end point, usually on a grid. Usually there are some rules to follow. Maybe in some you have two lines, or maybe you have to group colours together, or maybe the grid is a different shape, that kind of thing. It doesn't matter. The beautiful world is wasted as you run around looking at lines and grids on a screen. Or maybe the grid is on a wall. Or maybe on the floor. Maybe it is the floor. It doesn't matter. There is no variation. I could print out every single puzzle in the game and staple them together and miss out on absolutely nothing.\n\nWhen're not puzzling, all you can do is walk around the island in silence, searching for line puzzles or audio logs. And there's always a puzzle lurking somewhere, ready to jump out and bore you to death. Your reward for finishing a line puzzle? Another line puzzle. Maybe that line puzzle you just did will open a door to some more line puzzles. Maybe it will move a platform so you can get to even more line puzzles. Or maybe a panel right next to the line puzzle you just solved will pop open revealing yet another line puzzle. It's endless. And even though each puzzle is unique, they don't feel it. Each puzzle blurs with the one before it, an endless stream of the-same-but-different. As soon as you complete a puzzle, you either follow the wire to the next one or watch another screen with another puzzle turn on, over and over without end. Another grid, another line. There was exactly one "A-ha!" moment for me: the hedge mazes. These were easily the best puzzles in the game. Why? Because they're just barely connected to line puzzles at the end of them.\n\nScattered around are audio logs and videos of some people spouting philosophy and Zen teachings. You could try and listen to them, but why bother? There's no story.There's an allusion of one, I'm sure - A logo shows up again and again on various items  - but there's nothing to give it form.\n\nAfter a few hours of lines, my initial enthusiasm faded rapidly. I went from, "How do I solve this?", To "Oh God, not another one". The puzzles quickly go from being novel to being a chore, and some puzzles will shut off if you fail them, requiring you to go back and re-solve the previous one to reactivate it. Some of the puzzles seem to exist for no reason, too. There are strings of puzzles in some of the areas that just end. No follow up, no shortcuts, nothing. The puzzle chain just stops and leaves you wondering why you just did all that, especially when the skill that it teaches you is never used again.\n\nAfter 10 hours, I'd had enough. At first, I started looking at hints to see if I was moving in the right direction. However, boredom quickly gives way to frustration, and I used a walkthrough to find how to get the remaining 3 of 7 lasers to get to the final area, and then to get through final area itself, where the puzzles start at incredibly difficult and end at impossible.\n\nAnd when you beat the game, what do you get? A vague idea of anything that happened? Nope. Game over, the end.\n\nFinally, the biggest problem I have with this it is the price. £30 is absurd. Avoid this, unless, after reading all that, you're still convinced you want it, wait until it's much, much cheaper. Like, 1/3rd of the price.\n\nDespite all that, I don't hate The Witness. It's not a bad game! It's well put together and the island is nice to look at if nothing else. It's just not the game I thought it would be.\n\n\nIf you want to play a better first person puzzler, go and buy either:\n\nThe Talos Principle\n\nor Fract OSC\n\nOr hell, even Myst","February 5","false","14.3"," 88 of 122 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","88","122","4","0"

I'm going to avoid spoilers because it is still a relatively new game, but the best thing that I can compare it to is a book of 700 sudoku puzzles.  It's fun to sit down and do a few on an airplane from time to time, but doing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle just feels like tedium -- especially once you've figured out the basic logic and just need to work through 5 or 6 possibilities and do some process of elimination.\n\nIn addition, the game tries to "spice up" the puzzles from time to time by putting them on flickering screens or wrapping them around columns.  Doing so doesn't really add anything to the game.  A flickering screen just means that I have to whip out video recording software (or just spam take screenshot) and leave the game to solve the puzzle.  A column means that I have to pull out pen and paper, diagram the puzzle, and keep going.\n\nFortunately, the puzzles are all well designed and fair, in my estimation.  I didn't find any bugs or have any correct solutions rejected, which speaks to an impressive amount of testing that has gone into this game.  Unfortunately, there are just too many of them for the relatively few "ah-hah" moments that you get from figuring out new mechanics.\n\nThere isn't a story or any real motivation to what you're doing.  The island begs a lot of questions, but never answers them -- worse still, the experience isn't even fleshed out.  I can live with a story that doesn't get tied up nicely at the end, but the story that you can see on the island feels like a 10 page exerpt from the middle of a 300 page book.  There is no beginning, no ending, and no progression or change whatsoever.\n\nFinally, there is a collection of short audio logs scattered throughout the island and a few longer ones too (anywhere from 3 minutes to over an hour) on whatever Jonathan Blow felt like including in the game, presumably things he has found enlightening.  It's heavy handed zen that feels completely out of place.  There is a particularly egregious instance of this late in the game (minor spoiler follows) where an optional puzzle requires you to listen to an hour long lecture to receive completion credit.  Mercifully, you can walk away from your computer and let it complete on its own a-la the Braid cloud.\n\nAs a fan of puzzles (I've attended many MIT mystery hunts on competitive teams), philosophy, and good 'ol Braid, I'm really shocked that I didn't enjoy this game.  But the fact is that I didn't -- playing this game felt like a chore.  I've only gotten the basic ending, but I've been put off by this enough that I don't have any interest in digging deeper myself -- I've youtube'd the rest.\n\nAll in all, The Witness tries to pass itself off as a 40 hour, near-AAA title by making 700 variants of the same 20 basic puzzle rules.  This struck me as mostly annoying and not very challenging or creative.  This game could and should have been condensed into a 10 dollar, 50-puzzle package with an accompanying book of quotes and lectures that were particularly influential in Jonathan Blow's life.\n\nIt's hard to believe that this got universal acclaim by all of the pre-release reviews -- maybe it's just me?

In hindsight, I later changed it to positive.\n\nThe Witness is definitely a game that you'll either love or hate. For me, it was a love-hate-love-hate journey.\n\nWhen it started, I was captured by the environment, the design, the colors. The puzzles looked smooth and fascinating. Everything was mysterious, and the promise of a hidden narrative pushed me onward. That was love.\n\nAfter a while, I realized that the promised narrative (and I say promised because the Steam's misleading description clearly promises it, by stating "You don't remember who you are, [..] but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home") is a failed promise. There is no narrative here, other than what you might imagine by yourself, as if looking at a stone cold sculpture. Solving puzzles has almost no consequence. Many little things I didn't care about before (like some puzzles requiring millimetrical positioning in the world, but the engine not supporting analog joystick movement) began to annoy me. That was hate.\n\nI moved on. I decided to ignore the missing narrative, to try and just enjoy the puzzles, and the dedication with which the island was crafted. It worked. There is so much richness in The Witness' island, and so many relations between elements. Like that one statue which, if looked from the right perspective, wants to hold hands with a farther one. It's like a beautiful alien mechanism that pushes you to find its deeper connections (only later I realized those connections weren't really meaningful and mostly random, which can still be a beautiful thing but, you know, it depends). That was love again.\n\nFinally, I reached the last part of the game. And the puzzles (and the misleading narrative) decided to troll me more evidently. Instead of implementing new ideas, they used dirty tricks like flashing lights and colors and glitchy monitors. They were trying to hurt me, physically. To solve one batch I ended up nauseous. To solve another my vision became blurry for a while. And mind you, these puzzles are not skippable: you HAVE to hurt yourself to go on. Every game developer knows you don't do flashing lights and colors, because on a wide range of people they can have really bad effects, and the eyes are a delicate thing. That was hate, again.\n\nThen there was the ending(s). I won't say anything about it to avoid spoilers, but let's just say that, when I connected the dots, I realized that The Witness is just a big FU to players, possibly to humanity. Its anti-philosophical philosophy sways from intellectual frigidity to adolescent depth, from incoherent nihilism to detached positivism, and is overall like a Möbius strip, rolling over itself without anywhere else to go. The Witness didn't have anything to say, other than that it hated me.\n\nI never wrote a negative Steam review (other than for the horrible Godus), and I thought I'd write this while still recommending the game. Because, as I mentioned, the island is beautiful, and most puzzles really cool. But then I thought about it more. Yes, I did love part of this, but at this price (please note, I was initially a big supporter of its high price), I can't recommend a game that hates you, and cheats you into believing there's a narrative which is not there. So. My two cents.\n\nEDITIt's been a few days now, and I decided to change my review to positive (while leaving my previous words untouched). When I initially finished The Witness, I was angry and very annoyed. In hindsight though, the game's merits feel bigger than its demerits. Sure, I still believe it's a carefully and beautifully crafted empty shell (I'm not really sure if it wanted to be more but couldn't, or if it decided to embrace/show its own limits with frustrated anger) with an overall FU message, but it has a lot of potential, and I hope it will pave the way for better games, both as a culture and as a media. Also, as I mentioned in the review, most puzzles, even if inconsequential, are really good. They have a great learning curve, are well connected to each other, and never feel frustrating (except the "I want to physically hurt you" ones towards the end).\n\nSo. The Witness is, in my humble opinion, a glorious puzzle game on possibly the most beautiful virtual island I ever saw. Other than that, even if it fails at being more, it still shows such potential that it's a game you should play, to see it for yourself.","February 9","true","31.7"," 90 of 126 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","90","126","2","12"

And this is where it surprised the living bees out of me, because in spite of all that's written above this game turned out to be very fun and addictive.\n\nThe secret is, obviously, in the puzzles. They're quirky. They're inobvious. They're varied. They require you to pay attention to your surroundings and sometimes to think creatively. They're not too hard, at least those that you need to solve to get the base ending, but they make you feel smart, and make you feel like you've achieved something by solving them. But yes, there're much harder ones in the game too, they're just optional.\n\nRemember the first Portal? Remember those puzzles that seem unsolvable, but then you think about them for a couple of minutes and arrive at a solution? Well, the Witness basically embodies it.\n\nThis is pretty much controlled creativity, and that is what makes this game so addictive. A typical puzzle in the Witness is like this: you see a panel with the puzzle, you think, holy ♥♥♥♥, this is so hard and/or impossible to solve, I'm gonna quit the game now. After five minutes you go back and attempt to solve it. You realize that it wouldn't actually be all that hard, there's a pretty straightforward way to solve it, but, oh no! O cruel heavens! It's blocked. It forces you to think of the alternatives. You try something that is bound to fail once, twice, and then you get an idea. You try to realize it, and on the first or the second try you most likely solve the puzzle. Hooray, you clever you. Now go and repeat it with the next one - and this is important! - not really a harder one.\n\nThe difficulty of the puzzles is pretty much universal. There're really simple puzzles, sure, but they're there to teach you the rules. Nobody explains you the rules in a human language. You figure them out yourself, by solving puzzles. This is nonverbal communication Jonathan Blow is so fond of. and this makes the game very accessible and very interesting. Whatever language you speak, it's mostly irrelevant, you'll still be able to finish the game. You'll miss on some philosophical quotes, but for me they didn't add all that much to the experience. And you'll learn a new language, a language of a line going through mazes.\n\nThe puzzles are divided into logical and enviromental, and you'll have to figure out yourself which are which. There're several zones with different kinds of puzzles, and within those zones the puzzles usually go from easy to slightly not easy, in fact not easy at all, in fact, they are hard as ah nevermind, solved it. Also, the puzzles are very local: if you know the rules behind each symbol, you'll be able to just go ahead and solve everything the location has to offer on the spot. But knowledge is often not the case, so you have to go somewhere else and find some puzzles you can actually solve - most often the tutorials for the symbols - and then return and say, yah! It's still not easy at all, but at least I know how to approach it now. Unless those were the enviromental puzzles, and you had to find something relevant in your surroundings. In which case the puzzles are still as mysterious as an emerald doughnut.\n\nSo this is the Witness, a game where you're rewarded for solving puzzles with feeling clever, and this is somehow enough. If you're able to enjoy originality and quirkiness, and are not too demanding about the presence of the plot, please, do play this game. It's basically like believing in six impossible things before breakfast. Except all six start at the big circle and go through a maze the right way while not crossing themselves.\n\nP.S. Interpreting colours correctly is a big part of the game, so if you're colourblind, do safely ignore it. There're also puzzles based on sounds, but they're optional for the base ending, though encountering them may be frustrating.","February 19","true","34.7"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","55","72","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/memelover222/recommended/210970/","memelover222","Pete, King of the Detectives","http://steamcommunity.com/id/memelover222/","209 products in account","Seven and a half years after the release of indie darling Braid, Jonathon Blow is back for revenge with another puzzler: The Witness! This newest game is in many ways quite similar to Braid: the puzzles themselves are (for the most part) very well thought-out, the visuals are interesting, and the rest of the game is a complete mess. Braid was a much shorter experience, though, and a lot of the really stupid ♥♥♥♥ didn't show up until after you beat the game and received access to Blow's attempt at a plot (really just an infodump). The Witness, being much much longer, gives the player plenty of time to think about what went wrong during the making of this game.\n\nThe majority of the game's puzzles revolve around the use of various symbols that each denote specific rules that must be kept in mind when solving the puzzle in question. Black and white dots must be separated, tetris blocks must be drawn into the grid, and colored balls must be grouped into pairs. I wouldn't really call any of these spoilers, as the way the game introduces these symbols makes it fairly obvious what their specific rules are. As the game progresses, these symbols are combined and used in increasingly more complex ways, and I would say that this is the one part where The Witness isn't a complete failure. The way that the difficulty progresses feels very natural, and I never found myself stuck on any one puzzle for a very long time. It is when the game deviates from these mechanics that things go downhill.\n\nSeveral areas of the game choose to completely forgo these symbol-based puzzles, with often tedious results. The environment-based puzzles are never difficult: Blow obviously realized that during the development of the game, so the way that these puzzle mechanics evolve just makes them more annoying to solve. For example, one area's gimmick is that you have to listen to bird calls and map out puzzle solutions based on high, medium, and low notes. As you progress through the area, the bird calls begin to get interrupted by other noises, such as wolf howls and jackhammers. Instead of making the puzzles more difficult to solve by increasing their complexity, The Witness chooses in these cases to just make it take longer for the player to get the information they need. Again, these environmental puzzles become extremely tedious: you already know what you have to do, but some silly gimmick has been added that means the puzzle takes five times as long to solve as it should.\n\nThe game's final area has its own share of problems, which I'll put in spoiler tags. It seems as though our pal Jonathon ran out of ideas for the last hour or two of the game, because most of the puzzles you encounter are extremely simple, with stupid one-off gimmicks that, like the environmental puzzles, add zero real difficulty. Some of the puzzles are at weird angles, some are overlayed with a checkerboard pattern, and some spin around in circles. Considering how long this game has been in development for, I can't believe that these puzzles were kept around.\n\nAnother problem lies with the way that the puzzles are integrated into the game's world. Most of the game involves solving a series of puzzles, each on its own separate panel, which then unlocks a door to the next series of puzzles. Granted, these are very good puzzles, but it rarely feels like I even need to be on an island at all. In only a few instances do these puzzles have any impact on the world other than activating machinery: in the treetops area, for example, the puzzle panels that you solve slowly form bridges that you use to cross from tree to tree. A few puzzles can be solved in more than one way, and depending on how you solve them, the direction of the bridge changes. As it stands, though, there exists very little relation between the game's puzzles and the game's world.\n\nThe final major problem, I would say, is the issue of player motivation. The only draw here is the puzzles; if you do not love solving puzzles (in fact, a specific type of puzzle), there is zero reason to buy this game. There is no plot, no lore, nothing exists to motivate those who maybe aren't so keen on the puzzles but want to learn more about this strange island that they're on. In fact, Blow decides to further exacerbate things by dropping audio logs all over the place. No, these aren't recordings made by the people on the island who all apparently turned into statues: they're quotes from famous scientists, artists, and thinkers of the world, telling you about how amazing the world is and how powerful we all are! What's worse, there exists a hidden theater where, by inputting the correct puzzle solution, you can watch unrelated video clips that I guess were meant to "blow your mind". Of the three that I found, there's a clip of James Burke talking about how science is the greatest thing ever, one of Richard Feynman talking about the hierarchy of the universe and why he studied physics, and the ending of Tarkovsky's Nostalghia taken out of context. Really, all of these clips and quotes and whatever other ♥♥♥♥ was thrown into the game seem to have no purpose for being there. Blow just wanted to sound smart by having a clip in his game where an astronaut talks about how cool space is.\n\nI went into this game deliberately avoiding any information I might find (hopefully I don't ruin the magic for anyone reading this ♥♥♥♥). I knew that there were two possibilities: either there was a really interesting backstory, or there wasn't. Not knowing which of these was true meant that, at least for most of the game, there still existed within me a small glimmer of hope that The Witness would end up as something more than a collection of interesting puzzles (not counting the environmental puzzles, ♥♥♥♥ that). It was only during the game's ending, when you fly around the island, disembodied voices say a few unrelated words, and then the game closes itself that I realized that I had been duped. Since I enjoyed the puzzle aspect of the game, it didn't hit me as hard as I would assume that it would hit someone expecting more, but it was still a pretty big disappointment. The Witness just doesn't seem to understand what it wants to be. If you took away the entire island setting and turned The Witness into a traditional puzzle game with a level select system (a la SpaceChem, Mario's Picross, World of Goo, etc), you would certainly lose very little. Sure, I enjoyed exploring the island, but it never felt like a necessary part of the game to me.\n\nSo, while The Witness is interesting purely as a collection of puzzles, it makes very little effort to justify the existence of its island setting. Outdated concepts such as "plot" and "lore" are superseded by audio logs talking about how cool our planet is. While 50-60% of the puzzles are very well-designed, the rest involve gimmicks that only serve to bore any competent player. Despite the game's flaws, I did enjoy it. However, I would only recommend it to those interested in solving a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of puzzles.\n\nTaster's score: C-\n<!> PUZZLE FIENDS ONLY <!>","January 29","false","14.9"," 505 of 816 people (62%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","62","505","816","25","33"

Had this been sold for half the price on the basis of "I've thought up some interesting mechanics to stick into a maze/grid puzzle, here's 500 or so of them" I'd have probably quite enjoyed solving a few dozen of them. The problem is that The Witness promises intrigue and a story which it nevers delivers on.\n\nThe puzzles are okay but being limited to just pathing a line through a grid means that solutions at times are pushed past what is reasonable and mechanics are introduced which are just plain bad. There are parts to game where you need to use sound to solve puzzles but this isn't always made obvious and later in the game some puzzles have their difficulty increased by using flashing colours and disorienting, moving grids. A bit cheap for a thinking-mans puzzle game.\n\nThe game does have some nice sections and some of the more enviromentally based puzzles are satisfying but they can't make up for the lack of depth or the missing narrative which gradually saps your enthusiasm. The environment is pretty, and the world design is interesting to discover but I can't help wishing they'd given us some way to interact with all that beauty.\n\nI think most players will walk away from The Witness thinking what a great experience it could have been but feeling short changed by the promise of solving the larger mystery of the world and not entirely impressed by some of the games tricks for artificially stretching the difficulty of the puzzles.\n\n\nAdditionally, I found it very interesting to look through the other negative reviews of this game and notice how many others that don't usually review games have made the effort to express their disappointment of The Witness. I know hype sells but the blurb in 'About This Game' saying "discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home." is basically a bare-faced lie.","May 13","false","14.8"," 55 of 78 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","55","78","0","1"

I went into this with preconceived notions, complained a bit about its price, etc., but over time, it became a definite Game of the Year contender for me.\n\nIt respects the player's intelligence and ability/willingness to figure things out without hand-holding, and it gave me a lot to think about regarding my own curiosity, biases, and existence.\n\nIt's rare for something to completely surprise me, but The Witness is no ordinary game. I can't recommend this one enough. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that's as creative, surprising, and disciplined as anything I've ever played.\n\nI've been asked by some friends how it compares to something like The Talos Principle. This is a good question, and both games deal with philosophical issues, like what it means to be human and the persistence of what we leave behind.\n\nBoth games are great, but overall, I liked The Witness more. While the puzzles are arguably not as spatially complex as Talos', I think the ones in The Witness are more focused. There's more story content in Talos, but a lot of The Witness' lasting appeal is in how the player digests its clues and fills in the gaps.\n\nI realized earlier this week that this game, which is pretty much built around a single game mechanic (drawing a line from one point to another), kept me completely engaged the entire time, and even as I type this, all I want to do is jump back into it.","February 24","true","39.3"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

I was shocked to hear that this game took 7 years to make, because it feels so empty outside of the puzzles.\n\nThe game sells itself as hiding a deep and profound story, the hidden mystery of the island that waits to be discovered, but the truth is that there is nothing substantial behind the pretty visuals. When I first explored I was fascinated by the strange people turned statues and eager to explore what had happened to this strange island and why I was brought here. What little answers there are, that the island is just an inception-style constructed dream that you have entered for an unexplained purpose, are unsatisfying and completely disconnected from the world you explore and any clues you can find, only becoming apparent in the hidden ending.\n\nYou can pick up audio logs throughout the world, but they also explain nothing. The quotes about religion, science, and discovering the truth of the world feel utterly unrelated to the actual game content, other than that you are discovering "the truth" about how to solve puzzles. Their only purpose as far as I can tell is to make the game seem artificially deep and profound. The secret hidden audiologs also contribute little to the absent plot, they are only scenes of the voice over people debating which quotes to put into the dream.\n\nThe store page description is a complete lie.\n\n"You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you.\n\nYou don't remember who you are, and you don't remember how you got here, but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home."\n\nReading this after completing the game I'm shocked. Memories? Clues? Who I am and why am I here? The game does not even attempt to explore any of this.\n\nOther than the core puzzles of the game that open doors or lead you to the main ending and the challenge area, the puzzles feel compeltely pointless. There are extra puzzles off the main path that seem to do nothing when they are completed. At first I thought I was discovering some secret that required investigation, but in the end it turns out they do absolutely nothing. The environmental puzzles, an interesting surprirse when first discovered, also seem to do nothing, and don't provide any further insight into the non-existant story.\n\nIf you really like puzzles and don't want anything more than that, you will probably enjoy that aspect of the game. but I would recommend waiting for a drop in price before spending so much money on this game.","January 30","false","32.5"," 86 of 132 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","86","132","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drgentleman/recommended/210970/","drgentleman","Heroman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drgentleman/","632 products in account","After seeing only negative reviews on the front page for this game, I felt I needed to chime in.\n\nThis is a thinking man's game.  If you cannot appreciate meticulous detail, subtle hints, painstakingly hidden environmental details, or are not inclined to perfectionism, this game is not for you.  Many reviews I've read apparently have a hatred for puzzles, which is 95% of what this game is about.  If you are easily frustrated and despise the idea of learning interesting new mechanics, well, why did you think paying $40 for this game was a good idea?\n\nIf you require instant gratification, this isn't the best use of your time and money.\n\nHowever, if you're like me, and have a deep appreciation for brain-benders and don't mind being stumped on a dozen different puzzles at once, you need to get this game.  There is a perplexing draw to the whole experience - the promise of an overarching puzzle within a puzzle within all of the other puzzles you're solving.  It's not just about navigating several hundred mazes.  It's about what you learn, what you feel, how you think, and the way you process the sights and sounds of this precisely engineered world.  There are times where you will break the fourth wall for yourself and think, "How did they program that?" yet remain in awe of the task you've just completed.\n\nThat's really what I appreciate about this game.  I haven't felt this satisfied with a gaming experience since the original Dark Souls.  I'm reminded heavily of that game's brutal difficulty when going into it as a brand new experience.  This game draws multiple parallels despite being a wholly different genre.  In Dark Souls, after defeating a notoriously difficult boss after numerous attempts, the feeling of victory is nearly unrivaled - that is, until you play The Witness, and solve a series of puzzles over the course of an hour that leave you feeling like a genius.  It will require plenty of intuiting, and the occasional figurative slamming of your head against a wall, but nothing in this game requires brute force.  It is all learned, it all builds upon itself, and it all, majestically, simply, cohesively... works.\n\nSome of the later puzzles will really test your ability to navigate intimidating labyrinths as you plot every scrupulous step.  I was stubborn in my tackling of such puzzles, as I never wrote anything down or made diagrams until much later.  Side note, I would recommend writing things down and making some diagrams.  Maybe take a picture of your screen.  Or don't, like me!\n\nIt doesn't hurt that I'm playing on a 55" 4K TV with a 980 Ti.  The attention to detail, regardless of the painterly overtones, is not lost on me.  While plain from a distance, up close is where the magic truly shines.  The color grading and art direction going from different zones of the island are incredible, evoking a totally different feel within seconds of traversal.  Were I not to enjoy the puzzles, this game would still be a joy of a sight to behold.\n\nThis game is this generation's Myst, no doubt about it.  Playing this felt like I was touring Jonathan Blow's synapses, and getting a glimpse at how beautiful the human mind can be.  Without flattering the developer too much, I think of this game as a genuine gift to gamers worldwide, and its fastidious creation over the last 7 years or so is without a doubt a labor of love.\n\nSo, I have a lot of high praise for this game, but it's not quite perfect.  If I were to complain about anything, it would be the lack of exposition, and the really-quite-terrible audio logs: Strewn and hidden about the world are different tiny recorders you can activate, and each one is narrated by a person reading a quote by someone who sounds really full of themselves, and loves hearing themselves speak about things that sound smart but are in fact common knowledge.  There are quotes from religious authors, astronauts, Albert Einstein... and they're all grating, and frankly, weird.  After I time I stopped activating the logs because they were intrusive and annoying to my experience.  I actually hate this aspect of this game, but thankfully it's optional.  I didn't find my first one until about an hour or two in, so it was a cool surprise, which rapidly devolved once I realized how utterly lame they were.  I'm sure they thought this was a good idea, but in practice, I thought it was pretty awful.\n\nThere hasn't been a single puzzle I haven't enjoyed solving (except for the really easy ones which are not challenging).  I don't think you can ask much more of a game that entirely revolves around such, but the developers really did go above and beyond, and made the otherwise mundane into a masterpiece.

I never played Braid, nor do I know much about it, so I came to this without zero knowledge of Jonathan Blow’s previous work. Whether that works for or against someone, I don’t know, but what I’ll say is The Witness is definitely an adventure.\n\nTo start, I suck at puzzles. I played Sigils of Elohim, had my fiancé help with me most of them. My brain just doesn’t work like that. But from reading all the info on The Witness, I had to try it, so I bought it at launch. My first thought was, this is an indie game? At $43.99 (CAD), it’s definitely not priced like an indie game. I was a little hesitant, but my willpower lost and I bought it, and it has not been a bad purchase in the least.\n\nIn the roughly five hours I’ve played, I’ve gone through several areas; symmetry island, orange forest, the hedge mazes, tree monastery, marsh, desert, quarry, and I’m now heading off to whatever location is next. I’m enjoying what very little information is given in the audio logs you find, but I’ve only found three so far, so there’s definitely a lot more to go. I’m refusing to use a guide and so far have been able to get by without.\n\nProsPuzzles all follow the same basic idea (line puzzles), but the variety is excellent and the sheer amount of them will keep you playing\nFiguring out how puzzles work (using light that casts a shade on the correct path, or aligning your view to a distant object) is the best part, in my opinion\nBits of story you get from the various audio tapes is interesting\nThe world is beautiful in its simplicity, and is a joy to explore\nSound effects do a great job of immersing you, even ones that aren’t part of the puzzles\nThe lack of music works quite well in the game’s favorConsI’d have liked at least a little bit of info or backstory on why we are here and what we’re doing\nYou can’t jump, not even slightly, and there are invisible barriers everywhere, meaning you have to walk along the path, and if you need to go down or up, you need to keep going instead of slightly adjusting your location\nI’ve yet to get to the end, but with two achievements and being single player, it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of replayability once everything is solvedSummaryThe Witness is an excellent game. It’s an excellent experiment, as well. The puzzles are one part of the game, and in order to solve them, you need to figure out how they work, and that’s the real fun. Does this particular tree with its leaning branch indicate a path I should take? Or is this particular tree a red herring, designed to screw with me and further complicate the puzzle?\nJonathan Blow has crafted an excellent world, one I can’t wait to finish exploring. If you’re a fan of puzzles, you’ll enjoy it too. Try not to use a guide unless absolutely necessary, as that will detract from the very point of the game.","February 6","true","7.5"," 67 of 106 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","67","106","0","0"

The island is riddled with statues, recordings, and items left behind like something happened here and you want to find out what.\n\nWhile some of the puzzles can be irritating, for the most part they are incredibly well designed. There were puzzles used in this game like I've never seen before. It constantly blew my mind... until the end.\n\nThis game has, hands down, the most dissapointing ending I have ever experienced.

There were a number of puzzles that made me laugh at myself for not seeing the forest for the trees or vice versa.  There were also hard won victories over puzzles that seemed impossible at first, but just took a better understanding of the rules.  I also quite enjoyed several accidental discoveries of easter eggs or of different types of puzzles on the island.  One's perspective became so very important.  It was a wonder to see how many types of puzzles could be constucted from a simple grid and how the types could be combined.  And all this without a manual.  I must admit I had to brute-force my way through some puzzles and relearn what it means to be patient.\n\nI had been anticipating the release of this game for some time, but understand how complex it must have been to get the puzzles just right and provide enough clues for players to figure things out on their own.","May 9","true","216.6"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","23","29","0","0"

Can't recommend:\n\n-Draw a line through your numpad (start at bottom left of one and end at top right of 9) where multiples of 4 are grouped together, 2 multiples of 2 are grouped, the number of turns you make must equal at least two other numbers in a section added together, and all the numbers in a particular section must be a prime number when added up. Sound fun? Not for me, and that's what some of the puzzles in The Witness are like. To be fair, some puzzles are really interesting and utilize the environment in cool ways. No problem with these. Others are like that example, just too logical for my tastes. I found myself knowing what the rules to a particular puzzle was, but having trouble figuring out the exact pattern it wants me to have. It's a bunch of trial and error until you get a line that works with the conditions you already know about. Like an overly complicated Sudoku. It might be hard and challenging, but not interesting to me at all.\n\n-The design goal was to capture the "ah ha!" moment, but the annoying part is that it forces you to have these. Meaning, there's no grey area. You either know it or you don't. In a game like Portal, you can clearly see if your idea will work or not, just by looking at it. You can get halfway through an idea, see it wont work, and go from there. There's a system in place that you slowly begin to understand. In The Witness, there is no system in place, you will either know exactly what to do or are completely lost.\n\n-Returning to the game (or a puzzle) later will completely suck because you'll forget the specific rules to certain puzzles. Later puzzles require you to know the rules to previous puzzles, so your only option (if you happen to forget) would be to resolve the earlier puzzles. I'm not interested in backtracking through puzzle ideas.\n\n-There's no way to tell if you don't know what to do. You might just not have all the info you need. There might be a puzzle on the ohter side of the map that tells you how to solve this one. There might not. No way to differentiate the two.\n\n-Traversing the overworld is a pain. There's no reason to have a run button, why not just always be running? You can't fall off of heights and everything is on predetermined pathways. Meaning you have to zigzag through a pattern of rocks on a hill instead of simply going up/down hill. There's no accessible minimap, so if you want to go back to a puzzle, you need to remember where it was or just run around until you find it.\n\n-You pretty need a pen/paper or some type of image program. There are puzzles that require you to flip images, rotate them, and so on, which can get kind of tedious (but is sometimes a little cool).\n\n-There is a ton of puzzle saturation. A lot of the ideas repeat themselves with minor variation, and in a game like this, it's more interesting to know what else is out there, not what's already been done.","January 28","false","1.0"," 109 of 185 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","109","185","4","2"

Thank you. Being TOLD when I can or cannot play a $40 game is a dealbreaker.)\n\nI wish I was playing “The Witness” at this moment. Very much. But I’m not, because I’m currently offline, and it won’t run. Just as reported previously. And the error message again reads, “no internet connection”.\n\nWARNING to anyone considering purchase. It may load offline. It may not. Most likely it will do some of each, as BOTH copies I purchased have done (or not done) to varying dergee when I attempted offline play.\n\nBecause of my considerable interest in this game I succumbed to misinformation from DEVs and childish insults from the community to try it again after obtaining a refund on my original purchase; that it was guaranteed to run offline at the time of my second purchase (and if fact, as was my first copy. Clearly!) Little doubt that if I had little enough self-respect to follow this discussion after this post, I would be told, as I was told then, that I am wrong, and my claims make no sense, and even that I'm stupid. Even though I type this sentence while LOOKING at the “no internet connection” message on my other half of my screen, produced after clicking on the PLAY button for “The Witness.” Over and over and over, as also noted in my previous report.\n\nIt may well be true that “The Witness” does not test for internet access. But it DOES test for Steam, and STEAM apparently sometimes tests for internet access. (Gee!) And if that check is performed, “The Witness” WILL NOT load. Of 800 games I own on Steam, no other offline-playable game has acted in this manner. How is that NOT the cause of the game, and thus the responsibility of the DEVs? (But there aren’t many of us left playing offline, so it’s really no big deal.)\n\nSo next time one of you “braniacs” in the Steam community (including the DEV who offered zero support or consideration, and asked no questions) wants to tell someone how much you know…..\n…please remember, you don’t. Prove it instead by asking the right questions, rather than making assumptions based on ego. OK? Everyone will benefit in some way.\n\n(I just want anyone following after me to not be deceived or manipulated as I was. Buy if you wish, play if and when you can (as, at best, I may continue to do.) I made a mistake of misplaced trust, and I’m prepared to live with it. You others should at least have more information than I did, if not more choice. And please, always trust the evidence of your own eyes and experience.)\n\nYou have my $40 and whatever bizarre personal satisfaction some of you may have derived from my gullibility. I consider this a permanent parting of the ways. Had I been treated more courteously or professionally by any party involved, this posting might very different. As well as any possible interest in any future projects.\n\nAt least endeavor to learn something from this regrettable and avoidable experience.","February 4","false","10.5"," 128 of 220 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","128","220","4","16"

It is probably the best puzzle game ever made - easily better than Portal and the likes!

The island is probably the most precisely and skillfully crafted level in the history of video games - 8 years of development time and it shows. The puzzles and their places on the island are simply amazing.

The most impressive thing about the game to me is how well the game is able to stick to its core mechanic; the game never lets you, say, go back over an existing line you've drawn. The Witness has one base mechanic, and commits to it, and still manages to make deep and complex puzzles out of it, and that will not cease to impress me.\n\nThe problem with The Witness isn't its puzzles, but the game that contextualizes them. The issue is as follows: Almost all of the puzzles in the game effectively have one solution. Maybe you can have a line in a slightly different place, if it's a symmetric board you can obviously mirror your solution, but in a practical sense, there is only one way to solve most of the boards in the game. Yet, to complete the game, you have to complete sequences of these puzzles, one after another; you cannot skip any, nor can you complete them out of order, and often, failing a puzzle will force you to re-solve the last one.\n\nIn a game like Portal, you have to complete every puzzle, but each puzzle has multiple solutions: it's much fairer to require the player to solve each puzzle if it's more likely that they'll find a way to get through it, even if it's sub-optimal. In a game like TIS-100 (I'll try to think of a better example I promise), each puzzle is incredibly difficult, but you can skip a few here and there: the game acknowledges that there might be a puzzle you get stuck on for no good reason, and allows you to try your hand at a different puzzle instead. The Witness is the worst of both worlds: the puzzles that will confuse you, with the frustration of being stuck on it so having to stare at it for way too long.\n\nNote: You *can* leave and go to puzzles in a different area, the main issue is that getting around the island takes way too long; the game has a fast travel system that's slower than just running everywhere. Even if you do leave, you'll still need to solve the puzzle that stumped you eventually.\n\nIt took me a little over 10 hours to "finish" the game (the rest of my playtime is on a challenge area; more on that below), and I consider myself to be pretty good at puzzle games. I said I enjoyed my time with The Witness, but I'm someone who is desperate for puzzle games that present me with an actual challenge, and The Witness sated that desire. If you share that sentiment, you probably already own the game, or know that you want to; for everyone else, I would certainly recommend many other puzzle games before this one.\n\nI said I would discuss the challenge area, but I lied; I really want to tell you about the ending. Not spoiling it, but I will tell you that completing the game resets everything. It's like starting all over again; the game even goes as far as to reset your settings to the default. For a game with a huge amount of hidden secrets and puzzles to explore, this seems absolutely insane; I had left a dozen or so things half-finished when I went to the end, assuming I could just return to them later, and then I was plopped back at the beginning. Not only did this completely kill my interest in exploring the mysteries of The Witness, it solidified my view of The Witness being nothing more than good puzzles in a bad puzzle game. The only reason I played more was to solve the challenge area, which is probably my favorite part of the game; a series of randomly-generated puzzles you solve in a time limit. It's right before the end of the game, so I needed to replay several hours of content to get back there.","February 7","false","14.8"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","28","42","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mogalicous/recommended/210970/","Mogalicous","Trollcop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mogalicous/","138 products in account","This game is a perfect example on why a simple "Yes/No" system is a little too barebones for this kind of video game. I would recommend this game to certain people, but only a select few that I seem to not be part of. The puzzles included in The Witness are interesting and creative, but they are the same general concept of a maze with different gimmicks and ways to come to a solution that require some out of the box thinking. Only an hour in and I found a house where the layout was the solution to the puzzle on the back door. And a lot of times, the puzzles build on the ideas of the previous idea and lead to a series of puzzles with increasing difficulty so you can, as Jonathon Blo put it, understand what the puzzle is saying. There is also a lot of free form design choices that allow you to go where ever and attempt puzzles in many areas on the island at any time, but I have some gripes about that (along with many other parts of the game). Exploring is pretty fun portion of the game, however, as the world seems "frozen"  with many neat and interesting set pieces to examine and how those scenes end up leading to a puzzle with a new idea behind the solution.\n\nHowever, for all the good in the game, it comes with aspects that rubbed me the wrong way. The most minor of gripes I have is the walking speed is pretty slow and the sprint is an alright speed. By itself, the speed isn't bad, but the openness of the game means you'll be in for a great amount of wandering and backtracking, and that means time spent walking from A to B where you've already been. And wandering is a big part of the game since there is no story nor direction, at all; or at least within the first hour of the game. This means the big hook for the game is the puzzles for you to solve, the mazes. There are audio logs, but they seem pretty small and kinda hard to find. I really feel like the setting has promise and there was something interesting that transpired, but it requires a large drive to find anything about it. The puzzles themselves seem creative, but the issue have with them is the series of puzzles that are presented. Some of the puzzles in a sequence will turn off if you don't get them right, but can be reactivated by redoing the last puzzle in the series. This means you have to think about the puzzle and prevent brute force attempts, but get it wrong or test an idea and you'll be walking back to that last puzzle. And with the walking speed, it adds up how annoying it is that I am being punished for trying something in a puzzle game. For me, this killed my interest as I was constantly running back to the same puzzles, speeding through the solution, going back to the new puzzle, and repeating if I get it wrong. And the fact that the core aspect of the puzzles never change, it can get a little daunting as you go from maze to maze with no explict story given, or frustrating if you get stuck at a puzzle and have to go find another to do. And even with the very open areas, sometimes you'll come across puzzles that haven't been activated, so that means finding one that is turned on. It can be a little tiresome if you follow a line of puzzles to one end, only to realize that it's the wrong end. Also, J.B. included something that becomes impossible later. And that really rubs me the wrong way.\n\nSo, The Witness. Should you get it? Maybe, depends on if you like iterations and new ideas blended into the same core puzzle gameplay and if you don't care about hand-holding whatsoever. Like with the way Braid was a platformer, this is a exploration game with mazes. It is difficult to say yes or no for such a niche game such as this. That being said, the big thing is, Braid was $15 and this is $40. So, the question is, is it worth the $40? I say no to that price: the puzzles are interesting but don't offer enough variety to make up for the lack of story telling present and there are too many things that make me unhappy about the game, or I just don't have the mental capacity and critical thinking to really enjoy this. But if you can work with finding new ways to solve the same sort of puzzle, then perhaps you can find this brain-bending puzzle game up your alley. A good baseline is, do you like Space chem? If you do, this game might be worth looking at.","February 4","false","1.2"," 63 of 107 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","63","107","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acaediam/recommended/210970/","acaediam","Acaediam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acaediam/","216 products in account","Do you remember Lost?\n\nI mean, I don't; by the time I was aware of it, the show had gone on too long for me to start from the beginning, and I was never very interested in it anyway. Largely, my impression of it was and is that the writers started with a few interesting mysteries, but then, in an effort to seem clever, just kept adding more and more "inexplicable" (read: more or less random) events without actually answering the previous questions. By the time it ended, nothing made any sense - the attempt at depth and intrigue had landed more in the realm of obtuseness and pointless confusion.\n\nThat's The Witness in a nutshell.\n\nThere are two major flaws with this game. The first, as previously mentioned, is that nothing even tries to make any sense, and that this is heralded as fascinatingly clever instead of frustratingly lazy. The second is that the puzzle gimmick really does wear out its welcome.\n\nThe first hundred or so grids with various rules and layouts are interesting, even fun. It's a mechanic I haven't really seen anywhere else. The second hundred are okayish, but after a certain point, if you've seen a hundred and seventy-five, you've seen them all. The three hundred or so after that? I started looking up the answers in guides, not because I needed the help, but because I was bored out of my mind solving the same damn thing over and over.\n\nI really wish this game had done more to let the player feel like they were actually impacting the environment. Sure, doors open when you solve the puzzles on them and whatnot, but can you imagine how awe-inducing it could be to see the island actually change around you in response to your progress through the game?\n\nAs it is, I feel that another, different type of puzzle should have been introduced about halfway through. It would have kept the extant mechanics from feeling stale, and could have been combined with the grids to produce new puzzles. My favorite part of puzzle games is the "eureka" moment, where suddenly all the clues align just right in your brain and voila, there's the answer, right in front of you all along. The Witness... doesn't have that. At all.\n\nBut on the whole, that's a lesser crime, compared to the complete lack of explanation or justification for anything on the island. Listen. I would have been totally fine with this if the game had billed itself as, say, "A journey across an eerie, beautiful island, with few distractions but plenty of moments to savor." That'd be fine. But no - to copy and paste directly from the description: "This game respects you as an intelligent player and it treats your time as precious."\n\nLet me repeat that, a little louder for the people in the back: "This game respects you as an intelligent player and it treats your time as precious."\n\nIn my experience, that's exactly what this game doesn't do.\n\nThere aren't even any spoilers for this thing, besides puzzle solutions. There's nothing to spoil. Here's what happens when you finally reach the end of the game, the thing all of these mindbending puzzles have been leading you to: the camera pans around the island, showing off a lovely view of every single puzzle you did being wiped clean, doors closing, machinery shutting down, and then desposits you right back in the hole you started the game in.\n\nThat's what you get, for putting all that work into this game. I don't think the message "you wasted your time, you sucker," could be any clearer. The obelisks don't do anything either, and you can't finish them all in a normal playthrough. As in, it's literally impossible.\n\nIf you like this one specific type of puzzle and you're willing to do just that and only that for zero reward, go for it. Otherwise, save yourself forty bucks and don't bother.","March 5","false","43.0"," 93 of 162 people (57%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","57","93","162","13","10"

(bullet point review)\n\nFirst I'll say I think its not perfect, and I wouldn't give it a 10/10. There are, after hours of play, some things I don't like. I did not like the sets of puzzles which relied on listening to shrill and annoying audio samples to solve. I would like the environment to feel more alive. Where are the fish, insects, birds (wink wink) , small mammals? I suppose I can forgive an indie studio for not having the budget to elaborate on complex animal ambience.\n\nOnto business.\n\nIf you are looking for a game ...\n\n... which challenges you instead of rewards you.\n\n... which isn't bugged to hell or released in alpha as most 'full releases' are these days.\n\n... in which thoughtfulness is encouraged, instead of time-destroying grinding or farming for e-stats.\n\n... where you walk away from it feeling happier than when you sat down.\n\n... which doesn't conspire to get you addicted like many modern games.\n\n... which feels like walking into an art gallery, where ones shoes should be removed upon entering.\n\n... with actual depth. Not the fake depth of grinding to level whatever, but the depth of discovering and understanding complex practical and philosophic puzzles Witness presents you with.\n\n... in which 'sleeping on it' is actually a legitimate method of solving the puzzles.\n\n... where you will walk over a piece of ground a hundred times, not realizing it is the missing piece of the puzzle.\n\n... which you can show your family and friends.\n\n... which doesn't feel like watching a Michael Bay film.\n\n... which is bad by 2016 standards (no perks, leveling treadmills, no addictive hooks, no farming, no worrying about it while you're at work, no peer pressure, no achievements, unlockables, no pay to win, no DLC).\n\nThen you have found a game worth playing.\n\nI won't tell you to like Witness. It is not for everyone. The price feels steep at $39.99. I do believe Witness is worthy enough for you to take a chance with it, and after 10-20 hours of play, deciding then whether you like it, or not.\n\n\n\nJust as a wine collection needs a few fine bottles, your Steam Library needs The Witness.","January 29","true","129.2"," 124 of 220 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","124","220","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/5ro4/recommended/210970/","5ro4","5ro4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/5ro4/","398 products in account","The Witness is pretty much "The Puzzle Game", in a too literal way.\n\nMost of the game consist in a series of puzzles that progress in this fashion:\n\n1.- Solve a puzzle so simple that's almost impossible to fail, not really understanding it.\n2.- Solve a variation of the same puzzle, now deducing what's the rule that makes the solution valid.\n3.- Apply it to a more complicated version of the same puzzle.\n4.- This next puzzle seems impossible to solve. Re-evaluate your assumptions and find out the twist in how the rule can be applied.\n5.- More complicated version of the same puzzle.\n\nAnd some times:\n\n6.- A new rule is introduced. You don't know how it works and it's hard to deduce. Go find the tutorial progression for that rule in another part of the island.\n\nMost puzzles are pretty cool and make your brain click a lot. However, some times you'll find an isolated puzzle that combines ~3 rules and ~7 conditions in a complicated way that crosses the line of what you can mentally solve, making a direct deduction of the solution impossible and forcing you to consider every partial solution you can think of and try out combinations until you find out a valid one that satisfies every rule and meets every condition. It's not so bad that you can't find the solution if you insist for a while (probably), but it will be out of spite or pride, not because you are really enjoying it. Luckily, these are the exception, not the norm.\n\nSadly, the final series of puzzles before the ending is pretty underwhelming, with puzzles that are either a complicated mix of previous rules or a not so complicated puzzle presented in an obnoxious way, like the it will be moving, spinning, changing color, or you can only see one section of the puzzle at a time, basically forcing you to draw them on a piece of paper and solving them there.\n\nThere's also a fair share of environmental puzzles in which you don't have to logically deduce the solution but to find it or reveal it using the environment in different and imaginative ways. These are generally cool, but in some instances they walk a bit too close to the edge of BS or plain obnoxiousness.\n\nThere are also some optional patterns that can be found and activated through the island. Making things align to reveal some of them is really cool, but trying to find them all is probably a lunatic path paved with patience and frustration.\n\nMaybe the most disappointing thing is that the island itself serves little to no purpose. There's no interesting interconexion between areas, no substantial change, no big reveal. There are panels with puzzles, solving those puzzles get you access to more panels, and some times you activate a bridge that let's you reach even more panels.\n\nThere's barely a hint of a story, not enough to even understand what the title is referring to (if it's actually referring to anything) but enough to make you miss a proper one. The game also tries to convey some messages, but it does so in a confuse and pretentious 2deep4u way in which nothing makes more sense or has more meaning than what you are willing to pretend it does.\n\nOverall, it's a really good puzzle game, almost the perfect puzzle game, but feels like it should have been more.","February 3","true","24.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

People looking for a strong story wont find it, but in many ways this game is rather genius. I don't want to spoil it, but the experience, at least what I have so far, is from how you learn and approach the different challenges in your own way and time.  Leaving and returning to different challenges is built into the game design, but overall I have to say I really like this game.\n\nI get that the game is trying to be a metaphysical or philosphical approach to learning, and understanding rules and progression, and that might be why people don't like it. I think it's like learning a language. If you use a walkthrough for a particular puzzle, you might figure it out, but you won't understand the rules for the next one. If someone translates a sentence from another language, you might know what that sentence means, but you have no idea how it was constructed in a certain way.\n\nI never played Braid, but as a puzzle game, this really is eye-opening. As of writing this review, I'/e only seen a "very conservative" amount of what the game has to offer, but there is a lot to the game, and there is plenty of going on with the "island" itself, you just have to look for it in the right places.\n\nThe only issue was the lack of any sound-track, but I think it's warranted given the isolated island setting of the game.","April 7","true","11.6"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeddsdead/recommended/210970/","zeddsdead","Zedd's dead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeddsdead/","1920 products in account","This game is by far one of the best pure puzzle driven games I have ever played. With a little over 6 hours played I would estimate that I have done about 1/3 of the puzzles this game has to offer and I am still compelled to return.  Here is a breakdown of the good and the bad of the game and why I find it so amazing.\n\nGraphics -\nThe graphics of this game are beautiful but very stylized and not overly detailed up close. So, the real draw is how the art is used. Much like World of Warcraft when it first came out, the graphics were not amazing per say, but the sheer artistic vision realized through the graphics is what is impressive.\n\nSound -\nThe sound in this game is designed to keep the tone and feel of the game relaxing and peaceful. While I may not be the best puzzle solver in the world, I am no slouch. There were many times already that I had to think both deeply and creatively to get a solution and the background sound was enjoyable and was not disruptive to my train of thought.\n\nGameplay -\nI have read many reviews of this game and yes... the game is a "puzzle maze" game. Most (not all but most) of the puzzles are all presented on boards for you to interact with. However, to say that this game is just one type of puzzle and boring because of it is like saying the Louvre is just a building full of paint covered canvases (yes I know there are other forms of art there but you get my point). While the game starts out with VERY basic puzzles, they not only get harder later; they evolve and branch out into a myriad of different themes.\n\nStory -\nSince I am only about a third of the way through, I cannot comment on the overall quality of the story, but it is definitely there for those who are paying attention. That is one thing which may be a problem for some: this game may not fully be about "the story". What I have experienced instead so far is more a sense of cohesiveness. Each area of the island has different coloring, temperature (artistically), and culture so that there is a feeling of uniqueness to each area that maps to different puzzle mechanic themes. Despite this, there are several game elements that tie each of these unique zones into a clear whole.\n\nNits -\nSo is the game perfect? No. There is an oddly clunky menu (mostly irrelevant). The textures for the game close up are not amazing (as I hinted at before). There are some poorly designed terrain elements like solving a puzzle to move a small "bridge" across water and having it take an eternity EACH time you do it is silly. Also, the movement mechanics are a bit primitive, so you are sometimes forced to walk around obstacles in the environment due to the inability to even slightly jump. These are not intentional barriers that serve a purpose in separating different aspects of the game; they are just unintended bumps in the road. Finally I have a pet peeve for quasi pretentious quotations from great thinkers that are not directly relevant to the environment and there are plenty of them in the game.\n\nSo, why is this game amazing?\nThe answer is the game's skill at teaching and how it does it. The way the game is set up, each themed area teaches you more and more about the puzzles and how the function. It is not a tutorial, it is not an explanation; it is a journey of discovery as you are confronted with iterations of the same puzzle theme that are increasingly abstract or complex. Never have I seen a game before that is more elegant in using a self-educational model to greater effect. You then get to go back to areas with more hybrid puzzle themes with a clear understanding of how these dozens of mechanics work without anyone uttering a single word to explain.\n","February 4","true","8.7"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","23","35","0","0"

This Beach is incredible!\nBefore I downloaded the game I was reading the reviews about how All Of The Puzzles Are The Same. They are just grid maze puzzles. (I couldn't believe that there could actually be just  hundreds of the same grid puzzles so I Purchased the game).\nSure-Nuff! Hundreds of the same grid type puzzles. I almost wanted my money back as I was reaching the two hour mark but Thank God I didn't.\nThis work is absolutely Fantastic! The longer you explore the island, the more that you learn and discover. Let me explain:\nIn those 1st two hours I came across some of those maze type grid puzzles that made Absolutely No Sense At All. (That was what made me think about getting my money back)\nBut behold! After exploring the Island for awhile, I learned something that made those 'No Sense' puzzles....make perfect sense. Then it was just a matter of solving them.\nIt was that 'eureka moment' when I realized what this game was all about and how complex and vast this game was going to be.\nThe Island is huge and there are So Many places to explore that just the exploration itself will take quite some time; not to mention trying to remember where everyting is.\nThen, of corse, there are the puzzles themselves. Wow, this isn't going to be a cake-walk either.\nSome are easier, of corse, but some are vastly complicated (But Very Logical).\nAn Example:\nI came across a puzzle that made absolutely No Sense At All so I left it and continued exploring. About 10 hours later I discoved a part of the Island that explained the puzzle that I was stumped on. Now I understand the puzzle so I head back to it. OK, so here I am back at the puzzle and I Now Understand what it is all about and what I have to do to solve it.\nHee, hee, but now I have to solve it!\nI worked on it for well over an hour, gave up, and turned the computer off.\nThe next morning I was sitting on our deck and thinking about the puzzle and the answer hit me like a brick.\nI ran inside and solved the puzzle in less than a minute!\nThat is just a hint of what this game is all about. There is a ton of exploration and a ton of puzzles to solve.\nSometimes you work on a puzzle for a long while and when you finally solve it....Nothing happens 'as far as you know'. You feel let down.\nLater you may realize what solving that puzzle actually accomplished and you get that atta-boy feeling.\nOther times, when you solve a puzzle, there will be instant gratification.\nI wish that I could go into more detail to explain the vast wonderous intriging complexities of the game but I don't want to take a chance of spoiling anything for you if you decide to play.\n\nIf you are the type of person that thinks matching three or four of like colored or shaped objects to make them vanish is a puzzle, don't even waste a penny of your money on this software masterpiece.\nIf, however, you are a person that likes the puzzles on MillerWorldInc or some such puzzle site then Don't Even Hesitate For A Second! Purchase This Game!\nI know that the 40 buck price tag seems steep but I have to tell Ya, from what I've seen so far, you are going to get a fantastic ride for less than 50 cents an hour.\n\nIs it like Myst? Not really, because there isn't an intwined story involved.\nIs it like Portal? No, Portal was more linear.\nIs it like The Talos Principle? Kinda, because you have more freedom of movement.\n\nBut, take those three and put them in a blender and you May have an understanding of what 'The Witness' actually is.\nIf you like to explore and solve puzzles....\nGet this from Steam NOW!\n\n\n","February 2","true","103.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

I'm still not satisfied with any puzzle yet. The first area puzzles make me feel like I went back in a discrete mathematic or a programming class. Solving them by logical thinking is not that difficult, but also not a rewardng experience. I felt like those problems are more suitable for computers, not for humans -- the puzzles are so dead that I should "let dead people do the work for me". I understand that the designer intend to isolate pure logical puzzles on board first so that the players will not get frustrated. And because the players have to be skillful enough with such logical thinking (so that they will have less problem later in more advanced courses), there has to be many of them -- repetitive and boring puzzles. This is not a flaw in the design but a consequence of the choice of puzzle made by the author. The sun temple puzzles are more to geometric. However after the first set of puzzles on the surface, the rest of the puzzles stackup more overhead to the player, not fun. First set: 1 reflection, second set: 2 reflections, 3rd set: 2 reflections and a translation... It was like I'm working with a series of mathematical evaluations each evaluation is getting more complex because there is another multiplication term stacking in the rear. How to solve that? I need to do similar process of computation again and again and again, then translate it back into control sequence for the game. The newly introduced gimmick/ideas are not bad but doesn't worth additional chores. The maze puzzle area also has the same problem of "pain > value".\n\nOverall, the puzzles are like multiple sequences of math excercises presented in a book across chapters. Apart from that, I sometimes find it difficult to locate a starting puzzle of a series. Tracing wire is not fun at all... Braid is a lot better. The witness lacks of both atmospherical and emotional punches. I gave a thumb down not because the game is not good. If it is not made by the creator of Braid, the game deserved a big thumb up. I had a very high expectation for this game to be so much better.","January 31","false","4.5"," 112 of 200 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","112","200","0","15"

The Witness takes this one step further. The rules are not always known, and an equal part of the puzzle is even understanding what the rules of the puzzle even are -- and much like David Fincher's "The Game", the fact that you only get to experience it once "for the first time" is a deep regret. That it takes place in on a graphically gorgeous island is merely a bonus. Though the story transcends even the most meta of meta at times, you might be forgiven for being skeptical. Jonathan Blow is not merely channeling the spectral ghost of Stephen King's The Dark Tower and protagonist Roland Delacroix, but has instead become his spiritual sucessor, weaving his personal challenges at constructing a decade long 7th wonder of puzzle into a public offering for the mass market. His talents will speak for themselves.\n\nI am highly critical when it comes to puzzle games, but as a puzzle enthusiast, The Witness has become a core component of my psyche along with a short list of other greats. Zachtronics. Deadly rooms of death. Saira.\n\nIs it worth $40 to a general audience? Maybe not. But I feel it was time very well spent.

If you enjoy games which reward exploration and experimentation, there's a lot to love here - but even then, the game asks a deal of patience of its audience. You will often come across puzzles which you are ill-equipped to solve. The brilliance in the design is that all of the puzzles are entirely solvable with the mechanics available to players from the start of the game; the only real limit on the player is their knowledge of the rules. There are no explicit tutorials, but the knowledge is available to be discovered across the game's beautiful island setting.\n\nIf that sounds a bit vague it's only because I want to respect readers in the same way that the game respects its players, allowing them to explore and discover for themselves the many secrets of the island.\n\nAs you might expect in a game from the designer who brought us Braid, the narrative is very much open to interpretation. This is a game wherein nothing is explicit, and if you require that external drive you may feel rather lost. It helps a great deal to to come into this game with a willingness to think, to be confused, and to keep exploring all the same.\n\nIt's worth noting that colourblind and/or hearing impaired players may have difficulty with some of the game's puzzles, as they rely on an array of sensory clues. I encourage those affected to do more research before diving in.\n\nIt took me about 25 hours to reach the end of the game, completing a fair deal of the optional puzzles along the way - though I suspect the remaining ones could easily take another 5-10 hours to get through, if not longer.\n\nI abstained from turning to the internet for advice the entire way through, and I strongly recommend that other players do the same. The game tells you everything you need to know if only you persevere - and the sense of achievement that comes from overcoming these challenges alone is great. Trust the game; it is fair, and it does want you to succeed.\n\nAll in all this is one of the most impressively designed games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. There is sharp intent behind every aspect of its construction - to a level that often feels absurd - and the result is an incredibly unique and fulfilling experience.","February 3","true","27.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

It's made up of "deep" and artsy poems by characters you don't even know.\n\nFull opinion:\n\nPart of what made me dislike this game is the exaggeration of how great it was. I had heard about this game through tons of positive feedback over how amazingly smart it was and how the creator of the game was a mastermind in his craft. This only leads me to believe that my time spent on this game would be a fantastic and memorable gaming experience. It wasn't. I feel like half of this game shouldn't even exist, unless, it was optional or a harder difficulty. I really don't understand how so many people were stoked on this game.\n\nIt seems as if every set of puzzles in every area had a pattern of  "let's figure this out" to "okay i get it now" to "oh god there's more." Just as the puzzles became managable and at the peak of their difficulty, it would open up a whole new set of puzzles with even more ridiculous challenges. And instead of feeling like I had overcome obstacles with my intellect and hard work, I just felt like I had done a list of chores. Especially considering every single puzzle is the exact same with a slight spin.\n\nPretty soon, it felt like the creators had given up and decided that they could keep players invested by just including more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I had beaten Myst, one of the greatest puzzle games of all time, and have a total of 10 hours spent on it. The Witness took up 20 hours of my time, and I hadn't gotten to all the optional areas and puzzles. Most of it feels like a waste of time, and I found myself tempted to look up solutions because I didn't have the energy to continue. To me, the price of this game does not equal the time spent. I'd much rather play a short and actually FUN game for the same price.\n\nThis game is just a gigantic vague mess in an attempt to sound and look deep and artistic. It wastes your time by giving you way more than you can or should ever chew. While most puzzles start off very interesting and unique, they always end up overstaying their welcome and introducing the most ridiculous ways to make a fun puzzle frustrating. This game might tickle some people's fancy. But I would highly recommend just playing Myst.","April 5","false","18.5"," 82 of 145 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","82","145","6","0"

You can solve puzzles from any area on the island.\nMaximum satisfaction for solving puzzles. The game doesn't hold hands or show anything at all. The only information you get is that you are alone on a strange island (and this information you got from Steam :D). This is different from other games that at least show you a tutorial and explain things around with a tutorial level. The Witness tries to teach you like how kids learn how to walk and then lets you go on your own.\nBeautiful scenary and art all over the island. It is definitely a screenshot magnet.\nA great game for your brain, your eyes, and your ears as some puzzles require all three to be sharp ;).\nNegatives:\n20+ hours in and I'm not sure about the story. All i've got were recordings and some deep hints about life and existence.\nNo animals or other form of life apart from trees and plants. This made it too lonely and sometimes boring. I feel that's why the game had to look extra vibrant and colorful to compensate for the fact that you are alone.\nInconsistent puzzle punishment. Some puzzles would "shutdown" if you get them wrong while others don't. In fact, most of the puzzles I solved didn't punish you if you got them wrong. So I don't understand why some of them punish you while others don't. This is annoying for people who care about symmetry, consistency, and simplicity. The game has all those 3 traits everywhere apart from this aspect which annoyed me.\nFinal Thoughts:\nI'm still not done with the game and will continue to play whenever I have time. I think it is a great puzzle game with amazing game design ideas.\n\nSome people complain about the puzzles being to hard or the game not teaching you why your puzzle logic is wrong, however, those people didn't realize that the game actually teaches the puzzles and how to solve certain patterns but in the right area. Some areas combine knowledge from different patterns and those areas do not provide indication or help on why your puzzle logic is wrong.\n\nIf you like puzzles, art and a challenging game then this game is for you. If you like simpler games with less brain fatigue then this game is probably not for you.","February 1","true","20.5"," 49 of 84 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","49","84","4","0"

Looking back on it a couple months later, I think it's one of the best experiences I've had. Full stop.\n\nTo be sure, this isn't for everyone, and much of the gameplay is solving maze puzzles with increasingly complex rule sets, starting conditions, and interactions beween rules. You end up exploring each rule and the interplay between different rules. In doing so, I was amazed at how many different moments of epiphany are crammed into these mechanics and into the island setting. Almost none of the puzzles are truly hard in hindsight; when it clicks, a surprisingly simple answer tumbles out of the rule set. In that sense, it's more like exploring the consequences of puzzle concepts than solving puzzles (and that is a good and novel thing).\n\nOutside of the puzzles, I'm impressed by the deliberate and thoughtful design: the unique architecture of each house/treehouse/installation, the sound effects and cues for all types of puzzles, the feel of the cursor in the puzzles, the hidden details of the island--visual puns isn't quite the right phrase--that are unrelated to any puzzle. Congratulations to the team that put this much effort into the world and the mechanics. I know I couldn't have noticed everything, but rest assured I was looking.\n\np.s.

Sometimes I would discover a door and I would care until I opened the door the puzzle was blocking.  For the most part, I learned that most of the doors just led to shortcuts through the world and really didn't reveal anything. Sometimes the doors  led to videos on philosophy and science  , but those weren't very rewarding as they didn't really give you insight or reveal what you were doing on the island.\n\nMany times I'd be presented a puzzle where I knew I could solve if I pulled out yet another sheet of graph paper and worked it out, but simply didn't feel like it. So I ended up quitting, playing something else and coming back the next day until the same thing happened. It turns out that is exactly how I approach sudoku or maze puzzle games on my smart phone. Binging on those is exactly what playing The Witness started feeling like. So I got through to the "easy" ending in small doses. Fortunately with everyone complaining about how bad the easy ending was, I was already prepared to be let down. So it wasn't shocking.\n\nThe puzzles in the mountain almost made me stop completely. The only way Jonathan Blow could make the puzzles any harder were to  make them spin and flip and move around . That's when I felt he stepped over a line from intellectual challenge to using cheap tricks to make them harder. It's one thing to present a gauntlet that makes you think outside the box with all you've learned, it's another to have someone jump in front of you waving their arms while you're trying to solve a puzzle. Having to look at those puzzles was unpleasant. Giving your players headaches and motion sickness is not good puzzle design.\n\nInterestingly enough, it wasn't until AFTER the mountain when you can access all these hidden areas you could see through locked gates and inaccessible bridges you saw overhead did the game become fun again. I'm currently going through those puzzles, but I'm yet again, approaching it as I would the sudoku and maze puzzles (Flow Free) on my cell phone. A couple of puzzles at a time and then moving on to my other games. I'm using the same method to find all the environmental puzzles too. I'm simply in no rush to see the other endings.\n\nThe only reason it's worth $40 to me is I enjoyed exploring the Island and the game has lasted a long time. It was a "pleasant" way to pass the time, but the game itself didn't knock my socks off.  Talos Principle still remains as my all-time favorite puzzle game.","February 17","true","44.8"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","29","48","0","2"

Broadly, it's a game about being perceptive, about teaching and understanding, and about discovery. Devoid of wordy descriptions or rule explanations, The Witness invites players to learn naturally while adopting a mindset of attentiveness.\n\nThe ingenuity of the game comes from the fact it takes the "solve line puzzles on grids" mechanic and toys with it as much as possible, squeezing absolutely everything out of it. The grids themselves serve as an input method, a means of interaction with your environment—the game is much more than hundreds of line puzzles on an island. Through these puzzles, however abstract, The Witness does not only (greatly) challenge players, but also incites real human emotion—glee, annoyance, excitement, hatred, wonder, elation.\n\nThe Witness is an ideal example of how a game should be—while it may only appeal to a relatively small subset of players, it appeals to this group greatly, rather than appealing to many players mildly without being overly impressive to anyone. It does not try to please all players, and actively rejects the "low risk–high reward" mold common to the modern video game industry. It's also not every game that necessitates you to get a notebook of graph paper to solve puzzles, or at least exit the game window to visualize your thoughts using Microsoft Paint.\n\n\nSo, why "The Witness"?\n\nThe P versus NP problem, a major unsolved question in computer science and branches of mathematics such as complexity theory, asks: "Can every problem whose answer can be checked quickly by a computer also be [/i]solved[/i] quickly by a computer?" The definition of a problem in NP (e.g. puzzles in The Witness) is that, given a candidate solution, there exists a way to verify that the solution is correct in polynomial time. Reiterating an earlier point, The Witness is more about the discovery of a verifier as opposed to finding an actual, specific solution to puzzles. In mathematical terms, such a verifier is called a witness. The game involves you, the player, searching for the witness to various puzzles.\n\n\nBlog post about this game, with pictures: http://elifessler.com/games/blog/posts/the-witness","February 4","true","65.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

And when I say done I mean it. I didn't just beat the game but I made sure I had done every piece of puzzle and discovered everything there is to discover. I didn't use any help and would guess that I could have finished the game in half that time. So one thing is certain: claims that the game takes almost 100h to completely beat are ridiculous. Unless you require 15m to button your shirt that is.\n\nSo what does the game have to offer? Without spoiling anything, the game does just as it says in the title. In a sense it makes you the witness of its world. But you really trascend beyond that to become an observer even borderline detective.\n\nThe puzzles are all based around the concept of drawing lines through grids or mazes, but according to a set of rules that are not written anywhere. Yet you have eleven distinct areas harbouring one or two sets of puzzles meant to introduce one or more rules. This is the way you progress in knowledge and along the "story line". And by "story line" I mean fulfill the requisits to open up the final area, where you'll be tested on what you've learned.\n\nThe best part to me though was to discover the nature of the game's secrets and then go hunt them down. Some require you to be incredibely observant, others require you to be patient and some require a complete understanding of all the puzzle types' rules.\n\nThis game is definitely playing in the same league as Portal and The Talos Principle. It is beatiful, smart and will test you like I have only seen The Talos Principle do.\n\nWhat I didn't like, were the tapes you can find. Their content is mainly boring and feels out of place, because it lacks continuity. But it's not the main course, so who cares? The game would have been the same without, imo.\n\nI enjoyed the fact that secrets were catalogued according to areas, so that you can keep track of them, but I didn't like the fact that some of the secrets were hidden in a separate challenge area that is tricky to uncover. Actually, my grief is that it has many exits that you can see and taunt you, but only one well hidden entrance, which requires several steps and conditions to unlock. I would have prefered to have no secret in it. It made the catalogues seem off and foced me to look forever in areas I thought I would find them, while they were actually underground...\n\nFinal word of warning: do not play this game if you are colour blind or epileptic (obvious I know). Some puzzles rely heavily on colours to be solved and you would just be unable to finish the game. Same goes for deaf people as some puzzles require sound.\n\nConclusion: I enjoyed it, felt it was worth my money, even fully priced (rare for me). I defenitely got a challenge out of it and felt rewarded most of the way with a few eureka moments here and there, which is all that is needed in a puzzle game. I give 9/10","January 30","true","46.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Be warned though that if you need story, context, or variety in your puzzle format, the Witness can be to some a tiresome slog. The game has beautiful clarity of purpose across every connected component of the location, puzzles, and mechanics, but that purpose is beautiful delivery of puzzles. There's not much in the game but walking around in silence, and dragging lines across your screen.\n\nIts best feature is the difficulty ramp, one of the best I've seen in a long time. It's engagingly difficult, but with variety as well - you at times go from working through a difficult puzzle for 30 minutes to burning through an easy sequence of 5 in under a minute.\n\nThroughout the content I've seen (more than 20 hours worth, about a main-story-and-a-half worth of puzzles), the design in the Witness has so far never felt unfair. While I very much liked both the Talos Principle and Fez, they both felt to me like their difficulty spiked somewhat in the later, optional puzzle content. The Witness never has for a moment to me (though admittedly, I'm not done). In addition, the brilliance of the many independent puzzle sequences is that being temporarily stumped is just an opportunity to go explore and solve puzzles elsewhere.\n\nAgain though, if you need a story, context, or a fundamental variety in mechanics to get you through the 20+ hours of difficult puzzles - and I really wouldn't blame you - best hold off.","February 1","true","55.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The game's scenery/art style is beautiful, but there's no motivational factor in doing the puzzles.  There's practically no story besides you being on a weird island in the middle of no where. In other puzzle games of this sort (Portal and Talos Principle, are two good examples) There's a very direct story on what's happening (In Talos Principle it's not very direct, but at least they leave a trail of audio tapes explaing the mystery of why you're there/what's happening). Many of the puzzles in The Witness are well thought out and make the player think, even though all the puzzles are based off the same 2D line puzzle logic, but if you wanted to just solve 2D line puzzles in a nice enviroment you could grab a sudoku book and play outside.","January 30","false","3.1"," 117 of 214 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","117","214","0","0"

I have some non-puzzle content to wrap up (e.g. hunting down audio logs), but am mostly done with the meat of the game at 515 (out of an alleged 523) puzzles solved. I have achieved both of the games only achievements and experienced what some would call the "secret ending".\n\nWhat an excellent game this is.\n\nThe basic mechanic - the line puzzle - is utilized very well. Maybe half of the puzzles involve symbols on the puzzle panel that you must divine the meaning of in order to proceed. The other half present you with effectively blank slate of a panel and expect you to figure out the pattern it wants you to trace. The line drawing is therefore an input mechanic for puzzles solved "externally" from the panel itself just as much as it is a way to solve puzzles that present themselves to you with no frills.\n\nThe world is split into several puzzle "hubs", and from about 5 minutes into the game you are set free on the island to pursue them in any order. Most of them are independent of each other, but a few leverage knowledge learned from other areas. Eventually you will be expected to combine techniques and puzzle language from each hub area in the games most challenging and rewarding puzzles.\nThe island itself is gorgeous and beautifully realized. It is one of the single most meticulously designed video sets I have ever had the pleasure of exploring. Nearly everything on the island is placed with purpose.\n\nIf I had to complain, it's that the plot is mostly insubstantial; wispy and tenuous. Given some of the messaging within the game itself and the philosophies it describe, this isn't a true negative but I imagine some people will be disappointed. The puzzles and exploring the island are truly their own reward and the very loose narrative provide just a small bit of flavor.\n\nIf you remotely enjoy puzzles then do yourself the favor of buying this game.","February 1","true","39.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Like an eye opening walk through a false wood, where suddenly a miniscule pattern of the overall quiltwork becomes obvious to you. You then trace that pattern, and expand it into deeper and more complex systems, slowly piecing together how the entire world works. This is where you get hooked, that excitement of figuring out the next small iteration that you're already oh-so-close to seeing clearly. If you love the feeling of personal discovery, of learning the rules of a system through your own analysis, experiments, and processing, this is a must play. If you're not sure what that means, and are hesitant to pay the full price without knowing, I recommend checking out Blueberry Garden, as it's under $5.

It hasn't been out for that long, but I have played it for about 30 hours.\n\nFirst thing's first, yes, there's only one kind of puzzle. However, that puzzle evolves in such a way that the puzzle never becomes boring or repetitive. Now, there will be those who might disagree with this, but if you don't want to sit down and solve puzzles, puzzle games aren't for you anyway.\n\nThe graphics... Oh my God the graphics...

It really sticked out to me like it belonged somewhere else but not in this game.\n2) The end game puzzles are a bit too complicated, and I think it damages the overall flow of the game in general.\n3) I believe all your progress shouldn't be erased when you complete the game.

I love that there is no compromise and hand-holding in the sense that we most often see in modern games. Here you gain knowledge on how to solve the line/maze-puzzles by learning and by trial-and-error. There will be many hurdles on the way for the average player but the best moments in The Witness are found along the road rather than at the ending (which can still be great, given the right conditions, especially for those that have been observant to the buzz around the game during the weeks before launch). I have had goosebumps several times and literally stopped and laughed and applauded towards the screen when figuring out something I had been stuck with for a while. The game design is in this regard second to none. You will feel like a genius.\n\nThis could probably not have been accomplished by a too large development team, risking that the overall vision would start to diverge. So when stuck, do what you can to avoid spoiling the game by looking up solutions. Go somewhere else on the island and you may find a sequence of easier puzzles that also may lead to revelations for how to solve the ones you left behind. I admit to have consulted a walk-through myself, but after I had first reached the ending and solved almost 500 puzzles. You may solve far less puzzles and will still be able to reach the ending. I am still playing, approaching 600 solved puzzles, due to that there are more of those great moments to be found.\n\nThe colourful graphics looks pretty as well, running at a smooth 60fps. Then there are all these weird things scattered around the island that together with great sound design (no background music) adds a certain ambience to the experience.\n\nIn conclusion, The Witness is a rare gem, utilizing the environmental design and other video game-unique features to present you with something truly amazing. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who has passion for video games and who can live with it not always being a cake-walk. In truth we will probably not see a puzzle game as good as this one for many years to come.","February 3","true","48.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The lack of any narration or explanation of what was happening or what you needed to do made the experience extra calming - you really do work at your own pace. You can stop and go to another section without feeling guilty or stressed about how many quests and objectives you have left to complete: the whole island is quite happy to go on without you, and it will all still be there when you're ready to try a section again.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzles and looking at things that are pretty you should definitely buy this game!","February 5","true","22.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Which is a really big deal considering the game.\n\nYes, I have read many reviews before writing this one and most of them contains spoilers. Kinda sad considering people read reviews to know about the game playing experience, not to ♥♥♥♥ing ruin it completely. And it makes me wonder, do these people that wrote negative reviews really had The Witness gaming experience? Or maybe they just got their experience ruined by spoilers themselves... or maybe the game was just not meant to be played and liked by those people?\n\nTwo things you have to know about this game and this is where every negative review fails: This game is about exploration and puzzle solving. Nothing else really. What did you expect? Also, it does it perfectly. It does it in it's own way. There are similar games out there such as Myst, The Talos Principle and the Portal games, but it's still not even close to what I felt during my playthrough of The Witness.\n\nIt is an astounding puzzle game where you WILL have your mind blown in many different ways. Keep in mind that this is not your typical videogame. It is a puzzle game, and a hard one. You will enjoy progressing if you enjoy learning stuff. It is a very mature game that almost feels like working sometimes, but who said working has to be boring? Everything, and I mean everything in The Witness is beautiful. Environment, puzzles, design, colors, sound, details, gameplay... Everything is there for you to admire, feel, experience and forget. To make you forget about your life for a moment and completely fill your mind and thoughts with puzzles. But after, when you will go out, you might end up seeing the real world differently, seeing more of it's beauty. That's just what The Witness does.\n\nNothing more has to be said and keep in mind that reading more reviews WILL ruin your experience. The game is all about it. And going in spoilers free is the way to go if you want to live something fun and worthy.\n\nI would give it a good 9.5/10.\n\nAlso, a little bit of precision for some of you that might now know : Jon Blow is the director of The Witness and his last game Braid came out more than 6 years ago. So I want to precise the fact that I did not like Braid that much. I am not a Jon Blow fanboy. I am not brainwashed of any sort. To me The Witness is a masterpiece and a very inspiring game.

I couldn't remap my movement keys (Colemak) so I ended up awkwardly shifting my keyboard to play with the arrows. The character moves slower than what one may expect from a first-person perspective, but it's the initial acceleration of movement that was bothering at times. There was no music*. I understand that decision now, and how it relates to the overall experience while playing the game, but sometimes I just want to listen to music while solving some puzzles.\n\nI felt like a pinball in the beginning, bouncing from area to area, trying to learn all the rules, but once I had them down, the adventure was much more satisfying. Still, I probably went through a small pad of sticky notes to finish the game. For having one basic mechanic - connect a source point to an ending point, the number of ways in which I'd learn to tackle a puzzle were impressive. Most types of puzzles were fun, but one (not prominently featured) type in particular I'd like to drown in a bathtub.\n\nIt sounds like mostly negative feedback to this point, and that's probably not inaccurate. However, The Witness is a classic tsundere of a game. That last 40% is so sweet; it makes all the prior frustrations worth it. The audio logs start to come together nicely for an interesting story, particularly when accessing later challenges. I spent about 50 hours on my initial playthrough to 100%.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/recommended/210970/","masterevilace","A Fancy Fridge Magnet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/","707 products in account","The Witness is a meticulously crafted puzzle game that uses and expands on one single puzzle design concept.\nEvery puzzle in The Witness is solved by drawing a continuous, non-overlapping line from a starting point to an end point. The puzzles start simple, such as navigating a simple maze, and slowly become more complex, adding symbols to the two dimensional puzzle board that changes how the entire puzzle must be solved.\n\nThe world of The Witness is made up of one entire island, with no loading screens, and many types of environments all co-existing seamlessly. The island contains many secrets and details that you won't notice at first, but slowly over time you will discover their meanings. Puzzles are strewn across the island, typically grouped together with a common theme. You will need to solve simple tutorial-types first, before moving on to harder puzzles. If you get stuck at any point you will typically want to walk around and explore more and come back later. Some puzzles really stumped me for a long length of time, until I came back with a fresh mindset. Many puzzles will require you to use the environment around you, which made things quite interesting.\n\nSome of the puzzles in the game had mechanics that I did not enjoy at all, and actually had a very hard time doing. Some mechanics were over-done and tended to not do anything interesting, but still existed in quantity, which became tedious feeling. In many ways I would have preferred less puzzles. For all the others, I really enjoyed them, especially this one area where you are forced to do puzzle after puzzle in order to actually progress forward at all. There are over 500 puzzles, and many are quite difficult, especially near the end of the game. This game is downright challenging, but can be tackled slowly over time.\n\nThe island is mostly open to exploration, but many areas you will find “locked” until you learn more about how to open them up. Because of your ability to wander the island, it’s entirely possible you find puzzles that are over your head, leaving you the feeling that the game is just too hard or obscure. A person that stumbles upon the puzzles in the perfect order of difficulty will likely enjoy the game much, much more, and find it easier to play through.\n\nThe game as a whole can feel overly perfected to the point of feeling dead. For example, you can’t even jump at all. Being in a three-dimensional environment without the ability to jump from one ledge to another feels really bad… many times you’ll walk around and get stuck on a corner briefly and have to reposition. That being said, the game isn’t designed for jumping…. If you could jump even a little bit in this game, the entire thing would be broken… this is how specifically crafted everything is.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the island are the secrets hidden in plain sight... there are a ton of puzzles that can only be accessed if you're very observant or have heard about how to get to them. The entire island is very interconnected which is an amazing feeling compared to level design of every other game. The island's use of colors and patterns is extremely creative, as is the visual play on player "perspective." If you’re an experienced player, you can look at any screenshot from the game and pretty much pinpoint where they are on the island based on colors and uniqueness. That’s incredible.\n\nAnother design choice was to have no background music. I heard about this a lot prior to playing, about how all of the sounds come from you or the island itself. I thought this was clever, but in the end I really feel like a well-crafted soundtrack would have actually benefitted the game. Many times I was stuck solving a puzzle for a length of time, and I would just hear some repeating ambient sounds, which made it feel like I was taking much longer on a puzzle than I actually was. Music would have really set the mood for each area of the island that you visit, as well.\n\nThe biggest letdown was the lack of a REAL story. There are audio logs and video recordings hidden very scattered around the island, and they seem to talk about more abstract ideas. You will find them so sparingly that keeping them in your mind while playing is pretty much not going to happen. A real narrative would have been appreciated, and would have helped deliver a driving force into completing the game. Currently, your only motivation is to "solve all the puzzles" and "hope to unlock more areas." Near the end of the game things get interesting, but there ends up not being much meaning at all… the ending of the game was the absolute biggest letdown of the game… a game that takes 20+ hours of puzzles and leaves you going… “is that it?”\n\nI got a lot of enjoyment out of The Witness, but it isn’t a perfect game, and in its strive for perfection it comes off not evoking any real emotion or strong feelings. I’m extremely impressed with the design and details of the world, and the challenge that the puzzles bring for how simplistic they are. If you love puzzles and figuring things out, there’s a TON of content here for you. This is the closest game in the style of MYST you will find. If you don’t enjoy those things, then this game doesn’t have anything for you at all.","February 6","true","19.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

I love The Talos Principle, but the games aren't really comparable in design - The Talos Principle, with few exceptions (some of the harder stars) confines its puzzles to very clear boundaries and the levels don't interact with each other. The Witness throws that out the window, with puzzles building together and the player's perspective of the level changing what puzzles are available and solvable. The two games play by different sets of rules.\n\nAs far as a story goes, I don't really feel like it's lacking in this game. That's not to say that there is a complex or compelling narrative presented, but it doesn't need more than it has. The real narrative is how you the player interact with your environment, and that's sufficient (and certainly better than a half-♥♥♥♥♥ story shoehorned into the environment would have been)\n\n2) 'It's just a bunch of mobile game puzzles in a pretty island.' Anyone who says this didn't get very far in the game. It has a pretty gentle difficulty curve at first, so I can see how you would get that impression. The way the player interacts with the world is via panels with little maze puzzles on them. If you play the first 45 minutes to an hour of the game, it teaches you the first few maze mechanics in quick succession, so that's the main focus. Once you start exploring, it becomes apparent that the mazes aren't really the majority of the puzzles. They're merely how you communicate your understanding of the puzzles' solutions to the game.\n\nFor example:\nIn the desert area, the main mechanic is reflections. You communicate your understanding by seeing how to complete a maze via bright light shining directly on them. The real puzzle is figuring out how to set up the angles between you and the light sources correctly.\n\nIn the greenhouse, the main mechanic is colored light changing groups of painted squares that have to be separated in the mazes. The real puzzle is figuring out how to view each maze so that it has a set of colors with a completable solution (and, a step further, using multiple colors to figure out the pigments without being able to see them with unfiltered light).\n\nAs far as I can tell, the most complex mechanic is how the optional puzzles are baked into the world - the environment itself contains hidden visual puzzles that trigger black obelisks to light up with the area's patterns.\n\nI'm enjoying this game a lot. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you like being presented with interesting problems, banging your head against a problem only to realize the solution was right in front of you 20 minutes later, and then being satisfied that you figured it out, this game is really fun. It does a great job of teaching the mechanics to the player, and then pushing your thinking.\n\nAlso, it's a really pretty.","February 1","true","10.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Puzzles that challenge your mind to look at a situation in a new way and that leave you feeling acomplished when you finally solve them. The Witness does do this at times, but a good portion of the challenges presented in this don't fit that criteria. Instead of making you think in a new way, they challenge you to be at just the perfect angle to make the puzzle work. You know what needs to be done, you just have to spend 5 minutes getting the exact right spot. Or the puzzle will flash in a series of colors that leaves you with a headache so that you can only do one or two at a time before having to take a break simply because it hurts your eyes. It's not fun, it's frustrating and leaves you feeling upset and argavated because you just want the game to be over!\n\nPortal is challenging in a fun way. Myst is challenging in a fun way. The Witness is not.

I wanted to love this game. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the game that make it pretty terrible in my opinion.\n\nFirst, the island, while hauntingly beautiful, is not really the star of the game. When playing The Witness, you simply move from maze panel to maze panel, and you can pretty much see everything and easily get anywhere you want if you solve nearby maze panels. There's not much of a feeling of adventure or even ambiance. Everything's quiet and empty. After a few hours of playing the island lost its charm and I wished they had just put the puzzle areas right next to each other, or given you a much faster sprint in order to quickly get between puzzles.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, some of the puzzles are extremely frustrating to the point that they're unequivocally not even the slightest bit fun. I'm not sure whether Jonathan Blow wanted The Witness to have a reputation as an essentially unbeatable puzzle game, or whether he was just a poor judge of how hard the puzzles are.\n\nOf course the island has a few essentially impenetrable secrets that nobody will be able to beat without looking at a walkthrough, but you don't need to beat everything to get the ending. What I take issue with is the main series of puzzles that you face frequently and that you need to beat. Some of these puzzles are really clever and require you to be observant of your environment and think. These puzzles have a "Talos Principle" kind of vibe that I really like. But the game goes much, much too far in giving you problems to solve with incomplete information.  The most egregious offenders are the maze panels which deal with symbols indicating increasingly complex unspoken rules about how you must solve the maze. These get ludicrously complicated and there's zero explanation in-game about what any of the symbols mean. Somehow people have through sheer brute force divined the meanings of each symbol and shared them with the Internet, and you'll need to cheat and read that info to make much progress. Until you do, you'll wander around the island shut out from most areas. When you do, you'll laugh, because it's so comically implausible that anyone would be expected to figure them out on their own. And it's not just the symbols; the game repeatedly fails to provide the player with enough information to reasonably beat the puzzle. There are dozens of puzzles that don't give you quite enough information to nail down the exact maze path; you'll spend literally hours dragging your mouse guessing different paths because there are many possible permutations or transformations which could all equally well be the solution. Sometimes the game is smart about this and lets you enter a variety of solutions, but that's not always the case. You're going to be clicking and dragging a lot. This is not fun gameplay by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nThere are some really fantastic puzzles buried in this game, but it's not worth it. I will not sit in front of my computer for hours blindly guessing and probing to make sense of the world. The Talos Principle and Portal/Portal 2 are perfect examples of games which introduce concepts fairly, and have puzzles which are solvable in your head by simply thinking through them. Even if the puzzles get very difficult, there's no dumb trial and error involved. That's the kind of puzzle game I want.","January 28","false","7.1"," 290 of 545 people (53%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","53","290","545","12","20"

The Witness, on the other hand, is another animal entirely. The game plays as well as it looks, and even the generous screenshots don't really capture how gorgeous this game is. Anyone that writes off this game as "just line puzzles" doesn't really get the point of this game. Sure, you interact with all of the puzzles in the same way, but the real purpose of The Witness is the process of solving the puzzles. Even in the first few hours of playing, I must say that some of the ways the game approaches puzzles are downright genius and require not just logic, but creativity, attentiveness to surroundings, and other skillsets not usually emphasized in video games. Interaction with the player is subtle but always fair, so challenges are sometimes tough but never unreasonable.The Witness is a marvel of game design which has already given me more "A-ha!" moments than any game in recent memory.\n\n$40 is very steep for an indie price tag, but this game really is a labor of love and is oozing deliberate, intelligent design.","January 26","true","26.4"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

You'll encounter a plethora of maze-like puzzles with increasing rules and complexity. The puzzles can be very challenging, and since you have nothing to tell you where to go first on the massive island, it can be all too easy to come across a puzzle before you have learned its mechanisms. This isn't a problem though, it built up my desire to explore. Eventually, the game does have it's way of giving you goals to complete, and there does seem to be a point to everything.\n\nThe environment is beautiful, take a look at the trailer if you haven't. Very artistically designed, every scene looks like a painting. The game does have an occasional narrative, often times very enlightening or philosphical quotes. I'd recommend this game solely on the way it makes me feel when I discover one of the many secrets hidden about.\n\nThe Witness seems to have no music, prepare to wander around in silence. This made me really sad, I expected a game of this price to have some kind of background music, especially given the quality of the trailer's music. Of course, you can always play your own.\n\nThis game is great for any puzzle fan, or anyone who enjoys the "walking simulator" games like Dear Esther and such. I've actually found a lot of enjoyment in playing with a friend, two minds are better than one on those puzzles.\n\nI am still playing this game, but the more I have played it the more it has grown on me.

The graphics are stunning, the island is a very sunny place which is nice because the weather outside is ♥♥♥♥♥ this winter. I take my time solving puzzles, walk away from more difficult ones but eventually figure out what to do which is very satisfying. Occassionally I need to make some notes or take some screenshots which is great because it actually feels like conducting some investigation.

If the prospect of that sounds like a red flag, you'll probably not like it much.\n\nThe game subtracts all superfluous elements like music, characters, cutscenes, action, etc. to be entirely focused on the game itself and its themes of isolation and self-reflection. It abandons you, but teaches you the rules subtly and subliminally. There is an overarching narrative, but it's subdued and backseated more so in that it's loose enough to be interpretive and allow for self-insertion. An understated masterpiece in game design, everything is meticulously crafted, organized, and positioned to have a distinct purpose with clear attention to freedom. You are completely free to play as you want, going wherever you want at your pace. Though, akin to learning, discovering or creating a programming language, there are foundations that you must know first before building upon further.\n\nWhen you are consumed by the Witness, you learn about yourself, you learn your limits, you overcome them, you learn how to examine problems from different angles, and to reflect on not only your environment but yourself.

All that I can say is that there is a lot more here than just puzzles. I've had something of a spiritual awakening - or at least I've really put science and my own personal atheism under the same microscope that I once viewed religion through ... and now I'm having a similar reaction to atheism that I once had with Christianity. It just doesn't hold water when looked at and dissected endlessly.\n\n\nThis game unlocked something inside of me that I knew to be true all along - that life is mostly a subjective and personal experience. And it's these subjective and personal understandings and beliefs that should take precedence over all dogmas - including material atheism. I had had these thoughts and hunches before playing The Witness - the seed was already planted somewhere deep inside of me that I acknowledged from time to time but mostly ignored and wrote off as whimsical feelings and musings. Feelings thoughts and ideas that are intensely personal and difficult to put into words.\n\n\nI feel like the more time I spend on the Island - the better I understand the 'story' and the more comfortable I am shifting towards a more spiritual self. The more I listen to the logs and videos the better I understand them - my self - and the world around me. I am a seeker by heart so I was constantly searching for the deeper meaning and trying to understand everything but I noticed the puzzles started becoming secondary to my experience.\n\n\nThese were not the first times I had heard some of these quotes - most of them were new though...but I had heard several of Einstein's takes on 'God' and how vastly different his thoughts are compared to modern Christianity. I knew there were differing opinions out there such as this - but never had I thought as deeply as I have now about them. One that stood out to me the most was the quote by Nicholas of Cusa that basically said in short - "Should anyone try to describe you I would know it to be false since you are indescribable". I also enjoyed Eddington and Feynman's thoughts one the subject as well. Perhaps it's not the God of my parents or my unquestioned atheism that is the end all be all to my existence on this earth. Perhaps  the answer, if there is one, is somewhere in the grey areas. One that I have to search deep and far for. One that I can never draw any clear cut solution - but one that I can only get closer to understanding.\n\n\nNow I know what you're probably thinking - "but this is just a video game and you had that kind of reaction to it!? pffffft". And I completely get that and I was hesitant to post my reaction to the game because of how rediculous and insane that sounds... Before I 'beat' the game I was actually frustrated at it and thought it was a failed attempt to surpass Braid. I honestly was wanting to write it off as some post-modern/art game bull at first but now I'm on my second play thought and realize this wasn't a game at all. It was all a dream - a dream that helped me to finally wake up.\n\n\nThank you Jonathan and to everyone that helped create this 'awe'-some game.

All variation is derived from the rules of these line puzzles, which are indicated by small icons.\n\nIn total, the game makes no effort to feel rewarding, or even substantiate its world.

From the start, the idea is simple: Draw a line from point A to point B. Every puzzle in this game follows this one mechanic, and that may turn some people off. But in a sense, Super Mario Brothers only had two whole mechanics: running and jumping, but it's what you do with those mechanics that makes for satisfying gameplay. And boy are these mechanics satisfying.\n\nThe gorgeously and painstakingly detailed island is host to many distinct sections, each one dealing with new mechanics that get added on to the "A to B" style of the puzzles. Perhaps there are symbols on the board whose rules must be learned by the player, or perhaps the environment itself contains hints as to the solution. There is never quite as good a feeling as when you finally understand the rule of a challenging puzzle. It's a moment of "Wow I can't believe I didn't think of that, it seems so obvious now!"\n\nIn fact, as the game world is freely open to exploration, I sometimes stumbled upon puzzles that I simply didn't have the knowledge to solve. But where there is a difficult mechanic, there is an area of the island that has simpler puzzles for this mechanic that allow you to learn the rules for yourself. This type of gameplay feels alot like when you reach an area of an RPG where the enemies are much tougher than you, and then coming back when you have gotten stronger. But rather than leveling up a character, returning to tougher areas means coming back with new knoledge that you have acquired for yourself, and that is a very satisfying feeling.\n\nIt wouldn't seem like much really, if the world wasn't beautifully crafted and a joy to wander through. Every area is distinct both in its' puzzle mechanics and its' visual flair. While there is no conventional story pulling you through the game, I found myself excited at the thought of finding a new perspective illusion located in the games world, from calm water reflecting rocks to form faces, to statues interacting with shadows in clever ways, to faces hidden in the outlines of the branches of trees. This world is perhaps the most preciously constructed world in gaming. Everywhere you look you see new illusions or beautiful landscapes dotting the island.\n\nMany people have complained, thinking that this game is based solely on these panels of puzzles and that this gameplay couldn't possibly hold their interest for long, and that is true, this game is certainly not for everyone in its' slow, deliberate pacing. But to say that this game has nothing else to offer besides puzzles on panels is patently false. I won't tell you what else there is to this game, as the beauty of it does come from discovering stuff on your own, but let me tell you that I was floored by the detail placed into every aspect of this island.\n\nFrom clever mechanics all evolving from one simple "A to B" style to the gorgeous game world, devoid of music and calming to journey through, The Witness is a fantastic experience, but only for those willing to figure out the path for themselves. This is a game that does not hold your hand in any way, and you as the player must be willing to think and learn for yourself. I very much appreciated this mature approach to game design, which is in stark contrast to many games with necessary tutorials due to the complexity of the controls. This game does away with complex controls, and instead decided on one main concept and creates a full experience around it.","May 20","true","12.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It’s amazing to see how such a simple idea, drawing a line from one point to another, can be given such mechanical complexity. Taking that one step further and including the very world itself as part of the mechanics is an inspired achievement, one that blew me away when I finally figured it out. However the repetitive nature of the puzzles, coupled with the lack of narrative to drive you forward through those puzzles, makes it hard to keep coming back after a while. The Witness is most certainly a testament to Jonathan Blow’s dedication to perfection in all things he sets out to create however it falls short of acquiring the “must play” status that his seminal title did.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/210970/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","The Witness is a puzzle game like no other I have played.  It bucks the trend not only by having no narrative, but also by having no direct explanation of any of the game mechanics.  Rather than painstakingly explaining everything as most games do, The Witness simply provides the information you need and lets you figure it out.  It's quite refreshing in an era of constant hint popups, control prompts, and hour-long tutorials.\n\nNow how does this work?  The Witness provides all the information you need, and even provides a set of tutorial puzzles for each main mechanic but it does not tell you how any of it works.  Half the challenge is figuring out how the mechanics work.  The game provides a near-constant feeling of satisfaction from figuring the puzzles out, barring a very small minority of puzzles.  I found many of the puzzles rather clever in their design, and I find it quite telling how superb the design is that I only ever felt frustrated in two spots in the entire game when I am normally frustrated very easily by difficult puzzles.\n\nAnother large difference I see between The Witness and other puzzle games is in the design of the puzzles themselves.  Most games use very simple mechanics and combine them in increasingly complex and lengthy ways to increase difficulty.  I find that results in the major difficulty of the puzzles being simply thinking through all the steps, rather than any mechanical complexity.  The Witness, however, uses more and more complex mechanics, constantly modifying or introducing new ones, without unnecessarily increasing the size or complexity of the puzzles themselves.  The difficulty feels more natural and logical this way, rather than just trying to overload the player's brain with too many steps.\n\nThe part that makes this all work and ties it all together is the puzzle interface itself.  Puzzles are presented on panels throughout the game world with an exceedingly simple goal: Draw a line from the starting point to the ending point through a grid.  Every puzzle has the same basic goal, and this simplicity tying every puzzle together gives the player a feeling of familiarity, even when confronted by completely new mechanics.\n\nGraphically the game is very impressive, especially considering how low detail the models and textures are.  It runs quite smoothly as well, barring a particular bug with my GPU that I've been working around and will hopefully be solved in the near future.  The island is beautiful and very colorful, with each zone having a distinctive style.  Sound effects are minimal, but fit their purpose well.  There is no music, which I was confused about at first but completely understand after playing the game.  I wasn't even tempted to play my own music while playing the game.  Any music would drastically alter the mood, and the game is so tightly designed, it felt like that would lessen the experience.\n\nThere are two things about the game I dislike:\n- The first being a small number of puzzles that felt like they could not be solved with perception and logic alone, but required the use of external software to decipher.\n- The second being the story, or lack thereof.  While nearly everything in the game is very tightly thematically linked around the idea of opening your mind and learning new things, I thought that there should be some sort of explanation for the island itself, why you're there, and certain things non-puzzle-related that you find.  It's possible there's a well-hidden secret that has not yet been discovered that contains this, but nothing has been located to my knowledge.  I know that some people complain about the lack of narrative, but while I don't think it would fit the game to have an Elohim or GlaDOS watching over you the whole time, I would have liked a little bit of something to explain the world.  There does seem to be an attempt by the game but I found it very lacking and it raised even more questions.\n\nI'm not sure I've ever played such a well-designed game.  Everything fits, everything supports the rest of the design.  The amount of content is certainly worth the price, containing more than either The Talos Principle or Portal 2.  It's certainly an experience unlike any I've had before in a game and I hope that other developers, not just of puzzle games, can learn from this example.  I realize this game isn't for everybody, but I hope that most will enjoy it as much as I did.","February 1","true","35.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tellus_E/recommended/210970/","Tellus_E","Tellus Eidolon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tellus_E/","950 products in account","Allow me to preface my review with a commentary directed at many of the highly rated negative reviews currently on the store page. It worries me greatly that so many people put so much stock in reviews that very obviously let their expectations drive the review. I hope that potential buyers read a generous number of reviews (both negative and positive) and gauge the contents. If your tastes match those of the reviewer, a subjective review will probably resonate with you. If not, try and view it from an objective standpoint. That being said...\n\nLet me put something bluntly, and in brief.\nIf you are not the type who could lean back and listen to instrumental music and dream up worlds of your own, this game might not be for you.\nIf you like clear stories being told for you and to your face, this game might not be for you.\nIf you believe that a good game has explosive action, this game might not be for you.\nIf you dislike sitting in silence and letting your thoughts flow free, this game might not be for you.\n\nThe Witness is a cerebral game, as much about curiosity and self-reflection as it is about exploration and seeking clarity. It is not a successor to Myst. It is not trying to compete with The Talos Principle. I'd even go so far as to say that, despite some very obvious similarities, it tries to break free of Blow's previous work, Braid, and does not try to emulate the cryptic secrets of Fez.\n\nThe game (I'm tempted to call it interactive art) deserves to be considered on its own merits before being compared to experiences that may seem similar to it. As does any other game. Indeed, the exploration of the game and the thick atmosphere of the world evokes thoughts of the desolate and empty worlds of Myst. Its single mechanic echoes the central element of time manipulation in Braid. The "first person puzzle solver" moniker can also be applied to The Talos Principle. But The Witness is different. Its core mechanic, the sliding puzzles shown many times over in the gameplay trailer, is not the game's primary draw. It is only the first of many layers, a conduit through which you engage in a dialogue with the world you explore, a sun-bathed island seemingly abandoned ages ago.\n\nAs you take your first steps from an ominous dark room into the glaring sunlight of a quiet garden of strong colours, you are left naked with nothing but the wind in your trees as your companion. Even before passing the first gated puzzles into the open world ahead, you a greeted by choice. While one has an obvious immediate impliciation, the other does not. What is its repercussion? You don't know. The thought lingers, and the moment you are released onto the island you are made free to follow the trail to its conclusion. Or perhaps the harbour town you see in the distance as you find an overview. Or the doorway, tucked neatly behind a few bushes, unseen as you pass by the first time. This urge to explore and see every part of the island, the effects of choices made and the many vistas and vignettes, all come together to form yet another layer of the game.\n\nBefore long, you will encounter tape recorders scattered about the island, containing quotes from notable figures of our own past. This is not some pretentious attempt at being philosophical or artificially raise the class of the game. The clips, as with every feature of the island, have been particularly chosen to make you think. About the puzzles. About the island. About how you, as the player, perceive what may have transpired and how you view the world and its mysteries - yet another layer of The Witness. This is when something becomes clear. Every rock, every tree, the dancing shadows, and running streams have all been placed with meticulous, deliberate precision. You will return to previous scenery, time and time again, and notice something new. Lessons learned in your travels will open your mind to impressions that may have never occurred to you otherwise.\n\nThis exploration and cycle of increasing depth is an important part of The Witness' narrative. This game is not about the puzzles, however obvious they may seem. The puzzles are a means to an end. The puzzles, and the always cryptic revelations they lead to, allow you to draw your own conclusions. This is the beauty of the game, and why it stands out in comparisons.\n\nPlayers who delve single-mindedly into the puzzles, enforcing their own Metroidvania view into the many and complex puzzle rules, are likely to overlook the shifting perspectives and obviously deliberate constellations in play.\nPlayers expecting a Myst-style relevation from the precious but fragmented voice and video clips will leave wanting.\nPlayers expecting the frivolities of dialogue or humour to break the tedium of puzzles have entirely missed the point.\n\nThis game is for the patient. The meticulous. The explorers. The ponderers. The listeners. The dreamers.\n\nIn many ways, this game defies categorisation while integrating elements of many well-known games. Above all, however, it is most definitely a Jonathan Blow creation. If nothing else, this tells you three things: everything is deliberate, you are only limited by your own mind, and the story is yours - through and through.","January 28","true","22.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

This game is not for everyone. It's not like Braid; you can't just jump into it and go. The Witness is a lot more like MYST or other older puzzle games, where it's entirely puzzle and no action. All of the puzzles are done on grids and they involve creating lines on these grids. There are rules however, and sometimes you have to get very, very creative. The environment interacts with the puzzles and you have to put the two together in a way that will not always make sense at first. A lot of people are saying that the puzzles are not rewarding due to no big "ah ha!" moments, but I find that this isn't entirely true. There aren't any 'big' moments where everything falls into place, but the game does provide an enjoyable slow burn that is fun to just spend an afternoon digging into. It's not a short game, by any means (I've played about 10 hours and only activated three out of seven lasers). The high price tag reflects the amount of time you will spend in The Witness.\n\nMy only complaint is that, so far, the plot/narrative elements are vague, far apart, and unrewarding. There's clearly a lot going on on the island and I don't think I've missed much, but I get the feeling that lots of people will never even come across a single story element.

It starts out simple, easing you into the mechanics of the game, but before long you'll be juggling multiple puzzle mechanics that you've learned hours or days ago to try to unlock new areas or "complete" already discovered areas.\n\nDuring the process of playing the game, you're basically being taught a puzzle language and the game constantly tests you to see whether you've understood the rules correctly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pasta_Pillows/recommended/210970/","Pasta_Pillows","PastaPillows","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pasta_Pillows/","285 products in account","Let me start by saying THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR EVERYONE. This puzzle game is quite different from the likes of Braid, FEZ, Portal or anything else you may have played. That said, it's still an amazing experience.\n\nWhile it *does* get very complicated late-game, The Witness takes a very simple concept (labyrinths that you normally must find your way through) and throws a bunch of different rulesets about them at you. They do this with a variety of symbols that at first, you won't know what at all they mean. That's where this game kinda becomes FEZ in a sense. In FEZ, you didn't know how to translate any of the cube text or the tetronimo lines until you found a specific room in the game that told you what you do translates to what the tetronimo lines say. The same goes for The Witness. You encounter symbols within these puzzle panels, only for them to be revealed what they mean to you by a row of puzzle panels that teach you how to use the symbol, and how involved each symbol can potentially get.\n\nThe reasopn why this game is so different from other puzzle games that you may have played is because of a few factors. For one thing, the control scheme consists of 5 buttons. W, A, S, D, and Mouse 1. You don't get any physical power-ups like a double jump (not to mention, you can't jump in general). The only power up you get in this game is knowledge on how to solve another puzzle. This game will seem unrewarding if you're expecting to collect a certain amount of something every time you finish a puzzle. Instead what unlocks is more puzzles in place of whatever you think you might collect. This game is one giant puzzle and doesn't reward you until you complete it. If you go into this game knowing that, you will enjoy it as I have so far. Knowledge truly is power in this game.\n\nAnother thing that's different is that this game isn't linear whatsoever. Once you complete the "tutorial area" right out of the start point, you're free to take on *any* puzzle you'd like. Of course, you won't know how to solve most of them until you find the "tutorial panels" introducing diffierent symbols, but that freedom is there. It's something I haven't really experienced in any other puzzle game I've played so far.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, here are some questions that might help you:\n\nDo you like discovering puzzle mechanics on your own, with no hand-holding? (Similar to FEZ, but if you didn't play FEZ, then you should know that game doesn't explain anything *at all* to you, just like how The Witness doesn't either.)\n\nDo you enjoy that sense of "aha!!" moments when you've been studying a puzzle you've been struggling with for a while?\n\nDo you not mind getting stuck on a puzzle, and decide to leave to come back to it later?\n\nDo you like/not mind a lack of narrative in a puzzle game, and instead be somewhere shrouded in mystery that's (most likely) not explained? (I'm still working on completing this game, so I'm not sure if the island you're on ever gets explained in the end.)\n\nDo you not mind exploring in search of anything that could help your puzzle-solving abilities?\n\nDo you like to be surrounded by really ♥♥♥♥ing pretty visuals? (who doesn't??)\n\nIf the answer to all of these questions is 'yes', definitely give this game a shot!\n\nP.S. DO NOT look up any puzzles.

The world is absolutely beautiful, and there is so much to it. Some people may stray away because it is basically the same puzzle over an over again, but the creators somehow made each puzzle fresh, new, and even more complicated then the last. This game made me hate myself, this game made me hate the game, this game made me love myself, this game made me love this game.\n\n*Puzzle Spoiler*\nMy favorite experince in this game was a certain series of puzzles. The game taches you as you go, so I had figured that I had figured out the point of the puzzle, outlining the rocks in the water, so I came to a single rock in the water. No matter how much I outlined it, it still didn't work. As it turns out you don't have to be looking directly at the puzzle to solve it. The rocks I was suppose to outline were to my right, and I had to look at just the right angle to see them. Once that puzzle was done I move to the last puzzle of the series, and using my newfound knowledge, I looked at the rocks in all different angles, but I still couldn't solve it. Finally, I figured it out. I had to look at the puzzle backwards, and outline the trees, not rocks. This was one of many experinces I've had the pleasure of having thanks this game.\n\nThis game is worth every penny I spent on it.","January 31","true","7.9"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

The puzzle difficulty ranges from "well, DUH" to "I'M GOING TO MURDER YOU FOR INFLICTING THIS ON ME". I would recommend it if you like challenging puzzles and if you want to check out a beautifully crafted little world. At this point I've played just under 20 hours and the only reason I've stopped spending every waking moment at home doing line puzzles is because I feel guilty getting ahead of my buddy who bought it first.\n\nA friend and I played a lot of this at about the same time. I found it pretty interesting how almost every puzzle I found impossible, he had no trouble with it. Meanwhile he got stuck at one point for about an hour and asked me to get up to where he was so we could bang our heads on the puzzle together - I got it within seconds of getting there.\nSo yes, it's almost certain there will be at least one set of puzzles that you Just Don't Get. If it's not making your blood pressure raise alarmingly, give it a while and you might crack it, otherwise I'd recommend looking up an answer and moving on to some other puzzles you actually enjoy looking at.\n\nPros:\nTons of puzzles.\nLots of surprises.\nA gorgeous and colourful game world.\nFeeling like an absolute god when you figure out a problem you're having trouble with, or notice the Big Important Thing you needed to notice.\n\nCons:\nSome puzzles WILL feel impossible.\nSome puzzles WILL just be massively annoying.\nEventually wanting x10 speed to move around because seriously man I just want to get over there already jeez.","February 1","true","37.3"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","28","50","4","0"

Unfortunately, The Witness felt like a game catering towards compatibility with a mobile experience. Simple navigation and ultimately 2D logic puzzles that if isolated and released on their own would compare to a free flash game on newgrounds (though not quite as drawn out). Yes the world is beautiful, but it's really quite hollow in interactivity and alone can't make the game. I'm sure it would be great on a tablet, but not so much on the desktop and especially not at the price.\n\nAgain, I'm another refund story so minimal playtime. I looked up snippets of later gameplay right before submitting my request to be sure this wasn't just my impatience with the beginning, and while the puzzles do get more intricate and start having effects beyond the opening of a door to yet another puzzle, for me it doesn't really seem substantial enough.\n\nAlso, whilst the game never advertised to be anything else, it didn't explicitly convey that the core mechanic consisted purely of these 2D panel-puzzles. I'm sure Blow would've been aware of people's perception of the game as being somewhat akin to Myst from the vague trailers (there's a few such stories already in the reviews), and I don't think you can play that one off as being necessary to avoid spoiling the experience.\n\nI, and others, should perhaps have been wiser than to pre-order. It doesn't serve to benefit anyone other than the developer. At least now with the reviews and gameplay footage up, everyone will know what they're getting into before purchasing.","January 27","false","1.1"," 145 of 275 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","145","275","3","3"

Reasoning: as of the date of this review: two hours is the maximum play time you can have a game for in order to request a refund if so desired. I desired that refund.\n\nMoving on.\n\nMy criticisms are for puzzles, and gameplay. They are not against style, art, sound, assets etc. If this was a flash game from 5 years ago: I'd have the same concerns as I do now.\n\n\nThis was not a relaxing game for meI found this game stressful, and at times frustrating. When I encountered the pathing puzzles: I quickly learned that navigating the maze was simply not enough. There was a particular method that was needed in order to solve all the puzzles in a given set. This makes sense to me. Find the overall method of solving a solution, and you can solve the rest of the puzzles with a little bit of elbow grease.\n\nKind of like a 'teach a man to fish' scenario.\n\nBut then the game decided that it no longer wanted me to do that. I attempted to solve a puzzle in the manner in which the game had taught me; only to find that it's rules had now arbitrarily changed.\n\nHad I misunderstood the rules? Had I just fluked out? Where there rules I was missing?\n\nHonestly with the time constraint that I had: I simply had to locate a guide online and use it's solution... And that's when I got frustrated. The solution in the guide was simply an alternate solution than the one I had attempted.\n\n\nRepetitionIn my mind: the worse thing in a puzzle game is repeating the same puzzle over again. By their very nature: the vast majority of puzzle games suffer from a lack of replay value. I get that, and I accept it. We've all played the Portal series, and forced ourselves to forget it so we can enjoy playing it again in 6-8 months.\nThere was a part in my playthrough of this game where I failed to solve a pathfinding puzzle. Instead of letting me attempt again: the game reverted the previous puzzle to a non solved state, and forced me to re-enter that one too. The worst part was that the puzzle was still visibly solved, and I jsut had to trace over what I had already done. Why?\n\n\nThe restriction of movement felt like a time-sink mechanic rather than a gameplay mechanic\nThere is no jumping or crouching. The game is not about physically demanding puzzles, and that's fine. However there are invisible walls everywhere. A minor ledge of say - half a metre - is an impass. It makes me have to walk back and forth between puzzles and areas the long way every time.\n\nI get it; the game is gorgeous and you want people to experience the environment. But I couldn't help but feel like I was just a slave to the world's path, and not person taking a place within it.\n\nOn top of that, your character is slow to move. I found I was constantly holding the shift button to sprint, and my pinky got cramped. He also seems to have this strange acceleration when beginning to move in a direction. Starting off slow, and speeding up. While true to life: it feels out of place and indeed seems to serve no purpose in this particular game.\n\n\nAll in all: I do wish I had more time with it - (Thank steam). If these types of issues are not that important to you: then I can reccomend this game. For me: it was simply not what I expected.","January 26","false","1.8"," 189 of 360 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","189","360","4","8"

After playing it in a couple of brief spurts throughout the week, I came to realize it's more than just puzzles.\n\nFor me, The Witness is like a piece of artwork. It looks pretty on the first glance..\n.. And then you start taking a closer look. You start seeing significance in each brush stroke. There's meaning in almost every single thing in the game. It seems like almost every single pebble or twist of the branches in a tree are designed *just right* in order to create this world. And indeed, it's difficult to miss this while playing the game.\n\nBecause while the game may start out as just maze puzzles, it forces you to start looking at your surroundings differently once you free yourself from the walls of the starting area. You look at some of the puzzles in the town, with their bizarre shapes and seemingly impossible answers. Then you start to explore, and then you start to learn. What were simple mazes are now tracings, or they're representations of what you hear or what you see around you. It makes you stop and think each time you go around the next bend.\n\nAnd now it should be noted that there are no instructions on how to solve anything in The Witness. This is the part of puzzle games that Jonathan Blow seems to understand. The joy of solving a puzzle doesn't come just from reaching the end (while there certainly is a great amount of relief in that) the enjoyment comes from trying to figure out the solution.\n\nIf you're in it for the puzzles, then you'll be in for a treat.\nFor anyone else.. If you subscribe to the philospohy that games can be works of art, I would recommend it to you.\n\nI think the game is worth it simply to explore the whole island. I can't think of any other game that has been put together with SO MUCH attention to detail. I can't count how many times I stopped playing just to take in a view, be it a grand vista, a tight, winding path in a forest, or the curious shapes the shadows of a tree make upon a wall. Every little bit of this game has been honed to perfection.","June 5","true","41.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Not only does this succeed in being the most consistently mind-blowing game, I've ever played, it's also unique from any puzzle I have ever seen because it requires both inductive and deductive logic. All puzzle games, whether it's sudoku or portal, give you the rules up front and then just rely on you to make deductive steps to reach the solution. In The Witness, the rules of the puzzle are never given to you. It is up to you to inductively guess what the rules could be, abductively test your supposed rules, and then deductively solve the puzzle based on the info that you yourself have been able to gather. Because of this, I would not hesitate to say it is the most challenging puzzle game I have ever played. This in turn creates the largest temptation to use a guide or look for hints because we naturally associate "more challenging" with "less doable". This is, however; not the case. The game is just as doable as any puzzle game, and it facilitates the learning of all of the rules naturally. If you go for this game, do not bang your head against the same puzzle for more than a few minutes. The world is open, when you get stuck, explore. The answers are never all in the same place.\n\nThe creator very cleverly draws parallels between the relationship of the player and the game world to the relationship between the scientist and his testable environment. Jonathan Blow's philosophy of what we need to know, what we can know, and what is useful to know is very profoundly expressed through the game, although I can't say I totally agree with his rather cynical philosophical outlook. Very enjoyable, one of a kind experience. If you are willing to allow yourself to legitimately struggle with the unknown, you will get so much out of this game.","March 10","true","49.7"," 45 of 83 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","45","83","3","0"

The puzzles start out fairly simple, and you're left to your own devices to figure out each new rule and concept introduced with new puzzles. At times you'll need to pull out a pen and paper to solve your way through a particularly difficult set, but when you solve each series of problems with increasing difficulty, it only makes it more rewarding.\n\nThe story is largely symbolic, and most of it is only hinted at through environmental cues, audio clips, and intentional placement of objects. The best way I can describe it without spoiling anything at all, is that the story is about an abstract concept. Since abstract concepts are hard to describe directly, the best way to describe them to someone is through bits and pieces of information that at first seem irrelevent. These small pieces of information may seem abstract in and of themselves, but they slowly come together, leading you closer and closer to an epiphony that was (hopefully) intended.\n\nAt it's core, it's a puzzle game. Exploring the world reveals nothing more than clues into the story. The world is so detailed that every item feels deliberately placed, but sadly very little interaction with the world actually takes place.","January 28","true","24.2"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

This game is essentially an open world series of those moments, boiled down to a science.\n\nIt's not for everyone.  The Witness has surprisingly few elements to it, but it is world class at what it does, and not many games do it.  What is it?  Why, making you feel like a clever son of a ♥♥♥♥♥, that's what, but you'll definitely have to earn that feeling.  The most similar game is probably Myst, though I'd be careful to not make too close a comparison, as their approach to puzzle solving is radically different.  There's no question in this game if you have what you need to solve something.\n\nIf you like puzzles, you'll love this game.  Just keep in mind that the game doesn't try to provide you with much more, other than some pretty scenery and some wanderlust.  There's no music or story to speak of, and there is almost no direction.  Just interconnected puzzles on an open world island that doesn't care if you can figure it out or not.  That needs to sound at least somewhat interesting to you, otherwise this will be a waste of money.  I can't emphasize it enough, you HAVE to enjoy puzzles on a fundamental level to really enjoy this game, and it is oh so worth it if you do.\n\nAnd yes, the whole game uses that line puzzle formula.

You can see them in some of the classic early video games, in art, and in film. In the Witness they decided very early on to restrict their puzzle to the basic panels you see in previews for the game, but the brilliance is in the way they've taken the idea to its absolute peak. The puzzles in this game are inventive, challenging, and somehow manage to be varied. If you're at all interested in subtle game design, The Witness is rich in undertones and manages to both effortlessly and wordlessly guide the player to solve extremely difficult puzzles.\n\nThis game differs from other classic adventure puzzle games in that it is almost entirely distilled gameplay. There is little narrative carrying you along, and although there are voiced pieces in the game, most of them are about the human mind rather than any story. For the most part, the game leaves you to pull your own meaning out of it.\n\nThe Witness is not for everyone. If you love puzzles for the sake of puzzles, I don't think you'll find a game with more challenging and clever puzzles than this game. The island, in its isolation, ambience, and beauty, is a solitary retreat.

After a few hesitant moments at the beginning of the game, right after you leave the "tutorial" area and you begin explorning the island, the game absorbs you and never lets go.\n\nEach part of the island is brimming with puzzles that will leave you amazed at what you can actually achieve if you put your mind to it. One of those few experiences where you can walk out of it feeling fully satisfied of every second you spent playing on that island. At no moment you feel trapped or stuck on a puzzle for too long, as you are always free to leisurely move on to the next thing that awaits you on the island. The brilliant part is that taking those breaks actually helps you gain more perspective and aids you in solving those puzzles that proved too difficult at the time. With the right angle and/or spin, everything clicks into place in one of those so satisfying 'Aha!' moments that occur quite often throughout the game.\n\nIf you are a puzzle fan of some sort, or you are someone who likes to give his/her brain an interesting challenge every once in a while, give this game a world. Just don't expect a lot of action, explosions or cinematic moments, as there aren't any on this game.

This game is comprised solely of puzzles and explorations. That which it has, is done masterfully, but don't go in expecting it to be something it's not.\n\nThe central core of the game is about learning. EVERYTHING in the game, every maze, every obstacle, even the environment is a constant and concerted effort to teach the player. The problem, at the start of the game, is that the player does not yet understand the language in which the game operates. So it is the task of the player to, essentially, learn how to learn. How to listen and how to read, to be open to new and challenging concepts, and how to apply them to the world around you. This is the central experience of the game, and it is done beautifully well. If you allow the game to teach you, and you put your mind to work at it, this is a game that can be, and very much should be, completed without outside help or guides, because of how important your sense of discovery and understanding is to the experience of the game.\n\nThe landscapes of the island are gorgeous, and while the game does not have a soundtrack, the sounds of the natural world around you inspire a stronger atmosphere of introspection. The environments are varied and gorgeous, and the architecture is thoughtful and detailed. Every inch of the game screams with attention to detail, no space is wasted, nothing is without intent and purpose. Every aspect of the game works together to create a truly wondrous experience.\n\nPerhaps my only complaint about the game is that one or two smaller sections of puzzles felt like they progressed with a somewhat unfair / disappointing form of difficulty, that just felt cheap and unimaginative. However this was a very small and specific set of puzzles, and is not a complaint I had anywhere else.\n\nThe "main path" of the game is about 20 hours long, for a game like this, I feel like it's a good length: enough to keep you engaged and challenged, but not so long it wears itself thin. In addition to the "main path" I've caught a lot of glimpses throughout my play of well-hidden additional content and hidden / optional puzzles, which, from other reviews I've read, could easily tack on another 20 hours for the particularly meticulous player.\n\nOverall, The Witness is easily one of the best puzzle games I have ever played, and certainly one of the most unique gaming experiences out there. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who enjoys puzzles and thinking games.","January 30","true","43.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It may feel pointless or repeitive if you do not enjoy the puzzles. I do enjoy the puzzles.\n\nFor me this game is worth full price. I never felt like what I was doing was mindless or repetitive. Every puzzle always felt like it taught me something new or challenged me to use what I knew in different ways. The game's environment is as beautiful as the clever design of these puzzles. Many puzzles seemed to know how I thought and actively cut off paths that I would naturally try to take, instead forcing me to get creative and try something else - this felt very refreshing. There are also several puzzles where your initial solution solves the puzzle but nothing happens, and if you solve the puzzle in a different shape it changes the environment to match how you solved the puzzle. For me this is the most rewarding experience.\n\nNot to mention the secrets in the game that blow your mind when you first discover them and then continue to blow your mind as you solve more of them. Many of them are a puzzle to even set up in the first place, and I felt challenged in a different way than the normal puzzles. It is very enjoyable.\n\nI only had to look up a walkthrough at two points during the game, and not to solve puzzles that I was stuck on, but instead to find out where to actually find more puzzles to solve.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzle games like the Portal series and Antichamber, this game is for you. There is minimal story and the focus is expressely on puzzles, and you are free to play any music you want in the background or listen to a podcast etc, or you could just stick with the ambience of the game.\n\nIf you aren't interested in actually playing the game yourself, you can watch my playthrough here for more in-depth commentary and spoilers:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCsoffCh90oOXDIoHd1PLOd6DkVRMBSV","January 30","true","43.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

You aren't expected to have all the answers right away.\nGo to a different part of the island, solve some other puzzles, and eventually you will be able to come back to the puzzle with a fresh perspective and understanding, and wonder "Why was that so difficult before?"\n\nThis is a game for puzzle lovers. That frustration is part of the enjoyment. Because the "Aha!!" moment is the ultimate reward.\n\nThis game is full of those aha moments. The Island itself is fascinating, and wondrous to explore, discovering new bits of knowledge to add to the puzzle language.\n\nIf you are impatient, easily angered, hate puzzles, or just can't stand being stuck.. Then this game isn't for you.\n\nThe Witness is a puzzle journey. It's about solving puzzles, but it feels so much more than that. It's an experience.","January 27","true","36.3"," 49 of 91 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","49","91","2","2"

But, the only thing preventing you is knowledge of the puzzle mechanics, which you learn by seeing those mechanics implemented in smaller more simpler puzzles. If you get stumped by a puzzle, you can just walk away, and find another one. Like Jonathan Blow's other game Braid, there's a ton of philsophical undertones embedded in the story and in the world that slowly unravel as you continue to play and discover. The only reason you have to not play this game is if you are not a fan of puzzles.

Going into this game with those expectations will leave you dissapointed.\n\nThe Witness is a deeply satifying and somewhat challenging puzzle game set on a desolate island. The island looks stunning and I found myself on many occassions just waltzing around admiring the views.\n\nThe puzzle range in difficulty from easy to extremly difficult, but your never left feeling like the game is cheating you as the answers are always there somewhere on the island, if you have the vision to see them.\n\nThe only negative thing I will say about the game is the lack of audio. There is no music and the enviroment makes very little sound. The game could do with a subtle eerie score or nature sound such as chirping of birds or the blowing of the wind to help create more of an atmoshphere.This aside, it a great game and worth the purchase.","January 28","true","5.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Off you trot. Bye bye.\n\nYou're still here? You LIKE puzzles?! Well get on in.\n\nThe Witness is one man's vision perfectly realized. Having finished the game, I look back to the start of the experience realize just how much I have been taught about how the structure and flow of the puzzles in this game work despite never being offered a single line of instruction to as what the rules are.\n\nAll puzzles in the Witness are solved by drawing an unbroken line from a circular node, through a maze and into a rounded end point. Interacting with the world in such a consistent manner avoids being repetitive by constantly switching up and adding to the design of the puzzles with masterful execution by the creator Jonathan Blow. In doing so, it also solves a big problem of many puzzle games - pixel hunting. You now know without the need of pressing a button or requiring a cluttered GUI overlay if what you are looking at can be interacted with.\n\nPuzzles aside, the game itself looks and sounds beautiful. The visuals are wildly varied between sections of the game, while at the same time still feeling like they belong together on the same island. While (almost) completely devoid of music, a solid ambient soundscape ties the experience together.\n\nAt first I wondered why the island itself was even necessary. Could the game simply not be a collection of puzzles held accessible by a central menu? Having completed the game, I know understand the opposite to be true. The island is crucial.\n\nThe Witness is a lovingly crafted puzzle game. I cannot wait to return to the island.","February 5","true","45.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

There are tape and video recordings hidden around the island for you to find if you keep an eye open for them. They are filled with quotes about the ways in which different thought processes colour our view of the world, such as thoughts on Religion, the Scientific Method, Human Morality and the Art of Zen.\n\nI have now 'finished' the game, although there are still quite some puzzles out there I think I might have missed or have remained unsolved as you do not have to solve every puzzle to 'complete' the game.\n\nHowever, when starting out I cannot stress enough that you have to explore the whole island to be able to solve the mazes. In the first hours you are playing you might think that the puzzles you are encountering are truly impossible. This is because the rules of these puzzles only get explained in certain areas, so there are many puzzles you will encounter in the beginning that are way too advanced for you. The more you explore, the more you learn bit by bit, the more fun the game gets. At the end I was gleefully solving puzzles while backtracking to places I thought were impossible the first time around.\n\nIn this day and age it is sometimes difficult to just stay in a moment and have the patience for more than a few minutes to truly look at the details of an object that is in essence an extremely simple thing (a maze), repeating this process over and over and over again, and then still coming up with new ways of solving the same object.\nIt is very refreshing, like a deep cleaning of your brain.\n\nAll in all, I came away from this game with the Zen-like experience which I believe the game was trying to impress upon its players.

There's an incredible amount of depth in a very simple way of interacting with the world + just about everything ties together. Every single puzzle is taught, every single puzzle has a mechanical language easing you into exactly how to solve it- and there's just a ridiculous amount of them all to work through.\n\ni've yearned for a really good elaboration on what the myst series did to videogames for ages and this is just the sort of thing i've been waiting for, really. Games that do what the Myst series tried to do so few and far between, despite that series being so groundbreaking. Puzzle games centering around world- and exploration-based puzzles are basically nonexistent - there's barely even games that try and fail at it, let alone games like this that succeed so hard. The game feels like one that came from a world where games like the Myst series were iterated on constantly and the concepts had time to be polished and perfected, not a world where Fez and Talos Principle are the two bulletpoints on the timeline since the Myst series died.\n\nAnyway: it's a really good game and you should absolutely make time to play it if you are interested in puzzles + game design at all! do it!","January 29","true","25.5"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","23","41","0","0"

Not 100% but completed the endgame. 518 Panels solved +53 secrets. If I understand the black Pillars correctly there are probably over 50 secrets left. Probably also a few panels left but I solved everyone I found (except one, for which I need to study a good few hours more). But I have all the lasers.\n\nThis game is about exploring an island and solving the panels. The panels exhibit various mechanics/rules. And when looking at a very complex panel you have no chance figuring the panel out. But there are easy panels of each mechanic distributed over the island, which offer you to understand the mechanic step by step. So when you come across a new mechanic you don't have the knowledge to solve for yet you got to come back later when you learned more.\n\nThe game has at least 10 zones where a laser can be activated by most of the panels there. Many zones exhibit one mechanic that is deepened but often combined with other mechanics to produce more difficulty. In some zones you have to complete all puzzles to activate the laser in others you can solve either half of the puzzles. When you reached a certain number of lasers you can enter the endgame.\n\nThe endgame is so difficult. There are no words that do justice on how ♥♥♥♥ing difficult it is. It felt like torture. And I only worked it out by trial and error. At this point you should have fully understood every mechanic and can apply it with all its tricks. But the puzzles in the endgame sometimes seem impossible to solve. So you just try and try until out of luck something works. And the endgame is a long zone with many puzzles and combined mechanics from the whole island. I am sure that not many players will complete the game. It is just insanity and you really got to have the will and patience for it. (if you are not good in logical and methodical thinking you are screwed)\n\nThere is no story whatsoever in this game. There are recordings that can be played but only contain some pseudo intellectual jabbering that goes on your nerves. And the voice actors weren't very passionate about it. The game has very beautiful graphics and very good sound effects. But there is no soundtrack. So you can play your own relaxing music while playing the game and I strongly recommend to do so because otherwise you end up frustrated way too early. Would I recommend?

Running is the *only* instruction the game actually provides to you, and complaining about jumping is completely beside the point of the game. Don't get me started on the person who said that the puzzles are "badly placed"- the Metroidvania structure isn't that difficult to figure out. If you don't know what a symbol means, thats a hint to go elsewhere.\n\nWhat you'll get with The Witness is a clever spin on puzzle gaming where the game isn't necessarily about solving line mazes, but about learning the ever-expanding vocabulary that governs them. It feels very satisfying to learn these rules and apply them all by yourself, and its hard to ever truly feel stuck since you can easily take a break and change gears to try a different set of puzzles with a different set of rules.\n\nTo those who complain that there isn't a big payoff at the end, or that there needs to be more story or some sort of motivation to continue playing: knowledge is its own reward.","January 28","true","18.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

It is through the interplay of your actions, the scenery, and the audio that you can begin to understand the deep meaning that Blow was trying to convey. It shows a startling and absolutely genius understanding of how the human mind works, and how different types of thought give rise to different types of meaning--while also tying those different types of meaning together.\n\nIt is not an action game by any means, because it is meant to be played at your leisure. People are used to plowing through games like a cheap buffet, but this is a feast and must be taken slowly. If you allow your mind to relax, the puzzles and meaning will fall into place--and that is an exciting and rewarding moment.\n\nReally, what Blow has done is create a game that helps you realize and understand just how much thought went into figuring out the world around us. At times I can even imagine what some of the great thinkers from the audio clips might have felt when a deep meaning or new understanding has finally clicked into place (probably a bit like it feels to finally solve a game puzzle that has eluded you).\n\nAnd it is exactly this that makes the game what it is. It is not just for your entertainment, it is meant to teach you something that the convenience of modern life has caused many to forget about humanity: that it took a lot of careful thought, daydreaming, and work--from many people throughout history--to get us to where we are. Sometimes it feels like you're playing inside a book (or someone's head), and I've never played a game that is so fully immersive.\n\nIf you are looking for action, look elsewhere.

The game revolves around a very simple core mechanic, but the mechanic is explored in so many unexpected, mind-blowing ways. Some puzzles will stump you for a very long time, while other sequences of puzzles will get you into a non-stop flow of puzzle solving.\n\nGame isn't perfect though. Some of the perspective based puzzles were kinda finnicky and frustrating, leaning more on the execution end of the spectrum than the "figuring out the solution" side. The backstory is also very subtle, to the point where you will completely miss it if you're not actively paying attention for it. That may have been an active decision in making the game, but it probably isn't for everyone.\n\nA minimum length playthrough can take about 8 hours if you're good at puzzles (need 7 areas completed to get to the final area; I did all 11 and finished the game in about 12 hours), but the game is jam-packed with so much extra challenges and secrets that it's hard to say how much time 100% will take.\n\nDespite its very few flaws, this is probably going to end up being a classic.","January 27","true","117.0"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

The general ambiance is very peaceful, and I find that complimenting the game with some light orchestral music makes for the perfect experience. The key to enjoying this game is to view the panels not as a challenge, but as a lesson. They're not something to be conquered, they're something to be approached on their own terms and handled as one becomes ready.\n\nI don’t think that the development team is trying to show off how smart they all are, and how dumb everyone else is. The puzzles aren’t trying to beat you back and dissuade you, they’re enticing you with the opportunity to learn and to understand and to explore. Sometimes, they fail. Most of the time, they succeed.\n\nI think the decision to build the game without an engaging narrative is a bit of a double edged sword. On the one hand, I don't feel frustration from not being able to complete the puzzles fast enough to satisfy my narrative curiosity, which was a problem I sometimes had in Portal. I always wanted to hear what Glados had to say next, even more than I really cared about solving the puzzles, a conflict which often led to significant frustration. In The Witness, I don't have to worry about missing out on a captivating narrative, because as far as I can tell, there isn’t one.\n\nBut, on the other hand, not having an engaging narrative means that this isn’t a game that I can sit and play for long periods of time, especially now that I’ve gotten far enough in that puzzles are taking more than 10 minutes to solve. Even with the music, I find my mind wandering and thinking of other things to do. I just try to take it one panel at a time and when I start getting bored I do something else. When I come back later, I’ve regained some energy and my curiosity and I can enjoy playing once more.\n\nUltimately, I offer my cautious recommendation of this game. If you find that you don’t like it before your refund period expires, just go and get a refund. It won’t get any easier or significantly more engaging any time soon, and you’re better off finding something else that can hold your attention.","January 27","true","24.6"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","19","34","2","0"

The people who like it, really like it. But those who go in expecting something this game is not, are almost certain to walk away disappointed. The following are just some general things about the game. I dare not call them "facts" since some things are still subjective, but I try.\n\nWhether you will like the Witness or nor depends largely on whether you consider any of the following to be pros or cons.\n\n1. A number of puzzles rely on color and sound, more so than you might be used to in other games. Colorblind or tone deaf players be warned.\n\n2. Similarly, there are a handful of puzzles with brightly flashing colors which may cause discomfort.\n\n3. The Witness is a puzzle game, far more than it is a puzzle-adventure game. It's not Myst. Solving puzzles doesn't give you a new piece of the story. It gives you more puzzles. Story is an afterthought at best.\n\n4. The witness has decent atmospheric sound design, but is devoid of almost any background music.\n\n5. Some sections you may do 10 or 20 puzzles in a row that are similar except for increasing complexity.\n\n6. This game has no tutorials, no hints. Everything is determined by the scientific method. You have to experiment with puzzles to understand how they work.\n\n7. When you solve a puzzle in the Witness, there is no fanfare, no sparkles, no gold star rating. For the most part, the only reward is unlocking the next puzzle.\n\n8. The Witness is open-world. You can very early in the game go nearly everywhere in the island. It is also likely to throw puzzles at you in the early game that you will need to step away from and come back to much later.\n\n9. You will always be drawing lines in this game. There are many different mechanics at work, which make for many unique puzzles, but the method of imputing the solution is always the same. Even switches and levers are line puzzles.\n\n10. This game can be really hard, obtuse, and often frustratingly mind-bending. Sometimes, very rarely, it might also be just a little cheap.\n\n- The bonus totally not objective section\nUnpopular opinion inbound, but I think I liked this more than The Talos Principle, to which it is compared quite a lot. I like the mental process of solving puzzles, but not really the act of having to show my work, which in Talos Principle might mean 5 to 10 minutes of carrying around boxes through force fields and trying to get a laser angle just right. I already know the answer. I don't want to have to do all the grunt work as well. I want to do a new puzzle.\nThis game allowed me to do just that. Once a puzzle clicked, it took just a few seconds to draw it out, and move on to the next challenge. This wasn't always true. At times the pace set by the puzzles is broken by the languid pace of the world around you, which I suppose is fine, if you are taking the game at a slow pace. Near the end of the game, getting around the island between the few puzzles you might have remaining was also not that much fun anymore, and one or two puzzles were maybe just a bit too obnoxious in the way it regarded my time.\nDespite this, for the most part, I loved it. It this was one of the most inventive, original and gorgeous puzzle games I had played in a long time.","February 22","true","47.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Since the Portal and Portal 2, I have never been so amazed by overall theme and emotion of the whole game. It feels really as a whole, and not as a decoration for some puzzles and author's ideas.\nBasically, the game explores one mechanic. But creating new rules, then bending them over to create new rules, combining those rules in different, unimaginable at first, ways - all of this creates an atmosphere, where you are proud of your solutions, even the simplest ones.\nThe game is hard sometimes. I mean, it isn't scary hard, but I had a couple of dozens of puzzles, which stopped me for some significant time. The difficulty in the game increases gradually, which is a big plus for such games. You don't want to stop, because you understand that every minute you spend in the game, you solve something a bit harder, you brain works a bit better, so you are... smarter?\nThere is one thing, where the game even beats Portal games. The environment here holds your attention, which wasn't the part of the game feel in Portal. Trees and sand, rocks and ocean, windmill and autumn leaves, sometimes you just stop and watch the nature of this island. There is more in it, sometimes you can find a small puzzle or secret in an unexpected place, sometimes the environment plays a significant role in puzzle solution and... sometimes the island is the puzzle itself.\nAnd in the end, the atmosphere and puzzles don't interfere, but work together to give you the game experience of the year.

While the player has fun laughing at Glados or is pondering the philosophical implications of The Talos principle, the brain gets a chance to relax. To gain perspective.\n\nThis helps stop the frustration chain.\n\nIn The Witness there is no music, no story, no context, barelly any tutorials. . Even when there is sound, the effects are minimal and create no mood.\n\nSo what is left? Graphics, which are nice, puzzles and criptic clues for said puzzles. The simple fact i found in the first two hours of play is that if you take out humor, and other distractions such as Elohim or Glados all you have to think about is your own frustration with some puzzle. Because of that even when i solved the puzzle i didn't feel smart. I felt stupid for taking so long.\n\nAlso even in the first two hours of play i encounterd two very simple puzzles made hard in an artificial manner: maze puzzles, and regular puzzles translated in the enviroment.

The Witness is not the kind of puzzle game you'd play if you like puzzle games; rather, it's the kind of puzzle you might give to someone who likes puzzles. It has the definitive style and tactility of one of those die-cast metal things you'd get at the learning store at the mall, and the same rich symbolism and intellectual charm of an ARG or illustrated puzzle book with a cash prize that nobody ever claimed. On top of that, The Witness is also one of the most beautiful and painstakingly designed locations I've ever inhabited, full of painterly trees and buildings designed by a real-life architect.\n\nWell worth the asking price, and well worth not spoiling even if it means never completing it.

Some people misunderstand a piece of art and quickly dismiss it. Many people who bought this game came with certain expectations. What they expected didn't end up happening. Instead of over-the-top action sequences or a transparent narrative, this game is quiet, contemplative, and tough. Some people prefer books that have a simple conclusion that tells you exactly how the characters felt and what happened to them. These people get angry at authors who don't spell out exactly what things are supposed to mean. Other readers enjoy interpreting things for themselves. I believe the word for that trait is imagination. This game is deeply meditative, and I give my interpretation of the meaning below. Warning: it contains some vague spoilers about the game.\n\nYou start in a sheltered area, learning the basics of how things, how to get ahead, how to progress. It isn't too long before you gain independence and can go anywhere and do anything you want. But you quickly learn that all these new areas are locked until you apply yourself to more learning. Your final goal is not immediately obvious, but major moments of solving puzzles unlocks more and light directs your path upward. You can take the time to hear scientists, philosophers, psychologists, and religious icons if you choose. Their words can shape your experience and make it more meaningful than simplying moving from point A to point B. Instead of endlessly working and never feeling fulfilled, you can realize that there's no rush. No timer to hurry you. No other inhabitants on the island to force their expectations on you or pressure you to complete anything. You can stop to look at the clouds, hear the birds, enjoy the beautiful island you are on. And even in these natural formations, you see patterns that can be meaningful. You have the realization that solving puzzles just seemed like the thing you had to do, but really there was no person telling you to complete them. You start to find your own reasons for completing them. A sense of accomplishment. A sense of adventure. Curiosity to see what it all means and how it ends. And in the end, progressing to the edges of what is possible to learn and accomplish, you finish your journey and look back on all that you've done. Did it matter at all? Was it meaningful, or just a waste?\n\n....And that is the beauty of this game. It makes you realize that life works the same way. Humanity has always sought how to interpret our surroundings and progress toward lofty goals. For some, religion gave perspective. For others, the pursuit of scientific discovery was enough of a goal. Others still didn't see any point to it at all, and felt cheated when they looked back on what they did. This game, if you are willing to listen, is asking you, "What is your perspective on life? What is your reason for going through life, solving the daily puzzles in your way?"\n\n10/10 Made me rethink my perspective on life","April 21","true","48.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I've only played for 6 hours so far and it has, quite literally, surpassed every expectation I had going in and, interestingly enough, scratched an itch for immersive puzzles that I didn't know I had. The game is beautiful, one of the most beautiful games I've played, but not in the sense of graphical prowsess but in the sense that it really feels as though someone laboured both time and love into sculpting this island (though, in having said that, graphically this game runs like a dream and looks the part (for specs and FPS, check bottom of preliminary review).\n\nThis is one of those games where I, in good concious, can't spoil or talk about any of the puzzles or what occurs in the game for that would do a great disservice to the experience. All I can say is that if you like puzzles (and, yes, they are varried -- even if they all essentially are the same breed) and if you like immersive experiences, please play this game and please do not spoil it for yourself. This is an experience that needs to be your own. I can't wait to jump back in and see what else I learn.\n\nThoughts on Performance:\n\nThe game consistently runs well at 60fps (on the high setting) with a GTX970m, i7-4720HQ (2.6ghz) with 8gb RAM loaded from SSD at 1920x1080. Runs fluidly and smoothly and beautifully. A great PC game.\n\nRecommended for:\n\nAnyone who likes puzzlers. This is, at the very core, and exploratory puzzle game. I'm not sure if there is a legitimate narrative but that isn't what is gripping about this game. You create the narrative with your exploration and puzzle-solving. Do not buy this game if you wanted a game like MYST or a game that isn't fundamentally a puzzle game. The price tag is a bit steep for a puzzle game, yes, but it has been worth it for me so far. Wait for a sale if you are on the fence about the title but this has been one of my personal favourites for the past year.","January 28","true","10.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I have my notebook handy and I have been writing down the games laws as I figure them out.

I love puzzle games but everything I had seen suggested this was just a bunch of panel puzzles which could have been a phone game, with the island being just a five-million-dollar 3D menu system which took seven years to make and made the game cost £30 at launch. I was going to wait until it was on sale, but I kept hearing there was more (but never specifics) and a friend said it was good so I took a gamble and I treated myself. I'm really glad I did. I got my money's worth, as you can see from the playtime, and did & found almost everything myself, which was very rewarding.\n\nThe island is not just a menu system. It is part of the game. It is part of the puzzles. It is needed to solve the puzzle panels. It *is* the puzzles in some cases, and I am not just talking about large walk-on puzzle panels (although those do exist as well). I personally love exploring large 3D environments, and it is full of incredible detail, which makes everything feel real. It is not just the amount of polygons on screen but the way everything feels made out of solid stuff. Scaffolding and supports are in the places they would be in a real decaying building that needed them, and things like that. Things like the shoreline of a beach are really well observed, with so many tiny details. And every detail may matter, because it may be part of a puzzle or a clue, so you have a reason to look at them, too.\n\nThe island feels large and varied, but it usually only takes a short time to get from one place to another when you need to, so it is never a trek. It would be more accurate to call it dense than large, but the density makes it feel large. You'll often run the same route several times and discover something new on the way in a place  you thought had nothing left to give.\n\nThe puzzle panels are everywhere, but they are not the only things you can interact with, and the panels themselves are actually a UI for doing varied things, with a consistent theme and visual language. Some of them act like switches. Some are just puzzles. Some are both. The puzzles themselves are varied, and not just simple mazes (although there are a few), nor just logic mazes (although there are many). Nobody minded that Doom 3 had lots of interactive computer terminals which looked and worked in a consistent way, and the panels in The Witness are not entirely dissimilar, but obviously also more the focus of the game than in Doom 3 (and you won't be shooting any demons from hell).\n\nThe puzzles themselves are very, very well designed. Puzzle design is hard to do in games, getting the training, progression and learning curve right without it feeling too hard, too easy, or too repetitive. The game nails this overall, although there was one type of puzzle some people may find a little hard (but you can always use a walkthrough for that one type if it comes to it, and my advice is to repeat the patterns yourself as that seemed to help me visualise them). A sign of a good puzzle game is that, once you've learned the basics, you'll face puzzles where you try the obvious solution but find the designer has thought of that and added a complication to make you have to think laterally to solve it. This game is full of things like that.\n\nThe engine ran very well on my PC staying at a solid 60 FPS at 1080p on my GTX 960. I could up the res to 4k and get about 45 FPS but 1080p + good antialiasing and 60 FPS felt better. My hardware isn't really up to 4k gaming, so the fact it could have done >30 FPS in this game at 4k is a positive. A week after launch the things it was missing like FOV sliders and joypad sensitivity were added (mouse sensitivity was already in the game, and I played using keyboard & mouse).\n\nAny negatives? Well, the story is minimal, but that honestly didn't bother me. In fact, I'd have preferred if there was even less story as I felt the small attempts to give some background to the island in some of the more hidden audiologs did not really work. I disliked the audiologs in general, but they are more of a collectible and, I guess, an attempt to make the player think about philosophy and spirituality while playing the game. You can completely ignore them (whether you click on them or not) and it will make no difference to the rest of the game.\n\nI found the (lack of) editing of the quotes and the voice actors' delivery made even the seriously profound quotations have me wishing they would just shut up and stop repeating the same idea again and again because I understood it the first time and I keep thinking the quote will end now but they keep adding more words to say the same thing I already understood, just like this sentence itself has become; it can get annoying, can't it, when someone won't just stop talking even though they have run out of ideas to say, however good the ideas were at the start? :)\n\nI also felt that the game's audiologs & meta-story were pushing the concept of spirituality as a given, as how the world must be viewed to experience the wonder of life to its full, and then they literally complain that few prominent atheists/scientists provide answers to spiritual questions rather than criticisms of other answers. I can see how the conversation arose. The game aimed to present various philosophies' takes on the world, some of them conflicting, and without saying 'this is right, and that is wrong', and it achieved that in general, but ended up criticising atheism and only atheism. It's trendy to bash atheism lately, and some of that backlash *is* deserved, but the author-inserts' complaint in the game was that it doesn't fit the framing the game designers wanted, which is neither its duty nor its fault. It's like complaining that statistics won't tell you which lottery numbers will come up, when a clairvoyant will. It also occurred that the author-inserts making this complaint were guilty of the exact same thing themselves, but not self-aware enough to see it. None of this really affects the rest of the game, though. It's just audio you can ignore if you don't like it.\n\nWhile I liked Braid a hell of a lot, I wasn't a particular fan of Blow personally. He has exceptional design & dev skills, but I disagree with a bunch of things he's said (although certainly not everything) and find his attempts at narrative a bit pretentious, to be blunt. But that does not matter. This isn't "Be Jonathan Blow's Friend: The Game" and restricting ourselves to art only made by people we'd be friends with would rob ourselves of many great experiences, including this. As with Braid, the game mechanics and designs speak for themselves.\n\nBefore the game came out, many assumed it would be like Myst, and then wrote they were disappointed it was not. Having played it, I don't understand this. It felt *a lot* like Myst to me, and that game is fresh in my mind from recently playing Myst, RealMyst and Riven for the first time. You have an island full of puzzles and zones, things you have to work out for yourself using observation, symbols, logic and experimentation, and things you learn in one area that were gating your progress in another (i.e. ability to solve puzzles & open new areas). You have the isolation and the beauty. The feeling that someone made this place, for some purpose, and that it is both real and surreal, and will probably never be completely understood, but definitely has some meaning. Some of the areas are direct homages to Myst, too (e.g. the treetops).\n\nIf you like solving puzzles, if you like exploring, and having your observation rewarded at almost every turn, if you want to be inside a dense puzzle-candy store, if you like getting lost in a beautiful island that is tightly packed with detail, with things to find and do at literally every turn, then you will love this game and get many hours out of it. It is worth every penny and, more importantly, worth your time.","February 7","true","60.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I love games where you genuinely feel like you've figured something out or unlocked something that was hidden. I'll say the same thing that's been said before...  don't use a guide. Just don't. Everything will become apparent after you've played for a little bit. It's hard to say "if you've played ____, you'll like this game" because there's really nothing like it. The closest thing I can say is it's a little bit Myst and a little bit Portal and a little bit Rubick's Cube. Everything mixes together nicely with some incredible graphics to boot. I'm playing on a mid-high end PC and it looks incredible. The high frame rate on PC really makes the world come alive in a way that it doesn't on the PS4. I'm having a great time with the game and I've become addicted to it. Supposedly there's around 80 hours of gameplay... I'm only 17 in, I can't imagine what else I have ahead of me.

I won't lie to you, you interact with puzzles in mainly one way in this game.  But the logic of the puzzles is so varied and challenging, and the environmental impact on the puzzles is very distinct and keeps a somewhat simple idea really fresh for hours on end.   Most games have a primary way of interacting with the game (in shooters, you shoot, etc.), and The Witness is no different.  But the way in which the game distorts these puzzles, uses them to challenge what you already understand, and incorporates a beautiful environment makes The Witness a memorable and very enjoyable experience.  The world is vast, with lots of places to explore and secrets/easter eggs to find when you want to take a break from the basic puzzle.  The Witness does follow the recent trend of not giving the player much (if any) story directly, instead relying upon the environment and some hidden pieces to build the story of the world.  This approach may not resonate with everyone, but I feel that it fits the story being told.  I'd highly reccomend this game to anyone who like puzzles or wants to think a bit when playing their next video game.  9.5/10","January 28","true","33.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Just like the time mechanics in Braid were layered with more and more aspects and a-ha moments, the seemingly simple "draw a line puzzle" keeps being built upon, requiring noticing hints in the world, lateral thinking, and remembering puzzles done earlier. There is no music, just beautiful ambient sounds, which I think is a good choice. While the music in Talos Principle is great, eventually I got tired of it. Graphics are similarly sparse, going for bright, pastel colors and smooth plain surfaces instead of high resolution textures. Think functional archtecture or zen gardens.\n\nIf I could think of anything to criticise, it would be nice with more achievments for boasting rights and to get a greater sense of progress, it currently only has two achievements, which I suspect are "completed the game" and "found every secret and did every damn puzzle in the game". But maybe that is another aspect of the minimal, zen like design, teaching you to shed youself of the trappings of modern gaming and appreciate the beautify of the essence.","January 31","true","44.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","1"

Now that has grown to the level of hero worship, and I do not use the word lightly. What goes on throughout is a testament to both his brilliance and his ability to communicate, even through the most limited of channels.\n\nIt does take intelligence to admire the game, admittedly. You only get to appreciate the layers of puzzles unraveling if you are able to unravel them. As you progress deeper into the game, you glimpse part of that genius, and in time begin to think alike. You grow and get to expect what comes next, and then you get amazed that the designer did foresee your growth, what path it would take and did prepare for that. You bubble with joy when you see the next surprise, that you deep inside knew was coming, but only realized it after the fact.\n\nYou get to see the simplest of puzzle ideas, an application of graph theory, grow into an infinite playground in a fractal pattern, always promising to be more in the next step.\n\nIt is amazing that this level of intricacy can be achieved, in any stretch of time. The development time, long as it may be considering 'industry norms', is nothing, considering this was the end result. It is exciting that yet more artifacts like this may come from Johnathan blow.\n\nThere are all these complaints, from people who are offended when their intelligence is challenged. People don't play games to feel inadequate, many do when playing this. And many people tend to lash out so as to convince (primarily) themselves that the inadequecy isn't intrinsic. Those who can introspect, can grow, and that denomination is the target audience for this work.\n\nI have seen comparisons with Portal and Talos Principle. Games that fall far behind their promise (especially in the case of Portal). The puzzles were kept simple, as a design decision -to appeal to a wider audience, when they could be so much more. No punches are pulled here. The premise is extended far, far beyond what could initially be imagined.\n\nThere are complaints that you have to use pen and paper. False: You also need a pencil and an eraser. The puzzles are so intricate that some of them would give you a headache if you tried to keep all aspects of it in your head, even if you were named von Neumann, and that is by design. If you think that is bad, this game is definitely not for you.\n\nI have seen comments that this is a disappointment after Braid. Ridiculous, I think: This game contains the seed that made Braid great: the ever-evolving puzzles, the extension of a simple mechanic to both technical and symbolic extremes, and the philosophical sense of wonder behind. Likewise it contains what made Myst great: The sense of exporation and loneliness in an alien environment, and the devious, ingenious, and original puzzles. Myst was never about the patchwork mythology pasted on it afterwards. This work captures the 'abstract' in them both, where most people merely grasp and look for the veneer, the packaging. I tried to avoid and spoilers throughout, but here I will give the whiff of one: The game _explicitly tells_ this fact within, showing that 'the dev team thinks of everything', even what most people will fail to grasp, and the few will.\n\nI have seen someone complaining when they learned to do something, and looked forward to 'apply elbow grease' to solve others like it was frustrated when 'the rules arbitrarily changed' in the next step. That is the point here, really. That was Blow's promise all along: There won't be any repetition, any 'application of elbow grease'. You won't ever get to turn off your brain and proceed through muscle memory -or its cognitive equivalent. Aside from some tutorial bits (where the whiners haven't even got past) the game always keeps you on your toes, always offers something fresh. This gripe, of course, contradicts with another that has been raised: That the game is repetitive. Well, only if you cannot see the puzzles for what they are and all you can comprehend is lines and boxes.\n\nThere are those who whine about not getting rewarded. That's pitiful, for it shows that the people have become so dependent on the Skinner boxes that dominate the industry, not only need but also explicitly want the base gratification offered by them, for accomplishing trivial tasks. Here the gratification is in the puzzle itself: Admiring the beauty of one's own work in the solution, getting a nontrivial thing done, and getting to see the next puzzle. That is not to say there are no climaxes and revelations, they are just scarce enough to be really significant and deeply satisfying. And supposed dead ends are, more likely than not, part of some greater puzzle that you might get to see hours later.\n\nAnd in all that freshness, there is an amazing amount of content. It was immensely satisfying to get the endgame after 13 hours of play, and I believe I did very good time there. There wasn't the disappointment of it being over either: There is so much more to explore yet. And the game did make the promise with puzzles that -at the time- I could not fathom, teasing to come back after I did grow.\n\nNow all I hope for is for Blow to begin working on his next project immediately, and with utmost pace. I do believe he is a font that contains more to give than a lifetime of giving would suffice.\n\n---\n\nSlight spoiler, so beware:\n\nSeen the ending, then dove back in to complete the obvious extra objective. Done that, and when admiring the island in satisfaction, saw a curious little detail. Clicked around just for fun and got my mind blown. Chased the lead, and am feeling overwhelmed for the first time since the beginning. There are so many layers, and the sheer amount of detail makes one think that the developers _lived_ on the island all this time, to get it all 'just right'.","January 28","true","28.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The main reason for not recommending it is mainly the cost. This is not a game worth $40. It feels too sterile and lifeless. Games like Myst or The Talos Principle have way more variety to their puzzles as well as having a really immersive, interactive world that is exciting to explore. This game just feels like a bunch of line puzzles randomly placed throughout a pretty island. It's way too restrictive with its sluggish walk speed, inability to jump, and overabundance of invisible walls and insurmountable waist-high fences.\n\nThe puzzles themselves aren't really interesting either. Some of the puzzles aren't even puzzles. They're just memorization. One group of puzzles involves looking at trees at a certain angle and seeing what branch an apple is and replicating that on a monitor. There's no real thought to that at all. On top of that, sometimes failing a puzzle will force you to go back and resolve the previous puzzle to reunlock the puzzle you were just on. That's just unnecessary busy work.\n\nI will say though that you should take this review with a grain of salt as it is only based off of an hour of playing since I didn't want to surpass the 2 hour refund limit.

For the vast majority of the game the only real hints as to what this island is are audio files with quoats from famous pepole about religon/ science and when you get basicly to the end and it's a little (I stress a little) clearer as to the actual plot.But even after that the story feels chep and hollow. The writter of the game seems to be trying to make a profound statment about how games can be more then entertainment and can be enlightening/meaningful (I agree) but when there dosn't appear any original thoughts of the developers own in the story it just made me feel like the hollow story was extra hollow.\n\nI've come to expect from a game that wants me to spend 30+ hours in it's world I want that world to ether be a world I want to be in or a world that is teaching me something. I feel like the developer despritly wanted to teach me something but lacked the currage or cofidence to tell me something that wasn't directly taken from well respected philosiphers or the like and if I was interested in that I'd just go to the source. If the argument was that I wouldn't hear these quoats or thoughts otherwise I find that insulting and would rather my games not insult me.\n\nAs to the complaints that the game is $40 those complaints are pritty stupid. The game is masterfuly crafted with lots of original content. Sure it's no the same level of content as say skirym or something like that but something this original takes extra effort and there was probbly a lot correctly on the cutting room floor as the delopers were feeling outside the normal gernra norms. I feel like if the game story and or overaching levels came together better in the end like a myst or something like that I'd say $40 is a steal but as it is I think it may be a little over priced but if you see this for $30 you'll get your $'s worth so $40 day one is fine by me.\n\nFinal not the 2nd achevent without spoiling anything was the most stressful/fun thing I've had to do in a video game in years so for me my time with the game was enjoyable but objectivly the game is overly lopsided.","January 31","true","35.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Why is this a thumbs up, then?\n\nI simply believe the game keeps its secrets too well hidden from its potential audience, to the point where it becomes a fault. The thing is, it's not just that the line drawing puzzles escalate to amazing depth over time, it's also that there is an entire extra layer of depth and interaction and revelation inside The Witness that the dev never even hints at and all professional reviews do a really poor job underlining.\n\nOutside of the (admittedly excellent) panel puzzle sequence that progresses the game, there is an extra intricate layer of gameplay that exists outside of the physical panels that you solve. I feel this is something you might have a hard time spotting in your 2-hour jittery Steam refund window. But I feel that it's important that people know that this layer IS THERE and it's much more mind-boggling than the actual panel puzzles.\n\nThere is a ton of other secrets within secrets and little surprises and feelings and meanings that I have not yet discovered despite watching some mild-to-medium spoilers before I purchased. It was those spoilers that won me over.\n\nEven though I've seen and read fascinating things, I can see there is a wealth of extra content, layers and meanings that I have yet to uncover, in addition to all those mind-bending puzzle grids. The whole point of The Witness is not to solve a sufficient number of panels and trigger an ending.

I've been eagerly awaiting this game for several years, and today is the day it's finally out.\n\nI'm going to get right to my biggest complaint: You will absolutely need a pen and notebook to beat this game.\n\nNot right away, possibly not even for several hours, but at some point you will start running into puzzles where note taking and doodling are mandatory as there's just far too much abstract data to keep all in your head.\n\nThis game is being billed as a deviously difficult puzzle game, and with that sentiment I have to agree. Yet, it is difficult for the wrong reasons. Understanding the puzzles at a conceptual level isn't really all that hard. Noticing the subtleties in the environment and being able to apply them to the puzzle at hand isn't particularly tasking for someone with acute attention to detail.\n\nIt's the application that is frustrating, as it often requires you to doodle the information that needs to be repeated somewhere else. After playing the game for about 8 hours now, I'm looking at page after page of doodles and notes I've taken, none of which are particularly even meaningful after the fact, that were simply a translation of information that existed at one place in the game and needed to be applied somewhere else.\n\nThis isn't a difficult process. It's just annoying and time consuming. And what's worse, it diverts your attention from the game. If you're going to have note taking and doodling as a key facet to the gameplay, you better well make it *part* of the game instead of constantly distracting the player *from* the game. How difficult would an overlay or a virtual notebook have been? I suspect not very.\n\nI realize games like Myst and Riven virtually required note taking as well, but those games are 10-20+ years old by now. Limitations of the time were certainly a factor, and if you're looking at this as an evolution of the genre, then this is an aspect that I'm sure just about everyone hopes would have gone vestigial.\n\nThere might be more practical ways of achieving the same results as pen and paper: taking screenshots, taking pictures with tablet/phone, but I suspect these would be no less immersion breaking, and ultimately more of an annoyance than a challenge.\n\nThere is also the possibility that this is a non-issue for you, and if that's the case I actually recommend this game, as I have no other complaints about it.\n\nDespite the minimalist art style, the game is visually stunning. I thought no music would be a turn-off for me, but after playing I must say it was the right call. The game world feels very much alive despite there not being any sign of life. Trying to absorb everything and catch every (often necessary) detail is quite an experience, even if the game demands more of your resources than what it provides.","January 26","false","0.5"," 174 of 337 people (52%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","52","174","337","7","10"

Because there sure as hell is very little to this game other than puzzles.\n\nThere's vague whispers of a story. Somewhere. Good luck getting through all the hidden artsy-fartsy poems and philosophical essays to find it.\n\nMost of the puzzles aren't taught in any way. You're expected to work them out. It's clearly "part of the difficulty", except the issue there is that it is not fun - especially in the scenarios where the game punishes you for getting a puzzle wrong by making you walk to the previous panel you solved and re-solving it.\nThe challenge should lie in the puzzle itself, not in remembering what all the ♥♥♥♥ing little symbols mean. When you finally remember, there's no satisfaction - you feel completely cheated by the game for throwing in another one of the little ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nAbout 6 hours in I realised I was no longer enjoying the game and it had no promise of surprising me with something. It felt like a chore, and sadly the art direction couldn't keep the gameplay afloat for any longer. I don't recommend it, unless you really love puzzles (and I don't just mean if you enjoyed playing Portal).\n\nThis makes it sound like I hated it more than I really did, but I'm certainly not re-installing this one any time soon.","April 13","false","7.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","1"

There is a sense of stagnantation to the game,  I think part of the problem may be due to the randomness of the puzzles scattered all over the island, There is no rationale or reason as to why these puzzles exist in the particular context. They just feel randomly scattered and makes no sense. Because of this, there is no real feel of progression.\n\nI am not really motivated in continuing further, which is partly due to the fact that I get nauseous after a short period of play time. The other would be the fact that I'm just not engaged by the promise of mystery and wonder of the island. At least not enough for me to brave the nausea. Some may find the appeal in solving the puzzles strewn across the island, but I'd probably have trouble keeping my lunch in much less finding solutions to the puzzles.\n\nnote: it would probably help to have animation cues when certain puzzles are solved as to be able to determined what some of the puzzles achieved.

If both are yes, go buy this game.\nIf not, you could skip this game, but I promise this game is worth the effort. Just know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nI can already tell that The Witness is easily one of the best games I've ever played in my lifetime. I'm roughly 5 hours in and I can't get enough. I'll fully flesh out this review at some point, but I thought it important to put my initial impressions up as soon as possible. Without meaning to offend, it seems clear that most of the negative reviews I've skimmed through, simply don't get it.\n\nStoryThe Witness is not about being told a 'story', at least not in a traditional sense. It is a contemplative, meandering conversation between designer and player. It's about uncovering a story yourself, through hours of patience and curiosity. There are so many mysteries to uncover: what is this island, who were its inhabitants, what the heck is with all of these puzzles? I've only barely scratched the surface, and I am more than intrigued. I'm excited for more, and without being spoon fed the answers.\n\nPuzzlesSaying that the maze puzzle mechanics are repetitive is like complaining that an FPS is repetitive because it makes you fire guns, or driving games are repetitive because you drive cars. The maze puzzles work BECAUSE they are the backbone of all of the puzzle solving. They give your brain a filter through which to receive all of the information that you collect by completing other puzzles or simply exploring the environment. It would be impossible for the puzzles to have the depth that they do if it weren't for the maze structure.\n\nThe puzzles are beyond fantastic, a masterclass in puzzle design. They are always varied, always making you question assumptions, and always building upon the accumulated lessons that you've acquired. It's your brain that levels up, not your character. Truly brilliant stuff! Yes, they are crazy fun; yes, at times they are pretty frustrating; and yes, you probably should get out the old pen and paper once in awhile. They are more than worth it.\n\nThis game challenges not only you as a player, but the entire medium of gaming itself. Come at it from a place of patience, curiosity, and a dash of discipline, and you will experience on of the most rewarding experiences gaming has to offer.","January 27","true","32.8"," 57 of 109 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","57","109","3","0"

This is a great mechanic to motivate a player to explore.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel that the puzzles are ultimately not fun or particularly satisfying and due to their difficulty easily get tedious. It can't be compared to the fun and interactive physics puzzling of games like Portal 2.\n\nStory, well didn't play sufficiently yet to say, but you're basically just thrown flat into the game without any explanation whatsoever. Perhaps that's part of the mystery, I don't know, but it's certainly not gonna keep most players intrigued since the story element (at least for now) is largely absent.\n\nGraphics are pretty, but optimization is rather poor.\n\nOverall, an interesting game that's worth trying but NOT FOR ITS CURRENT PRICE ($35-40).

As the game goes, puzzles get challenging which is really a great part, but there is a line between challenging and infuriating. Challenging but fair is one kind, but challenging and irritating is another. Here its the second kind, because the puzzles get overly repetitive after a point, same kind of puzzle again and again, and what do you get for completing it ? Same more difficult puzzle again. Also another big problem is there is no puzzle variety, only mazes with different rules. That adds to the irritating nature of the game.\n\nThere is no music, no rewards for finishing puzzles, collectibles are dumb and doesnt make sense.

Weird combination, huh?\nThat concept actually works rather well. You work on a puzzle for a while, can't figure it out, and instead just move on to another part of the island. This solves the everlasting puzzle game problem of not even wanting to start it up if you're stuck.\nThe (many!) puzzles are singular screens which have you drawing a line across a grid. A very basic concept. And with that very basic concept The Witness does absolutely everything it possibly could. It will introduce lots of new rules, need you to take the surroundings of the puzzle into account and even have you taking notes in real life.\n"Then why are people complaining that the puzzles are too similar?" you ask.

The setting is beautiful. There isn't anything about this game that isn't artsy or pretty to look at. When you enter darker rooms, it feels like you're there. When you go out into the sun and gaze out upon the mountains and trees, everything is just stunning. This game is beautiful.\n\nThere is absolutely no ambient music. Only the noises of the enviorment you're in. And I have to say that the developers did an excellent job at making sounds effects, every step sounded like what I was stepping on/in. If I was walking on concrete, it sounded like I was stepping on concrete. And the same for all of the other materials in the game. It was really well made as far as little details go.\n\nAs for gameplay I would have to give The Wittness a 8/10. The game is a puzzle game that is open world and relies on you exploring the beautiful landscapes to find out where to go. Now, that being said there are several areas you should go to before others otherwise a lot of the puzzles the game puts you through won't make sense at first. I had this issue multiple times and I had no clue where or what I was supossed to be doing. This was frustrating at best as I had to go look up what I was supossed to do for a specific puzzle because I didn't know what the hell I was supossed to do. But I like that about this game. There is absolutely no tutorial and the game does not hold your hand at all. It is extremely challenging and forces the player to think about the puzzle they are trying to complete. There were clues hidden throughout the enviornment which made me look about to try and find something to try and help me complete the puzzle. It is a very clever idea and the concepts for a lot of these puzzles are some that I have never seen in a game before. The "you have to look for clues" aspect of the game also led to several different secrets in the game which IMO is really cool.\n\nAll that being said this game isn't easy at all. The game starts out relatively easy, however that's about it as far as easy goes. The game is extremely difficult and challenging. I wasn't able to play the game for more than about an hour per session because my brain would melt and be in a puddle on the floor. But when I was in a good mood and ready for a challenge the enviornments were very relaxing, and being that the only sounds in the game are the ones you and your surroundings make just exemplified that even more.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to those who are ready for a challenge and don't want their hand to be held or be stuck in a super linear puzzle solving experience. Excellent work.","March 2","true","30.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Now that I've played it myself it totally exceeded my expectations, and now that I've beaten it, and with the rising amount of negative reviews on top about this game I feel like I have a responsibility to speak up positively.\n\nFirst of all this is totally not a game for everyone, this is for those who loves to just chill and explore, this is for those who want a game that respects their intelligence. This game does a different take on many things. One of it is obviously not spoon-feeding the player about many things. I hate those games where they just bombard you with texts, or dialogues and all just to teach you every bits of what you can do in the game. Those kind of games are an example of bad game design. I mean looking way back we got Mario, did it teach you the mechanics through texts? No, instead it taught you by experience.\n\nMoving on some other side, The Witness really focused on the gameplay side with a little glimpse to its narrative, that glimpse giving the player hints so it can interpret things on its own. Regarding the gameplay side it totally rocks! The puzzles are brilliant that you'll even think about how Jonathan Blow came up with it. I can't comment much on the narrative side because I was so into the world, and the puzzles instead. I'll probably focus on them on my next run.\n\nCommenting on those people who did not recommend this game because "there are no rewards but puzzles", dude I just want to say that this is a "puzzle" game for a reason. The real reward behind this game are those "aha!" moments when you solve a puzzle that you've had a hard time with. There were also saying that the narrative is "un-insteresting", the game is dull. Yeah maybe it's "un-interesting" because the game doesn't present it to you by explosions, slow-mo epic moments and stuff, but it gets interesting when you dig deeper beyond the audio logs, the island, and what you do in it. Well at least for me it's interesting because it's a really clever ending.\n\nAnyhow I just also want to point out the game content-wise. Is the $40 price tag worth it? YES! I've beat the game, I got 38.9 hrs as of the moment, and there are alot of areas that I haven't gone into yet! (I've solved around 450+ puzzles I think with around 30 secrets). For me I would even buy this game at $60. It's just that worth it for a puzzle maniac like me.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR version: The game is totally not for everyone, but if you're that kind of person who loves games that pushes their brain to its limits then this is totally for you. Content-wise, it has a lot in it. You just gotta dig deeper.","February 8","true","55.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Weird combination, huh?\nThat concept actually works rather well. You work on a puzzle for a while, can't figure it out, and instead just move on to another part of the island. This solves the everlasting puzzle game problem of not even wanting to start it up if you're stuck.\nThe (many!) puzzles are singular screens which have you drawing a line across a grid. A very basic concept. And with that very basic concept The Witness does absolutely everything it possibly could. It will introduce lots of new rules, need you to take the surroundings of the puzzle into account and even have you taking notes in real life.\n"Then why are people complaining that the puzzles are too similar?" you ask. Well, that kind of line puzzle is all there is. The Witness really needs to be praised for how much it does with the limitations it set itself but it never answers the question why it limited itself so much in the first place.\nThe island is huge and even 5 or 6 hours into the game you will still find yourself running into new places you haven't seen before.

It is an interesting allegory but also a very simple one.\n\nWhat I want to talk about is how perfectly crafted this game is. The game design and graphics are simply amazing. I loved roaming around on the island, looking for the next series of puzzle and wished the game would never end.\n\nThe difficulty was perfect for me and I really enjoyed the roller coaster aspect of it. Traditional puzzle games tend to get harder as you progress. This one goes back and forth which is key to make sure the player doesn't get frustrated. I was sometime stuck on a puzzle for 30 minutes and the last thing I wanted was to be stuck on the following one for another 30 minutes.

The moment I realised that...well all I can say is that was a great moment and it made me reinvest in it on a whole new level. Also, did I mention that the game is gorgeous? It is.\n\nSo the question is, do I recomend this game? My short answer is 'Yes!'. However, to answer the question if you should buy this game I have three follow up questions:\n-Do you like puzzle games and brain teasers?\n-Are you the kind of gamer that look behind every rock, every tree for that last collectable?\n-Do you enjoy a well made walking similator?\nIf the answer is yes to one or more of these questions, you owe it to yourself to try this game. It  is great!\n\nOnce you feel that you are done with the game and ready to stop playing, have a look at the spoiler filled game session Giant Bomb had with Jonathan Blow.

The subtle, wordless tutorializing combined with meditative quotations and audio recordings  seem to me like an attempt to communicate a (somewhat lofty and pretentious, but probably not incorrect) argument from that designer that people can do so much more than they are to better themselves through study and meditation, and with the right approach, all things, even philosophy, products of creativity, and our very consciousness, can and will be eventually be *fully* understood with sufficient study and intelligence. I did indeed find myself tackling puzzles that I would have never even attempted in a game made with less craftsmanship and sense of wonder; it’s really neat to see the core interactive game bits so directly play into (what I assume) are the novelistic thematic underpinnings of the whole thing. The game's beauty and amazing capacity to just keep on delivering those wonderful "A-ha!" moments keeps you going and pushing yourself just a little bit more. *Fantastic* game.\n\n…\n\nI totally cheated on the sound puzzles though; I couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket.

Instead, he went in a new direction and his vision is both grander and more humble than anyone could have expected. My only beef with this game is when it gets too much like a video game, and starts throwing timers and clicks-per-minute into the mix.

If so, this game will likely interest you; however, keep in mind, this game will not hold your hand at all. Think of this game as what dark souls is in the hack and slash genre... except replace hack and slash with puzzles. This is an open world puzzle game, probably the only one of its kind. You will get stuck on puzzles in this game, and that's okay. You'll come across puzzles that you have no clue how to solve, at this point, it's time to turn around and explore the world further. Each type of puzzle in this game is like a language. Each area in the game will teach you one of these uninque languange through very easy to solve puzzles... however, quite often you will come across "languages" which you have not learned yet, back away and go to another area.\n\nFrom an outsiders perspective, the base medium of the puzzles is very simple, and would make one wonder why such a beautiful game would be made for such a simple concept. This is indeed one of the most ingenious things about the game. The medium of the puzzles is very simple, just as shooting holes in walls in portal, or swinging swords in dark souls with the press of just one button. The mechanics that are developed on top of this very simple medium is what makes the experience so unique. You will need to use the environment in your surroundings in order to solve these line puzzles, very often the line puzzles are solving by the interaction with the world; I will say no further as I refuse to spoil any of the puzzles.\n\nWith that said, as you are eased into the many languages of puzzles, you will come across very, very tough puzzles. I play many puzzle games, and I would say I am very good at solving puzzles, there were countless times where I was stuck on puzzles that took me in the upwards of 15-20 minutes. Solving these puzzles is just as rewarding as defeating a very challenging boss in the souls series.\n\nOn the graphics side, this game is absolutely beautiful, one of the most artistic games I've ever played, as you explore the many types of land you will come acorss the many languages of puzzles that I mentioned. Solving the puzzles is very rewarding and clearly the main point of the game, however seeing the beautiful world as you explore from one area to another will have you in awe of the scenary and vibrant colours of the world.\n\nThe story of this game is told in a very subtle way, similar to how Braid told its story. To many, this game won't have a story, unless you look for it. The environments tell a tail, as do the few audio diaries that spew quotes of history throughout the world. This game respects the players enough to not shove a story down their throat. There is a story, if you want it, look for it (again, very much like dark souls... or Braid if you prefer).\n\n10/10 would recommend.","February 4","true","26.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There's an island, and that's where the similarities end. That's fine, because if I wanted to play Myst I would play Myst. Unfortunately those reviews set me up with the impression that I would be playing a puzzle-driven narrative -like- Myst; again, it's not.\n\nThe narrative in The Witness is extremely vague, if there even is any. I'm several hours in and I can say with confidence the story isn't why I'm continuing to play. The puzzles are. There are a lot of puzzles; hundreds, maybe thousands? The premise of these puzzles are interactive maze-displays that grow progressively harder as you adventure through a visually compelling island. Sometimes you'll "get" the maze solution in a couple of moments, but more often than not you'll walk around, think, walk around some more, and wonder aloud before you have your "eureka!" moment.\n\nIf you want to spend ~$40 USD on an adventure game then don't buy this. This isn't an adventure game, although I will admit it -might- turn into a more solid adventure after one progresses far enough; however, that point comes well beyond the first few hours. If you want to spend ~$40 USD on a puzzle game then this is going to be worth your money because there's a lot here  - a lot of puzzles. If you buy The Witness I promise you will have myriad hours of puzzles in your future.\n\nClosing thoughts: I wish this game had a soundtrack. I like the clever environmental cues for some puzzle segments. I like the overly-saturated world. I wish the collectable, uh, tape recordings were more common.","January 28","true","9.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I was even more concerned how it was going stack up against the brilliant Braid.\n\nI shouldn't have doubted Mr Blow for a second who has once again proven himself incredibly capable both of creating fiendishly difficult puzzles but also of excellent game design by having really well crafted "tutorial" sections that ease you in with the fundamentals without ever having to outright tell you anything but also by having an open-world approach so that should you find yourself completely stuck you can wander off to another puzzle and try again later. The ways the same basic puzzle has been expanded upon and altered for different sections are so imaginative and really rewarding to crack. Also, the whole thing is absolutely gorgeous and the sound design is also excellent.\n\nYou absolutely need to be prepared to use your brain (and quite possibly a pen and paper to help in some cases) but if you do enjoy a mental challenge then this is an excellent game to pick up.","January 28","true","26.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You just have to know that it is indeed little logic puzzles on screens dotted around an island. If that's what you're expecting, it's wonderful. If you're expecting something else you might be disappointed, but it's very clearly about doing logic puzzles on an island, so I'm not sure why people were expecting something else?\n\nIt's entirely about figuring things out yourself, which isn't to say it's frustrating or obtuse. Only ONE puzzle has annoyed me so far, and I'm 10 hours in. I'll probably solve it later and feel really silly.

It has no story, and it has no puzzles that don't involve drawing a contiguous line from the start to the end of a grid in order to divide the space according to logical rules.  Those puzzles are deliciously challenging, and the lack of distraction from them forces you to start to see everything in lines. This is important as you progress, as you are constantly asked to apply the visual language you have been learning in new ways and in new contexts. In the same way that people used to play Tetris for hours and then dream of pieces falling, spending some time getting familiar with the Island and learning the aesthetics, you will be dreaming in connected lines.\n\nIt's a 9/10 for me.\n\nIf you like puzzling, and you go in expecting a collection of puzzles that fit within a larger context that is also a puzzle, and don't expect a story, you will find one of the best designed and put together challenge to come along in a long time.\n\nThe downsides for me are mostly technical:\n* I have the audio crackling problem, which hurts the already somewhat sparse ambient sound experience\n* There is some z-fighting on some of the grass, flowers etc that detracts from the beautiful island design\n* My method for note taking is to use the steam screenshot feature. While this works OK, an in-game note system would have been really helpful. No, I'm not going to use my phone or write notes in a notebook\n* A few of the puzzles are bad for colorblind or deaf. It doesn't affect me personally, but I think more care should have been done to either mark those puzzles optional or work around people's limitations.","January 28","true","45.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Either you get it and you love it, or you don't and you hate it. The reward for completing a puzzle is almost always access to another puzzle, so, to be perfectly clear, if you tend to get angry at inanimate objects or have a short attention span, or just don't see the appeal of 2d maze puzzles no matter their depth, you should avoid this game.\n\nIf you like puzzles, though, you've come to the right game. Blow & co. are puzzle-making maniacs and have created a game that teaches you how to solve every puzzle on the island with a carefully balanced, well-paced difficulty curve. The game oozes with polish, has a well-put-together world, looks fantastic, feels sublime, and has plenty of depth and gameplay to offer.\n\nThe game has crackling sound in a few places on my machine (earliest in the game in the building with the pots that have Voronoi patterns painted on them.) I didn't feel that it took away from my experience much, but if you have a non-standard sound card you might also have extremely occasional problems with the sound. I have a Xonar DX PCI-E sound card that's never given me trouble with any other game, and it's disappointing that it doesn't work perfectly for this game when the rest of the game is so polished.\n\nAnother disappointment, for me at least, is the game's use of lightmaps. I feel that lightmapped games tend to limit the number of moving parts of the world at the expense of gameplay, whether it's Mass Effect, Remember Me, or The Order: 1886, and I think The Witness could have had some really excellent mechanical puzzles beyond what it has if the lighting were more dynamic. I remember between 2004-2008 or so starting with Doom 3 there was a lot of hubbub about making everything dynamically lit and destructible, and there's a lot of gameplay potential that the developers give up the moment they decide to use lightmaps for a game.\n\nOverall, this is my Game of the Year So Far for 2016, and it was a real pleasure to play it. I hope someone at Thekla, Inc. will see fit to give this game a Linux port at some point. Even though there aren't as many gamers on Linux and OS X as there are on Windows, this seems like the type of game that most Linux users would really enjoy, and that many Windows users would not, as the other Steam reviews clearly show. I look forward to seeing what this studio comes up with next.","January 28","true","25.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It satisfied me in every aspect that it ever could:\n\nThe world is well designed, intreaging and available right from the start. Every moment the explorer in me wanted to wander off and see what´s around the next corner while memorizing every puzzle or location i wanted to come back to.\nSpeaking of puzzles, they are perfect. The start of the game is simple enough to get you used to the simple premise of drawing a line from one point to another. But soon enough, more elements come into play with which you will spend more time thinking than actually drawing.\nWhat really fascinated me was the tutorial/learning curve tho. No element of the puzzles gets explained to you, instead you have to figure out what they do by yourself. Finding a puzzle early on with something you don´t yet understand really pushes you into exploring the world further. You immediatly understand that you aren´t yet able to solve that puzzle and shold move on to find an easier one with the same elements so you could learn about it. That is partially because the game does a really good job of seperating real puzzles from teaching experiences. On the latter, elements will light up red after finishing the puzzle wrong so you can see why it didn´t work, understand the rules of it, and later tackle more difficult puzzles with it, that won´t be so kind and give you any hint on what you did wrong.\nThis simple but brilliant mechanic also shuts off a lot of the world at the start. More difficult areas usually have a little puzzle at the start, that contains at least some of the elements to make sure you understood the basic mechanics before moving into the area.\nThat said, the design of the puzzles like this would already be amazing, but where the game completly blew my mind, was on the clever design of EVERYTHING. Some puzzles can´t be solved without clever thinking, observing the environment and/or thinking outside the box. No puzzle game has ever done it this brilliantly. When a puzzle has no element at all yet requires you to somehow draw the correct line, you really start thinking, and once it clicks, that feeling will keep you going for a long time.\nAt the end i think i should also mention the amount of secrets inside the world. The perfect amount of detail really shows you what hidden objects are supposed to look like. A valuable lesson for other games i think.\n\nIn the end i can only reccomend you to play this game. It easily jumped into the top charts of my most favourite games of all time, which recent games usually struggle to do. I had fun playing it and will probably never forget the amazing experience of a game so well made like thisone...","January 29","true","21.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

And it was great! Pretty much everything I expected.\n\nThe Witness is an enjoyable challenge. People seem to think this game is short. It's not. It's one very simple mechanic used to great effect in a abundence of different ways, and then combined togeather. I'm a programmer, hence I'm very good at logic puzzles (a majority, but not all, the puzzles are logic puzzles), that said is still took me 12 hours to finish (but not complete, which will probably take a few more hours) the game, and I got stuck quite a few times (if you're stuck then explore elsewhere; the game is quite non-linear). I found the mental gymnastics the puzzles force you to do quite enjoyable, while I didn't need it a pen and paper will probably be useful for some people.\n\nThe other great aspect of this game is it's environment. Graphics and sound are excellent, absolutely beautiful. There are also tons of interesting details scattered around. But the environment really shines with how perfectly tied into the puzzles it is: the thematic organization and grouping of environment with puzzles is really amazing. The movement system is good, you won't get stuck in the environment. The great graphics do cause some framerate drops for me here and there, but it usuaully fixes it self after a few seconds (likely due to loading assets from disk when traversing areas).\n\nThere are some downsides. First I didn't comprehend the story (if there is one), if it's there, it's abstract. I enjoy that to an extent (e.g. the Talos Principle) but this moves from abstract to incomprehensible, interesting, but I didn't figure it out (if I was even meant to). Second, some UI issues namely that the capability is there: changing graphics features or checking progress, but the interface is obtuse (text file, look in load game menu, respectively). Niether of these disappointed my expectations from an indie game focusing on gameplay and graphics.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game if you like beautiful puzzle games.","January 27","true","35.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I love that the game doesn't have any tutorials or direction, but is made in a way that you never feel like you're lost.\n\nEven though the game is open world, it's organized much like how Braid was. Each "area" of the world has a puzzle theme that gets more and more complex as you progress through that area. The difference here is you don't really have to do the areas in a specific order.\n\nI hear a lot of people saying there's impossible puzzles, or it's impossibly difficult. I'd say they're probably playing "wrong." If you can't figure something out, don't be afraid to leave the puzzle and come back to it later.\n\nInterestingly, this makes for a great group game I've found. Even though it's technically singleplayer, my friends have had a blast adventuring and working out the puzzles together. It's a lot more fun thinking everything through as a team I'd say!\n\nIf you liked Braid, you'll love this game.

The Witness is easily worth $40, even $60.  People who dismiss this game after just the first 30 minutes are missing out on what I think is one of the best games of all time.  The game is a slow burn.  It will take some time to really fall in love with it.\n\nThe Witness is a game from Mr. Blow, the genius behind Braid.  He spent around 7 years working on this game and it clearly shows.  The game is incredibly polished, with beautiful watercolor graphics and literally no glitches.  The sound design is eerie and very minimalist but contains very immersive sound effects, like water and walking through different terrains.  Overall, it's really, really well made.\n\nThe gameplay consists of solving line puzzles on a grid.  The game starts easy and gets more and more complicated.  The design is absolutely brilliant.  Basically, this game does NOT hold your hand AT ALL.  You are forced to figure everything out on your own.  This makes it very challenging, but also extremely rewarding and satisfying.  I want to again stress that this game does not ever...ever help you or hold your hand.  You must observe and think critically to understand the puzzles.  This is a breath of fresh air in the current gaming market.  To put it bluntly, The Witness respects your intelligence as a gamer, unlike so many games.\n\nThe "story" is not really a story, but rather a reflection of human endeavor.  The puzzles in The Witness are analogous to human progress and discovery.  Humans have come a long way since cave man days.  Slowly, through observation and patience, we came to better understand our environment and eventually understand the physical laws of nature that govern everything around us.  There are many highly interesting scientific/artistic audio logs and even a surprising video I found from James Burke in the game.  Each audiolog, when pieced together, tells a subtle, but brilliant "story."\n\nIn conclusion, I love this game.

I think this is a great puzzle game, maybe one of my favorite. I'm currently ~25 hours into it, and find myself getting sucked into it for hours at a time still, determined to beat it (getting closer!).\n\nI won't lie though, my first impressions of this game were not great. I picked it up mainly because I loved the art style, but went into it unsure of what kind of puzzles would be involved. During the early game, it can be easy to write it off as a great environment, built around 2-D mobile-app type puzzles. However, if you play a bit longer, you start discovering more and more depth to things... Without giving away too much, I think the longer you play, the more this game pays off, and it has kept me wanting to advance to the next group of puzzles each time.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws though. I will say sometimes it seems like the difficulty is all over the place, but I think that is more a product of how different people think different ways. A puzzle that could take me 15 minutes might take someone else 15 seconds, and vice versa. However, there are also some puzzles which I think are just straight up too difficult, and had me end up brute forcing/guessing to get past them. Luckily those seem to at least be few and far between (at least at this point in the game).\n\nOverall I'd say it isn't a game for everyone, especially if you are looking for something to sit down and relax for a couple minutes. It doesn't have the broad appeal something like Portal has, and there is no comedic relief or real storyline. However, if you are looking for a truly tough puzzles game with some amazing scenery, that will have you breaking out the pen and paper, and don't mind getting frustrated now and then, this is for you!","February 14","true","33.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

This is by far one of the best puzzle games I have ever played! The puzzles can be extremely difficult at times with no instructions or guidance which is fantastic and exactly how a puzzle game should be. Not sure how long the games lasts but I can't see myself finishing anytime soon, a lot of puzzles I had to give up on because they were just too hard :P.\n\nThere is little story however there are audio tapes scattered around the island for you to discover but I'm finding it hard to understand their meaning, maybe I'm too dumb or it will piece itself together at the end, I'm yet to find out.\n\nI assume this is a console port since the only graphics options are low, medium, high and vsync which isn't really that bad since the games runs brilliantly, I'm hitting 400+fps on high with a high end rig.\n\nThe sound only works in stereo mode for headsets which is a shame but should hopefully get fixed soon.","January 26","true","17.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

It may not be a game for everyone, as it certainly gets tedious and frustrating on multiple occasions.  When I get stuck, I have the most success when I take a ten minute break and look at the puzzle again with fresh eyes.  This so happened to be the game I've been craving; a game that has tangible solutions that require a variety of thinking strategies to solve.  If you want this difficult yet rewarding experience, DO NOT look at gameplay or spoilers.  Every step gradually prepares you mentally for the next task, and by utilizing previously "viewed" knowledge, you're only cheating yourself.\n\nLikes:\n\nVisual Quality:  Like I said, the game looks amazing.  Saturated colors galore. The power of the colors makes every section of the island feel vastly different, even when they're two steps from each other.  The small trinkets and the "evidence of human activity" scattered around tell small stories themselves.\n\nGameplay:  Traveling is a bit slow, but the island is the right size for your movement speed.  The core of the game, AKA the puzzles, have a good learning curve that steepens in the later portion.  You may get overwhelmed when you first see a puzzle you haven't come across before.  There's no time limit, so do not feel the need to solve everything right away.  I guarantee you will not be successful if that is the mindset you hold.  This is a game where your success depends on your own willpower and thinking strategies.\n\nDislikes:\n\n-Overwhelming color: Certain areas in the game have puzzles specifically using the area's color scheme.  Be weary when playing with screen brightness at maximum, you're eyes are not prepared for that intensity and brightness of color.  It only occurs in two or three areas, but I had to leave after about 30 minutes because I was having trouble seeing the puzzles.\n\n-Not an Adventure Game: I have this under dislike even though I like the concept of the game temendously.  This is more of a warning or FYI.  If you're hoping for a plot and character development and purpose, good luck.  This is a solitary game.  You make discoveries yourself, but it's all for your own pride.\n\n-Replayability:  Unless a patch or something is released for another island or whatnot, I doubt many people will play this twice for pleasure.  I would totally let my friends play this so I can feel superior to them while they struggle, but that's about it.","January 27","true","12.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It feels a lot more like Myst. You are dropped in a world and have to figure out puzzles without any context whatsoever. It makes the puzzles a lot more challenging - but when you  understand how the puzzles work, it is a lot more rewarding.\n\nThe puzzles increase in difficulty - one puzzle is "teaching" you how to solve the next. Getting the right answer to a puzzle isn't the point - it's figuring out how the puzzles "work" so you can apply that to the next one. You aren't going to be able to solve the puzzles by guess-and-check. You will spend time thinking about a puzzle, figuring out how/why the solution is the way it is, and -  once you "get" it - you will blow through a whole series of puzzles at a time (and feel really smart for doing so.)\n\nI haven't gotten to the point of frustration yet - so far I've "got" all of the puzzles that I've come across so far, or realized that they were based on a mechanic that I wasn't "taught" yet.\n\nColorblind players might have issues with this game - some of the puzzles appear to use colors to hint how to solve them.","January 27","true","14.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Each location has different puzzles and different rules for them. You have to pay attention to everything that surrounds you: shadows, lights, reflections etc. EVERYTHING matters in this game.

The whole gameplay is around puzzles, but their differences make the game interesting. I'm sure I will not stop playing it til 100%.

First of all I cheated. Out of the 300 puzzles I cleared to finish this game (out of about 700, I believe) I had to look up solutions for maybe 5-10% of that. Therein lies the shame, and the act of playing into the developer's hand of being an illogical being, driven by comfort rather than intellectual curiosity. Games have long conditioned us to look for help if we are stuck and to fully resort to the helping hand in such a predicament; this instead of our own ability or logic. Realizing this you are swiftly thrown into discomfort, playing The Witness. Because the game has a logic to it, but you can only rely on yourself to figure out the system in play. The mechanics are obscured by non-knowledge, but that's what makes this game so unique, and what constitutes its elegance and beauty as a game.\n\nI can't say that I have played a game that has required as much of me as The Witness. It requires trust and dedication, trusting that the game is working properly, that when you do not know something, that is what the game intends. And the only way a game can pull something like that off is with having absolutely impeccable game-design. There can't be any tricking of the player, in any sense. Blow mentions in an interview that he does not want to trick the player into feeling smart, which he never does with this game, but more so I think it's important to not trick the player into feeling dumb. Once a player start to doubt his or her own ability to solve something due to a lack of information, it's over. But even in this regard I think that The Witness succeeds in making the player feel like the answer of any puzzle lies within the game itself. My problems mainly arose when I knew that I didn't know, because I knew I disregarded certain places of the game where I felt like I couldn't grasp the logical rule-sets, or where I couldn't get over the leaps of logic even after I looked up solutions for certain puzzles. I conceded, there was no real trust in my own ability. That and my impatience lead to a certain mistrust of the game. But with this view back on myself, I see that the problem is not with the game-design, it is with me.\n\nBecause I can't stress this enough, this game is elegant in a way I have never seen before. It is a self-sufficient game. It's cyclical, it is an exercise in the Nietzschean return. Repetition of fleeting activities, grasping at shadows of pleasure, the attempt to make something out of nothing, personal progression, are all parts of this game. Narratively, visually and according to the mechanics we are witnessing the eternal return of our activities as human beings, our purpose as lifeforms. The Witness adumbrates a great deal of humanity, an intimacy that becomes so much closer despite the distance required when viewing ourselves existentially. The Witness is this incredible holistic experience that encapsulates the art of game-design without profusion. It is clinical, precise and executed perfectly, which you will notice with enough trust in the game-design and with enough appreciation for game-creation.\n\nAt the heart of this game – what is really the core of this experience, to me – is what goes on in your head, and what this game requires of you as a person; as a mind among minds, as a human being with intelligence. What I noticed fairly early on was my desperate need to vocalize the principles that each puzzle was run by. I had to vocalize this intuitively logical puzzle, just to wrap my head around what was required. This is not something I've ever really experienced before in games, and I was surprised to see it come out in a medium that is not often lauded for its intellectuality. Because this process of vocalizing or making conscious and intuitive form of intelligence puts it in the view of self-conscious scrutiny. This is a quality that can be very valuable for people in general, and in its own way The Witness has the possibility of teaching it.\n\nWhat I referred to earlier in terms of elegance, was in regards to the game-design, puzzle-design and the comportment of this game. This elegant restraint and non-compromise with the idiocy of the gamer's conditioned need for help, bleeds into its over all presentation. There is almost no music or extravagant sound-design, but runs the gamut of beautifully suiting each situation with an aural atmosphere that never feels empty nor mawkishly musical. It's this portrayal of life as “doing”, as functionality and concreteness. Every sound has its place, it springs out of the movement of the player and has a natural flow to it that in accordance with the visuals manage to structure a believable holistic world. Every facet goes with the theme of an encapsulation of being within something very fleeting, finding familiarity in a world that you're thrown into and out of, at least for the moment being. While this is the attempt, at least seemingly, it is hindered by self-hatred spawned out of inability. That is, however, limited to the dynamics of the individual, to what is deemed subjective.\n\nThe Witness succeeds in creating a stimulating world in all senses of that word, to all senses. In terms of visuals, I struggle to think of a game I think is more beautiful than this. In terms of composition, level design, environment, colors and lighting, it's out of this world, but more worldly than most games. There is this marriage between naturalism and human influence, between nature and machine, between natural colors and vibrant neon, between vocalized LOGIC AND VISUAL CUES.\n\nWhen I get some time I am going to revisit this game with a fresh mind. I am not going to look up solutions and I am going to wholly dedicate myself to this experience. The Witness is incredible, and unless this game spawns a trend of games following in its footsteps, we will most likely not see anything quite like this in a very long time. I'm the type of person to be subjugated under things I consider to be more intelligent than me, and this game falls under that category. That means I am naturally inclined to praise it, solely due to the fact of it being “above me”. I have yet to master this game, even though I have beaten it, I don't feel like I have beaten it, and I that alone makes me impressed. I do not feel finished with the game, I couldn't happily move on from this game. Because I know there is more to it. I know there is more to learn and that curiosity will drive me back to this experience. And I think that is special. Especially special enough to warrant a recommendation.\n\nI believe this is a game where the more time you dedicate to it the better it gets and the more fulfilling it becomes. It simulates and portrays the essence of human – even personal – progression in so many ways and so perfectly, and it has so many moments of beauty and immense respect before the creator. If If I were to inhabit this world as my only existence I'd bow down in eternal love for its creator. I respect this creation and most of all I appreciated the experience. It was okay.\n\n\n\n","January 28","true","39.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacepanda/recommended/210970/","spacepanda","lonelyspacepanda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacepanda/","322 products in account","The Witness is a stunning and stunningly fatiguing puzzle game that captures both the moments of madness and bliss its creator must’ve felt over its seven years of development. And all that madness and bliss? Well, you’ll experience a fair amount too if you play it.\n\nJonathan Blow, creator of The Witness, in an interview with The Guardian, said he wants to make games for people who read Gravity’s Rainbow. Not everyone who games reads books, and I imagine even fewer read Pynchon. Much like The Witness, Blow’s statement is obtuse and vague but still understandable: He wants to make a game that not everyone will understand, enjoy, or fully comprehend the first time through. In this sense, he achieved what he intended: a frustrating, beautiful and alienating puzzle game. In love with this idea, it seems he never stopped to consider how the player on the other end of the experience will feel about it all.\n\nOn a surface level, The Witness resembles the open-world of Myst, puzzle mechanics that gradually build on each other like in Braid (his previous game) and rudimentary grid-based puzzles you’d find in the newspaper. One assumes there must be more to the game than this. In many ways there is, but not always in the ways you want or expect. The ways in which you discover and solve puzzles continues to surprise even after ten hours of play. With over 700 puzzles, it’s entirely possible that Blow is displaying every conceivable puzzle type possible with the rules at play. Discovering and playing with those rules is what makes The Witness so enjoyable and often so painfully tedious.\n\nUnlike Portal and other recent successful puzzle games, The Witness puts a focus on making the player define the rules of the world. Even a tutorial isn’t defined in this game. Instead, you solve a series of simple puzzles, discover nothing changed, and decide “Well, I guess that’s a tutorial!” The Witness is a game about thinking outside the box without ever knowing how big that box might be. Not only is this process deep and ingeniously clever, but it holistically feeds into what the game is trying to convey to the player about life and nature.\n\nIf this is all The Witness contained, it’s be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, discovering the rules of the world is only half the experience. You also have to apply them. A puzzle game is only as good as its rule sets. A good rule set can make a puzzle game endlessly fun; I’ve played Picross for years and will continue to do so. But spending even a couple hours with some of the rule sets in The Witness makes me never want to play the game again.\n\nA good puzzle should be about figuring out what rules are needed and how they are applied, but so much of The Witness’ frustration comes from the game obscuring readability for challenge. Imagine playing Tetris with the screen half-black or Uncharted with the screen spinning. It would be unacceptable. The Witness is so far removed from other games that it can almost get away with these tricks at times but they are still cheap tricks: lazy ways of adding challenge to a puzzle that would be easy to solve otherwise.\n\nAdditionally, half the puzzles are trial-and-error and not in the sense of “Does this rule apply here or that one?” but rather “I know what rules apply, I just don’t know the exact path through so I need to try again and again until I find it.” Where The Witness’ best moments made me feel satisfied by being observant and thoughtful, these puzzles made me feel like my time was wasted. I never felt clever or happy solving them, as they require an amount of brute force and patience that makes for a miserable puzzle-solving experience.\n\nThere are awful things about The Witness. The game becomes so awful at the end that I decided to stop playing it and watch videos of the ending instead. I think Blow is a very intelligent designer but I also think he is a very stubborn one. He insists on making a complicated world that is not meant to be easily understood (or understandable at all, in some aspects); rather than a game world that is designed to accommodate the player. I don’t mean to imply the game needs tutorials or guiding the player -- it’s in these aspects that Blow’s stubbornness pays off -- but the puzzles should have been designed with player experience in mind. If they were tested on players, then Blow must be fully aware that his puzzles force nausea, discomfort, eye strain and just aren’t fun at all at times, especially in the game’s final section.\n\nThe Witness is a puzzle game that tests the player’s resolve more often than their intellect. Even though Dark Souls is one of my favorite games, what The Witness asks of me in terms of visual discomfort, fatigue, and repetition is not worth the experience of playing it all. But it is worth playing. It’s a contradiction I’m aware, but the beauty of The Witness’ world, exploration, and message to the player is inspiring. It’s world is one of the greatest things ever achieved in games and when it’s good, it’s incredible. But more often than not, I found myself bored and tired by many of the game’s poor rule sets and combinations of them.\n\nThere is a madness and obsession that permeates across The Witness. It manifests itself in the unfathomably beautiful and complex visual design and layout of the game. But, unfortunately, it also manifests itself in the puzzles that have a blatant disregard toward player experience. So in love with this vision, it seems Blow never considered how others may view it. The Witness is a game about the joy of discovery and observation, but so often its puzzles go directly against this theme.\n\nThe Witness might aspire to be Gravity’s Rainbow, but it’s not. It can’t be. It’s not a book. It’s a game. And if it were more aware of this aspect, it would be a better one for it.","January 30","true","23.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MOM4Evr/recommended/210970/","MOM4Evr","Daxar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MOM4Evr/","390 products in account","First and foremost: This is a puzzle game.\n\nI don't mean that in the obvious sense. I mean in the sense where it is the closest game possible (besides possibly the brilliant but flawed game "Pandora's Box" made by Microsoft) to a jigsaw puzzle. As such, each fragment of the game you complete - each panel, which you can see in the trailer - is meant to take a small portion of your time to complete, and be challenging in and of itself. If you know the solution, you can solve it within a couple seconds maximum and then immediately start on the next "piece." If you cannot solve it, place it down and pick up another. I see a lot of people complaining about lack of reward for completing each panel; your reward is the information you've gained mentally and your greater grasp as to how the puzzles work. If you do not get a sense of euphoria from understanding puzzles and completing them (or if you are failing to gain understanding of the puzzles as you play), this is not your game to begin with.\n\nThis game also heavily rewards observant people. There is a particular puzzle in the game that I solved within minutes, because I quickly realized more information was needed, and sought out such information, finding it almost instantly. I watched someone else who took hours on the puzzle because they failed to recognize where they were missing information. No puzzle in the game has a solution that is obtuse or arbitrary; all the information you need to solve every puzzle in the game is given to you in creative ways; you just need to recognize it. 98% of the time, it is immediately around you, staring you point-blank in the face.\n\nComparisons are hard to draw. I see plenty of reviewers likening this game to Myst or The Talos Principle. Neither of these are good comparisons at all. Myst had obtuse puzzles that were not explained fully with little depth. In The Witness, each puzzle is obvious and doesn't require vague clues from elsewhere. You are required, however, to fully understand the puzzle itself. Knowing how to solve it is not enough; there are many puzzles within the game with several possible solutions, and you are required to figure out them all. As such, each puzzle has incredible depth and complexity, which cannot be said of adventure games like Myst.\n\nEach puzzle also does more than form a small part of a whole; you are required to understand and learn what works within the puzzles and what doesn't. Once you understand the puzzle itself (which in my case, sometimes required graph paper, Legos, or both), solving it was trivial and took seconds. The same cannot be said of The Talos Principle, where each puzzle had a few variables which, with trial and error, could be used to create a solution, and even with the solution in mind could take several minutes.\n\nThe Witness is not a game for everyone, and both positive and negative reviewers need to understand this (In fact, a negative reviewer explained in such depth what he disliked about the game that I realized this was 100% my kind of game and bought it immediately). If you are a curious player who pays attention to detail in every game you play, and who enjoys brilliantly-crafted mental challenges just for the sake of the challenge, this may well be the puzzle game you've been waiting for. If you suffer from impatience while attempting jigsaw puzzles, or often charge through games without peeking around every nook and cranny first, watch someone else play the first few minutes of The Witness to get a better feel. This may just not be for you.","February 17","true","32.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

That one being, "Is this just a game where you draw lines inside of mazes? Isn't there anything more to it than that? That seems dumb."\n\nThat is exactly what this game will look like if you are just watching Let's Plays. And honestly? The first couple hours of the game will feel a bit like that. But this is mostly just because the mazes are foundational for solving other, more advanced kinds of puzzles, so you need to learn a lot of things about them right away. Also the maze puzzles are extremely easy to see. Just square terminals sticking out of the ground, right out in the open, right? Seems like you'd just walk up to terminals and solve mazes and that's it, right? WRONG. It only looks like that's the only kind of puzzle at first because that kind of puzzle is THE EASIEST TO SEE. So naturally when you (or whatever Let's Player you're watching) first starts out, you'll just run immediately to all the maze terminals you see, because they are right there and you can just check them off, bam bam bam. But unbeknownst to you, you'll be walking right past dozens of more complex puzzles that you just don't know how to see yet. But the maze terminals are important! They teach you foundational knowledge you'll need for more complex and multi-phased puzzles later.\n\nSo after you learn a lot of rules and special techniques for the maze puzzles, you will eventually start to run into situations where it's not good enough to just know how to solve a maze puzzle. You start to realize that there are kinds of "hidden knowledge" that you need to solve particular puzzles, which you have to get from elsewhere. The knowledge is often something external to the puzzle itself. Whereas in most games this would just amount to finding a door combination written on a wall or piece of paper somewhere, in The Witness nothing is that simple. You have to pay VERY CLOSE ATTENTION, because the insight you need to solve the puzzle might be found in something as subtle as the way a tree looks when reflected off the water of a pond that you are looking at from the second floor of a nearby house. (Note: That is not an actual puzzle solution in the game, but it is the exact KIND of solution you can expect.)\n\nThat being said, the grid mazes in The Witness, while highly puzzling, are often not the "actual" puzzle. They are just a logical puzzle interface on which you communicate a lateral thinking type solution. (Yeah, it gets complicated.) The "actual" puzzle is often an insight you have outside of these mazes, and then you use or apply that knowledge in the maze somehow, or else the maze is a sort of gate you pass through on your way to executing the "actual", broader solution.\n\nIt's hard to completely explain without spoiling too much of the fun of discovery, but suffice to say that The Witness is primarily a game about PERSPECTIVE and PERCEPTION. Things may look different depending on the angle and manner of view. A particular object/thing that seems inconsequential may at some point leap out at you as having a meaning that never dawned on you before. A thing that you walked past one hundred times turns out to have an obvious puzzle that you somehow never noticed until the 101st time you walked by. Oh yes. In order to solve the puzzles, you must first be able to PERCEIVE the puzzle, and many puzzles will go quite unperceived by you at first, even though they are right there, staring you in the face. You just weren't looking correctly.\n\nDon't ruin it for yourself by watching Let's Plays. That won't give you an accurate idea of the experience of playing The Witness. Watching a Let's Play of The Witness is like watching someone else view one of those Magic Eye books. It's just not the same thing. You have to do it yourself to really get the idea of how good it feels the moment that shift in your perception occurs and YOU FINALLY SEE IT. You will not get that feeling or experience from watching Let's Plays.\n\nPuzzle difficulty? There is a wide range of difficulty and type. The maze puzzles being the most obvious type. These will challenge your logical thinking. Some of them are simple as putting two and two together, but you will eventually hit one that seems impossible. And I don't just mean it seems hard. I mean you may literally encounter a puzzle that you are 100% convinced is impossible. It makes no sense! It doesn't follow the rules! But don't worry. Go do some other puzzles elsewhere. You'll come back to it later and find that what before seemed illogical now makes total sense.\n\nThen there are the other puzzles, which I will just call the "non-maze" puzzles. These will often challenge your spatial and lateral thinking. Logic will only get you so far in The Witness. You'll also need to read and interpret various kinds of unique "signs" in the environment and sometimes you'll just have to try a crazy idea. An idea that seems so stupid it couldn't possibly be the answer. But it IS the answer.\n\nDon't go into it expecting it to be like Portal or The Talos Principle. There are certain similarities, but The Witness is its very own kind of experience.\n\nFinally let's talk visuals. It's not exactly photorealistc. The game does not strive to have amazingly realistic looking textures, and frankly I think that works in its favor. The island still feels very much like a "real" place, but visually it is like some kind of living watercolor painting or the most vibrant graphic novel. It is a really cool style that manages to feel both real and stylized. And it's not just the graphics/colors/etc that are worth noting. JBlo actually contracted some professional landscapers to help make sure that every inch of the environments on the island looked fantastic. Just the way that everything is spaced and harmonizes with everything else around it is excellent to behold.\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.\n4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.","January 30","true","47.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

However, the fact that you keep doing the same thing over and over again - drawing a line for all puzzles, moving from one panel to the next -  makes the game exhaustingly repetitive and boring. There were a couple of times which seemed nice, where you had to consider your surroundings too, which spiced things up for just a moment, before it would get back to the same old thing again.\nIt's like having hundrends of Sudoku puzzles, with the difference they are not irritating like this is.\n\nIt starts off promising, but,  at some point the game starts feeling more like "work" and the fun is all gone.  It's just not fun anymore.\n\nSome  really  bad puzzles:\n\nTowards the end, there is a row of panels whose grids are not steady and keep moving, with the last one even spinning around really fast. There are also puzzles with flashing lights which are really tiring.  I understand it if people get motion sickness from first person shooters, but tiring the audience like this in a puzzle game is outrageous - it feels like torturing the audience on purpose, rather than challenging their skills.\n\nThe sound puzzles in the forest. You see, the good thing with puzzles is that most people can at least have a go at them. Incorporating puzzles whose solution is solely based on sound, you immediately exclude part of the audience who may have hearing problems of some sort. NOT cool.\n\n\nAbout the story:\n\nWell,  there is absolutely NO story whatsoever. You go through all these puzzles and in the end you have absolutely no idea who the hell you are, why on earth you are on this island, what those statues scattered all over the island are or why you need to keep an eye out to form those strange symbols around the island to fill up those black columns. After all this trouble you went through, there is no reward to satisfy your curiosity, not in the slightest.\n\n\nAbout the end:\n\nYou  enter a sort of glass elevator and, like Willy Wonka, you start to hover over the island for a while as you watch and hear the panels you worked so hard to solve being turned off along with the sound of your heart being torn apart, since you realize that all of your hard work went to waste as you are mockingly sent right back to the beginning, right where you started.\n\n\nI also didn't like the fact that you can solve the puzzles even from miles away, provided you can aim at the panel. I found this very stupid - unless you are inspector Gadget.\n\nThe only thing that is really good about this game is the graphics - and the sound of your footsteps. Really well-made graphics with vibrant, enticing colours. And... that's pretty much it.\n\nIf you really want to play this game, I suggest you get it on sale.","February 15","false","43.2"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","24","46","2","0"

This is simply an exploration puzzle game. There is no adventure to this game. You are literally stranded in an island solving puzzles. But why I like this game, because it is a really good puzzle game.\n\nThis puzzle game requires you to try various puzzles so you can gain knowledge of various mechanics so you can complete other puzzles. There is no levels in this game, you can go anywhere in the island, but some areas have puzzles that you may not know how to complete. The game encourages you to leave that puzzle and try out different puzzles in different areas so you can gain the knowledge and come back to the puzzle you struggle.\n\nSome puzzles in the game requires you to use the environment from the game (lighting, reflection, sound, etc.) which I really like. Some puzzles requires you to think out of the box, or find hints around the map to help solve the puzzle.\n\nThe only thing I did not like from the game is the ending, I did not really understand it, it was just like "that's it." Also, the game does have a backstory about the island, but I did not go much into that.\n\nOverall, if you like puzzle games, I would definitely recommend this game. I thought I would spend only a couple hours playing this game, but ended up playing several hours.

There is no big mystery.  There is no profound revelation.  There are "only" puzzles.  If you expect something more than that, you will probably be disappointed.\n- There are philosophical audio and video clips scattered throughout the game.  A few of the clips hint at a story, but they are just fragments.  There are also cryptic statues scattered around the island that suggest a story.  However, these things, either individually or as a whole, do not form a coherent narrative or thesis.  Their meaning is open to interpretation and speculation.\n- There are three types of puzzles:\n1. self-contained puzzles, which can be solved all on their own once you have figured out the rule\n2. external-based puzzles, which require additional information external to the puzzle itself\n3. monolith puzzles, which are hidden in the environment. They are like the 3D version of those hidden picture search games you might find in children's activity books)\n\nLikes:\n- The fun is in figuring out how the puzzles work -- understanding the rules behind them.\n- Overall, the puzzles are good (some comments raved about how amazing the puzzles are -- they are good, but they are not more extraordinary than puzzles in other good puzzle games).\n- I enjoyed the self-contained puzzles.  A small number of them are very well-designed and creative (e.g., the blue and orange bridges puzzle, the simultaneous solutions puzzles, the puzzle that contains four other puzzles within it).\n- As you learn how the game works, you start to discover more and more puzzles that are hidden in the world (the monolith puzzles).  At first, it is fun and satisfying to discover these, but see also the related Dislike below.\n\nDislikes:\n- Often, the interesting part is figuring out how a puzzle works, but the physical act of actually solving the puzzle is tedious because of the mechanics involved. For example, some puzzles require you to wait for something to move slooowly.  As another example, the desert ruins puzzles require you to fiddle with motors and lights and water levels.  See also the comments about monolith puzzles below.\n- The monolith puzzles become tedious after the novelty wears off.  Also, they often feel arbitrary. First, they can be anywhere, so you have to search everywhere for them.  Second, they can be easy to miss if you don't look at them from the right perspective (e.g., the ones in the Tropical Forest).  Third, they often require a trial-and-error approach, which does not feel puzzle-y (e.g., the one in the cloud).  A lot of the time, you are just wandering around the island looking at everything.  It is tiresome to keep searching the same areas for puzzles that you missed just because you were not standing in the right place looking in the right direction.\n- A few of the puzzles are just obnoxious (e.g., the puzzles with the color changing background, the hour-long video puzzle)\n- Timed puzzles are the worst.  Fortunately there are only a few.\n- There are no resolution settings.  There are no volume settings!","February 3","true","36.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Devilnumber2/recommended/210970/","Devilnumber2","Devil#2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Devilnumber2/","669 products in account","This game requires a bit of compartmentalization. As a TL;DR for anyone reading, if you're into the kind of challenging logic puzzles the game offers, this game is well worth the money. But that's really the only reason to buy it.\n\nGameplayLet's start with the good. The puzzles in this game are all based on an extremely simple idea: get a line from point A to point B. However, the game sprinkles in so many different rules and requirements the player has to meet along the way that some of the puzzles can be extremely difficult. It starts with simple maze puzzles, but expands with icons that reflect shapes that need to fit into sections the player makes, to color-coded icons that need to be grouped or divided in various ways, all the way to affecting the color of the icons using glass partitions and colored lighting. The number of iterations on the same concept is actually very impressive. I particularly like the puzzles that require the player to physically position themselves to gain the proper perspective on the board to see the solution.\n\nThe open-world nature of the island can lead to some frustration, though. The player can come across puzzles that require some fore-knowledge that they haven't gained yet. My advice to anyone looking to pick this up is to never be afraid of walking away from a puzzle you don't understand. Go exploring, and you'll eventually come across the tutorial panels for the information you're missing.\n\nThe puzzle portion of the game is the reason you should buy this game. Check out some youtube videos that show what the puzzles are, and if they interest you, the game is worth buying. If there's any problem with them, it's that there is an overwhelming number of them.\n\nGraphics/AestheticsThis game is gorgeous. There are likely some that aren't into the aesthetic of the game and want photorealistic graphics, but this game doesn't have that. If you're not that type of person, the extraordinarily colorful and varied landscape is actually very refreshing. I didn't run into any situations where the game ran slowly for me, but that no doubt depends on the machine you're on. Some of the environments also play into the puzzles, as mentioned above, and that's really the most creative part about the game. Going around exploring the island and discovering all that's hidden away is a nice way to give the player a chance to breathe in between puzzles.\n\nIf there's one complaint, it's that the environment suggests a bigger story with the island. The game has a Myst vibe to it that makes you feel like you're seeing a lot of real history and that people have been there before, but the game never really delivers on that. This actually makes the whole island feel much more artificial.\n\nArt/Message/Story (Spoilers) The Witness is pretentious. There's really no way to justify the "artistic" element in the game. On this strange island that has so much detail in it, the player starts to think there might be a greater message, a bigger story that happened in the past, and they're doing all the puzzles to figure that out. There seem to be experiments, archaeological digs, and statues of people that...might have been alive at some point? It seems like such a mystery, and it's fun to explore the environment and wonder what the answer could be.\n\nInstead what the developers decided to do was record people reading famous quotes by famous people and scatter them as collectibles throughout the island. Yeah, the first one you find is kind of interesting, but after a couple more, you realize what the "artistic" message is supposed to be and that the developer couldn't convey that message themselves. They had to cobble together a selection of supposedly profound sayings from other people and create this Frankenstein's monster and call it "art". It doesn't take many of these tape recorders for the player to say, "Yes, science is the only true religion, I get it. Couldn't you have come up with an actually creative way of conveying this sentiment via gameplay or visual story telling?"\n\nAnd around that time you'll likely find the theater room. This is a small area off the beaten path that includes a projector tied into a puzzle panel. The player can find secret codes behind locked doors to enter into this machine for secret surprises. These turn out to be complete videos of some of the people the tape recorders have been quoting saying more of the same stuff you've probably been listening to this entire game, along with some cinematic clips that seem profound. Look, that guy is carrying that candle, and it's all one continuous take, how artistic!\n\nAnd this is a major problem with the game. I find it less enjoyable to solve difficult problems to unlock new areas if all I'm going to get is more puzzles and preachy quotes the developers substitute for artistic merit. I like the puzzles and the visuals, but this grates on my nerves.\n\nAnd worse still, there is one thing that the game does that I would have loved to see developed more. While playing the game, you'll eventually see a puzzle in the environment. I first saw it as a reflection on the water, the distict circle with the line that has a beveled end. I thought it was weird, and was amazed when I found I could actually trace a line down it just like all the puzzles I'd been doing up to that point. I was even rewarded with a big booming noise when I completed it. Suddenly, I began to see those puzzles scattered all throughout the island, usually requiring I find the right perspective. Walking into a forest, I saw another puzzle start to form in the tree's canopy. I could even find some in the clouds when I was standing on the right hill-top.\n\nThis element of the game was facinating and clever, and I find this to be where the greatest potential for artistic merit in the game lies. The player spends so much time solving these puzzles that they start to see the patterns in the world at large. First on a building, then in the trees and the water and the sky. Isn't this a good way to make an artistic message about recognizing the same patterns from the smallest elements in reality to the great expanses of the universe and finding some form of spirituality in the surprising order of chaos? This isn't a new idea, but the way the game never forces you to spot these large environmental puzzles, yet almost guarantees the player finds at least one could have been such an interesting way to convey that message.\n\nBut these puzzles don't really do anything. To my knowledge, finding the dozens of them that exist maybe gives you an achievement. Unfortunately there are so many of them that hunting them all down is way more than I'm willing to do. Such a waste of a good idea.\n\nSummarySo the game is fatally flawed, but if you approach it with the right expectations, you can still have a lot of fun with it. The puzzles are good and challenging, and the game does a decent job of giving you the tools you need to solve them, albeit in a way that sometimes requires you to walk away from puzzles until you get the information you need. This aspect of the game is the only reason to buy it, however. The game really wants to be artistic, but it's terribly misguided in its execution. Do not buy this game for a story, as you won't get any here.","February 12","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Overall, I'd say if you like puzzle games you'll probably really like this. If you don't like puzzle games, avoid.\n\nPros:\n+Pretty. Visually interesting without being distracting. One of the few games I found myself actually just walking around looking at the sights. There's something really nice about the low-poly models, saturated, colorful textures, and ambient sounds.\n+Puzzle games that kind of put you in the position of a scientist and rewards skill at figuring out how things work (as well as actually solving the puzzles themselves). It's a sense of discovery and experimentation and accomplishment you don't find in lots of other games. Most puzzle games explain their mechanics up front and the core gameplay involves working with those mechanics, but this game makes figuring out the mechanics part of the experience. It reminds me of the enjoyment I derive from trying to solve mystery novels while reading them.\n+Plenty long enough. Even after you get an ending there's still more you can do.\n+There's more to it than just solving line puzzles by themselves in isolation. Many of the puzzles heavily involve interactions with their surrounding environment. There's also stuff to do that doesn't involve line puzzle boards at all.\n+All sorts of stuff to discover (in addition to just figuring out the puzzle mechanics).\n+They preserve the mood throughout the game, all the way to the end. Some games with a peaceful mood suddenly end with a credit scroll accompanied by obnoxious and over-energetic or overwrought "deep" music. This game doesn't have any music at all. I didn't find anything that really "took me out of the experience" through the course of the game.\n+It's first person but didn't cause motion sickness (at least for me). Some puzzle games that have a lot of turning and wandering around can make me feel really nauseous. I feel like certain design decisions in this game contribute to lowering the chance of getting motion sickness (like turn rate and FOV).\n\nCons:\n-Some tediuous and annoying puzzles whose main challenge is obstructing your ability to get a sense of their state (by being distorted and skewed or far away or other annoying gimmicks) or who force you to re-do earlier puzzles or walk back and forth a bunch. Some of them even made me feel a little nauseous. There aren't many of these - I get the sense they just wanted to play around with the existing puzzle mechanics in certain ways to change things up, but I kinda just wished they wouldn't or that they would just do away with those puzzles entirely. I usually get really frustrated and end up quitting games when stuff like this happens, but for some reason I found it pretty tolerable in this game.\n-The final section drags on a bit too long for my tastes.\n-A few puzzles will be impossible if you have colorblindness, but they are optional.\n-Not a whole lot of story to figure out. Coming into this, I thought it was going to eventually answer all sorts of questions I had about the island and that that was kind of the point of continuing to play. It really isn't. In retrospect, I think this doesn't really hurt my enjoyment of the game much. And you actually can figure out the story, it's just not going to be something as elaborate as games like Myst or Riven. Despite the ending not being a big reveal or tell all, I actually really liked it (it's quite understated and not flashy, which would've killed the mood had it been).\n\n","February 29","true","19.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For me, it's better than Portal was.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything about the Witness, because the true enjoyment comes from discovering the essence of the game as you go.  So I'll speak in terms of Portal.  This game is tremendously longer (it took me ~40 hours to complete both achievements), and in my opinion is incredibly harder.  There are some puzzles I spent way too long on, and others where I literally laughed with excitement when I finally figured them out.  Whereas Portal had fantastic narration and at least some story-centricity, the Witness relies on mystery, discovery, and exploration to capture players.  The Witness is non-linear and each player's experience and discovery of the game is assuredly different.  I was able to solve enough puzzles to complete both achievements without any external assistance, although I know there are more facets of the game I haven't fully explored yet or just can't figure out.  This game does a good job with that adventure game trope: you discover interesting features in the world, which very likely have some function, but you just don't know how to interact with them yet.  I have a piece of paper here on my desk with reminders of such mysteries, as well as a bunch of puzzles I drew out to help me solve them.\n\nWorth knowing, I fit squarely into this game's target demographic.  It will likely appeal to players who are stubborn, inquisitive, and have taken at least one philosophy class in their life.  I refuse to look up any how-to guides or walkthroughs for games, knowing that the enjoyment comes from frustration followed by the joy of discovery.\n\nOne critique of the game is that the puzzles themselves can be a bit repetitive.  By that I mean, they overall follow the exact same format the entire game, although with myriad variations on that core theme.  I do believe this was a conscious design choice for the sake of unity, however, I posit that the game would not have suffered, and perhaps would have felt more constantly fresh, if there were other types of puzzles.\n\nBraid was great, Portal was amazing, and this game is a step yet above.","February 26","true","41.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Witness is just that: one big ah-ha moment. If something doesn't click for you and/or you get frustrated easily, The Witness may not be for you.\n\nFor me, The Witness never went beyond your typical "difficult". It started easy, got harder, and challenged me to think outside of the box, but I never had to stop. I never really left an area stumped to return to it later. The ah-ha moment typically came between 10-15 minutes each time I was stuck. This created a VERY positive feedback loop for me as a player.\n\nBut anyway, here are some recommendations if you want to give The Witness a chance:\n\n1) Play with a friend. I played with a fellow developer. Perhaps the fact that we are game designers helped, but if one of us got lost, the other person usually caught the solution right away. It was very seldom that we were both confused.\n\n2) Accept that not every area is required in order to complete the game. I have a very busy schedule and have yet to 100% the game. Only seven of eleven main areas are required (any seven) to view the game's ending. Many have complained that Blow did not work to accommodate the visually or hearing impaired. Puzzles like this are NOT required and he claims to have even worked hard to try to include a puzzle that was only accessible to the color-blind (sadly it didn't make the cut due to the large gamma differences across displays).\n\n3) Sleep on it. The ah-ha moment is what you're after. The puzzles are almost never any more difficult than the previous puzzles (to an extent). A fresh mind and a change of perspective can help.\n\n4) If all else fails, take it to paper. A lot of friends made paper models to work out some of the more difficult puzzles. I believe that my friend and I only had a sheet or two of paper notes, but I am assuming that we weren't the norm.\n\nAside from all of that, the game is beautifully designed. Many, many memorable moments and puzzles. Great visual and audio design for a game that can seem so constrained by the overall plot/setting. A remarkable experience, in my opinion.\n\nMy first Steam review and my first 10/10 in quite some time.","February 23","true","18.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The solutions aren't arbitrary or ambiguous like the puzzles in Myst or Riven, and the rules are introduced gradually and organically as you explore the island. The difficulty scales satisfyingly, and I found them challenging but enjoyable throughout. If you enjoy sudoku or crosswords, you'll probably like the puzzles in this game.\n\nThe 'story' however... well, it's basically not worth a damn. It's literary nonsense that pursues pointless ambiguity, sacrificing meaning on the altar of 'complexity for it's own sake'. Good stories are ambiguous because they address complex issues, not the other way around. This story doesn't adress much of anything - even if you drill down far enough to grasp what's really going on, with the second ending and hidden audiologs. There's just nothing of weight to it, and it's wrapped up in so many layers of secrecy that even if you do manage to wade through the pseudo-intellectual ♥♥♥♥♥♥y, the dissapointment at the end is doubly disgusting.\n\nBlow's made a wonderful game here.\n\nIt's too bad he can't tell a story worth a damn.\n\nI'd give this game an 8/10, just for the graphics and exploration and puzzles.

It is not very challenging but can have its moments where we will both look at a puzzle and wonder about it for a while. Then the stroke of genius happens and we solve it.\n\nWe thought that we were nearing the "end game" but seem to be no where close to it now that we have found rooms and hallways lined with more puzzles that seem to have no point but might. We have used online guides for a few (less than 10) hints on solving puzzles but mostly for where things are located to learn about HOW to solve the puzzle series.\n\nOverall, the game is gorgeous. The graphics, while not intense or crazy, just look natural and comfortable. The colors are vibrant. The audio is also very well done. If you walk around or out of a room that has sound in it, the sound changes and keeps with the walking out of the room.\n\nNow I will recommend this game to just about anyone, but would still limit that same recommendation. If you don't enjoy solving puzzles, some simple and some not so simple; then look to another puzzle game. We have done so many puzzles in this game, that we thought we are almost done, but we aren't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/z7xfla/recommended/210970/","z7xfla","z7xfla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/z7xfla/","191 products in account","The Witness is a very immersive game that would best be described as a puzzle adventure.  In this game, you're walking around exploring a colorful island while solving lots of puzzles.  The basic premise of these puzzles is to draw a line from one end of a maze to the other, and there are usually many paths to take in these mazes.  However, as you progress through the game, you'll discover more and more rules that you'll need to understand in order to help you figure out the correct path to take when solving these puzzles.  Sometimes these "rules" come in the form of clues in the surrounding environment that you need to pick up on, or they could come in the form of certain symbols displayed on the mazes themselves.  Throughout the game, you'll often come across mazes with symbols on them that you don't recognize.  You know how games like Metroid and The Legend of Zelda have power-ups that help you reach certain areas that you couldn't before?  In The Witness, you have no actual inventory, but your knowledge of how to solve puzzles with a certain type of symbol on them fills the same role as these power-ups.  Even though you may not know what to do with one of these symbols at a point in the game, there will undoubtedly be an area somewhere else on the island that will teach you how to solve puzzles with that type of symbol.  With your newfound knowledge, you will then be able to solve more puzzles and access more areas on the island.\n\nOne of the most impressive things about the game is how it manages to present all of this without any textual or auditory explanations.  This only makes it all the more immersive; you are left to your own devices to figure everything out for yourself through trial and error.  This system works perfectly, and it's nowhere near as tedious as it sounds because the areas that are meant to teach you how to solve certain puzzles start with the simplest versions of those puzzles and gradually become more complex, helping you grasp the intended concept.  I found the learning curve in this game to be perfect; many of the puzzles were challenging and had me thinking hard, but I would always figure it out eventually, and I would feel a great sense of accomplishment upon doing so.  No puzzle ever had me thinking so hard that I would become frustrated and quit.  Even though there are many different sections around the island, you don't need to finish all of them to complete the main game - though it's very much encouraged that you do finish every section, for reasons I probably shouldn't spoil.\n\nAlso, if you ever grow tired of solving the puzzles, the island is breathtakingly goregous and it can often be entertaining just to wander around and explore.  The game's various environments are full of color, and although the graphics may at times seem rather polygonal and forced into certain shapes, I guarantee you that this is for a reason.  You may figure this reason out early on in the game, or it may take you a while, but regardless I probably shouldn't give it away.  While searching around the island, you might also stumble across miniscule audio players from which you'll hear philosophical quotes.  At first, these quotes seem like they have nothing to do with the game, but upon careful interpretation you'll find they're at least vaguely related to the puzzles you're solving, which adds all the more to the game's creative value.\n\nI hear a lot of people have been pirating this game, most likely because it's something unique and they don't know what to expect from it.  While I'm normally not one to complain about piracy, I believe The Witness is truly a masterpiece of a game, so if you want to see more games like this, then please - throw down some cash and support the developer.  They deserve it.","February 12","true","26.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Then Blow made a game ABOUT discoveries, and again, through the gameplay.\n\nIf you consider Talos puzzles as "room" where you move lasers, block distrubtions, rewind time and Portal as Puzzles where you change speed, jump or teleport to go to places.\nAnd if you consider The Witness puzzles as "lines" you can draw.\n\nThe diversity of puzzles in this game is so much more !\n\nI guess that because the presentation of this puzzle is simpler people think the game is simpler, yet it's the opposite. The simplicity of the interface allowed the creators far more room to explore.\n\nAgain, it's by playing the game (and not watching it on Twitch) more than some tutorials and reaching puzzles you don't understand (in a world you don't understand) in 2 hours (due to Valve refunds) that you can see this.\nThe creators didn't knew Twitch and Valve refunds would exist when they made the game and it might be one of the first game that is affected by those.","January 29","true","86.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've never seen a game more completely built around the experience of puzzle solving than this. And I do mean the whole experience: learning the rules, the sudden flashes of understanding, the satisfaction of solving a difficult problem and, eventually, the way the puzzles begin to rewire your brain.\n\nThe Witness marks the first time I have experienced full-blown Tetris syndrome since...well...Tetris. Even when I wasn't playing the game, I'd start to see grids and lines all over in the world around me, and my brain would constantly be imagining and solving puzzles in the background. This one time (and I absolutely swear this is true) the solution to a particular puzzle I was stuck on came to me in a dream. It was such a strange but amazing feeling. I thought that sort of thing only happened in movies, but The Witness made it happen.\n\nIt's really unfortunate that the game is so strongly centered around letting the player figure things out for themselves, which means that even the slightest details about the way puzzles work and the way the puzzles interact with the environment (and they do interact with the environment quite a lot. This game isn't just logic puzzles with a nice backdrop) can ruin the experience for someone. So buying into The Witness takes a bit of a leap of faith, since it really is better the less you know about it. I made the leap and couldn't be happier. So I strongly recommend that if you have even a passing interest in puzzles, that you make the leap as well.","March 1","true","29.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Thank god somebody else out there has realized a Sega-blue sky makes gamers of a certain age happy and I have a negative gut reaction to "brown games" (Yes, I  Bloodbourne I mean you - I don't care how many awards you've won).\n\nSo into the game.\nWhat I was expecting, I'd come in with no thoughts this was a story driven adventure - not what I expected, wanted or got (if you did, move on - might I suggest Life is Strange).\nI love the puzzle panels. No "Oh, the monkey can be a wrench" - you solve the game with the panels... no, that's not true, you solve the game in a myriad of ways, but always punch the answer into the panels.\n\nIntro is pretty easy as the (t)ropes are explained to you, you're trapped in an enclosed space and clearly need to get out of it. You do easily and pick up some "rules" as you do so.\nOnce you've escaped the start-area, you can follow the path or wander off-piste, and be rewarded with another perspective around the start area and pick up your first tape. Bravo. Somebody anticipated my completionist urges.\n\nGo back to the path and you're lead to a nice easy zone to solve.\nGo onto the next one, and get stumped and stomp off to bed in the wee-hours in an "it's impossible to solve, I hate it" huff.\nLoad it up the next morning, instantly see where you went wrong, happily romp through the next bit.\nOn your way, spot some stuff you can't solve. Doesn't block you, but get pissy that you can't complete *everything* before moving on. FFS?!?!\nQuit with some stuff unsolved, move on, learn new stuff, realize you can solve old stuff and run back and release endorphines.\n\nThis is the point I realized the game was great.\nPreviously my mind-set was do level one (all of it), then level 2 (all of it) etc - this game more than any I've ever played forces you to give up and move on (and then go back when you realize how to solve something you'd given up on).\nOther free-world games might give you an unbeatable boss, until you've unlocked a BFG weapon. The Witness, doesn't have weapons, it has rules. You learn, you understand, you can go back and defeat the previously unasailable.\nMoreover you never feel 'stuck'. Or rather you initially do, until you learn just to go off and do something else (there's always a something else) - and you'll accidentally learn something.\n\nIt's not perfect though. A few hours in, I thought this might be the best game ever, and then I got to "The Swamp"\nAll of the praise above was predecated on "Not knowing the rules", then passively learning them, and then having the scales lifted from your eyes. Maybe you then solve the first puzzle easily and have a few more of increasing difficulty, you can scratch your head over for 10 minutes or so, but felt fun.\nThe swamp just has a ♥♥♥♥-load of puzzles where you know exactly what you need to do, but just have to slog through them. Literally. They're in a row of puzzles. You solve them, and then walk around a corner and there's another row of them. No new concepts. No fun. Just more of the same f'in puzzles.\nI resorted to a walkthrough at this point - and that killed a bit of my love.\n\nNot wanting to end on a negative, I love the strange incidental stuff (very Braid-like). That strangely shaped crack in the wall, that if I line it up with the random pattern outside, seems to form an image. That massive statue way over there, thar if I stand just here and juxtapose with this thing in my line of sight, seems to form a tableau giving a very different meaning.\nYou end up with the impression that the seemingly zonal-world, has actually been hyper-designed and there's potentially ideas to unlock all over the place, that you're continually going to discover or (mainly) miss. Wander, explore, absorb.\n\nStill - no idea wtf is up with the swamp.\nAfer playing continuously for the first few days, killed my fun dead.\nIntention is to clear it using youtube, pretend it never existed, hope to god that was a one-off, or I will cry.","February 1","true","11.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Some of us like to learn to understand and solve cleverly designed environments.  When this occurs in a gorgeous landscape, all the better.  Once I squeeze every drop of mystery out of this game, it will be a sad day. There probably won't be a sufficient remedy for the gaping void that will then plague me... at least not for another 7 years or so.  Till then, I will continue taking my fill of accomplishment on a daily basis, no matter what everyone with under 10 hrs logged are saying.\n\nNext, in my opinion, the developer should be evaluated based solely on his/her creation.  We should discontinue whinning when our threads make the "dumb internet comments." Jon set out to create the game of his dreams, not to babysit the internet. Does he sometimes come off as... what's the word everyone's throwing around... "pretentious"? Yes, but probably mostly to people that don't understand what that word actually means. Everything Blow has claimed about the game has come true for me, and more. In any case, our discussion of a game developer shouldn't stray too far from the games they develop.\n\nFinally, take these reviews with a grain of salt. Understanding the game for yourself is the only way to measure its true value to you. Personally, it has already far surpassed the $40 mark, and am fairly confident I am nowhere near proficiency. Combine that with the fact that Jon blew through $6 Million and 7 years of his life, and our complaints about an "overpriced indie title" start to seem less rational.\n\nNow, descend upon me, trolls.\n\n","February 1","true","48.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Nothing seems to be cheap or unfair, it is all based on your intellect. I have finished the game in around 20 hours, and there is still a lot I feel I need to do. There are lingering mysteries that I need to find, but I will give my review of just the parts I have played.\n\nI did my best to go into this game completely blind, and I did a pretty good job of avoiding any sort of spoilers/ solutions. As I said earlier, this game is very challenging, so it may be tempting to look up solutions, but I would encourage you not to, as the struggle of completing a very challenging puzzle along with the feeling of completing it is priceless. In my playthrough, very few of the puzzles seemed "unfair", or seemed like something I couldn't complete. They are challenging, but not impossible.\n\nThe atmosphere of this game is incredible, everything very carefully crafted, and lots of secrets to be found, even in the enviroment itself! The graphics are very beautiful, and all around the presentation is great.\n\nOne thing though, this game is very mentally exhausting. It gave me a few big headaches, and I had to take a break.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes any sort of puzzle game. Although 40$ is a high pricetag, it is worth every penny. It may seem like a very simple game where you just run around solving snake puzzles, but these puzzles are more a translation of your enviroment than anything like sodoku or kenken.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/210970/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","For more than seven years already, I've ranked Jonathan Blow's Braid not just as one of the best puzzle games ever, but as one of the best games in general. The way Braid used gameplay itself as a storytelling method has only been approached in some rare other games such as Brothers: The Tale of Two Sons, but never rivalled. And don't even get me started on the secrets.\n\nNaturally, I've been honkerin' for The Witness since it was announced, hoping that the end result would be worth the long, long wait. And, after having done pretty much everything there is in The Witness, I can conclude that for the most part the hopes were not unfounded.\n\nThe thing that will undoubtedly disappoint some people is the almost total lack of a story, or the wish that the game is building up towards some kind of a Shyamalan-flavored mind-blowing twist at the end. That isn't the case here. Blow seems like a bit of perfectionist and a man who's not afraid to express his worldview through his games, and I see it only as a positive that he didn't set out to do another Braid, but a whole new experience instead.\n\nThe Witness is all about discovery, and lots of puzzles. In the most reductionist manner the game could be described as just drawing lines from point A to B. And to be honest, that is what all the puzzles in the game are. However, during my playthrough I grew into considering this simple gesture as a metaphor for pretty much everything in the end. There is a strange power and meaning in this simple form; The beginnings you choose, the paths you travel and the endings you reach.\n\nThere are layers in The Witness that are nothing short of revelatory. There are puzzles inside puzzles; Secrets piled on other secrets, some of which I'm convinced have yet to be even found. The vibrantly colorful island you explore is a masterclass of environment design: Absolutely everything has been meticulously crafted down to the smallest detail, with not a single twig in the wrong place.\n\nIt's easy to get philosophical while playing, since the environment is sprinkled with media snippets of several famous thinkers. Not all of these might be for everyone's liking and the game can easily seem overtly preachy if you disagree with some of the thoughts, but they managed to get at least me to ponder not just the puzzles. Even though I didn't enjoy everything (teachings about nonduality were a bit tough to swallow), I can appreciate Blow's courage to put his very personal stamp on the game.\n\nI must still mention the gameplay design, which is another aspect of The Witness that totally shines. The way the game teaches you about its rules feels so natural. You're always learning new things, doing new things, and eventually extrapolating on your existing knowledge to reach complex discoveries. Yet, looking back, the path you took to get there seems as simple and clear as a line from A to B.\n\nIn my mind, The Witness cements Jonathan Blow as one of the great video game designers of our time. I'd probably go as far as placing the game in the Top Ten puzzle games ever, along with Tetris, Picross, Lemmings 2, World of Goo and others. It's not a game for everyone. Some might find it excessively sterile and dull. But if you like puzzles, The Witness is not to be missed.","February 11","true","48.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Essentially a metroidvania where your knowledge (or lack-of) is the tool holding you back.

I've just finished the main game and look forward to 100%'ing it.\n\nI've been constantly exclaiming out loud "how the hell did he [Jonathan Blow] come up with this?" The puzzle design blows me away: the interaction of the puzzle pieces with other pieces, the interaction with the environment, the sheer depth and variety built on top of the same simple concept... and just the way you progress in learning the rules of the panels. You are forced to question everything you see in order to understand how to move forward. Quite a few times I was stuck for a while before taking a step back and asking myself "what is the nature of the puzzle, how has it been progressing thus far, and what can I see around me?" A breakthrough would then come.\n\nPlaying The Witness is incredibly fun and satisfying: I have a notepad full of sketches and tetris pieces, and even with the main game completed there are a huge amount of puzzles left to discover and solve.\n\nYes, it can be challenging, and some people will give up in frustration.

That's all it is, in fact. It is those moments of clarity and accomplishment and excitement, over and over and over again.\n\nI won't be explicit, but this bliss of discovery and understanding is absolutely not limited to the puzzle panels themselves. That is what makes The Witness so beautifully compelling. The game is so much more than the sum of its parts. It's endlessly surprising.\n\nThe Witness presents a universe and trusts you to understand it. It offers all the tools you need to test your hypotheses and never changes the rules on you. And once your theories are proven true, it breaks down the walls you never realized were surrounding you and trusts you to understand this new, larger universe, use what you learned to find where the walls are, and break them down yourself.\n\nThe Witness trusts you and you have to trust it back. If you get stuck or frustrated or feel like something is impossible, you need to be able to step back and trust that the game is being fair to you. Because it is. The new understanding you seek is around you on the island, and the game simply trusts you to seek it out. It's never arrogant, malicious, or esoteric in its design.\n\nAgain, The Witness is so much more than what it looks like. It isn't just puzzle panel after puzzle panel. But if you don't enjoy the puzzles, you will never enjoy The Witness.\n\nIf you enjoy learning for learning's sake, if you see being proven wrong as an opportunity, if you love searching, discovering, and understanding, then The Witness is for you.","February 6","true","34.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The game doesn't make you sit through endless, tedious tutorials. It throws you straight in at the deep end, lets you work things out for yourself. It's one of the hardest I've played, but it's far from impossible.\nAesthetically and atmospherically the game is beautiful, as well as eerie and dark at times. As a result, exploring the open world map is part of the fun. Being stuck in one area is more an opportunity to venture elsewhere than a roadblock.\nSecrets. Braid had 8 hidden stars, The Witness has far more secret areas and easter eggs you can feast on, giving it huge replay value. The hours of gaming you will get from this game are worth the price.\nLots of variety. I was worried the maze mechanic would be boring and that the game would just be 600 top-down hedge mazes, but that's not the case at all.Bad: Of the 400 or so puzzles I've beaten so far, I'd say one or two had solutions that I'd deem unfair or inscrutable. Sometimes luck plays a part in solving them. But that's not a particularly damning figure considering you don't need to solve everything to reach the end of the game.\nNo real discernable story, both endings are a tad anticlimactic. That being said, there's so much to discover, and I don't know what happens when you finally solve every single puzzle, or if anyone's even done it yet.\nThe backlash against this game on Steam, Youtube etc from the vocal minority has been considerable and I'm not sure why. If you avoid walkthroughs and spoilers you've got yourself a gripping and ingeniously desgined game that will have you hooked for hours. 8.5/10","February 1","true","47.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

That's all it is, in fact. It is those moments of clarity and accomplishment and excitement, over and over and over again.\n\nI won't be explicit, but this bliss of discovery and understanding is absolutely not limited to the puzzle panels themselves. That is what makes The Witness so beautifully compelling. The game is so much more than the sum of its parts. It's endlessly surprising.\n\nThe Witness presents a universe and trusts you to understand it. It offers all the tools you need to test your hypotheses and never changes the rules on you. And once your theories are proven true, it breaks down the walls you never realized were surrounding you and trusts you to understand this new, larger universe, use what you learned to find where the walls are, and break them down yourself.\n\nThe Witness trusts you and you have to trust it back. If you get stuck or frustrated or feel like something is impossible, you need to be able to step back and trust that the game is being fair to you. Because it is. The new understanding you seek is around you on the island, and the game simply trusts you to seek it out. It's never arrogant, malicious, or esoteric in its design.\n\nAgain, The Witness is so much more than what it looks like. It isn't just puzzle panel after puzzle panel. But if you don't enjoy the puzzles, you will never enjoy The Witness.\n\nIf you enjoy learning for learning's sake, if you see being proven wrong as an opportunity, if you love searching, discovering, and understanding, then The Witness is for you.","February 6","true","34.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Even 400+ puzzles in the game is still challenging me with new ideas. This isn't a game that just repeats three mechanics and scales to become more complex. It's a game that continuously throws new mechanics in the mix. It's half solving puzzles and half understanding them.\n\nIf you enjoyed the myst franchise or the talos principle give this game a shot. There's more than enough content to justify the $40 price tag and I think it's already a strong GotY 2016 candidate.\n\nThe only things I'd caution:\n- While the witness brings a bounty of fresh ideas and new focus to the puzzle game genre... It is still a puzzle game. If you hate puzzle games you likely won't enjoy this.\n- There isn't much of a direct story to be found here. There are audio logs to be found with philosophical quotes that tie in deeply with the theme of the puzzles and gameplay but don't expect a full on adventure title.

I've only put in a few hours so far but have greatly enjoyed them. I WILL be putting in the hours over time to solve every single puzzle. This is not a game for those who do not enjoy puzzles for the sake of puzzles.\n\nThis is not an exploration game with puzzles along with X,Y, or Z mechanic. It is entirely exploration and puzzles. Varied, intelligent, challenging, and clever puzzles. If you like to figure things out on your own, I recommend this game. If you have patience, I recommend this game. If one of your favorite things about learning is the "Ahah!" moment, I recommend this game.\n\nIf you are looking for anything more than puzzles, the game seems to have some sort of narrative or message or meaning. But you have to really love solving puzzles to figure whatever that is. I haven't figured anything out yet but I've only played a few hours. I feel as if it's more of a medatative game.\n\nIt has a beautiful open world. The scenery is amazing. The colors are vibrant. The contrast of areas is astounding.\n\nBut this game isn't for everyone. It is definitely for me though. I thrive in an environment of challenge that this game presents.

I was really looking forward to this, mostly based on the fact that Jonathan Blow was the mastermind of the project, and it looked really pretty. I'm not really the biggest fan of puzzle games. Portal 1 and 2 are wonderful, I think they're great. Talos Principle? I liked some aspects of it (the atmosphere and the lore) but the gameplay didn't really do it for me. I got some amount of enjoyment from it, but had little motivation to go deep into it. To hear from many that Talos is a better game quickly grew my skepticism of The Witness. Is it really worth $40? Kind of a risky investment considering I put exactly 2 hours into Talos... and I don't really intend to go back.\n\nWhile the similarities to Talos are definitely there, this game also hearkens to what is one of my favorite games of the last few years, Proteus. The lack of music brings my full attention to the environment -- no dramatic emotional cues are provoked, and I like that. I'm kind of left to my own exploratory devices, at my own pace. And what a place to explore. This game is VISUALLY ARRESTING. I don't know how they made colors behave the way they have here. Everything I look at is a dopamine rush. It's just the definition of aesthetically pleasing. I can't quite put my finger on it. It's painterly, and layered: yes, your character is confined to sometimes-limited paths (unlike most FPS situations, if it looks like it would break your ankle, you can't drop down, etc) but the trade-off is gorgeous views, interesting visual terminals, and controlled color palletes. I wish parks were designed this nicely. I wish landscapes for designed so elegantly. It really feels like someone has considered how the game looks from every possible angle. The whole thing is super screenshottable; picturesque. And it is a dream to explore.\n\nSo then, about those puzzles. They are more "two dimensional" and "contained" than I expected, I guess, but I think that's okay. Instead of making yourself and your movement an element of the puzzle, like in Talos principle, you literally use a cursor to guide lines through a 2D "maze." It's, at first, exactly like the pen and paper maze puzzles that lined children's magazines. And that is actually kind of refreshing to me, to have each puzzle be a clear, self-contained unit. Because it's easy to walk away from them. It's easy because there is so much worth exploring. Since I haven't allowed myself to get to the brink of frustration yet, in the first hour, I've been pleasantly surprised and happy with them. I'd say there's probably much, much building on the basic formula to be had, and I don't doubt I WILL be frustrated.\n\nAt the end of hour 1, I am pretty easily expecting to blow past hour 2. I can't wait to hop back in. But how long will it hold me? We shall see...\n\nDAY TWO:\nWell... as much as I love the world of this game, I'm not really sure I'm made of the kind of stuff that can make much progress with these puzzles. The exploration is great. The puzzles feel like a lot of trial-and-error to my math-strained brain. Unfortunately, I think I'm going to test out Steam's refund system, because I'm just not sure if it's worth $40 for me right now.

Few things are random in this game, and as it goes on I'm feeling increasingly like a conspiracy nut as I'm constantly looking for patterns in the world around me.\nThe feeling of coming across a panel with no clear solution, investigating the world around you, and then trying out some far-fetched theory only to unexpectedly find that it works, is truly amazing.\n\nEnjoying it immensely so far, but it requires an hour or so to start to understand why it is so good.

Not for those looking for a braindead-gratification-on-rails; you have to put a lot in but you get a lot out.

This, and only this, is your way of interacting with the world, even outside the puzzles.\nWhich is a good thing! The panels employ a number of mechanics, each with a relatively simple set of rules. Combining those mechanics just means applying the rules for each one.\n\nEasy, right?\n\nIt is, at least when your mental model of the rules is correct. These moments are hugely satisfying: Progression happens not because you've collected the correct item, but because you have learned something.\nAnd when your model is wrong, it's time to experiment. People mention the scientific method in conjunction with The Witness, and I can see why. The deterministic behavior of each element means you can form a hypothesis and test it as often as necessary.\nOr, admittedly, until you give up in frustration. Which will happen, unless you've got Vulcan-like patience and focus.

Stunning, colorful vistas at every turn, rendered beautifully, with no background music and few sound effects to distract from the puzzle solving. I think that's a wise decision, given how much concentration can be needed to solve the panels.

Because I failed to beat the game in a weekend (thats not a bad thing, I just have other things to play too) I'm not sure if theres a point... but from what I've seen its pretty decent to Myst like Talos Principle did to when the original Portal came out. The game uplifts and challenges the player in a different way, while keeping the experience enjoyable (minus the fact all the puzzles are line/dot puzzles (more on that later)\n\nGameplay: All the puzzles are variances of a "draw a line from point to end while doing things on a board." Every puzzle, every environment action besides Moving requires you to manipulate these plates in ways to get things done, doors open, rooms lit, panels flipped, etc etc etc. So the challenge is finding the solution because as you play... what is on the board, what appears on the board, why your manipulating the board becomes less and less clear. Everything around you looks pretty and may have an overarching purpose to your progress. Thats my flaw, every puzzle looks the same, but isn't. Myst (which I compare this game strongly too) varies it up but has the same flow because you interact with objects directly while this one requires panels to do the same interation... like TURNING THINGS. Not to mention this game sometimes prohibits guessing by the inconvience of repeating the previous panel to attempt the current panel again.\n\nGraphics: Looks amazing, theres alot to look at and is a photographers dream. The artstyle might not be for everyone, but it suits this game well, and once in awhile stops your tracks to gasp at a perfect vision.\n\nAudio: Music is missing, but puzzles can have audio so I can see why. Your going to be hearing things happening that you need to see to comprehend and you can tell whats going on with headphones or speakers.\n\nScore: I'd like to give this a higher score, but 8.5 or 9 out of 10 seems to be the best I can give it. The price point might be kind of high for some, but theres enough to sink your teeth into if the puzzles can keep you engaged. While its not the best puzzle game of the past 5 years, I would say if you picked this up and don't mind drawing lines to solve things you'll survive to get a great experience, but if your looking for a more interactive, more engaging experience you can get this or Talos Principle. This might become the myst of the next generation, but it needs to tweak the average interactive experience instead of tying everything to panel drawings.\n\nPS: This game crashed twice over some of the ways the game lights rooms, it uses some kind of light filtering (I'd go more but since its a theme for a hub I'm stopping here.) so some Video cards might become unstable. I use ATI Radeon HD 5670 with the game in DX11. The auto save was never corrupted (thankfully) but I feared it could so a manual save might be a good way to go if the dev is looking for improvements.","January 31","true","11.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I wanted to talk in a calculated and measured way but I don't think that's really the way you're going to figure if you'll enjoy the game. Either this will resonate with you or it won't and you'll think I'm full of abject puffery or that I'm deluded in some manner.\n\nI have to say, it's weird seeing the utter contrast between people who enjoy the game and people who don't. Either the motif of enlightenment and zen strikes you or it doesn't. Either you enjoy the myriad ways that the game makes path-puzzle solving difficult by using the environment and adding more rules or you find it stupid. Either you love the way the game tries to make you feel connected to something, some secret just beyond your grasp (there goes the motif again)... or you find the whole experience unbearably pretentious.\n\nI can't promise you'll like the game (if a deeply puristic exploration 'game' can even be called such). And as a personal plea from an absolute nobody, maybe I can't convince you of it but there IS something here: a surprisingly strongly structured attempt to invoke a longing for a connection to something (knowledge or spirituality or whatever metaphysical concept you hold closest to you). Either you'll find the call to this 'something' deeply self-resonant or you won't and if it's the latter I can see easily how you might not enjoy the game. The whole experience is built around trying to invoke your feeling that 'something' and if it fails then your mileage will vary.\n\nFor the sake of trying to give SOME sort of guidance, it's close to the Myst series and The Talos Principle thematically (and graphically it's downright GORGEOUS). And like those games either you are good at puzzle solving or you'll need to look up the solutions. Try not to spoil it for yourself though since some of the seemingly toughest puzzles sometimes just require knowledge acquired at a vastly different area of the island. None of the problems are unfair really though pounding away at a puzzle like its a veil you're desperate to see behind is discouraging at times. As an important aside though, sadly, the game WILL give you issues at points if you are colorblind to certain colors or are deaf.\n\nThanks, Thekla in general and Jonathan Blow. I lack the words to properly express. This wasn't a game I was looking forward to heavily and it's completely consuming me. (Hell, Braid only resonated with me minimally.) I'm really going to miss this feeling when the experience is over.\n\nIn the end, whether something resonated with you in this review or it didn't. And either way I can't promise any correlation with how you'll feel about the game. So what was the point of this? I suppose I just needed to express how this experience has made me feel was all.","February 1","true","81.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The main draw of this game in the beginning is its beautifully crafted environment, which is pretty much completely explorable and packed with detail. The only gameplay element aside from simple movement is in mouse-based interaction with line puzzles (controller works too, but I found I wanted more precision). Basically these are those puzzles that require you to trace a shape without crossing the same spot more than once. The rules are never spelled out, but the game is great at encouraging the player to learn through experimentation and exploration. I hesitate to say any more about it, because some of the most awesome moments in this game are in figuring out what's going on.\n\nThe secrets are the fun part of the game, which is why it's so frustrating that a few of the secrets are so damn obscure. After a certain point, I was aware that there was more to do, based on a few glimpses of locked-off areas, but I had exhausted almost everything else of interest. I really wanted to find everything worthwhile in this game without spoilers, but the game turned into hours of me squinting at the screen for some hint about what to do next. I even tried solving a nearly accessible puzzle through the cracks in a plank ceiling to make progress (which, let's be honest, would've been an epic solution if it worked). Honestly, trying to solve that mystery on my own turned into a pretty low point in the game. For any but the most determined, if you are to that point, I actually recommend getting a hint or two.

Solving puzzles in those games rewards you with insight into the world, the story, the themes. Along with being fun puzzles in and of themselves, there was a reason for solving them beyond 'because they're there."\n\nI got no sense from the Witness that there was anything beyond the puzzlees. I never felt like solving a puzzle resulted in a tantalizing, fleeting glimpse into what lies beneath. It just felt like... puzzles. A bunch of puzzles.\n\nIf that's what you want, then this may be the game for you. But if you want puzzles in service of something else - ANYTHING else - then move along. There's nothing to see here.\n\n(I'm sure someone (possibly many someones) will say I didn't give it enough time. To them I'd say that if Braid and the Talos Principle (and many others) managed to hook me in an hour, then the Witness should be able to do the same. From what I experienced, it seems utterly indifferent to my enjoyment. It offered no hooks. It simply exists, and much like the island on which it's set, it seems completely unconcerned with me or my actions.

I'd have preferred to give it a neutral rating, but on balance my feelings are more negative than positive, hence the thumbs down.\n\nAnyway, you're a guy, or maybe a girl, I don't know, who is stuck on an island for some unknown reason, and you've got to solve some puzzles in order to do ... something. There is no story whatsoever, no explanation for who you are, or what you're trying to achieve. And without going into spoilers, the ending is a total anti-climax. Well, okay, as long as the puzzles are fun, that's the most important thing, right?\n\nThe first several hours of my time in The Witness were extremely frustrating, because compared to those other games that I mentioned above, The Witness does a terrible job of explaining its mechanics and concepts to the player. I'm not complaining about difficulty. I don't mind being stuck on a puzzle for a while, as long as I've got an idea of what I'm supposed to be doing. There's a difference between understanding the rules of a puzzle, and actually finding the solution. The best puzzles are easy to understand, but challenging to solve.\n\nIn Portal 2, the first time I stepped on the orange gel and ran face first into a wall, I immediately understood "this stuff makes me run fast". In The Talos Principle, when I see a laser beam shooting out of a wall, I immediately know "I need to redirect the beam to activate something". The Witness does have some puzzles like that, where you need to observe clues in the environment. The first time I saw a console partially obscured by the shadow of a tree's branches, I immediately knew "draw a line that doesn't touch the shadow". Some puzzles have objects blocking part of the grid, and its obvious that solving the puzzle depends on standing in the correct place to get a better view. And there are some puzzles that have multiple solutions, which unlock different paths in the world around you. That's kinda cool, and its easy to understand "if I want to go over there instead, I need solve this puzzle a different way".\n\nBut the vast majority of The Witness' puzzles revolve around coloured dots and symbols. For example, when there are differently coloured dots, you draw a line to separate the colours. Okay, great. Now here's a triangle. And now there's a star. And here's a white thing with three lines. But what do those symbols mean? The game doesn't tell you. You just have to draw some lines on the grid in a random direction until something works, and then try to understand why it worked. Its not really a case of working it out with logic, but more a case of trying to guess "what was the developer thinking here?". And quite often I "solved" a puzzle without understanding what I actually did.\n\nSometimes a little bit of hand holding can be a good thing. Its like if you give me two numbers and specify whether you want me to add, subtract, multiply or divide, I'll give you the correct answer because I understand the rules of maths. But if all you give me is the two numbers, there's a crucial piece of information missing, so what am I supposed to do?\n\nSome of the concepts have "training" puzzles, but because you can wander around the island in any direction, you will probably find the more difficult puzzles first. I must have encountered about a dozen tetris block puzzles, which confused the hell out of me, before I finally found the area with those training puzzles. Yeah, I understood the concept after that, but you're supposed to give the player the easy puzzles FIRST. Introduce a concept, then build more complex puzzles around it later.\n\nI eventually resorted to reading a community guide which explains the rules of each type of puzzle without giving specific solutions:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614554253 After that, I started to enjoy the game a little. Some of the late game puzzles are especially mind bending, combining multiple concepts into the same puzzle, or just laid out in a really complex way. And although every puzzle requires you to draw a line through a grid, there is plenty of variety to stop it becoming boring. But unfortunately it was too late to forget that initial frustration.\n\nAnother thing that annoyed me is that some of the puzzle grids will deactivate if you fail to solve them correctly. This forces you to re-draw the line on the previous puzzle grid, to re-activate the one that you failed. Imagine being stuck on a puzzle, failing it dozens of times, and before you can attempt it again, having to re-do the previous puzzle over and over again (the previous puzzle doesn't change, so you just have to draw the exact same line again). The store page says that the game "treats your time as precious", but this is the exact opposite, a completely unnecessary waste of my time.\n\nThe game doesn't have any major problems from a technical point of view. I didn't suffer any bugs or crashes, and I got a constant 60 FPS at max settings on my GTX 770. The art style is pretty I guess, but I've always cared more about story and mechanics. You can't rebind keys though. Okay, the only key other than movement is "run", which is bound to shift, but I prefer to use end to run in other first person games, so the position of my hand felt unnatural. There's no excuse for a PC game in 2016 to not allow key rebinding.\n\nMy recommendation is to skip The Witness, and play something better instead.","April 21","false","18.5"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","5"

There is essentially no story to speak of. You appear and are free to do whatever. There is no obvious reason to do anything beyond unlock the first door so you can get out of the spawn location. Maybe if I invested  more time, there would be story but I doubt it.\n\nThe lack of story isn't really what killed this game for me, its the lack of puzzles. For me, to solve a puzzle, one must figure out a solution. In this game to solve a puzzle one must solve a graph optimization problem. It is a purely computational effort with no creativity involved. All puzzles are variation on labyrinth solving, but since that is very simple, some constraints are added. For example, your solution path must outline a certain shape or separate light and dark areas of the board etc. Once you figure out the constants, the process of actually solving the puzzle becomes a tedious process of trying different permutations until you arrive at the right one... Or look up the solution online.\n\nTo add insult to injury the mechanics are by no means obvious so any area that introduces a new mechanic also has an extensive tutorial system where you 'solve' progressively more difficult puzzles to get a handle on the rules of this specific  rule set. On the other hand, sprinkled thought the world are puzzles that assume advanced knowledge of mechanics that you have not yet found the tutorial for making solving them all but impossible. As a result, the game removes pretty much all elements of creative thinking from this 'puzzle' game. You either know the mechanic and the puzzle is little more than an equation that needs to be solved, or you don't know the mechanic and you have almost no hope of solving the puzzle at all.","February 14","false","1.8"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","21","41","0","0"

You will not find a story to speak of beyond the barest conceit. You will not find much music or action or RPG elements. There is nothing much to pull you through the game except the rather stunning scenery and your own sense of discovery. What you will find is a very compelling concept, stretched and explored in almost every conceivable way. It does not appear that way at first though. If you have do not have a little faith in the designer (by playing Braid for example), then you may be quick to dismiss it. It seems too simple. Too easy. But it builds upon itself over and over, folding inward and outward.\n\nBy the end you will be swearing at Jonathan Blow. But again, that journey relies on you as a player. The game gives you everything you need, but never explicitly. You have to want to understand the underlying systems. Very often you will come across something unintelligible. Something you can’t solve yet because you don’t have the mental tools. You have to make note of it and come back later. I highly recommend taking notes. Pen and paper will be your best companions on this odd little island.\n\nThis is a game that will change the way you look at the world and don’t mean that in some high-minded philosophical way, but in a very specific, rather funny way. That is something I don’t think I can say about any other game.

I think the idea behind the game is great and I would like to see more of the same.  90% of the puzzles were fantastic logic puzzles that challenges one sense of logic and critical thinking.  The artwork was also nice.\n\nThe problem is that abpout 10% of the puzzles were just stupid.  They weren't logical, or critical thinking puzzles, they were stand in the right spot puzzles.  The reflection puzzles were fine as you could use logic to figure out where to stand, but some of the other puzzles were just random.  I was only able to solve those by pure permutation and looking up the answer online.  And those puzzles weren't even challenging.  If you know which arbitrary view is the right one, then you already have the answer, no thinking required.  You just have to view the puzzle from every angle and distance until something lines up.\n\nI want to get the answer by rational thought and logical pattern recognition, not by knowing where to arbitrarily stand.\n\nThe other problem is that this game makes some of the puzzles hard by just assaulting your senses.  If you are color blind or, like me ,have bad hearing, then you are just screwed.  The puzzles would be simple if you could understand what you are seeing/hearing, but the game goes out of it's way to make it hard to view/hear the puzzles.  And I can only assume the puzzles at end game are designed to induce seizures and discriminate against the epeleptic.\n\nThe sad part is that these crappy puzzles of arbitrary standing and sensory assaulting don't add anything to the game or make the challenge more rewarding.  It just makes it annoying, frustrating, painful, and forces one to look up the answer in order to finish.  I don't want to have to cheat to finish the game.\n\nTo the author: You have a great game here.  It is fun, rewarding, enjoyable, and worth playing.  Just get your next game play tested by people and if somebody can't handle a puzzle due to hearing/sight/seizure problems then redesign it.  Even those who don't have bad hearing will thank you for it.","February 20","true","24.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cocoforcocopuffs/recommended/210970/","cocoforcocopuffs","Ace Ryder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cocoforcocopuffs/","160 products in account","The Witness provides the joy of discovery, exploration, and solving puzzles in a way that abstains from the trends of modern game design. It is less like a filed-down meticulously crafted experience and more like a beautiful expanse in which many truly beautiful experiences are possible, and in that way it is less like a "game" and more like a world. It conveys very profound messages, never explicitly, but it leads you to moments of introspection and thought, extremely open to interpretation and personalization, and yields many individual variations of self discovery, just as experiences in real life would. It toys with many strong concepts, and often the messages are typically supplied internally as a reaction to those concepts (the most effective way of truly resonating and teaching). I think this game will most appeal to those who find themselves living their lives in the pursuit of truth of any kind. If you want a familiar comparison, it is like Myst, but done properly, and a million times more captivating and powerful.\n\nThe main rewards in the Witness are knowledge and understanding. In the tradition of Jonathon Blow's games, you have the ability to choose which puzzles you want to solve first, and you may often find yourself leaving a string of puzzles to try a new set, and finding that new set providing you with a key understanding that will help you complete the old set. Sometimes you will turn to life and introspection to solve these puzzles, and draw on your own talents and personal backgrounds, many times I found myself taking pictures of the puzzles and scrawling out symbols in my sketchbook, as if I was some kind of archaeologist. A lot of the puzzles are as ruthless and uncatering as a real life puzzle or problem would be, which makes them incredibly more satisfying when they are solved, because there was no assurance that you would complete them. This helped to make the game feel like a grand mystery, or an ancient artifact that I was dusting away and piecing together. This strongpoint would not have worked if it were not for the non-linear, open, choice-driven atmosphere that is presented, as many of the puzzles, will no doubt, drive you mad. But I sincerely discourage anyone from looking up the solutions or seeking help, even if you feel they seem impossible, there isn't nearly a speck as much joy of reaping the rewards of the puzzle, than discovering within yourself the ability to solve them. In fact, until completion, I refrained from looking up anything about the game until I completed it, because I didn't even want to know that anyone else had solved the puzzles before me.\n\nThe only major complaint was the weak ending, as all the mystery the game built up, led me to so many imaginative ideas of what it was all leading up to, what was possible, and what grand truth could be revealed, and unfortunately, the game didn't live up to what those mysteries led my imagination to produce. Nevertheless the experience was unforgettable, and this was a true work of art, visually as well.","February 14","true","14.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I understand that engineering a puzzle takes a great mind, but I feel as though you're efforts are simply too mundane.  Every day, the New York Times challenges me with a crossword puzzle that draws on my education and life experiences to craft a truly memorable and endearing experience.  The Witness reminded me of a stained glass paint kit I received as a Christmas gift.  It's an imitation of true, masterful art and only enables lesser minds to experience the physical climb towards impacting the world we share.  I can say, with no doubt in my mind, you are a smart man.  However, I beat all 700 puzzles in 10 hours and have an incredibly high IQ.  I implore you, with respect, to refund me the $40 I spent on your product as I do not make much in the world of academia.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nHitler","January 27","true","7.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"

I think the idea behind the game is great and I would like to see more of the same.  90% of the puzzles were fantastic logic puzzles that challenges one sense of logic and critical thinking.  The artwork was also nice.\n\nThe problem is that abpout 10% of the puzzles were just stupid.  They weren't logical, or critical thinking puzzles, they were stand in the right spot puzzles.  The reflection puzzles were fine as you could use logic to figure out where to stand, but some of the other puzzles were just random.  I was only able to solve those by pure permutation and looking up the answer online.  And those puzzles weren't even challenging.  If you know which arbitrary view is the right one, then you already have the answer, no thinking required.  You just have to view the puzzle from every angle and distance until something lines up.\n\nI want to get the answer by rational thought and logical pattern recognition, not by knowing where to arbitrarily stand.\n\nThe other problem is that this game makes some of the puzzles hard by just assaulting your senses.  If you are color blind or, like me ,have bad hearing, then you are just screwed.  The puzzles would be simple if you could understand what you are seeing/hearing, but the game goes out of it's way to make it hard to view/hear the puzzles.  And I can only assume the puzzles at end game are designed to induce seizures and discriminate against the epeleptic.\n\nThe sad part is that these crappy puzzles of arbitrary standing and sensory assaulting don't add anything to the game or make the challenge more rewarding.  It just makes it annoying, frustrating, painful, and forces one to look up the answer in order to finish.  I don't want to have to cheat to finish the game.\n\nTo the author: You have a great game here.  It is fun, rewarding, enjoyable, and worth playing.  Just get your next game play tested by people and if somebody can't handle a puzzle due to hearing/sight/seizure problems then redesign it.  Even those who don't have bad hearing will thank you for it.","February 20","true","24.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cocoforcocopuffs/recommended/210970/","cocoforcocopuffs","Ace Ryder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cocoforcocopuffs/","160 products in account","The Witness provides the joy of discovery, exploration, and solving puzzles in a way that abstains from the trends of modern game design. It is less like a filed-down meticulously crafted experience and more like a beautiful expanse in which many truly beautiful experiences are possible, and in that way it is less like a "game" and more like a world. It conveys very profound messages, never explicitly, but it leads you to moments of introspection and thought, extremely open to interpretation and personalization, and yields many individual variations of self discovery, just as experiences in real life would. It toys with many strong concepts, and often the messages are typically supplied internally as a reaction to those concepts (the most effective way of truly resonating and teaching). I think this game will most appeal to those who find themselves living their lives in the pursuit of truth of any kind. If you want a familiar comparison, it is like Myst, but done properly, and a million times more captivating and powerful.\n\nThe main rewards in the Witness are knowledge and understanding. In the tradition of Jonathon Blow's games, you have the ability to choose which puzzles you want to solve first, and you may often find yourself leaving a string of puzzles to try a new set, and finding that new set providing you with a key understanding that will help you complete the old set. Sometimes you will turn to life and introspection to solve these puzzles, and draw on your own talents and personal backgrounds, many times I found myself taking pictures of the puzzles and scrawling out symbols in my sketchbook, as if I was some kind of archaeologist. A lot of the puzzles are as ruthless and uncatering as a real life puzzle or problem would be, which makes them incredibly more satisfying when they are solved, because there was no assurance that you would complete them. This helped to make the game feel like a grand mystery, or an ancient artifact that I was dusting away and piecing together. This strongpoint would not have worked if it were not for the non-linear, open, choice-driven atmosphere that is presented, as many of the puzzles, will no doubt, drive you mad. But I sincerely discourage anyone from looking up the solutions or seeking help, even if you feel they seem impossible, there isn't nearly a speck as much joy of reaping the rewards of the puzzle, than discovering within yourself the ability to solve them. In fact, until completion, I refrained from looking up anything about the game until I completed it, because I didn't even want to know that anyone else had solved the puzzles before me.\n\nThe only major complaint was the weak ending, as all the mystery the game built up, led me to so many imaginative ideas of what it was all leading up to, what was possible, and what grand truth could be revealed, and unfortunately, the game didn't live up to what those mysteries led my imagination to produce. Nevertheless the experience was unforgettable, and this was a true work of art, visually as well.","February 14","true","14.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I absolutely love The Witness. Some people may be turned off by the "line puzzles," wondering the need for the world itself around them. But for many, there are reasons. Big reasons. Here the environment is the puzzle, the panel is where you put your answer. And then there are even more secrets to find. Explaining any further would spoil it.\n\nThere are also puzzles that don't use the environment, teaching you many of the rules of this game that will be used and built upon in the future. It won't tell you how to do them though, this game is as much about learning the puzzle as it is about solving the puzzle. But the answers are there. It can be a very hard game when it wants to, but it's never unfair. If you're stuck, the open world is great to look around and solve other puzzles.\n\nAnd the art direction is just incredible, sometimes I'll just stare at how pretty everything is. You'll quickly notice the amount of detail put into it and how much thought was put into where and how everything was placed. I mean, look at this small blog post:\n\nhttp://the-witness.net/news/2015/06/polishing-the-architecture/\n\n\nDon't expect much story, though you can piece some together. This game is pure puzzle.

I love the colour palettes the developers chose, and the way there is so much happening on this fairly small island. They packed so much stuff in there! It looks so meticulously designed!\n\nThe puzzles are quite well thought out. It takes this kind of path tracing puzzle concept and runs with it; it goes through many different rule sets all based on this one type of puzzle. The way in which it is done is awe-inspiring. I found myself excited whenever I figured out what one of those variations was.\n\nThe game definitely lived up to the promise of a challenge - nothing was given for free (or at least, not much). However, as a puzzle game fan (and adventure game fan) myself, I found that to be quite entertaining. I was often faced with a puzzle that I at first thought was impossible. However, in every case, I would come around to the answer. It was really cool how they managed to get the puzzle's rule set accross without actually saying anything. I love games that give me these mental exercises without holding my hand, but still make it just enough of a challenge to be solvable without breaking your brain.\n\nThe only drawback with the game (and it isn't a big one at all), is that some of the clips you find on the island are a little long. They vary from 10 minutes to more than an hour. Thankfully, though, there aren't that many to find. If you play this game, you'll know why I know about the lengths... ;) The videos overall (mixed with the audio clips strewn about the landscape) give you an interesting mix of perspectives on the human condition. However, I do feel that while they don't exactly fit within the context of this game, they do provide food for thought.\n\nIn short, I would recommend this game to any puzzle or adventure game fan out there. As some have mentioned, there isn't much of a story, but I really don't care. It gives just enough to be mysterious, and that's enough for me.","April 23","true","54.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As expressed by others this game will not hold your hand. So many people expect games to lead them by the nose and give them all the answers on a plate. You will not find that here. To say there is no tutorial is false. In fact, the way the tutorial content was designed is very well done.  This game issubtle and understated and much will likely be missed without repeated exploration. You will definitely be frustrated with the puzzles often.\n\n\nEdit: I originally wrote this before completing the game, as I didn't want to believe some of the negative reviews. I wanted to believe there was more to this game than puzzles upon puzzles to the point of almost "player abuse." The game seems to suggest there is some hidden meaning to be found. Howerver, after a $5 million dollar budget and 8 years of work from the developer, in the end this game sees players as a mere afterthought, as if a game can exist on the supposition that players don't matter.

As for the Audio, well, there really isn't much to talk about here as there isn't much to listen to in the game as far as I know, there are Audio Logs that can be found scattered around the land but even then they don't tell you much if anything about the backstory of this game. The one positive about the Audio is Very Meaty footsteps that are needed to solve some puzzles.\n\nNow for the Puzzles, The puzzles are original and can get very complex very fast with new mechanics around every corner and very little to no help solving them, however they are possible after a few failed attempts. What this game does with perspective is extremely clever and it can really make you think outside the box, yet, that said some of the "Forced Perspective" puzzles can be quite tricky getting into the right place to solve but not impossible.\n\nAs for the mood of the game it is calming and stress free mostly however, it can make you feel like a complete idiot by not seeing the larger picture but then again it does feel very satifying once you have cracked a puzzle that has been fustrating you for quite a while.\n\nNow for what some people look for in these types of games, The Story. I can't comment on the story just yet as im only 5 hours in but from that 5 hours of solving puzzles and wandering the land I can say that there isn't much of a story, You wake up in a tunnel and thats pretty much all your told, The audio logs are just Quotes from famous people and tell very little of the story and I haven't found anything that tells me what happened to the "Others" or what will happen once I solve the "Final" puzzle.\n\nTL:DR  Amazing Graphics, Very fun and original puzles, Not much of a story, Not much audio but still pretty good. I recommend this game to anybody that wants a good puzzle to solve.","January 29","true","5.6"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

As expressed by others this game will not hold your hand. So many people expect games to lead them by the nose and give them all the answers on a plate. You will not find that here. To say there is no tutorial is false. In fact, the way the tutorial content was designed is very well done.  This game issubtle and understated and much will likely be missed without repeated exploration. You will definitely be frustrated with the puzzles often.\n\n\nEdit: I originally wrote this before completing the game, as I didn't want to believe some of the negative reviews. I wanted to believe there was more to this game than puzzles upon puzzles to the point of almost "player abuse." The game seems to suggest there is some hidden meaning to be found. Howerver, after a $5 million dollar budget and 8 years of work from the developer, in the end this game sees players as a mere afterthought, as if a game can exist on the supposition that players don't matter. Bear this mind when buying this game. You may wan't to wait for it to go on sale as others have said.","March 11","true","52.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zero_koop/recommended/210970/","zero_koop","Koop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zero_koop/","316 products in account","This game is a masterpiece.  It takes the best elements of the puzzle/exploration genre (i.e. Myst, etc.) and completely eliminates the more frustrating elements of that genre.  For example, in Myst you could be stuck forever because you didn't realize some teeny-tiny pixel was a button that you needed to push.  The developers probably didn't even intend for that to be a hard puzzle, but you just didn't see it.  Well in The Witness every single puzzle is plainly displayed and very obvious.  Furthermore, the sequence of puzzles is obvious and the game does an incredible job of very fairly teaching you each rule you need to learn to solve each puzzle before later testing you on that knowledge.  This teaching was one of the more impressive elements of the game.  The end result is a type of puzzle where you could easily imagine the majority of them being in a straight puzzle game (no adventure or exploration, etc.) but that would be somewhat boring and The Witness has an excellent atmosphere of intrigue that makes you want to find out what is beyond the next gate.  The downside of this puzzle approach is that The Witness does not have the same immersive feeling as a game like Myst which had puzzles seamlessly integrated into the environment itself.  However, if that kind of immersive puzzle is something you love then The Witness actually has you covered there too!  I won't say anything that spoils the fun, but there is a whole set of puzzles that are not required to finish the game that do not show up on clearly marked panels...\n\nMy recommendation to anyone who plays this game: DO NOT look up walkthroughs!  Seriously, you can figure it out.  If you're stuck on a puzzle just walk away and come back another day.  I can't count the number of times I was so close to giving up and looking up a walkthrough and when I came back the next day I was able to figure it out.  I'll admit I did use one hint and that was for one of the bird call puzzles.  But most of the fun of this game is in the moments of finally figuring out a hard puzzle by yourself.","March 13","true","32.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's not for everyone. There's no action, items, or enemies. The game is ponderous, challenging, and vague. Not everyone wants to spend over 25 hours solving puzzles, and thats ok. But if puzzle games are interesting to you, The Witness is certainly one of the best. To like this game, you must enjoy and be satisfied with learning new concepts and experiencing breakthrough moments in your understanding. If this sounds good, just buy the game, its fantastic. If its not enough, maybe skip it (or challenge yourself).\n\nThis game is about puzzles, but it is also about learning, discovery and epistemology. In the end, it is about teaching you to solve its mazes while organically guiding you to moments of epiphany. While the game certainly takes itself seriously, I think that it deserves the attitude for how well it accomplishes its design goals. This game sticks to its morals and realizes them fully. The result is something beautifully unique that doesn't compromise if doing so would undermine its goals.\n\nIt surprised me how versatile the maze puzzles are. The simple concept of drawing a line through a grid from the start to the finish is complicated by gaps in the grid and symbols whose meaning you must learn through sets of puzzles designed for that purpose. Eventually you are solving problems with multiple sets of symbols that must be satisfied simultaneously, speaking a new sort of visual language.\n\nOh, and the visual are effing superb!

Absolutely stunning. However, doing the same type of puzzles over and over with nothing interesting in-between quickly got old, and I felt like it was missing something crucial. A storyline, perhaps?

This game isn't like that, but what it is is a study on your own mind: a test to see if you are determined, logical, and observant enough to solve what Jonathan Blow and his development team has come up with. Since this game was announced, I had been eagerly waiting its arrival, and I am very pleased to say the seven years of waiting did not disappoint. Play The Witness, forget the price (if you can buy it on sale, even better), and envelop yourself in that world for at least a few hours.

In most cases instead the game just makes the actual act of solving the puzzle difficult.\n\nIf you're looking for a puzzle game that requires actual thought, get this instead: https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/pushy/id322110989\n\nHere's the point where i personally gave up:\n\nRan into the sound puzzles. Puzzles where one has to draw lines at heights indicated by bird song. Doable. Then the game overlays cellphones, wood instruments and more birds. These were entirely impossible for me. Game provides no way to make them easier whatsoever, and has no compassion for people who aren't great of hearing.\n\n\n---\n\nSome more rambly details:\n\nThe game is basically a very beautiful, mostly static 3d landscape you walk around in. It might actually be kind of relaxing if that was the point, but the point of the game is puzzles.\n\nThe game's puzzles are largely not "solved". There are a few exceptions, but for most puzzles you don't look at and think about them much. In fact, for many of them the solution is just to look around and trace the line as indicated  by shadows, reflections, bird chirps or similar. (If you're colorblind an entire section of puzzles will be impossible, as the game lies even to non-colorblind people.)\n\nThat is, for many puzzles the "puzzle" part is in finding where in the surroundings the solution is hidden so you can enter it. Usually they're either not hidden at all, or hidden such that you need to work out how the reflections ingame work (i.e. not at all like in the real world).\n\nThen there is a number of *actual* puzzle that require pausing and thinking. Those are actually more annoying than the previous ones, because the *actual* puzzle in them is figuring out what the rules of the puzzle are. You're literally just reverse-engineering a black box. This would be fine if there were a lot of different things to try, maybe have the ability to rearrange the pieces on the board and see how that changes the solution. Instead however you have a fixed set of inputs to which you can add your solution and get a yes or no for whether it is right. Sadly often the inputs don't explain all the details of the rules however, so when the complexity steps up, you're just left guessing and hoping and eventually brute-forcing it.\n\nSome rule-based puzzles i still don't know what the rules are, even after having looked up the solutions, and i'm a programmer by trade.\n\nThere's also no story. All you get is a bunch of mp3s of scientists of various ages telling you how science is actually religion.","February 14","false","9.2"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","0"

Some are even impossible or require unbelievable will to solve -- but for every person it is different. There may be a kind of probability but I was stuck on an extremely simple puzzle for a long time and then swept through many following puzzles without a hitch, and it was not a matter of comprehension. It is just a bit of luck on how you look at it and not necessarily a matter of comprehension, intelligence or other personal traits.\n\nYou'll have to live with those "dumb feeling" moments if you want to enjoy the game.\n\nMy advise is to play as far as you feel comfortable without spoilers but if you feel like you need it, don't think it is wrong to cheat and look solutions up on the 'net. Afterwards you'll feel guilty and like you've ruined the fun, so do this with caution. But sometimes I can tell you some very hard puzzles I was HAPPY to have them looked up, because I knew I could never do those. For example the ones where you have to pay attention to "something" (I don't want to spoil here) and then "translate" that "something" into the solution. Well, it happens that I simply can't perceive that "something" even if I know what it is, I have the solution and try hard. I simply don't "perceive" it that way so I'd never come up with that solution.\n\nOther times I solved puzzles without having a clue how, even hourse later and all, I still don't know how I did some. Maybe just luck?\n\nThen there are the citations from literature. They are interesting but they feel more like overshooting or wannabe genius. No denying that "The Witness" is a masterpiece that will be remembered for a very very long time. I value it a lot, it's one of the best games I've played in the last years. But, come on. Einstein and philosophers? It certainly is meant as a tribute to those luminaries, but this is still a game and a COMMERCIAL PRODUCT, not a piece of art.\n\nTo be true art it must be something to put into a museum, teach in school or to release into the public domain for all humanity to enjoy for free. And neither of these is the case. This is still a commercial game, and as such the altruistic citations don't sound sincere enough to me.\n\nYou want the real deal? Stop playing computer games and read an academic text about any topic (philosophy, art, social sciences or whatever) that you can download for free from any university. You'll get pretty soon the difference between this "intellectual posing" and the real thing.\n\nThat said, I still recommend it over and over again. If you like puzzles, Myst or exploration games on solitary islands.. then this is the best you can get.\n\nAlso, take some screenshots of beautiful sights and use them as desktop wallpapers!

One word of warning to anyone interested in buying this game, do NOT watch any lets-plays or Twitch streams before you experience The Witness for yourself.  The game is designed to be experienced by yourself first and the awe-factor can be spoiled in a lets-play.

Probably just a personal preference thing, but I would have loved to have more audio elements in the puzzles, and much less color-masked stuff.\n- In the end game section, it seems like the developer is literally just trying to ♥♥♥♥ me off, or give me an ****-ing seizure.

What a narrow-minded, shallow interpretation. A great puzzle games doesn't throw fifty different concepts at you. It takes one simple concept and exhausts it completely. Just when I thought they couldn't possibly have more ways to keep the same concept fresh, they flip you upside down. It's awesome.\n\nThis game let's you unravel it bit by bit, letting you feel challenged and intelligent without overwhelming you.

Just looking at the screenshots and videos should tell you that though. Not only that, but you can tell great care was taken in putting the whole island together. The environment around the island changes drastically between two area, yet every transition feels natural.

I just completed the final challenge in this game earlier today and I'm STILL coming down off the high that it gave me, already half a day later.  It was definitely a very difficult challenge, especially at the end, but games like these are all about perseverance and looking at things from every angle!  I've got a lot I could say about this game, but in true Witness fashion, let me first proceed by backing up... and start with explaining just what kind of game this is for those who might be interested in picking it up:\n\nThe Witness is, at its core, a puzzle game.  As others have stated in their reviews, this game is not for everyone... but NO puzzle game is.  So like I said, it is a puzzle game, but holy mother of god it is a GORGEOUS one!!  I have played many puzzle games before this one since I am a huge fan of the genre...  All were pretty unique experiences, and some are fairly simple-looking while others have beautiful graphics.  The Witness is one of the latter.  I found myself completely and consistently immersed in its simple yet gorgeoulsy rendered 3D environment.  Just looking around I couldn't help but apprecaite how every detail of the island is a carefully crafted work of art, but make no mistake... The Witness is a really hardcore puzzle game!  Almost all of the interaction with the various objects throughout the environment consists of solving maze-like puzzles by drawing the path with your cursor based on different rules and different shapes of maze.  I was truly impressed with the amount of diversity the developers were able to achieve with such a simple concept, and I really mean that!  These puzzles really are incredibly clever and immensely satisfying to solve... which is why I quickly found myself addicted to this game.\n\nDue to the nature of the environment and the exploration aspect of The Witness, many might compare this game to the Myst series.  I, too, found many similar aspects between the two... such as the way you must carefully examine the environment around you for clues and extrapolating with previously obtained knowledge to solve puzzles which grant you access to new areas to explore... not to mention the fact that you are exploring a deserted island as a nameless, faceless observer with almost no narrative.  However, the puzzles themselves are vastly different and Myst DID have a narrative, however irrelevant it may have seemed at times.\n\nThe journey in this game is purely scientific in nature... it is about learning and then applying your newly acquired knowledge in the process to learn more!  It's also worth noting that there is some really fantastic voice-over work done by some top-notch voice actors in this game, but without spoiling anything I'll just say that its inclusion is less relevant to the game itself and more about adding some perspective to the experience of playing it... or just interesting philosophical fluff, however you choose to interpret it (also, it is completely optional to listen to it).  There is a lot about this game that is open to interpretation actually, but if you're into strictly puzzle games, don't let that turn you off!  You can still enojy the hell out of solving these puzzles even if you don't care about the beautiful environment or the philosophical framework in which it sits.\n\nLastly, this game is from the same creative mind that brought us Braid, another fantastic puzzle game that I greatly enjoyed for its clever implementation of gameplay mechanics and devious puzzle design.  While The Witness is a VERY different gameplay experience compared to Braid, I could easily use the same description for both... so in my humble opinion this is another smash hit from the now-legendary-if-he-wasn't-already Jonathan Blow!\n\nClosing statements: If you enjoy challenging your brain with puzzles, you HAVE to try The Witness!","February 10","true","32.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

If you do not enjoy puzzles, you will not enjoy this game. That said, the world is beautifully designed, the puzzles are created in such a way that they wordlessly teach the player how to solve new concepts at a steady difficulty curve. Then, why not combine concepts? Then, throw a total curveball at the player with something totally new.\n\nIf you enjoy the "A-ha!" moment of sudden realisation, the frustration of trying to understand the solution, and the joy of finally completing and understanding the puzzle, I couldn't recommend this game enough.\n\nIf you aren't a fan of mazes, just take a moment to explore.

Took me forever till i solved it by accident.\n\nAgain inside the mountain they broke rules where the stars were not paired in the puzzle and the only solution was star to be paired with another cube.  This change the rules as you go approach taken in this game angered me a great deal.  It is why I can love and at times hate puzzle games.  However most times the game is faithful to its own rules for each puzzle type.   There is alot to explore and see.  Secret places that are hard to find.

Yes, there's barely any explicit narrative -- and the little bit that *is* there is buried very, very deep. I went 50 hours in The Witness before I felt I understood what the island was, or why I was there. And there's still some doubt there, frankly.\n\nAnd... none of that bothers me. I found the puzzles tremendously engaging. I felt like a genius when I solved them, and discovering the endless, clever twists on the mechanics was a constant delight. I was happy when my puzzle-solving prowess was, inevitably, rewarded with more puzzles to solve. That's what I wanted to do: it's just like an FPS game rewarding you with a bigger gun, and more things to shoot with it.\n\nSo this all hinges on whether or not you personally enjoy the puzzle mechanics of The Witness. If you do, the game will absolutely fascinate you; if you don't, it'll seem an interminable slog. I don't think there's much middle ground there, and there's just no way to know until you try it.\n\nIf $40 seems like too big a risk, there's no shame in waiting for a sale.

No other game mixes environmental puzzles and symbolic logic puzzles together so masterfully.\n\nAnother consequence of this unifying concept of the puzzle board is that you always know when you're looking at one. The game almost entirely lacks that Myst situation where you're wandering around unsure of where the next puzzle is. It also lacks the Myst problem of puzzles that are available, but impossible to solve until some other puzzle is solved first.\n\nThe method of teaching the "rules" of the symbols on the puzzle boards through carefully designed challenges without ever using any explicit explanation is downright brilliant. They're carefully designed to make you think you understand a rule, to give you a series of puzzles where the rule you've come up with will work, but then to suddenly confront you with a puzzle where you have to rethink. You'll frequently discover that you convinced yourself something was impossible without ever seeing evidence of that.\n\nAnd none of the puzzles ever require guess-and-check.\n\nIf you're guessing and checking, you're making a mistake. You can play Sudoku by guessing numbers and seeing how far they get you - you'll eventually solve any Sudoku puzzle that way - but you're not really playing Sudoku if you do that. So it is with The Witness.\n\nOnce you understand all the pieces of the puzzle, it is always possible to solve it completely deductively. Learning the different ways to do this is a huge part of the game. Many complaints about the game center around the idea that the reviewer "learned all the rules" and then just spent hours and hours boringly brute-forcing puzzles. Learning the "rules" is just the start. The bulk of the game is not spent learning the rules, but learning the logical consequences of the rules that allow you to deductively solve puzzles. It isn't just about learning the rules of the dots, it's about learning that the rules of the dots imply that certain configurations are impossible. After you learn the rules, the subsequent boards will be about teaching you these implications.\n\nThe audio logs and videos can feel a bit preachy at times, but having listened to all of them now, I understand a lot beter what purpose they served. They can initially come across as a pretentious affectation, like some college student going around spouting random philosophy quotes to seem "deep", but in time I think the game does actually reveal a fairly legitimate depth to what it's trying to express.\n\nAnd the final challenge, past the "end" of the game, is downright beautiful. While opinions may differ, I also found the reward for completing it to be far more worthwhile than the final rewards in most other games.\n\nFundamentally though, The Witness is a game about changes in perception. It's a game about looking at something again and again and then suddenly and very viscerally seeing it in a totally different light. Sometimes that's puzzles - sometimes it's re-examining how you think a symbol works or how you reason about a certain kind of puzzle. Other times the shift in perspective is more profound.\n\nPenultimate warning: You will almost certainly want some paper and a pen. Maybe even some scissors.\n\nFinal warning: If you use a guide to get through much of the game, there is a very real possibility, thanks to a brilliant pieces of design near the end, that you will find yourself unable to complete it.","March 14","true","44.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

You have to learn the rules for yourself.  The world is beautiful even if the visuals are a bit simplistic, and everywhere you look you wonder what its all about and you want to find everything.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was the "Challenge" area.  I don't want to spoil what it is so I'll just say it took the game in a different direction that felt like a big letdown.  I was expected that with only two achievements and one called "Challenge" I was going to get a giant ultimate puzzle with every mechanic in the game that would take me hours, days... who knows how long to solve.  What I got instead felt more like a crapshoot.\n\nIf you don't like puzzles and exploring, this is not for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DParse/recommended/210970/","DParse","DParse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DParse/","209 products in account","The Witness is a puzzle game with a minimal amount of story but an absolutely beautiful world to explore, with an excellent merging of the puzzles you solve and the environment you're in.\n\nIt is unabashedly a puzzle game, and it has extremely well-crafted and insanely difficult puzzles, while still providing a natural learning progression without hand-holding and annoying tutorials. You start by solving easy puzzles, then harder, then harder still. The reward for solving puzzles is most often more puzzles, like the games Hexcells, Hook, or Snakebird. Occasionally you find audio logs that give philosophical perspective from famous thinkers like Einstein, Nicholas of Cusa or Heisenberg.\n\nBut make no mistake about it - this is a puzzle game, and like the other games I listed, the reward for tackling a grueling puzzle is solving it. Some people will not like the lack of RPG Puzzle Experience Points™ or new and exciting guns with which to take down tougher puzzles, but it's not that kind of game.  The game is about taking in the surrounding and using it to solve puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are brilliant. Even though they all take the same general form (You need to find a path through a maze) there is an ENORMOUS amount of variety. Furthermore they are brilliantly paced and the game does an excellent job of teaching you the rules non-verbally. You'll come up across two or three puzzles with a new symbol, think you understand it, but then the game will force you to deal with a puzzle that makes you tweak the way you thought it worked.  Regardless of what some detractors say, there is not a single puzzle in the game that 'breaks the rules'. It is perfectly consistent.\n\nSome real criticisms: The trailer promises a story about regaining your memory, but that is absolutely 100% not in the game. Some of the areas are incredibly unfriendly to people with disabilities like color-blindness or deafness. Some of the quick but tough puzzles turn off on wrong guesses (to stop people from bruteforcing them) and you need to resolve the previous puzzle (the solution remains on the panel, so it's not difficult) so that can be annoying.\n\nHowever these flaws are minor compared to the excellent puzzle crafting, the beauty of the island, and the mind-opening fusion of the two. This game is heartily recommended to people who like puzzle games.\n\nSmall spoiler for people who "don't get it": If all you've done is walk from puzzle to puzzle, making guesses until you move on, and then finish the game without looking around, you're going to have a bad time. The environment MATTERS. Go to the mountain. Take a look down at the river. Open your eyes.","February 15","true","48.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a challenging puzzle game, yet like the best puzzle games, it makes the player feel like a genius for solving its puzzles, and it was never frustrating.\n\nIt's a masterpiece for how a single mechanic can still teach and feel rewarding after 40 hours. This mechanic, essentially drawing colored lines on a grid, is made constantly fresh by introducing new rules to the player for solving these puzzles. In fact, the biggest challenge is often simply figuring out what the rules for each puzzle element are. Often, careful observation of the environment is required, as visual and audio clues may guide you to a solution.\n\nThe game takes place on a beautiful, deserted island. It's rich in color, and yours to explore, almost in its entirety, from the moment you start. What works so well about the puzzle solving is that when you get stuck, and you often will, you can simply go to another area and try new puzzles there. You can skip many of the puzzles and still complete the game. Exploring one part of the island sometimes reveals a way to solve another puzzle that you couldn't figure out. Sometimes, the quiet, contemplative nature of the island puts you in the right frame of mind to solve another puzzle.\n\nPerspective, finally, is another major feature of the game, and when I finally saw it clicking in the puzzle and in the world itself, I was amazed.\n\nI was worried that the story would rub me the wrong way, as the developer's previous game had quite a few pretentious story elements (and one very clever twist). Here, though, all the written or spoken story elements are more or less optional. There are hidden audio and visual clips to be found or unlocked. I never felt like there was some hidden meaning that was being kept from me; rather, they were all interesting moments that I was free to interpret as I choose. I did feel that there were one or two major themes of the game, but it's left up to the player's own interpretation.\n\nThe Witness smoothly teaches its mechanics to the player, and without needing words it does this teaching in a way that makes it feel like a discovery that the player made, not something explicitly authored by the developer. Out hundreds of puzzles solved, only a couple felt unfair to me.\n\nI strongly recommend The Witness for the meditative calm  of its aesthetics and the feeling of quiet success that comes from its excellent puzzles.","March 30","true","53.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

If you read more than this line about any of the puzzles, it's spoilers.\n- Beautiful world, I loved to wonder aimlessly through it and just enjoy the view.\n\nThe Big Bad Stuff. There is no explicit story! People expected this. All story elements you hear are interesting, but disjointed. You don't have to agree with all of them, especially since sometimes they offer conflicting views. There's a lot of implicit storytelling in there (through architecture for example).\n\nBottom line, the story is not the point of this game.

No control over keyboard layouts, game resolution...\n- No accessibility settings. Admittedly, Jon Blow recently tweeted that he's working on some accessibility features (mostly for motion sickness).\n- Spoilers for this game are worse than spoilers in general. The puzzles are designed to evoke specific feelings and experiences. Spoilers completely ruin those.\n- I really wish there was an "Extras" option in the menu.

You start by solving easy puzzles, then harder, then harder still. The reward for solving puzzles is most often more puzzles, like the games Hexcells, Hook, or Snakebird. Occasionally you find audio logs that give philosophical perspective from famous thinkers like Einstein, Nicholas of Cusa or Heisenberg.\n\nBut make no mistake about it - this is a puzzle game, and like the other games I listed, the reward for tackling a grueling puzzle is solving it. Some people will not like the lack of RPG Puzzle Experience Points™ or new and exciting guns with which to take down tougher puzzles, but it's not that kind of game.  The game is about taking in the surrounding and using it to solve puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are brilliant. Even though they all take the same general form (You need to find a path through a maze) there is an ENORMOUS amount of variety. Furthermore they are brilliantly paced and the game does an excellent job of teaching you the rules non-verbally. You'll come up across two or three puzzles with a new symbol, think you understand it, but then the game will force you to deal with a puzzle that makes you tweak the way you thought it worked.  Regardless of what some detractors say, there is not a single puzzle in the game that 'breaks the rules'. It is perfectly consistent.\n\nSome real criticisms: The trailer promises a story about regaining your memory, but that is absolutely 100% not in the game. Some of the areas are incredibly unfriendly to people with disabilities like color-blindness or deafness. Some of the quick but tough puzzles turn off on wrong guesses (to stop people from bruteforcing them) and you need to resolve the previous puzzle (the solution remains on the panel, so it's not difficult) so that can be annoying.\n\nHowever these flaws are minor compared to the excellent puzzle crafting, the beauty of the island, and the mind-opening fusion of the two. This game is heartily recommended to people who like puzzle games.\n\nSmall spoiler for people who "don't get it": If all you've done is walk from puzzle to puzzle, making guesses until you move on, and then finish the game without looking around, you're going to have a bad time.

I believe after scouring most of the island and doing alot of the puzzles, I can make an accurate first impression.  So you load in and find yourself in a tunnel.  You walk through it and find yourself in a beautiful fort area.  The graphics here were really well done.  Very colorful and differentiated.  After solving the first puzzle, you leave this closed area and can traverse the island freely.  After seeing a few more puzzles and completing them you begin to see a pattern.  All the puzzles use the same mechanic. You draw a line from one area to another area, and usually have to cover all the dots along the way.  I've seen this before in a tablet game called Lyne.\n\nSo the whole time, you are walking around admiring the scenery.  You notice there's no soundtrack, no monologue or narration.  No notes, books or posters...basically what I'm getting at here is, nothing to tell you about where you are or what this place is.  In a way, this can be helpful to the overall immersion of the island.  For me however, growing up with games like Myst and Riven, this was a deterent.  I never felt immersed in TW.  I just felt bored after that first hour.  I found that none of the puzzles made any sense in their placement.  You've got a shed area here, giving you 5 screens of the same puzzle that just gets harder.  Then over there, maybe 50 ft away, you've got a tree puzzle with the same line mechanic on different screens.  Then another 100 ft down a path, you've got a laser puzzle.  There is no lore.  It just feels like an island of puzzles condensed in a small area.\n\nI will give TW credit where credit is due.  Some of the puzzles are difficult and you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing them.  But with a price tag 0f 40 USD, I don't think this game is worth it.  Some polish needs to be done.  Like in the very beginning fort region, you can just walk through a sofa.  I feel like if they just added some music or more sound effects other than the wind, it would be a lot more immersive.  Maybe change up the puzzle design here and there.  Some of the puzzles require you to just look at the environment.  No spoilers, but the tree puzzle is a lot easier if you look at the placement of the trees.\n\nIn the end, I just didn't feel like I was a part of this world.  Almost felt like it was a tech demo that the developer of Braid made to see if he could do a puzzle game.  I wouldn't even call this an adventure game.  Once the price comes down to 20 USD I'd say pick it up.","February 7","false","2.3"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

In the most basic sense, it’s a puzzle game in which you interact with panels that are simple mazes, but really, the game gets so much more complex. Every area of the island in The Witness has a set of rules that govern the puzzles found there. You will learn what those rules are through what you could say are tutorial puzzles. Some later puzzles in areas will draw from the rules of other areas, so you start mixing two, three, four, etc… rule sets together and this results in some seriously complex puzzles.\n\nAgain, I cannot say too much as I don’t want to spoil anything, but many of these puzzles got so complex that I found myself grabbing a pen and some paper and actually writing notes and drawing diagrams. I took more notes while playing The Witness than I did while working on my Master’s degree. One puzzle, not due to the difficulty of it, but due to how it’s presented to the player, gave me a headache. This isn’t entirely bad and I can’t really explain why, again due to spoilers, but I just want to try and let you know as much as I can without spoiling, that the game does really spice things up and is far more than just solving some simple mazes.\n\nI should also add that I played The Witness in a sort of co-op mode. I played it along with a buddy of mine and we went from puzzle to puzzle, area to area in our own respective game while we communicated via TeamSpeak. Where one of us struggled, the other helped. This made it so that we never had to resort to using any online walkthroughs. We never really lost that sense of accomplishment in solving the puzzles by having to cheat online.\n\nThe Witness is a game that will make you feel like a genius just as many times as it makes you feel like an idiot. It will haunt your dreams and warp your brain once you’ve finished it. You will start to see things in the real world and you will want to interact with them as you had in The Witness. The is most likely my favorite game of 2016, I’m sure it will have a place in my top 10 games of the last decade, and it is even in the running for one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time.\n\n5/5\n","February 7","true","26.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In that regards it had succeeded. Set on a mysterious island, you wander around completing puzzles. Rather impressively, these puzzles are all variants on the same mechanic, drawing lines on a grid. Don't let that simplicity fool you, these are hard puzzles that will leave you cursing the name of Johnathon Blow, the creator of The Witness.\n\nLike a teacher, Johnathon Blow will gently lead you through the mechanics so that you learn not just to solve the puzzles, but to understand them. A key difference in that brute forcing through them or randomly guessing will be punished. With many areas to explore, each with its own unique take on the line drawing mechanics, it always felt like that even if I was stuck somewhere, I could go somewhere else and bang my head against a different wall. All I can say is, change your perspective and be observant of the environment.\n\nOne could even suggest that the island is like a metroidvania game, where the “item” is the knowledge you learn from each of the regions.\n\nThis game is a chain of moments where you go “Aha!” and suddenly understand the key. While you might not be physically lifting that item above your head to the world like in Zelda, you are essentially doing that mentally. I am often reminded of Fez when playing this game. Although Fez has that one moment where suddenly you see the code of the matrix, this game has a lot more (although slightly lesser) moments. Then again, it can still surprise you and make you open your eyes to wonder just what were you missing this whole time and what else might be hiding in plain sight.\n\nDespite really enjoying this game, I did find a few pieces to dislike. While I can understand the choice in there being no music in this game, I disagree with it completely. But this is something that can be easily fixed by throwing some relaxing music on the music player. There are also certain classes of puzzles which some people might have a really hard time with. The “story” of The Witness is also very subtle and out of the way. Indeed the ending you get is rather disappointing. But it is a testament to the quality of the game that I didn't mind this all that much, helped very much by some of puzzles in the final area. Indeed the journey is much better than the destination.\n\nEven if all you get is the first ending after 25 hours, it is still a brilliant game that is well worth the asking price. But if you wish to delve deep into the depths of the mystery of The Witness, it can still be worth your while.","February 6","true","26.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Just like some of the puzzles in The Witness, the perspective you take with the game changes the kind of experience you'll have if you try it, and just like the puzzles, it can be difficult to both understand and appreciate the game as it is. Many of the design decisions they took with this game are not in line -- no pun intended -- with what most of us would consider "modern game design." It's an onion that is surprisingly difficult to pull the layers back on, with each new layer providing new and even more difficult challenges.\n\nThere is no music in the game. The island you explore is ostensibly "dead and lifeless." Your reward for puzzle solving can seemingly be nothing, or -- if you're rewarded with some kind of change in the world itself -- seemingly useless in nature, one puzzle unceremoniously unlocking another. The puzzles themselves appear to be flat, mostly motionless panels that could be exist just as well in a book rather than a game. There are no direct hints in the game; it will not hold your hand through its toughest challenges. To an unwilling participant, the experience appears undirected -- go anywhere, do whatever, but what's the point of it all? Is there a point?\n\nThis is all one perspective, but shift your approach and you'll find the image changes dramatically. Suddenly, and without warning, there is a consistant, logical sense for why the game has minimalistic sound design. You'll understand the ploy of the island, insofar as necessary, and realize that it is full of life in the strangest ways. You'll find reward around every corner -- and you'll find the game nearly literally speaking to you as you traverse its windy paths, opening up new areas, and finding its most hidden secrets. The puzzles will cease to be flat, unengaging billboards on the wall, and literally pop out into the world, becoming multi-dimensional in ways you never expected. You'll find the game talking to you, helping you, and sometimes confusing you -- but either way, it speaks.\n\nThe Witness is a game about learning how to learn. It doesn't pave the roads you walk with arrows, but it always provides a path to take to get where you want to be. Its puzzles are hard, but never unfair, and even when things are at their toughest the sense of accomplishment you'll find for learning and solving the challenges it provides is second to none. At its core, its a brilliant, meditative experience that provides a "Just one more puzzle" draw -- addictive and challenging, when you're willing to let yourself stop and think. In a lot of ways, it's like trying to communicate with someone who speaks a different language; appearing impossible, the more time you spend with it, the more you begin to understand its language, and the more it can speak to you as both a player, helping you with its mechanics, but moreover, challenging the way you think about problem solving.\n\nThere are other layers to the game as well. Some philosophical, some visual, maybe even layers you won't care for. It's by no means a perfect game, but what it is is something unique and wonderful and challenging. I cannot recommend this game if you don't like other puzzle games -- but if games like The Talos Principle, Portal, and Myst are your bag, and you're willing to have a game that really pushes back on you, challenging to unwind its complexities, not only is the game worth its asking price, but you may begin to think its one of the greatest puzzle games ever.\n\nOr you may completely hate it. In some ways, it's kind of up to you.","February 6","true","54.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you read more than this line about any of the puzzles, it's spoilers.\n- Beautiful world, I loved to wonder aimlessly through it and just enjoy the view.\n\nThe Big Bad Stuff. There is no explicit story! People expected this. All story elements you hear are interesting, but disjointed. You don't have to agree with all of them, especially since sometimes they offer conflicting views. There's a lot of implicit storytelling in there (through architecture for example).\n\nBottom line, the story is not the point of this game. There are cool story elements, but the story should NOT be the reason you get this.\n\n\nOther bad stuff:\n- Probably unplayable if you are colourblind.\n- Settings are very rudimentary. No control over keyboard layouts, game resolution...\n- No accessibility settings. Admittedly, Jon Blow recently tweeted that he's working on some accessibility features (mostly for motion sickness).\n- Spoilers for this game are worse than spoilers in general. The puzzles are designed to evoke specific feelings and experiences. Spoilers completely ruin those.\n- I really wish there was an "Extras" option in the menu.

While there are moments of frustration from lack of understanding, the powerfully epiphanic moments of discovery more than make up for them - that is, if you're observant enough.  Many of the bigger moments come hours of gameplay in.\n\nI also really liked the realism in player movement - a realistic shadow, sense of inertia, and a other little elements make you feel like you're really there, exploring.  They were appropriate touches that I've never seen before.  The beautiful graphics are also always a welcome sight.\n\nLike so much of the game, the narrative itself is expertly embedded in the environment, and it too is very rewarding and profound.

As for the Audio, well, there really isn't much to talk about here as there isn't much to listen to in the game as far as I know, there are Audio Logs that can be found scattered around the land but even then they don't tell you much if anything about the backstory of this game. The one positive about the Audio is Very Meaty footsteps that are needed to solve some puzzles.\n\nNow for the Puzzles, The puzzles are original and can get very complex very fast with new mechanics around every corner and very little to no help solving them, however they are possible after a few failed attempts. What this game does with perspective is extremely clever and it can really make you think outside the box, yet, that said some of the "Forced Perspective" puzzles can be quite tricky getting into the right place to solve but not impossible.\n\nAs for the mood of the game it is calming and stress free mostly however, it can make you feel like a complete idiot by not seeing the larger picture but then again it does feel very satifying once you have cracked a puzzle that has been fustrating you for quite a while.\n\nNow for what some people look for in these types of games, The Story. I can't comment on the story just yet as im only 5 hours in but from that 5 hours of solving puzzles and wandering the land I can say that there isn't much of a story, You wake up in a tunnel and thats pretty much all your told, The audio logs are just Quotes from famous people and tell very little of the story and I haven't found anything that tells me what happened to the "Others" or what will happen once I solve the "Final" puzzle.\n\nTL:DR  Amazing Graphics, Very fun and original puzles, Not much of a story, Not much audio but still pretty good.

Don't let the videos online fool you. Videos would make you believe that the game has only one type of puzzle since the images of puzzles all look the same. However, the LCD display of the puzzle is only a minor element in solving the puzzles. In "The Witness" you will use nearly every aspect of the environment to solve challenging, yet extremely rewarding puzzles.\n\nDuring my first 10 minutes with the game, I remember thinking "well this is pretty neat but I know I'll tire of the mechanics". Then there was that moment. That moment we see so rarely in games. The moment when you see the true brilliance of the game... when everything begins to make sense. I won't spoil "my moment" but I've had several since I first started playing (about 5 hours in).\n\nIf you are drawn to games to be challenged but hate the monotony of repeating an iteration the same task many times over in most puzzle games, I recommend "The Witness".

There are still quite a few areas I haven't unlocked, and a few puzzles that I'm completely baffled by, but generally speaking, the game gives you enough freedom to keep discovering new areas and learning about different game mechanics in a way that allows you to progress continuously. There are several areas which I've finished completely, which taught some of the simpler mechanics that are built on in later puzzles.\n\nI want to give a little context on the way you learn about puzzle elements in this game, because I've seen some misconceptions in other reviews. The simplest puzzles are just moving a dot to connect a line from A to B, but quickly the game will start to introduce different symbols into the puzzles, each of which has a function and dictates something about the way you need to solve the puzzle.\n\nThis is the important part: There is a tutorial area for each puzzle element that holds your hand through learning how it works.\n\nIf you come across a puzzle that seems way too hard for you, then it probably is. The game is not encouraging you to try to guess the answer and get really frustrated. It's giving you a sign that you haven't learned the right tools to solve it yet, and you should be looking somewhere else. Every puzzle element, from black and white squares, to spiky dots, to a little tri-force looking thing that changes how different puzzle regions act, to things that look like Tetris blocks, every one of these elements is explained in a series of very basic puzzles (starting with just one or two squares as opposed to the usual 5x5 grid) that explains the mechanic. The rules, once you learn them, do not change. They are not arbitrary. They work the same way every time. There is a lot of challenge in finding a solution that fits all the conditions imposed by the different puzzle elements, but there is no guesswork.\n\nIt's unfortunate to see a lot of reviewers quitting after an hour and a half of playtime because they got really frustrated with something they didn't understand and want a refund for the game. My own feeling is that the game does a really good job of slowly introducing you to new elements, as long as you just walk around and look for simpler puzzles before going straight to trying the most complicated-looking thing you can find. The game even turns off the puzzle panels if you try to brute-force an answer to a puzzle you can't solve yet--- take the hint.\n\nA few other things. The graphics are beautiful, with a very colorful, almost cel-shaded style. The different biomes of the island are each distinct and offer an impressive diversity of scenery, with each location having a different mood, and often with puzzle mechanics that relate loosely to the area (one region, overlooking a wide bay of calm water, teaches puzzles about reflection). The sound is minimal but effective; there are a few puzzles that actually require sound to complete, and because the rest of the soundtrack is relatively sparse, the auditory clues jumped out at me quickly. The one place where I think the game falters is in story, in that there really isn't one, even (at least as far as I've gotten) to be pieced together from the audio recordings and videos that can be found around the island. Myst or Riven this is not--- the game has a lot of atmosphere, but it doesn't have a narrative. As a fan of games with strong stories and generally of fiction with detailed world-building, it does seem like a little bit of a missed opportunity. But overall, I've really enjoyed my time with the game so far, and I'm looking forward to playing more.\n\nI'd rate this game an 8/10.","January 27","true","30.5"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

You have to explore it and figure out why you are on there, and what happened.\n\nThe story is pretty light. Aside from some voice messages and videos of psychological and philosophical nature, there isn't really much story to speak of until, maybe, the end (I am not there yet).\n\nYou progress through the island by solving the same type of puzzle over and over. Now, I am actually impressed by the amount of variations this game has for just the same type ofpuzzle. It starts off easy - draw a line from a starting point to an end point. As the game progresses, new symbols will be introduced that make solving these puzzles way harder, and sometimes even the environment will take part in the solution. For having only one type of puzzle, the game varies it a lot, keeping you busy and on your toes.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are generally on the harder side, but if you love puzzles, you will want to solve them all without looking into a walkthrough. Trust me, the experience is better that way.\n\nNow, it is of course not all gold and sunshine. Here are my personal pros and cons for the game:\n\nPro:\n+Graphics\n\nThe graphics are nice and sufficient. The island has lush colours, the graphic style is detailed enough without being overbearing, and everything is generally nice to look at and resourceful enough to work on any type of graphics card, really.\n\n+Puzzles/Creativity\n\nWhile the game only has one type of basic puzzle, it varies so much over the course of its 500+ puzzles that it has more variation in it than 10 types of puzzles could ever hope to achieve. Symbols, dots, tetris pieces and much more will make every area you explore a little different and keep you on your toes.\n\n+Sounds\n\nThe sounds are well done. The footsteps are the primary sound you will hear, and they are just as satisfying to listen to as the wirring of machinery after a solved puzzle, or the buzzing of an activated computer panel.\n\n+Secrets\n\nThe island has a lot of secret puzzles and secret locations. Exploring it is in general very fun and rewarding.\n\n+Voice Messages\n\nI like the voice messages in the game. While they are all only quotes of famous philosophers, scientists and the like, the people reading them really bring in some atmosphere. They do a great job, especially since everything else is so quiet.\n\nEh:\n\n-+No Hints\n\nThere are no real hints or a way to progress should you ever not understand a puzzle. Now, the entire game is logical, and everything can be solved with logic, but should you ever not get something, then you can either explore somewhere else, or, if you don't understand a symbol, look at a walkthrough. It can be frustrating, but that is not necessarily a con - it makes you have to think about things.\n\n-+No Music\n\nThere is no music in the game. Aside from the sound, everything is quiet. Some say it helps build up atmosphere, some find it annoying. It is up to you.\n\n-+Claustrophobia\n\nThe game feels downright claustrophobic at times, which is weird. The island holds a lot of structures like castles, deserts, houses, and so on, but sometimes it feels so cramped full of things that it seems unnecessary. That could have been avoided by just making the island a bit larger.\n\nCons:\n\n-No Map\n\nThis is probably my personal worst point. There is a fast travel system by using a boat you unlock at some point, and it shows a map - but there is no map you can call on at any point. The island itself isn't huge, but there are so many things to discover that a map would be really useful at times - the game is kept minimalistic for a reason, yes, but that doesn't mean it isn't annoying.\n\n-No story (to speak of)\n\nAside from, what I heard, the end, the entire game has no story, really. Yes, apparently something happened on this island, but until the end, you won't know what - that can make solving puzzles feel meaningless.\n\n-No reward\n\nAside from progressing over the island (sometimes), a lot of the puzzles don't have more rewards, except more puzzles. The reward is, I suppose, getting to solve them. Which is why I recommend the game only for diehard puzzle fans.\n\nOverall, I think it is a game worth playing, but only if you love puzzles, can deal with a(n apparent) nonexistent story and no music, and like the atmosphere of exploring an abandoned island.\n\nMy personal rating: 7/10","January 27","true","40.0"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

It's very similar to Myst, in that it's an island filled with puzzles. However, while Myst's puzzles are all combination locks with a note hidden somewhere, The Witness' puzzles all require some serious grey matter.\n\nThe Witness' gameplay is incredibly simple. A first-person game where you explore an island and solve puzzles. These puzzles all take the form of maze panels. Each maze has a set of different mechanics. These mechanics, depending on where you start, are very simplistic, at first so you can get your bearings and understand how these mechanics work. The mechanics become more and more complicated and even mix into each other.\n\nThe puzzles are definitely the best part of the game. Not only do they become more complicated, but the way you find the solutions are absolutely mind-boggling. The island is crawling with clues. Not in the form of notes, but in the form of the island's decor. The plants, the rock formations, the architectures...almost everything on the island is a clue. Look closely! These puzzles are incredibly well-designed and implemented.\n\nThe game is also completely open. Each area of the island is yours to explore. This design choice also benefits the player if they are stuck on a puzzle, allowing them to walk away, clear their heads, and/or look to new puzzles to solve if you want. The game's setting is absolutely beautiful. Each part of the island is completely distinctive and wildly imaginative. A looming fortress, a forest set in eternal autumn, a beautiful orchard, a bamboo forest that could serve as a panda preserve, Journey-esque desert, and many more that I wish to not spoil.\nI have yet to 100% complete this game, but I'm fully absorbed in it's incredibly complex design.\n\nHowever, this game lacks a story (as far as I know and if it does, please don't spoil it for me). The game has several audio logs scattered about, but they're all real-world quotes that have no context.\n\nThis game leaves me feeling both befuddled, confused, frustrated, and fulfilled when I find the solution (Though, I often need a pad of graph paper on-hand. In fact, I have a pad specifically for this game. The puzzles are extremely well designed, they're simple to complete, yet complex in execution, and absolutely beautiful to look at. If you're a fan of deep, intricate games, I highly recommend it","January 31","true","66.0"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRTR/recommended/210970/","DRTR","Romz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRTR/","464 products in account","Truman Show meets wang drawing puzzles in the garden.\n\nEver looked at a cloud and thought "That kind of looks like a wang?", that's this game in a nutshell x500 nuts. Actually, there is only 1 real wang puzzle with about 500 variations to be fair. While this review is "negative", its more a ~ which means its OK, not a bad game by any metric, but nowhere near worth the asking price of $40usd ($60aud at time of writing). I could do a lot with $60, but I chose to buy the witness and cannot refund it, so I'll do the next most cynical thing and not recommend it at full price. $10 definitely, I doubt you'd get your $$ worth at asking price. Consider yourself warned.\nHere's some pro's and cons:\n\nPro:\n- Pretty to look at\n- Its fun to solve the first 100 puzzles or so\n\n\nCon:\n- Every single puzzle is draw a wang line on a board or a figurative wang on a figurative board. Would have been nicer to have other puzzles, but in essence there are 100's of variations of "draw a line from entry to exit, but with a twist(s)".\n- Some puzzle quest-lines just stop, with no "reward" or payoff, unless you consider half-baked "holier than thou, look how intelligent I am" philosophy a payoff. Some things in the game ask you to think or look at yourself or something. Not everyone can appreciate intellectual smugness, I certainly do not, The Witness is dripping out the wang full of it.\n- Many, many puzzles are just frustrating. Do you enjoy being stumped for hours looking at a single puzzle hopeless to try and figure it out? Then in a flash of inspiration you solve it, seemingly unsure how you never saw the answer before, only to be rewarded with an even more obtuse and harder puzzle in the same vein that you have to stare at for hours? Some are so obtuse until you run around half the island to find the "tutorial" puzzle teaching you how to actually do it. Even once you have learned a puzzle rule-set, some can be just a flat-out waste of time actually pulling off.\n- Many times you can see a puzzle solution staring you right in the face, you can literally see the wang right there in front of you, but have no clue how to pull it off.\n- Some of the hardest puzzle's only reward is more puzzles, or a simple puzzle, which are by themselves are super obtuse (hard to explain without spoilers). Some could consider that good game-play design, I consider it a waste of time. I don't find partitioning of knowledge endearing, I play games to understand the rules then enact those rules towards victory with various levels of skill:success. The Witness too often feels like playing a game of chess and trying to solve a check without knowing how half the pieces move, all while Johnny Blow laughs at you on the other side of the board.\n- The whole game feels like pseudo-intellectual ♥♥♥♥♥♥y. Extremely pretentious high-minded faff, ITS FREAKIN WANG MAZE PUZZLES MANG, get over yourself sheesh.\n- In all reality, this could have been a $10 puzzle game without all the highfalutin window dressing of "an open world". The $40 ($60aud) you pay is basically for a super pretty but painfully un-interactive "open-world" with absolutely  nothing going on and very little to no story or payoff for all the work you put in. And no, I don't consider drawing wangs in the scenery to be "interaction", even if you have to position yourself *just right* to see the wang fully.\n- It almost seems designed to reign you in for over 2 hours so that by the time you realise there's :A: Nothing going on but wang puzzles :B: There is no story or point to the wang puzzles besides very minor (basically pointless) spoilers :C: The first 100 puzzles or so aren't so bad, but staring down the barrel of 4-500 more is not a fun experience... more than 2 hours has passed and you can't get your refund.\n\nSave your money, buy x-com, and maybe consider watching an LP of the best friends doing this game after the hype has died down.","February 4","false","10.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

I can see where those people are coming from but there's so much more going on here.\n\nFirst off, let's state the obvious: The visuals are gorgeous.  Like this is probably the best looking game I've ever played, it's so pretty it blows my mind.\n\nThis game will NOT hold your hand in any way shape or form.  You can accidentally end up in areas where you shouldn't be and won't have a single hope of knowing how to solve the puzzles there.  Even though the puzzle mechanic of drawing lines on a grid remains the same, the game slowly introduces new different ways that the puzzles work, but each time a new thing is added you essentially have to figure out how it works yourself with no help!  Sometimes it's obvious and other times you'll scratch your head and feel like you're about to tear out your hair before suddenly having an epiphany and feeling like an absolute genius.  I like that a lot and it adds an incredibly surprising level of depth to what some might assume would just be the same thing over and over again.\n\nIf you're looking for something fast paced with lots of action, this really isn't for you.  This game requires insane amounts of patience and persistence, getting stuck is painful but once you get your breakthrough it feels fantastic.","January 26","true","23.5"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

The puzzles themselves are vast and varied, it just so happens that you speak in Snake to answer them. Even at this point I am discovering new stuff and starting to appreciate the weightier themes of the game as I peel back the onion skin a layer further. I'm not even dismissing the audio logs as pretentious nonsense anymore. It really does all fit together. Just to give one little magic moment without spoiling anything too much. There is a statue you find of a man who is raising his hands to the sky and looks as though he is despairing. Viewed from a slightly different angle, however, his shadow aligns with stones on the ground and suddenly he looks like a guy juggling. And that's the game in a nutshell.

While the only puzzle mechanic is, more or less, about connecting lines and dots, it does this in a wide variety of ways, from special rules, mirroring lines, and more. After the first couple dozen puzzles, the environment begins to have an effect on them, whether by being part of the puzzle itself from shadows, or from outside objects changing how a puzzle needs to be solved, or preventing it from being solved until later.\n\nThe game has its flaws, though. There is no story to guide you, no outright given reason why you are here. This is a detriment to some folks, which I can understand.

Those games are on the same level in terms of difficulty and complexity, but the core philosophy behind the games is completely different.\n\nTalos is more of a Portal-like puzzle game where the mechanic of the puzzle is simple, but the solution can be incredibly complex.\n\nWitness has more of the Myst like approach. The puzzle machanic is usually hidden and your goal is to discover it. Essentially it depends on if you like this kind of games.\n\n\n--------------------------------\n* I am afraid this is another indie crap with bad puzzles\n--------------------------------\n\n* This is easily an AAA tile.\n\nThis is not an indie game, well, not your regular indie game. It was not made by a single person, and even if it was, this is not what automatically should make it a low budget indie.\nThe production quality of this game is insane. Speaking in a Myst terms, I would say I found it easily on a pair with Raven or Exile.\n\n* This is not an 'only maze puzzles' game.\n\nThere is a lot of misunderstanding about this part and trailer not really explainging it well.\nWhat I was expected initially from the Witness is a collection of small mini-games where you just need to go through the maze. This did not sound really exciting to be honest.\nEvery time dev is asked "are there only maze puzzles" the answer is always "yes, there are only maze puzzles" and I wonder why did he not take time to explain this, because this statement is incorrect.\n\n* Panels are not puzzles.\n\nPanels are not puzzles, but rather interactive interfaces in the game. They work on the similar principle, but do a lot of different stuff.\nThey activate and deactivate different machinery, open doors and move elevators, they modify game environment, etc.\nThink of them as unorthodox touchscreens or gearboxes.\n\n* Puzzles are not mazes.\n\nLet's be honest: the variety of the puzzles in the game is insane. There are logic puzzles, but there are also optical puzzles based on the effects light and shadow or color mixture, there are sound puzzles, mechanical and kinetic puzzles, puzzles based on the environment and so on.\nThere are typically three group of puzzles:\n\n* One is some sort of tutorial, where you learn the rules of the game in a seris of progressively more complex tasks.\n\n* Then there are puzzles that combine several rules at the same time.\n(They may be really confusign at fist, but it usually means that you don't have enough information or understanding of the game at this moment).\n\n* And finally there is a metagame level where you suddenly discover that established rules may work outside of their usual context if you start to think outside the box.\n\nAlmost all of the game elements are interconnected in some way, and the main goal of the game is to find those connections.\n(Which is, needless to say, insanely addictive and fun)\n\nhttps://art.penny-arcade.com/photos/i-QxgsmCF/0/1050x10000/i-QxgsmCF-1050x10000.jpg\n\n----------------\nTL;DR:\n---------------\n\nDefinitely not a game for everyone, but great nevertheless.","January 28","true","32.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I've been anticipating its release since I first heard about it and I even preordered the game.\n\nSimply put, I did not find the game enjoyable. There's probably depth to it that I didn't understand in my 30 mintues of play time, but I just got exceptionally bored playing the game. It feels like puzzles you'd find in a cheap mobile app, but this game costs $40. I might pick it up whenever it hits $5 in a sale but I just can't justify full price.\n\nThe world is very beautiful, however I couldn't find anything interactive about it. The world just seems to link together all of the mobile phone game puzzles. You also are very limited in movement: you can't jump or drop small ledges.

On the contrary, the more I play, the more I am able to understand and engage with the more difficult puzzles, some of which are truly brilliant in design.\n\nHowever, be aware that MUCH of what you do in this game will be drawing lines in a grid interface. However, so much discovery and exploration happens outside of that interface, and much of that discovery unveils new puzzle mechanics, which let you progress further into the vast and mysterious island in The Witness.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinhito/recommended/210970/","shinhito","ShinHito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinhito/","77 products in account","The Witness is a beguiling game of deceptive simplicity. You'll see a lot of criticism aimed at it from people who have only scratched the surface of the game distiling the game down to "just tracing line puzzles". While it is true a large selection of the game are maze-like puzzles where you attempt to trace one unbroken line to the end without overlapping itself, the variations on this are vast and fascinating. Whie traversing this beautifully constructed digital island you unravel the various ruleset of these puzzles with non-verbal communication. This game has a lot more in common with the Cyan Worlds games (Myst, Riven, etc.) but instead of pushing an archaic, aging button to activate a portion of a puzzle like in Myst, The Witness unifies all contraptions into a unified puzzle language which serves to thematically tie all puzzles together.\n\nBut the true beauty is in the story and narrative provided. You have to work hard in order to piece together the "story" of this place you find yourself in, but its a grand combination of philosophies from a myriad of schools of thought presented in a way that only video/computer games can provide. The story being told in The Witness isn't one of sci-fi mysticism, but instead the story presented wants you to meet it more than halfway. It wants to hear your own ideas and preceptions as much as it wants to present its own.\n\nThis is also a hard game to talk about without giving away a lot of what makes it so special, and that discovery is a large part of its genius. So $39.99 is really a cheap ticket of entry for an experience that is priceless, but I also realize that the experience isn't for everyone but it was definitely an experience I enjoyed thoroughly.","April 12","true","114.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

This is a piece of interactable art. You as a player are part of it. In 20 years of gaming very few games blew me away like this one. In some places I get a sensation like I got from the first Portal game or Antichamber. You are constantly challenged to think outside the box and the game manages to reward you for doing so in a very gentle manner...\n\nAlso compared to Portal this game is accessible to a lot more people because it does not seem to be about speed and reflexes (I am not done with it, so I cannot completely confirm this, yet).\n\nDo not watch spoiling reviews or videos. Just jump in blindly and do not underestimate the "simplicity" of the "simple mechanic". It is brilliant, beautiful, mindblowing.

The island is opening up in layers of meaning, layers of understanding. The whole island is a series of allegories layered atop one another and beckoning the curious explorer.\n\nBlow's design objective -- to model epiphany -- requires inductive reasoning of the player. This game is entirely inductive reasoning. It's the most dense use of this rare mechanic that I've ever seen presented in a game.\n\nI heartily recommend this game as an excellent use of your time.","February 17","true","14.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

If you don't like semi-difficult puzzles, you probably won't like this game, but I encourage everyone to give it a try I also recommend that you go in blind, which I understand the irony of including in a review of the game. I've done everything there is to do in the game, as far as I know, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were a few deep secrets that I missed, that will eventually be unearthed by those with more free time than myself.

On the island you do not only discover a huge amount of puzzles, but you also gain an insight into philosphy, meditation, Zen and much more. I would say it is more than just a "puzzle game" - in my eyes it is a completely new genre and very unique. Of course, some details make you remember the Myst games, e.g. the final flight sequence or a couple of sounds and animations. Although I played the game on a six-year-old laptop, the island looked great even on minimal graphics settings.\n\n"The Witness" can be very hard sometimes, but it is definitely worth a try. It took me 33 hours to finish the game on my own, even though I have not yet solved all the puzzles on the island (which is not required to finish the game). I certainly will return on the island soon to discover more.","March 14","true","40.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It first teaches you a simple\n"puzzle language", but then beyond that, it runs wild and you have to follow on your own.\n\nThe main gameplay aside, the gorgeous scenes is probably what you first notice looking\nat all the media and trailers. It definitely helps the experience, and is refreshing to look at\nbetween solving puzzles. There are also hidden audiologs throughout the world (with\namazing voice acting) which again can be soothing inbetween puzzles.\n\nThe one big complaint I do have about the game is slow animations. Anything\nthat movies is painfully slow, and I'm guessing it is to get you to enjoy the scenery,\nbut I think that's bad game design.\n\nAll in all, I truly think this game is a work of art which will remembered years\nin the future. It does so many things right and brings a lot to the genre.","March 19","true","53.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Then I went to bed.  When I woke up I found myself asking a few questions about it.\n\nFirst, did I enjoy the experience while playing it?  Yes.  I enjoy a good puzzle and this game offered plenty of them.  They varied in difficulty and strategy and combined in interesting and creative ways.  I relished the "Ah-Ha" moments of finally solving a puzzle that had been stumping you for 10 minutes.  It was a well realized and truly enjoyable experience.\n\nSecond, would I play this game again?  No.  The primary issue of this game is that once it is learned then no challenge remains.  This is hardly a unique criticism of a puzzle game as the same can be said of Myst and it is still held up as a classic, but it does degrade the overall joy the game can bring me.  I have found that the best games are ones that can be played over and over for years bringing something new each time.  Unfortunately this game can not offer that.\n\nThird, what did it all mean?  On this I am unsure.  If we are to take it at face value as a puzzle game then it holds up well for the reasons given above.  This does however raise an issue.  If the game is really about just solving puzzles then the only plot and story we are given is philosophical readings then why bother to include it those readings at all?  The Witness quickly teaches you that nothing is arbitrary.  If something is shaped in a strange or odd way, then it is a puzzle.  The game, from the onset, demonstrates that it is not haphazardly constructed and that all of the minute things that are included are deeply necessary for some reason that may not yet be clear.  It shows you that if you just dig deeper you can find the answer; you can solve the puzzle.  From this core concept of the game we must conclude that the philosophical readings have a function, a purpose, in the larger game.  Unfortunately, that is the flaw in this experience.  No plot resolution is given.  (Yes even with both endings.)  Saying "It was all a dream, or a simulation" doesn't inform the philosophy discussed.  It doesn't illuminate the goals or purpose of the people whose voices we have heard.  Who are they?  What are they doing?  Why should we care?  The game spends its entire span showing you that answers will come to those persistent and clever enough to find them.  Then it changes the rules with 10 seconds left on the clock and unfortunately declares: None of that Matters.  It wasn't real.  This is a critical mishandling of an otherwise perfect setup.  I can and have thought of literally 10 better endings since I started writing this.  Sadly this game falls woefully short in that respect.\n\nWith that said, perhaps overly harshly, I still did truly enjoy the game as I played it and I will recommend it to friends.  Unfortunately, I will be recommending it as a puzzle solving game.  Just a puzzle solving game.  This had the potential to be so much more.  There is perhaps nothing so tragic as a wasted opportunity.","May 1","true","47.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If not, it's not your game. I am surprised by some of the negative remarks.\n\nPeople say there's too much of the same puzzle. Well, you bought a puzzle game, so that's astute of you to notice. And if you think the puzzles never change, then you quit after 5 minutes. There is only one type of puzzle, but it's a deliberate choice. This game uses one basic method of interaction - find a path through a maze - and layers different rulesets on top of it. Some of the later puzzles are nothing short of meta, where your solution will end up represented in the "real world," or you will have to solve mazes on top of each other. Really, the game takes one idea and does it perfect, taking it as far as it can go. I personally dislike when games try to have "variety" but only end up doing 5,000 thing mediocre. If you want something else, buy something else and quit whining.\n\nPeople also say it's pretentious. Well, it's Jonathan Blow. What did you expect? I honestly didn't find the game itself pretentious, but the audio logs and videos you find throughout the game certainly are. But hey, you don't *have* to watch/listen to any of them, so if you dislike that kind of thing, no harm, no foul.\n\nPeople also say the ending is terrible. Well, there's no way to say this without spoilers... but you didn't actually find the ending!\n\nPeople also say it's too much money. I sympathize with that because $40 is sometimes a person's entire games budget for a month, or season, or even year. Just wait until it goes on sale. Whatever you do, DON'T pirate it. Don't be that guy. You think you're sending the message to Jonathan Blow that he needs to reduce the price, but the real message you send (and the one he got) is that he should put DRM on his next game. Don't. Just wait until a sale. I think it is worth the $40, though, so if you are able to spend that kind of cash and you like puzzle games you have no excuse.\n\nPeople also say it has no replay value. This makes sense because I never played Myst or Riven again after I beat them once. Oh wait that was sarcasm.\n\nJust buy the damn thing","February 16","true","32.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You're super lost at first, but the game teaches you what to do with this confusion which is awesome. Also, there's a meta part to the game that blew my mind when I found it, and if you play a second time through, you find things you never can't even access in the first playthrough. 10/10 Very fun, very well made, makes you think about a lot of cool stuff.","April 7","true","21.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The controls are solid although a bit touchy with a mouse, but that is coming from a person whom played it on the Playstation 4 first.   Visuals are stunning if you have the capibilty to run it at the highest graphics settings. Music although mostly non-existant is actually a plus in this game & the sounds of the game is amazing.   The lack of traditional tutorials are actually a bouns.

The lighting, materials and rendering are pure eye candy. The entire island integrates perfectly to form a continuous chain of incredibly intelligent puzzles.\n\nOn the other hand, The Witness is also one of the most boring, poorly paced and non sensical games I have ever played. The story is told through audio logs which have no consitant theme and are mostly told out of context. While the rendering is great, the envirronment itself is bland comprised mostly of generic trees, rocks, cave walls, brick walls, wood planks, etc. Almost nothing has character in this world. The vast majority of the puzzles consist of standing in front of a grid and drawing lines to separate different icons. This gets very old and repetitive.\n\nRegardless of the low entertainment value, I have to reccomend this game beacuse it is just too inteligently designed to pass up. There are a lot of great ideas here.  Everyone should witness at least the first few hours of brilliance before the repetitive bordem sets in.","March 11","true","19.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The love for these maze puzzles needs to be extensive for a player to ever complete this thing.\n\nI'm not sure I'd ever complete it even if paid to do so as I don't like those puzzle anywhere near that much.\n\nThere's a reviewer out there that said maze puzzles for 25-30+ hours should be what you should consider to play this game. That's no joke. Take it seriously. If your not sure, its likely not for you. I wasn't sure and its totally not for me.\n\nAddition: The Myst series even with its flaws and taking the worst one, are still better. Some of the puzzles are similar, such as the one in the fireplace, but many are more relaxing and more entertaining, and the puzzles are far more varied. The Witness is just interesting. Its solve the maze puzzle to see what's next or walk over there to see what's next. Myst also has a nice story and doesn't feel completely lonely.\n\nThis game also has invisible walls which for first person game that's no good. You can't fall off anything when you want to.\n\nThere's no jumping so forget that.\n\nIts all about the maze puzzles and roaming for a good amount of time. That's what you do. You better like it.\n\nThey do a good job of making the maze puzzles more interesting with the sound effect and the look. It helps make them less dull, but that's it.","January 26","false","1.6"," 117 of 238 people (49%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","49","117","238","6","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leoking/recommended/210970/","leoking","Human Error","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leoking/","212 products in account","It's pretty. It's like Myst. If you liked Myst, you will probably like this. Some of the puzzles are fun, but what were the devs thinking, making you go back and re-solve puzzles you've already solved? I cannot fathom what was going through their heads.\n\nSo, for example you have to solve a maze, draw a path through this grid so it covers all of these dots and none of those dots. Okay, good, you do that, find the solution, and then you move on to the next one, which is the same idea but harder this time. The problem is, if you fail the hard one, you then have to GO BACK to the one you just solved, erase your solution, and enter the exact same solution again. Every time. Every single time you need to retry the hard puzzle, you have to go back and erase and re-solve the one you already finished.\n\nWhat in the world could have possessed them to put such a tedious and boring mechanic in a puzzle game? It's like being forced to erase all your answers from a crossword puzzle and then write them in again, exactly the same. Over and over. Who would want to do that!?\n\nMeh. The puzzles are fine, although some of them seem to be a bit less "solve this logic problem" and more "guess what I'm thinking of", since I'm faily sure I found working solutions to a few puzzles only to have the game reject them because a different solution was expected. So then you get to go back and try to find another solution, even though you already found a perfectly good one. Maybe there was some reason why the solution that eventually worked was better than the one I initially came up with, but if so I can't work it out.\n\nAnyway. The world looks good. It would be great if it supported VR--which it doesn't. Having to go back and fill out puzzles you've already completed is a boring waste of time. If that sounds like something you're okay with, play it. But wait for it to go on sale.\n\nI don't regret buying it.

If you're looking for a game that has action, violence, and an engaging plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat, look elsewhere. If you're impatient, and if you don't want your brain to hurt, this isn't the game for you. With that being said, in the amount of time I've invested in The Witness so far, it's already one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. The game takes the basic concept of maze puzzles, and introduces new mechanics to them to make you think. It then takes those new mechanics, and gives them a little twist, to make you think even more. And then once you think you've mastered that mechanic, it mixes it with another mechanic that you've previously learned, or even a brand new one. This game is hard, and it doesn't make any attempt to hold your hand. This game is going to make you want to smash your head onto your desk, but in a good way, because you want to conquer this latest puzzle so badly.\n\nThe game has an incredible atmosphere, with gorgeous visuals and ambient sounds immersing you into this island world. There aren't any graphics settings, which is a huge bummer, but hopefully that is something that could be patched into the game. The vibrant colors of the island really pop off the screen, and the different locations throughout the game are really neat. You can also listen to some audio diaries located throughout the island, which have different quotes from all sorts of different people. This would be a great game to have a podcast on in the background. Not that the sounds are bad, they do a good enough job to keep you immersed in the game while you're playing, but it might be nice to have something else to listen to as well. The controls work great, on both a controller and a keyboard and mouse. Pick whichever one you're more comfortable with. I know a lot of people have been complaining about the $40 price tag, but from what I've played so far, it seems absolutely worth it. There are a ton of puzzles in here, and it's going to take you awhile to beat the game.\n\ntl;dr I you want something different than a complex puzzle game that keeps you on your toes with a great atmosphere, you're going to want to look elsewhere. But if you've been craving a game like The Talos Principle or Portal, you should absolutely pick this up. This game is worth the price tag, and it's going to be a long time before you forget your time in The Witness.","January 26","true","13.1"," 46 of 95 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","46","95","2","0"

There are even some solutions that require you to take screenshots and solve them outside of the game. I'm not sure about everyone, but I prefer to have all the tools to solve a game within the game itself. I'm not a fan of solutions that break immersion.\n\nIt's a shame because I would consider myself a fan of Jonathan Blow. Even with the game's faults, the environment is gorgeous with thought provoking set peices. Despite everything feeling 'dead' and 'sterile', there is a persistent sense of mystery that makes you want to explore all that the world has to offer. Every zone has a theme, every theme has a new rule, and every new rule causes you to think differently.\n\nOn paper, this sounds like a lot of fun, and I would be lying if I said I didn't have fun, but in practice this game is designed to be solved very slowly with every zone containing several mental road blocks. While I'm all for challenge in video games, it should not come at the cost of proper pacing. There are quite a few puzzles to solve and though some are genuinely clever, most involve contorting the camera to the 'exact' angle required to complete a path, look at the environment a certain way, see through a specific window, look at just the right reflection, and so on. It gets to be more awkward than enjoyable.\n\nIf you're a fan of puzzle/artsy games, I would pick this up for a 1/4 of its current price. Everyone else: Avoid.","March 13","false","11.0"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tigrath/recommended/210970/","tigrath","Tigrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tigrath/","593 products in account","Possible spoilers.  This is an exploration/puzzle game.  Knowing literally anything about the way it plays could be considered a spoiler.  If this describes how you feel about such games, read with caution.\n\nI haven't beaten it yet.  Don't know if I care to.  I'm not sure a game has made me legitimately angry at its creator before.\n\nI absolutely loved Braid.  Very clever game, premise, puzzles.  A satisfying sort of headscratcher.  I'll admit I had to look up how to get (or mainly, where to find) a few of the stars.\n\nThis...just...hum.  I liked it at first.  It has worn me down and made me regret my rare early-adoption.  Knowing what I know now, I would not have chosen to give Jon Blow $40 for it.  Sadly I have more than two hours of patience.\n\nGood:\n- Very many puzzles\n- A pretty game, with an artistic style and varying biomes and color palettes\n- A fair amount of cleverness in the way many of the puzzles (and their rules) are implemented\n\nBad:\n- Inconsistent design; the game feels like it is designed well in some ways and intentionally poorly in others\n- Default movement speed is pretty slow (running should be a toggle, not a hold)\n- Voice recorders hidden throughout the island, as well as difficult-to-solve optional puzzles, 'reward' you with philosophical preaching and quotes which feel shoehorned-in and fake-deep, rather than thought-provoking\n\nIn the areas you are likely to interact with the earliest, the experience is the smoothest.  There are sets of panels throughout the game that are clearly intended to teach you a puzzle mechanic (without explicitly telling you what it is).  The earlier-introduced mechanics or puzzle rules are, I would say, inherently easier to grasp in an intuitive manner.  The ones you find later (further from the starting point, generally speaking - village puzzles a notable exception) are much less obvious.  This is all fine on its own.  These various rules leave a lot of room for interpretation, to where your understanding of them is gradually refined based on how you solved this one, but later tried to solve another one with the same line of thinking and it just didn't work.  In many cases it amounts to "I just was looking at it the wrong way," in a figurative and/or literal sense.  That is a consistent theme throughout this game: perception.  In the beginning, it seems brilliant.\n\nThe game's design philosophy of "just look at it from a different angle" begins to work against it as you proceed in the game.  For some puzzles, the precise literal angle from which you have to look can be so obscure that I think some players may have no recourse but to look up the solution or simply never solve it.  Looking up the solution obviously ruins the whole premise and takes the fun out of it, but there have been times where I left a puzzle, came back to it, left it again, came back again, and finally had to conclude that I just was not going to see how to do it on my own.  I've seen the words "frustration tolerance" in at least one review of this game, and I've come to find that it has greatly reduced mine.\n\nThen there are design decisions that just do not make sense to me, especially given that you can tell they are conscious, intentional design decisions and not something they might explain as "that's just the way we did it."  For example, the default movement speed is an irritatingly slow walk.  I'm tired of holding down the shift key.  Another weird decision will become apparent at some point when you fail a puzzle in a series - a "series" being when a number of puzzles are either all lined up next to each other, or simply linked by wires that glow and activate the next puzzle panel (also helpfully leading you to it).  For reasons I cannot fathom, some of these puzzles will deactivate when you input an incorrect solution.  To reactivate the puzzle, you have to go back to the previous panel (wherever it is) and re-input the correct solution, which will still be lit up on the panel for you.  Then you can go back (again) to the one you just failed, and try another solution (and be prepared to walk back to the previous panel again, if you are on the wrong track).  For a game whose creator claims he wants to "trust in the intelligence of the player," I'm feeling a disturbing lack of respect for the time I'm putting into it.  While I walk back and forth between panels repeatedly, arbitrarily wasting time in penance for having the audacity to suggest -that- was the solution, I imagine I could be doing something fun.\n\nFinally, there is a distinct effort to establish, early on, clear methods of game-to-player communication.  The glowing wires from puzzle to puzzle.  The short series of easy puzzles to introduce you to a concept.  The fact that you can activate literally anything that looks like a circle with a line coming away from it.  These are all solid design choices that create a feeling of consistency.  And then, there are arbitrary decisions that erode that consistency and my confidence that I've made the correct choice in how to spend my time.  Sometimes you can finish a puzzle and follow the wire to what should be the next one, only to see it leading into some crevice, maybe coming out somewhere else that simply cannot be found.  However, these are not cases of "well you just didn't look hard enough." I walked around the whole area multiple times and finally googled it to find that there just isn't another puzzle in that series.  Then why is there a wire leading away from the last one?  What does it do?   Why should I trust anything the game communicates now?  Reminds me of how convinced I was to buy this based solely on how good Braid was.\n\nThe "story" appears to consist of what you can find in hidden-to-sort-of-hidden voice recorders.  Most of which (of the ones I've found) seem to consist of Einstein quotes.  I don't really care about that, it's not a story.  It's not what I care to hear, so I just stopped clicking on them.  It doesn't feel like a mystery, it feels like someone trying to convince you of how smart they are.  I wasn't exactly expecting a blockbuster story or anything, but it gives the whole thing an extra layer of pretentiousness and makes me even less interested in whatever the "ending" consists of.  If I'm missing out on actual story because of this, I can't help but point to the design decision of "put pretentious science-vs.-religion quotes in voice recorders" as the cause.  I might have been more receptive to that kind of message if I found something actually written for this game first.\n\nI now feel like I am having a conversation with Jonathan Blow if I play this game, where I might say, "I liked that stuff over there, but not this part.  Why is it like this?  It doesn't make sense."  And he might say, "Well, it doesn't have to make sense, and we don't have to agree.  You're obviously doing it wrong.  I'm not holding your hand.  Go put in that other puzzle solution again if you want to keep bashing your head on this."\n\nI can (and may) just stop playing it out of spite, but he's already got my money either way.","February 4","false","9.5"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

I was forcing myself through the beginning and the middle of it. Sometimes I felt frustration because of seldom rewards from puzzles. Too many of easy puzzles there and that felt like a drudge-work. Where is all the fun? The worst experience was when I solved couple of puzzles and nothing just happened. What was the point?\n\nThe end-game puzzles were really good and they gave me a feeling of hand crafted experience. But I am sure that not many of you will get to the end-game to enjoy it. End-game puzzles cannot compensate for the overall boring process of the game.\n\nThe game has ended too-indie-like (read it as no real ending at all). This game lacks the story, in fact it lacks almost everything except nice views here and there and puzzles. Sad face.\n\nThe whole island feels like a crazy big tutorial with too stretched learning experience of too many puzzles. The end-game felt like the game finally has started, but it was not long enough to compensate for boring exploration experience of the island.\n\nBut again. No mystery gets uncovered in the game. There is no plot, no story, no nothing to think about afterwards. Random philospohy felt like a sand into my eye. Too cheap, sorry.\n\nCompared to Braid it is:\na) a step back as a game\nb) a step forward in nerdiness of puzzles.","March 12","false","28.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","0"

I find them boring, tedious, and pretentiously difficult. Anyone can make difficult puzzles by working backwards from the solution, and obfuscating the steps, but it takes real design prowess to make puzzles that are fun and rewarding to solve. The Witness just mocks you constantly, and dares you to think you have a brain. I got to a point where I solved a puzzle, then it gave me the exact same puzzle again, but with the paths broken so I had to find another solution. It really just felt like a big middle finger. And I just don't want to have to sit through any more of the videos and sound bites. As soon as I had the thought, "maybe I should just use a walk through to solve all the annoying puzzles so I can see what there is to the rest of this game" then I knew it was over for me. I have zero desire to play any more. It's sad, because it's a really beautiful game and really has a Myst vibe.

Having come into this game expecting akin to Braid I was sorely disappointed. I am dissapointed, not because this game doesn't have puzzles or atmosphere, but because its a very isolating game. While figuring out the puzzles there is no background music, no overarching narrative - just the complusion to better your puzzle solving skills.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the puzzles in this game are great. The build up of the puzzle design is great. The art design is great - but it feels hollow overall. I guess I could liken this game to someone making a rubiks cube simulator with hundreds of different rubiks cubes. Is there hours of game play here - yeah - is it misleading in its purpose - no. Would I play it for hours on end - no.\n\nIn regards to the puzzles specifically, as mentioned previously I feel like they are well done, but at the same time some of them start to feel gimmicky. I can't think of a good example of this, but I feel like puzzles should be self-contained, and should not require the environment outside of the puzzle to solve.\n\nIs the witness a good puzzle game? Yes\nIs the witness a game that I would recommend? No","March 3","false","8.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

Assumptions that are wrong, or only partially true, can seem correct after having some puzzles approved, but a couple of minutes/hours later you will hit a brick wall when the game uses your false assumptions against you.\n\nI am sure this will be topped, but my biggest "aha moment" this far was discovering the true properties of black/white/colored blocks: I initially assumed that the point was to close vertical and horizontal "line of sight" between differently colored blocks with my lines, which solved a couple of puzzles, but then inexplicably stopped working. After failing to apply my theory to more and more puzzles, I started to doubt my assumptions, and understood that the point was to border off differently colored blocks in separate spaces. This was not enough, though, because I later learned (after banging my head against the wall for almost one hour) that the same color could be bordered off in multiple spaces.\n\nA corollary to this great feature is that cheating on even a single puzzle should be a surefire way of sucking the fun out of the game. If you avoid that kind of thing, my early impression is that this is a phenomenal puzzle game. It is a must-play for anyone who likes puzzle games with brain teasers, really.","January 27","true","31.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

But, in the hour that I have played it, I have been amazed at the way the game is designed, every tiny detail in this huge island is there for a reason, aand just when you think you are beginning to see a pattern, it changes. So far, it seems on par with games like Portal, though it does not seem to share the same charisma, it more than makes up for it in its puzzle design.","January 26","true","3.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It has beautiful visuals and just leaves you to its devices, which teach you how to play the game without just flat out telling you, making you feel very rewarded when you learn a new mechanic. However, The Witness starts dragging its feet the first few hours. Everything The Witness has to offer is centered around solving geometric puzzles on panels, very few of which are easy, and there's roughly about 50,000,000,000 of them. Maybe the designers didn't want the player lacking for content, or maybe they didn't want to you finish the game so quickly and just take in the world, but they went to the other extreme. There's just too much of it. You'll start to get bored, and progress will too slow coming in the game. Opening a can of soup in the world of The Witness is a 20 puzzle affair and 3 hour ordeal. As this drags on, the beatiful visuals and atmosphere will start to become meaningless, and The Witness will feel like a very large Sudoku book. Fun to play in very short burst when you're bored, but you don't go through the whole book in few sittings like you do a game. If you play this game, I'd have a walkthrough near by, take 30 seconds to solve a puzzle on your own, and if you can get it, look at that walkthrough and move on to the next one. Don't worry about feeling cheated, there's plenty of opportunity to solve puzzles on your own. But there lies the problem with this game. All there is to The Witness is these mountain of puzzles, and by the end of the game, you'll be sick of them and sick of The Witness.","April 10","false","13.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

Having said that I wasted no time putting stylus to tablet and marking out as many notes, sketches, etc as I possible could as I begun this new beast know as The Witness. After about 2 hours of play time, Blow and team deliver on clever puzzles, entirely live up to "I want the player to continue to reform their opinions as they play", and execute with an incredibly visually beautiful game. Again, after Braid I can't figure out if I'm obsessing over nothing or actually drawing conclusions from the environment which can only lead me to believe "Well then the game must be 'working'"\n\nGenuine congrats to Jonathan "The Riddler" Blow on creating (so far) a genuinely awesome, unique, challenging and rewarding experience.
