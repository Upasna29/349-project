"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baseman/recommended/267900/","baseman","Base","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baseman/","272 products in account","First off: Would I recommend this game? Yes and no.\n\nFirst thing to consider is that this is a rather old PC port of a spinoff 'experimental' title of the main Guilty Gear XX series. It's unfortunate that the more traditional Guilty Gear XX #Reload wasn't placed on steam, however, the publisher of that title for the PC either no longer exists or is not interested in selling it here. Secondly, as it's a fighting game, Guilty Gear Isuka pretty much relies entirely on a controller to play the game to any reasonable extent that it is actually fun. That isn't a problem for myself, but for many people who are 'hardcore' PC gamers and lack a compatible device, that can be a dealbreaker. Third, as mentioned earlier, this game is very 'experimental' and as a result isn't nearly as polished as much of the other games in the series.\n\nHowever, despite all these flaws, the game can still be very enjoyable, and in some ways, more enjoyable than the main series (in certain situations).\n\nGuilty Gear is a series that is famous for it's intense speed, strange characters, and technical complexity. That last one is the reason a controller is necessary; the inputs required to perform even basic combos is just way too clunky on a keyboard. Whereas slower fighting games can be casually played on a keyboard if you're really hard up for cash, Guilty Gear is simply too fast paced and complex to do without a  controller. In fact, an arcade stick is suggested for most players. While the series briefly pops into the general spotlight once in a while when a new title is released, it often fades out of the public eye for the most part soon afterwards. Despite this habit of people seemingly forgetting this series existence, there is a thriving community of players from all around the world-- surprisingly one of the most stable and best gaming communities I've ever been a part of. The community is driven by competition. Guilty Gear may be famous for it's quirkiness and speed, but in the fighting game community, what really sets it apart is how amazingly well balanced the game is. Every character can win, with enough skill; Tier listings are merely a suggestion of relative strength of a character based on how often that character wins tournaments, not whether a character is overpowered or too weak to compete; Strong system mechanics tie together interesting character mechanics into a cohesive battle system that is both intuitive and deep; And if you enjoy the game, putting in the time to get better becomes infinitely more rewarding and fun.\n\nThis is all true of nearly every Guilty Gear game, particularly the ones starting from #Reload and after. This does include Isuka, but with a grain of salt.\n\nFor Isuka, the developers attempted an idea that hadn't really be executed in a 2D fighter before: 4 player simultaneous combat. In 3D fighters this has been done many times, and there have been tag team games for ages, but this was the first time in a 2D fighter where 4 players could simultaneous duke it out. Unfortunately, these characters are carbon copies of their #Reload versions (with the exception of the first appearance of A.B.A.) and therefore were not designed to play in a 4 player environment like this. The only appreciable difference between the versions of the characters is that they have additional attacks and animations to change 'lanes' on the stage to determine who they want to attack. These attacks aren't exactly good or efficient to any extent, making them pretty useless in actual gameplay. In fact, the addition of a background lane was poorly executed itself, as seeing what's happening behind the foreground players is difficult due to the style of animation used, which executes a lot of special effects and can cover a great deal of the screen.\n\nThis isn't to say the game isn't without it's merits, however. This game makes a great party game; however, lack of internet play means you're gonna have to find some buddies to hang out and play on your PC with. The game is quite old now, however, so theoretically it should run on most laptops without much of an issue, so it's pretty portable in that respect. Free for alls can be hilarious and silly (especially if everyone chooses Potemkin), and 2v2's can be intense and produce surprisingly awesome combos and mixups. 1v1 feels wonky because the addition of the background lane and the turn button is clunky when there's only one person to focus on; it's unfortunate that a regular 1v1 mode like #Reload was not included. Another addition was the Robo Ky Mk. II, which is a second edition of Robo Ky that is highly customizable, allowing you to equip practically any special move that any character in the game possesses. The animations for this are often hilarious and absurd, such as pulling out a gigant electrified fly swatter for Anji's command grab attack, or a giant frying pan for Zappa's Raou Bellow's Malice super, and flinging bacon at the enemy. You could level up and earn points to purchase these moves and stat bonuses from the games 'GG Mode', which is essentially an adaptation of the normal system inside a beat'em up like stage. The better you perform (higher damage/longer combos, not getting hit, etc.) grant more points and even unlock special things like Kakusei Sol and Kakusei Ky, which are incredibly broken and fun characters. The enemies for the GG Mode are not full characters at all-- most have a total of three attacks, however, they too are unlockable. For the arcade mode-- which is probably incorrectly named, considering it's much more like a survival mode, you can play through 50 levels at a time of increasingly difficult battles. You can play with a friend or alone, and every 50 levels you can increase to the next 50 levels, which culminates at 1000 levels of gameplay. This may sound like a walk in the park, however, the opponents get incredibly difficult, and the final boss for every 50 levels is a 'Gear' named Leopaldon. He's big, mean, and has super armor and autoblocks, making him quite difficult to beat. Unlocking Kakusei Sol and Kakusei Ky are very difficult but eventually become your best bet for combatting the level 1000 monster of a boss.\n\nThe game suffers from a lack of foresight, however. Several characters fail to function properly (Zappa and his Dog summon, Eddie and Little Eddie-- the summons only attack in the direction the main character is attacking, which severely limits the functionality they presented in #Reload. e), and you sort of have to trick the button configuration to set the Dust and Turn buttons to single button inputs instead of multiple button presses-- which there are multiple of in Guilty Gear anyways. The attacks for the characters weren't modified to better suit fighting multiple opponents, even when it seems appropriate, and attacking teammates makes them 'get hurt', although they take no damage, but can easily lead to them taking damage from opponents. This is likely why they added a background lane for the second pair of characters, but it's a lazy solution that could have been avoided by thinking a little harder about the concept. As a result, the game can be... frustrating, at times. Moreso than simply losing in a normal fighting game, because you may lose because your character simply doesn't function properly, or because your teammate hit you. It's an unfortunate departure from the usual level of quality we often see for Guilty Gear (and indeed, any games from Arc System Works in general).\n\nThis is all well and good, but is the game fun? Is it worth your money? Potentially. If you're looking for something you can play with your friends, or to see if you might enjoy the Guilty Gear series, this isn't a terrible option-- not the best, but it's not completely awful either. Maybe buy it to see if you like the style and playstyle, then buy one of the other games (Preferrably Guilty Gear XX Accent Core + on ps3 or xbox 360, or Guilty Gear XRD coming 2014).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberangel573/recommended/267900/","cyberangel573","Cyber Angel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberangel573/","352 products in account","I blindly bought this because it was Guilty Gear, and I was starving for either Guilty Gear or BlazBlue to come to Steam.  Little did I know that this was the four-player all-at-once Guilty Gear.\n\nThe first problem is that this seems like what is called a Lazy Port.  This is a port where very little in terms of changes are made.  This is shown in the Configuration Menu that you must visit in the game's folder before you can play in order to configure your controller to that of a PS2 Controller, plus the fact that the copyright on the Title Screen is 2004.  There is no in-game option to exit the game, which exists in EVERY PC GAME EVER!\n\nSpeaking of the Config Menu, you MUST visit this in order to play.  For same reason, I was getting some error concerning Direct 3D and some gibberish.  All I could conclude was that I had to play in Window Mode, which I don't like to do.  And the fact that I cannot use the full screen options on this game with a brand new computer furthers my theory about this port.  My system is just too new for this game to handle.\n\nTo make matters worse is the game itself.  When set aside the rest of the Guilty Gear games, this one seems like the odd one out.  Performing moves became very confusing due to the turning mechanic.  You don't turn automatically when you press left or right.  You have to press a button to tirgger it.  This is made harder in the Arcade Mode when, in the middle of a battle, once you somehow reach Survival Level 20, you  instantly encounter two opponents who want to kill solely you, and they have just as much health as you.  They do not have less health or do less damage.  It's just a two on one and there's nothing you can really do except either improve with this broken system or to continue and hope that your next set of opponents, which will shuffle even on continues, will not be as brutal.\n\nIf you are looking for the Guilty Gear experience, look elsewhere.  This isn't the game you're looking for.  Don't be suckered in like I was.  Pass it by and look for a better fighting game.","January 16, 2014","false","0.3"," 204 of 302 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","204","302","0","3"

On one hand, Guilty Gear will always be a great fighting game even with a few detriments, and the soundtrack is arguably worth the price alone. On the other, besides the unique soundtrack, this particular version of Guilty Gear is pretty much pointless to have now that there are others on Steam. It's really just Guilty Gear, with a more novel than truly enjoyable four-player gimmick (that I will admit I never played with four people) that's bogged down by a flawed (though necessary) change, namely the need to press a button to turn around. There is a beat-'em-up styled mode along with it, but again, it feels more novel than fun, never really feeling fleshed out to something good. Even the new characters aren't worth it alone, with A.B.A. being in a standard Guilty Gear game now, and Robo Ky Mk. 2 feeling more like a gimmick than a character. The included soundtrack isn't even the full one, missing songs like A.B.A.'s theme (which is my favorite track, so that's a downer). I just can't recommend it unless you really want all the Guilty Gears on Steam, you don't mind an incomplete soundtrack, and it's on a decent sale. Otherwise, go with one of the X2s that are available, or Xrd -SIGN- now that it's here too.","November 13, 2015","false","3.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","3"

The resolution is TINY which I could forgive; I forgive tiny resolutions all the time, but there's so much else wrong with this port that it's just ♥♥♥♥ sprinkles on my turd cake. There doesn't seem to be any native controller support which is pretty important for fighting games in general, unless you hate yourself. I do not, so it's a well-missed feature. Once I figured out how to navigate menus (which I normally wouldn't have had trouble with, except the select button can sometimes change from menu to menu), lo and behold the button icons were still the PS2 symbols. So I'm thinking "Alright, I'll just quit out real quick and look up a fix or something. Where's the quit button?" So I search for a solid five minutes thinking they hid it somewhere. There was no quit button. Pressing escape quits the game out immediately. This, again, by itself wouldn't be a huge deal; kinda sloppy, but not huge, except it does it no matter where you are or what you're doing. In a fight and just want to pause? Don't press escape. Finger slips? Don't press escape. Cat jumps up on the keyboard? YOU BETTER HOPE THAT CAT'S ♥♥♥ DOESN'T END UP ON ESCAPE OR YOUR MATCH IS OVER. DRAW.

You pick a character, you customize it and then you enter a tournament. But for some reason this game seems endless as opposed to a plot driven script as in Guilty Gear X2 Reload. There are lots of character challenges and lots of opportunity to level up your characters. Although the play can get confusing if your on the screen with mutiple people. Be aware that the character does not automatically change the way it's facing on the screen depending on what side you are on. You have to click the shoulder buttons in order make them face the way you are on the screen. I guess its strategy really.\n\nI do love arcade games and publishers love for PC ports. Especially when it's hard to track down a physicial copy before. At least its a worldwide release (So I seen) and everyone can enjoy the game.

Those who complain about the button stance switching mechanic... all I can say is learn to play.  I can understand being used to the auto locking of other fighting games, but if you take the time to realize when you need to switch stance, it becomes natural and almost automatic for you.\n\nBack to the review of the actual game; rocking soundtrack, fast and crazy gameplay, and more than 2 players in a match at the same time.  Calling this a party fighter would be misleading though.  This IS a fighting game; it is not easy to pick up, and you will be trashed by those who know what they are doing.  All the core mechanics of a fighting game are here.  With that being said, it is a great game to play with friends.\n\nUpdates have made the configuration tool a bit more obvious, so controller configuration is easier than it was.\n\nWould really like to see other GG titles make their way to Steam!","February 13, 2014","true","13.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

But originality does not equal quality. See, this whole 4-players idea sound fun and stuff but when you actually try to play Isuka some flaws get on the way of fun. The main problem is the new control system. Using the button to turn you character left and right during fast-paced combat is not very convenient. Changing of arenas' planes during fights also gets on the way of precision. Controls get even worse in Boost mode, where game turns into beat'em-up. But even with these flaws it is still Guilty Gear. And it is still fun to play, alone or with friends. The music rocks, sprites are beautiful as ever and overall variety of characters gets the work done. It's a solid fighting game but not the best in the series.","June 21, 2014","true","1.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Rather, it's not the game that's the problem; it's the port work.\n\nBUYER BEWARE\n\nIf you think you're getting yourself an excellent copy of Guilty Gear Isuk a, you're sadly mistaken. This game is contrived in ways which are generally considered unacceptable in PC gaming. For starters, if you have a beefy system, don't expect to run this game in Full-Screen, as it has large compatibility issues with newer hardware. It'll simply give you an error which is utterly unintelligible garbage, so that's no help, either.\n\nAlso, you're going to have to work to get your controller to work properly with the game. For every player you want to join in on the fight. This game uses an archaic system which makes support for a lot of controllers unfriendly, though X-Input seems to work fairly well, However, layer onto this the fact that the game has an arbitrary 'change of facing' button, and no matter what controller you use you'll never quite find a setup that this mechanic doesn't ruin. That's right, you've got to press a button to change which direction your character is facing, and that is nonsense.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's worth noting that this is the 4-Player simultaneous beat-'em-up entry, not the 1-on-1 Guilty Gear that the series is generally known for, so that might turn you off of it as well. This game is also only local multiplayer; there is no online component whatsoever.\n\nIf that doesn't all sound terrible to you, then buy away, but otherwise, you'd best beware what you're spending your money on.","May 20, 2014","true","0.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Actually they went even further adding a side-scrolling beat them up mode... like I said before, they totally stripped any "Guilty Gear" from this title.\n\nThat said, with much pain you can still get a "normal" arcade mode (1vs1) but there's a curse on that: the turn button. Your character won't turn himself to face the opponent but instead you will turn it when you feel like you feel the need. This is A LOT confusing at start but once you master it allows a few smart tricks you won't be able to do with auto-turn. Still it's definitely totally useless.\nFinally a few words about the last boss, remember I-NO from Guity Gear XX? Forget it, you will hit a giant brick in Guilty Gear Isuka, enjoy.\n\nGraphic, as I wrote before, is a little worse than Guilty Gear XX, I mean, visuals are actually better, but since there's a lot of scaling involved, they get worse.\nMusic instead is good, I liked it more than Guilty Gear XX #Reload in general, I'd say it was because there's a bit of experimentation and less strict 80s power metal (still metal though).\n\nFinally, on this there's no netplay, nor official nor fan made, no one actually cared much about this game. The only reasons you may want to play this game are: playing the new character A.B.A. (which I don't like much actually) and listening to the new tunes that are really good.\nSo, if you like side-scrolling fighting games like double dragon or such, buy this game and enjoy side-scrolling fighting with Guilty Gear characters, otherwise just buy the soundtrack somewhere and listen to it.","November 3, 2014","false","4.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","4"

There is no balance, no saving grace in this games fighting system....Outside of the 'Burst' mode.\n\nAhh yes, Burst mode should be the ONLY reason why anyone gets this game, as it turns the GG series into pretty much 'Streets of Rage' styled sidescroller, using anyone you want, or a custom Robo-Ky you can customize with movesets from everyone else in the game.

It's kinda slow on computers, (even some quad-core computers like mine) and I don't know why. If you are fortunate to have a copy on the PlayStation 2, then that's good news, because that way, it RUNS MORE SMOOTHLY!\nAnd for effort, Guilty Gear Isuka is definitely not a bad deal, for a game that costs $9.99, on Steam. If you can't afford a PlayStation 2 or Xbox, and you want to play this game badly, then you may be my guest, and feel free to check out this version! I give this PC port the 7.5/10 rating, saying that it's not perfect, but it is fun, and it's honesty better, than those old, non-canon, abandonware installments of Mega Man for DOS, which had unconvincing graphics, storyline, and designs.\n("Help me Dr. Light; they made me look ugly and fat, and I can barely defend myself, now!" *LOL* That was a parody line that I made up, based on them!)\nTo describe it, Guilty Gear Isuka is much like the other games in the Guilty Gear series, only up to 4 players can join in a fight, at once; it's quite an interesting party-style fighter! And it's even got a "beat-em-up" style mode, where most of the minor enemies are generic "lackey" types.

Pick it up in a bundle or on a seasonal sale. If you wanted Guilty Gear like I did and just buy the first one you see on Steam you will be dissapointed. (I bought this the day it came out long before any of the others released.) The game doesn't auto switch when your oppenents cross sides, this is because of the experimental (and at the time, the very first) 4-player ability. The lanes are a nightmare, the button combos to use them are hard to remember and harder to use. Get ready to hit the direction switching button more than any of the others combined. Atop that, at all times the life bars are in sets of four and not two. So play Single Player and your health bar is ten percent of the length of the screen. Then the two playerless bars just flash "Insert Coin". Don't get me wrong, I want every single last thing exactly as the original was but is sucks hard living with that health bar. You will never know how much damage you've dealt unless you're the one getting it dealt to.

Worst Guilty Gear title delivered with an awful port.\n\nThe new method for turning the character is just ridiculous, you have to set up a button on your controller for it. In 1v1 matches it can be handled with a lot of pacience, but in 1v2, 1v3 or 1v4 matches all you can get is the desire to exit the game and uninstall it. I also found the characters to be unbalanced in skills, speed and range, and a stupid glitch where you or the AI gets stuck being unable to hit.\n\nThere is no option to exit the game at all, not even mentioning that you can't leave the Arcade or Versus mode once started, or at least to switch between them somehow. By pressing ESC at any point in the game - you just get the process killed. All this stuff combined eliminated for me any chanse to enjoy Guilty Gear Isuka.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vangald/recommended/267900/","Vangald","Vangald","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vangald/","1613 products in account","This is a bad port. And here is why.\n\nSound\nHalf the games sound track sounds like some one is playing it on a small radio in another room and dunking it in and out of a tub of water. Other tracks are just fine and yet others are especially quiet. For a Guilty Gear game with such a fantastic soundtrack this is very irritating.\n\nController Support\nController support has been rather hit and miss even for console controller which have become a pretty well supported on the PC platform or who serve as a relatively large demographic of user's with controllers. This is is if you use the in game menu's. You can have more success configuration tool but there isn't a lot of info there that helps you recognize one button from another if you are used to the console version of the game. The button inputs are mearly labeled as the button and a number. This can make mapping without hunting down a guide on the internet very annoying and very trial and error. For a fighting game this shouldn't even be an issue.\n\nBig Picture\nIf you are a controller user you probably also use Big Picture Mode. Guilty Gear Isuka's external configuration tool is a bad habit for anyone who is develeping a game with controller support (or any game for that matter). External launcher's that don't accept controller input need to go. Further frustration is the fact that you have to hit escape to exit the game. The game never tells you this. If you are playing on PC without a controller you would likely stumble across this easliy enough but that is still a big no no in game design whether you are porting or not.\n\nAside From Being A Port\nThat game is little more than a port and as such has the problems that plagued Guilty Gear Isuka to begin with. The plane switching from the four player combat will no doubt be an issue for some as it can be rather difficult to come to grips with unless you were a hardcore Fatal Fury fan. And know that the AI is setup to exploit that very system to its full potential. Also this is one of the Guilty Gear games that has button turning. That meaning that in order to face left or right you have to actually hit a button to do so. More than this some of the character moves will only work in one direction even if you are oriented correctly to the enemy. This can be very frustrating and a down right deal breaker for those who remember the original Guilty Gear on the PS2.\n\nVerdict\nI would avoid buying this at full price if at all. There are far better ports and far better fighters built specifically for PC on steam that you can spend your money on.","May 19, 2014","false","3.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I was a fool. I thought that they'd have updated the game for PC, but they didn't, they ported it... and ported it badly.\n\n- Controls: No way to re-bind the basic controls. You can re-bind "in-game" controls, but no possibility to re-bind things for the menus, and it seems that my controller (official microsoft one) thinks B or Right-Stick Click is Start, Back is Jump, X is back, and other oddities. Went into Burst Mode, and the default button to jump wasn't clear... but it was Back.\n\n- No Resolution Options. This is the real biggie... you can't change resolution. It launches, looks really badly with graphic "fragmentation" (can't remember the real word for it), and you can't change that. Going into matches looks horrible in the resolution they have it set to, so it looks worse than it did on the Playstation.\n\n- No way to exit the game. Really? Really? I had to alt+f4 out of the game because there was no exit game option on the menu.\n\nIn effect they have done NOTHING to this game aside from pull it onto the PC and make sure it runs. No updates to make it worth buying for the PC. Save your money, buy a PS2, and get all the other GG games on a console.

Everything is difficult, menu is unstable and there is no exit game - button.. Also i get crashes if i press weird buttons, for example pressing b and p on default key settings with keyboard makes the game crash, not respond and exit.\n\nDon't buy, wait for a better one.

Maybe the fact that I've never played a Guilty Gear game before (at least not in a serious manner) is what made this game a satisfying experience for me.\n\nYes, at first the 4 at once gameplay is hard to get used to, but once you do it's pretty fun! This game, IMHO, beats Tekken and MK. I love this game's combos.\n\nI just hope they'll bring the other GG games to steam!","June 30, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
