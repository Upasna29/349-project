Worth $2-3 for an evening distraction if you find it on sale, but it's nothing more than that. I finished the game in about 4 hours total (left it running through the day on accident, thus the extra hours on my record).\n\nThere's nothing open ended to the game, it's all about finding the exact right string of commands to get to the next part of the story. Guessing passwords is a 50/50 split, either it's completely handed to you or you're left with almost no clue.\n\nIf you really want a fantasy hacker game, look up Uplink instead.","July 14, 2015","false","22.2"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","40","53","5","0"

Well, I don't play them often but when Hack RUN was announced, I was intrigued, so, I buy it. And I bought also ZERO.\n\nI've finally decided to play it after finishing Hack RUN and I knew where I would land.  Flashy green on a black screen with commands only to type and nothing else around. And like the previous game, the big negative point is the lack of music. The only sound is the sound of your keyboard (and... I'm letting you discover it).\n\nLike for Hack RUN, you're staying in the game for 2 main reasons:\n- You want to know the story\n- These achievements unlocking each time you're hacking, or receiving, or... in other words, it can be a quick release of achievements.\n\nBecause, let's be honest: typing always the same thing because the piece of information you need is always in an email isn't really captivating. Well, thanks god, there is at least 5% of the game that aren't about typing m and e.\n\nAnd yet, if typing the same thing is boring, trying to find passwords, or usernames, or any clue that can help you is very very enjoyable. And be aware of something: the game is more sneaky for the password, even relying on your knowledge of muscle cars, classical composers or any name that could fit a dog (still puzzled how that password can be found). But the best here is the inclusion of voicemails... if you're used to English. Else, it will be perhaps a little harder for you.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm waiting for the third game to come so that. After zo-\n\n-----press any key to continue----\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCONGRATULATIONS, YOU ADVANCED TO LEVEL X - YOU SUCCESFULLY INTERRUPTED VIC'S REVIEW\n\n(I'm not going to reveal here the big twist but 10/10 for the game by the way)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","October 10, 2015","true","5.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

The audio cue definitely played a good part to the game as it got my heart racing, fearing that I would die haha.\n\nLike before, the puzzles get tougher and tougher.\nThere were several instances where I thought I broke the game, but turns out I (the character) was infected. Nice twist!\nOverall, a good time killer :)","September 23, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These guys made an effort to improve the game and took off passwords that did not make any sense, which I believe was the main turn off in the last game. You get to hack outside the work terminal, which is also a plus. If guessing passwords is your thing then this game is for you.","November 5, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
