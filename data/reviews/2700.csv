Yes there are people out there who love to just line up all the peeps into the main area, and just blast them to smitherines. This is fun yes, but this is the playstyle that would lead to reviews of "not having any replay-ability". This is just based on how that person played the game, ignore it, and move on. If you have patience, and a good creativity, make a campain world, and you can prosper. There is sandbox (even for those that are creative it is an amazing outlet) which is like any game's creative mode, allowing infinite building. This has been one of my top five games for most of my life, and will most likely remain there.\nGraphics 7/10- While the look of most things is amazing, closer up you can almost taste 2006, but that aside the gameplay it-self is amazing (I personally have not looked into it, but I'm quite sure someone out there made a texture pack or twenty)\nGameplay 10/10- It allows many stories to be played, and can take quite a while (My current time from steam is flawed, I actually have had this game since 2009, and have logged at least 200 hours)\nReplayability 9/10- as I said, the game is indeed boring for those without patience or creativity, and I tend to lack in patience, this is my own personal opinion (From any official opinion, I would easily give it a 10/10)\nOverall 9.5/10 Amazing game, and a texture pack would put the icing on the cake\n\n*Note*\nFor those of you that are the crash and burn kinda people, just letting you know, the peeps are indestructable, believe me I tried VERY hard (Crushing, drowning, melting, more crushing, smashing, throwing, dropping, etc.)\n\nAll in all I hope that based on your personal experiences with you own past gaming, you can enjoy this game as well.

You are put in charge of a your own theme parks which you must expand to bring more customers and money to them.\n\nPros: You have a large variety of rollercoasters, rides, kiosks and themed decorations to lay, often more than you'll be able to cram in a single map. You manage the finance by determining costs for rides, food and souvenirs, balancing against running costs, staff wages other expenses including research which allow you to access even more rides and objects for your park. You start your career with a short selection of maps and a few pre-made rollercoaster designs, and unlock more as you achieve goals in each locations. The Soaked! and Wild! expansions adds even more locations, rides and stalls, you can play the same map over and over yet build different parks every time! Many rides allow themed-customization as well, from color scheme to cart-style or train-length. Micromanagement can also be as deep as you want it: you can go as far as choosing how much pickles a specific burger stand puts in its 1/4-pounder, or don't bother with it, it's up to you.\n\nCons: The graphics are bad when zoomed in, from character designs to fixed-shadows under moving objects, graphical glitches including bad character animations or placement on rides. You can barely hear the music from your rides unless you're zoomed in almost all the way. Building rides has flaws, too: buying a pre-made rollercoaster design never explains why a location wouldn't work or what can be done to the landscape to make it fit, while other times the entire ride will get elevated multiple stories due to a single tile that's 1 pixel higher than the others. As the first game of the series to drop the genre's usual fix-isometric view for a 3D-engline, the camera controls can be extremely clunky, while the vertical angle resets every time you're trying to change it.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nIf you like tycoon games, you're likely to enjoy this one. I could write a review 10 times as long and still have more to say about this game, so in a nutshell: perfect example of a tycoon game done right, with huge variety, good flexibility and excellent replayabiliy. I look forward to the final version of RollerCoaster Tycoon World, the next entry in the franchise!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 21","true","29.2"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","40","43","0","2"

It has something for all gamers, whether you want to be upstuck and businesslike making the pinnicale of rollercoaster cash cows, or mess around and torture the peeps by trapping them all in your park without food, drink, washrooms, or evilest of all.... no sun cream. There's also the inbetween of making some kicking coasters and what not. Now the game is damn old by now, but still shows the care and precision put into the game. but who cares about graphics...\n\n*One overlooked feature is the simplicity of  the savefiles on the computer, so shareing saved coasters and parks is wicked easy, just a matter of dropping the file into the right folder.\n\nover all, buy it, you probably will not regret it. It was worth $20 when released, and in all honesty, hasnt depreciated much. The fact that it is available on steam allows for it to be even easier to play and use, with no need to use the disc, although I have noticed that the load times are somewhat longer without the disc.\n\nPS.

My middle school years were pretty much defined by the original RCT and its expansion packs, which I spent hours on end playing and enjoying. When I first heard of RCT3, I had heard it was cack. Horrible bugs, horrible problems, not fun at all. They fixed some problems with it but it was still not highly regarded.\n\nNow that I have it and have played it, I can say without a doubt that it's relatively fun. It does some very cool new things but also takes away a few things that made the originals fun. Path making is a tiny bit irritating especially trying to make slopes at first, but you get used to it. There are a multitude of new coaster designs and the building tools for those are roughly the same with a new "autocomplete" button that really isn't worth using. Scenarios appear to be absurd and not as interesting as the old RCT scenarios. The sandbox mode is a neat addition (we had to use trainers back in the day to play around with unlimited money!), and there is LOADS of customization that can be done. The fireworks shows are neat and the additional water/safari themes are nice too. CoasterCam is an addition everyone had wanted for the series (although NoLimits lets you import tracks from RCT1/2) and it works well.\n\nUltimately, this game has some minor flaws, but the level of customization and the new features more than make up for it and make it a worthwhile purchase even for long time RCT fans.","December 26, 2013","true","6.2"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

Heck, even if you get tired after career mode, the godly sandbox - and other build options too - will keep you playing like as if it's you trying to perfect your own model railway; except for the fact that there will be a phallic-shaped pool.\n\nYet, above all, the game engine is old. I mean it - Nerd³ (a YouTuber I adore) had to stop building his park due to the game just being unstable and slow; even his rig blew the specs for this game out of the water! But then his park was full of crap here and there. It just makes me hope that RCT4 exploits modern hardware for full potential...if Atari even TRIES to make the game good. Okay, quasi-tangent over.\n\nAll in all, RCT3: Platinum's seemingly never-ending torrent of content has kept me going for some time (nearly 60 hours, to be exact), despite showing it's age.

This third installment of the game was made by Atari with the intention to attract all ages and genders, so the game looks slightly childish in my opinion. But make no mistake - this simulation is so rich it would make your head explode.\n\nThe game features an incredible level of depth to the simulation, almost unparallaled. It allows you to control if/how much toppings you put in each beverage sold in one of the dozens of stalls. It includes cheap terrain modification (and spray paint) and many differently themed decorations and buildings. It has a scheduled fireworks simulator with a built in looper (and the cost is per single firework). Each sim in the park has a wallet, a set of hands to hold on to stuff, a set of bars for hunger/thirst/nausea and ride preferences. You will, at some point, be required to address the career ambitions of Animal Keeper 17.\n\nAnd there's the rollercoaster simulator. Many dozens of real rollercoasters where the ride excitement is a factor of the speed, drops, g forces and more. A beatutifully complex and simple interface. I grew up playing the prequels and I was surprised every ride and rollercoaster I knew from the game was a real thing somewhere. RCT2 had missions in Six Flags parks and other famous parks around the world. This one instead has many creative scenarios where you start with a crazy looking old town or a huge garden that show you what this game has to offer if you decide to go sandbox.\n\nWhich is probably the point of this game - it's like building models more than anything.\n\nDownsides are the low difficulty in this installment. If you are completing the missions you don't really need to use the many features of this game. I would give my Peeps a food stall only after three or four months. There's no benefit to tampering with the food and items you sell (the ride control boxes are awesome to tinker with).\n\nBuy it on sale for sure.","January 2, 2015","true","118.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","20","21","4","1"

I used to beat the crap out of the game disc on my first laptop, so you can easily add 80 hours to the playtime.\n\nWell, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is now an aging beast. The game originally released in 2004, and that unfortunally shows. While graphics isn't the main or even secondary reason you would like to play this game, there are some now hard to forgive kinks in that department like the lack of native 1080p support. There are of course workarounds to this, but then again, it's hard to blame a game from before widescreens became common to have widescreen support.\n\nSo, what about the game itself? Well, it's really as solid as you would expect the sequel to RCT2 would be.  While the iconic, isometric pixel art of the first two games have been replaced with 3D, it really looks good for its age. There is content enough in the game to keep you sucked in for a long, long time, plenty of RollerCoaster types and designs to keep you interested and best of all, the people in the park aren't as timid as they were in the first two games, allowing you to build more extreme rides without it having a negative impact on your play.\n\nSo, why would you buy this? Honestly, Nostalgia is the main reason. But it does this very, very well and I still return to it ten years later.","February 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

It's the RCT you know and love only in 3D with rideable rides, loads of new coasters and buildings and in this version the ability to make water parks and zoo's in your park. But is it worth the price of admission?\n\nTL;DR This game has more than enough content to make it worth 20$ with zoo's, water parks, new rides, buildings and 39 scenario's each with 3 levels of challenge and goals. Ride your own rides, build your own peeps, heck there's even mod's for this game. If your thinking about getting this game, BUT IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!\n\nA lot of people will look at this game and it's age... yes it was released in 2006 and is 8 years old, than they look at the price which is a steep 20$ and freak out saying not worth it and to expensive. However those people are wrong and here's why.\n\nYou are paying 20$ for RCT 3 base game which is loaded with features like sandbox mode, coaster, building, and peep designer as well as a massive campaign with 18 scenario's each with a different theme and 3 levels of challenege from beginer all the way to tycoon.\n\nThan the Soaked! pack comes with 9 scenario's with the same 3 level challenge teir and the Wild! back has 12 Scenario's... again with the challeneges.\n\nSoaked and Wild also come with new rides, buildings and attractions like, well a water slides, pools and zoo's but also rides that arn't necessarily linked to a zoo theme. You can also use all that comes with the packs in any mode, so if your playing the base campain you can put in a zoo and pool.\n\ndon't like campaigns?

The expansion which add a tremendous amount of content to the game. RCT3 is at its core, a management game. You build and run a theme park the way you see fit, byt placing rides, attractions, booths, and more, to attract customers, and at the end, collecting their hard earned money to keep the park going, and to pay your employees their hard earned money. Obstacles will come in the form of rides breaking down, unhappy patrons or employees, and more problems to solve. And there are 2 ways to play this game: Full on simulation mode, where money matters, or a full on sandbox mode, where you can pretty much spend as much as you want, and get away with anything. There are as well, fun little scenarios to play to get you used to the games mechanics, which start off as tutorials, and end up being challenges to help you unlock stuff.\n\nFor anyone who has played RCT1 and 2, this game strays from the earlier isometric visuals of the first 2, and comes back with full 3D visuals, which this time around actually let you ride the park rides in 1st person. Everything looks pretty damn gorgeous, except for a few visual hiccups, like when messing with terrain, or the extremely aged and ugly looking patrons. Everything else looks damn fine though for a game this old. The expansions will take your vanilla park, and add a water park features, as well as a wildlife park, complete with various animals to use as attractions for the patrons.\n\nThis title is pretty easy to get into, even for people new to management games. Also a blast to play for veterans.","November 18, 2012","true","47.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

I hated it. This is after hundreds (thousands?) of hours combined in RCT1 and 2.\n11 years later I decided to give it another try and picked it up on Steam and gave it a fair shot. I can honestly say that it is a very good game and it does live up to being a RCT. There is so much variety in this game. You can customize each shop to sell what you want. You can build dozens of different thrill rides, roller coasters, gentle rides, etc. The graphics are ageless and will look good no matter what year you play in.\n\nHowever, there are 2 rather large issues that I have a hard time getting over. Hotkeys and the UI. These two areas were perfect in 1 and 2. For whatever reason, RCT3 does not have adequate hotkeys. For example, you can't press a key and open up Finances, rides, guests, staff, etc, like you could in 1+2. You have to move the mouse over to a very small circluar button and click it. To leave that menu, you have to click an (X) button on the menu that is literally only a few pixels wide. In the previous games, you could press Backspace to get out of the menu. Prepare for some precision clicking in this game.\n\nIf the developers just leaved those two things exactly how they were from before, this game would be very close to being perfect. It's so tedious having to click tiny buttons. Here's hoping that RCT:World will be a great game.","January 3","true","17.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Even the graphics aren't bad.\n\nBeing a fan of rollercoasters and parks, it sure is a game for me.\nThe scenarios are great, but let's be honest, we all play that kind of game for the sandbox. Being able to create your own thing as you wish, without having to care about managing anything.\nAnd in this game, there are really a lot of options. You can create so many things. Especially with both expansion packs included. You can create your park, put whatever you want in it, the rides you wish, make your own rollercoasters, make pools with slides, create buildings, make fireworks shows or even lasers shows, shape landscape, put waterfalls, billboards with personalized images, make a mini-zoo.... So many things. And not only can you create all that stuff, see people in the park enjoying it, get info about it (like speed of rides, g-force, etc), but you can even ride everything (slides, rollercoasters, rides)...\nYou can create your own park the way you wish, and then you can even experience it.\n\nAnd if you forget about the sandbox mode a bit, there's still plenty of time to spend on the scenarios, the rollercoaster builder if you wish to only create a rollercoaster... And also something pretty neat about the game, you can put your own music in the game.\nAlso, there are quite a few mods that you can find and which are pretty great, even though there is no centralized place for that.\n\nUnless you don't like theme parks or rollercoasters or creating stuff, there is no reason not to like this game.\nAll I could see missing to it is better textures and easier modding so we could get a lot of awesome community-created content.","April 20, 2014","true","25.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

RC3 has updated graphics, but it would have been amazing to see a more "serious" and "realistic" look rather than the "cartoonish" environment. I do thoroughly enjoy the "on ride" first person camera view, it makes you able to experience your park first hand. The rides overall are pretty cool but again I would have liked to see a more realistic detail. What RC3 did get right was the mechanics. They are terrific, taking ideas from RC2 and making them even better. Budgeting is as fun and challenging as ever, and some scenarios worth exploring. I do enjoy RC3, there is also loads of content available online including fully made parks. I do have a little more love overall for RC1, only due to the originality and extreme customization and modding. I would absolutely love to see another Rollercoaster Tycoon, they are truly fun and addicting.","January 11","true","17.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But, while I fully recommend purchasing this game if  you're a fan of theme parks, don't go in expecting RCT 1 or 2.\n\nThis game has a completely different feel than you may remember from the first couple games. The first game had a charm that was all it's own, and with this third installment it's mostly function over form. That being said, the function is a hell of a thing.\n\nThings you can do in this game that you couldn't do in the first two:\n- ride your rides / explore your parks in a 3D environment\n- build water park / zoo type attractions (complete with their own sets of custom controls)\n- create themed night time shows set to your own music, using fireworks, lasers, and water cannons (i saw someone online creating scenes from Disney's World of Color ... damn.)\n- import custom graphics using billboards and tiles (with some tinkering, if you're using a newer OS.)\n\nAnd since this game has been around for a while, there's also a huge wealth of custom scenery / rides / ride vehiceles / etc. online at your disposal, to help you create literally whatever kind of ride / show / theme park you can think of.\n\nI've played other theme park sims that have come and gone since this one and while, yes, the graphics and are a little dated and, yes, you will need to spend some time grinding through all the tutorials and knocking out the scenarios before you get pro enough for sand box mode, I still maintain that this game is still THE best theme park sim out there to really let your imagination run wild.\n\n(That is, perhaps, until Theme Park Studios is released in 2014.)","December 18, 2010","true","552.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have over 150 something hours on this baby.\n\nMy first experience with roller coaster simulation games was the game "Thrillville: Off the Rails" for the Wii. There was nothing to do, and there were just limits, limits, limits on that game. It's not Thrillville: It's Dullsville.\nWhen I found out this game was on Steam I just went completely head over heels for it. I've been a fan of the RCT franchise since second grade, and I was itching to play this one. However, I was worried that maybe this game would turn out to be just like Thrillville, with just limits, limits, limits.\nSo I decided to go ahead and give this game a try. I bought it and played Sandbox mode for maybe 20-30 minutes until I really got into the game. I severely injured 78 peeps on a horrific inverted roller coaster, drowned the annoying park inspector 50 times, charged 100 dollars for peeps to TCOB, and let my animals run loose and terrify peeps.\nWhat I really like about this game is that it's the Platinum version. That means it includes all three expansions, so you don't have to waste more money on downloadable expansions. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's a hardcore roller coaster fan.\n\nI'd rate this 9/10, and the reason why it's a 9 is because it's the graphics. The rest? PURE AWESOME!","January 11, 2015","true","162.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

Waiting for the next one but still having fun with this game in the interim.  The fact that you get to take a break and zoom in, get on the rides can somewhat take the slowness out of sims.  Has every aspect of managing a theme park and feels satisfying when you accomplish your goals.  Only thing that I find annoying with the game is a minor issue.  Wish there was a easier way to zoom across control screens.  Having to go through multiple clicks to get the menu item I want is somewhat annoying because I always forget which page has which control item.","December 13, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is similar to Sim City in the sense that you are building stuff using tile placement and budgets.  It is fully 3D, has a lot of really nice content, and has some neat features, like the ability to actually ride the rides.  The only way the game could be better in my opinion is to allow you to run around in first-person mode and play the game as an employee.  I have seen that done before, but it has never been done well.  At least this game does everything else well.\n\nThere are no Steam achievements, but there are challenges within the game.  You can also customize the game greatly.  I also think the game's controls are decent and the graphics are pretty good.  The overall atmosphere feels similar to the county fair until you start building the big rides and hiring lots of employees.  Then, it feels more like an actual theme park, I guess.\n\nThere are some confusing mechanics, as well.  The menus are hard to navigate, and the pool system is bizarre.  You would think that pool paths would work like regular paths, but no, they work on their own menu.  To this day, I still cannot figure out how to connect a pool to the rest of the theme park.","August 14, 2013","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is definetly a classic. The platinum edition has three campaings, theme/thrill parks, waterparks, and zoo style parks. Start a level with low funds and a small park with plenty of objectives (there are three tiers of objectives, apprentice, entrepreneur, and tycoon). Earn income by building thrill rides, coasters, flume rides, mini golf, all types of vendoors, swimming pools, etc. Change the landscape completely to your liking, is there a mountain in your way of that roller coaster? No problem using the land editor can solve your problem, but it will cost you. Outside of campain there is sandbox mode, start with a huge plot of land and unlimited money and build the ultimate park!

RCT 3 takes a huge jump from its previous installments. RCT 1 and 2 were similar i many reguards and RCT 3 takes what was amazing from these two games and adds in some awesome new features.\n\nPros/New features\n- the new riding the rides is a fun new feature. Ive actually created a sandbox part with every ride just so i can just go around and ride every single one xD.\n- Graphics. A huge jump from the RCT 2. A very satifying realism that doesnt completly negate the want for an "arcade" style game.\n- Pools. Another cool feature they added.\n- Huge variety. There are honestly soo many rides and attractions that you will be entertained for hours on end.\n\nCons\n- Some might find the new graphics to be a bit too realistic and not true to the RCT 1 and 2 feel.\n- Lag can be a problem late in the game ( this isnt a problem for the first 10 or so hours of gameplay). I make enourmous parks so this is to be expected.\n\nOverall\nThis game is fantastic and is loads of fun. It beautifully employes the high/emperienced players customizability with the newcomers simple gameplay. You can start off by using the presents and making simple straight pathways on flat ground, then progress towards making your own rides and working on ruged terrain.\n\n","June 25, 2014","true","109.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get to build amusement parks and try to earn money on your way, unless you're in sandbox mode. I prefer sandbox mode because it lets me expand my creativity. You can even make unfinished roller coasters and open tehm. One thing disappoints me about this. IT DOESN'T KILL THEM! I made a roller coaster that just goes straight up into the air. All the cars detatch, the people fall FACE FLAT on the ground, and they get up like it was no big deal. It really disappoints me, but I think it's kinda hillarious.

While it's easy enough to jump into to get started, it can be very addictive and take over your life for a while with its depth and seemingly endless possibilities. I've never even messed around much with the money management or scenarios, and I'm still creeping up on 200 hours with this bad boy just on Steam, which is my second run with the game.\n\nThere are a few different routes you can take with RCT3. You can try to tackle all the scenarios and successfully manage some pre-built (or partially built) parks, create your own parks in sandbox mode without monetary restrictions, or sadistically terrorize the peeps in parks of pure mayhem. Any of these is a viable route to take, and reason enough to pick this up.\n\nOf course, RCT3 isn't perfect. It's definitely showing its age at this point, the physics aren't remotely realistic, and the graphics (especially the peeps) are a bit cartoony. There are also some maddening limitations with the grid (I find your lack of diagonals disturbing), curious omissions from the pre-supplied content (no stock picnic tables?!), and many fans of the series seem to prefer the older games.\n\nDespite the shortcomings, however, there's just too much here to like. Custom content has kept this game going for a decade now and has made up for a lot of those omissions. Being able to view your parks in 3D and "ride" any of your rides is simply awesome the first time you experience it. And just being able to create your own amusement park -- a FULL park with flat rides, custom coasters, water attractions, and even animals -- makes this one a definite winner.\n\nRCT3 may ultimately be succeeded by Theme Park Studio in the sandbox department if the latter pans out (which I'm hoping will be the case). But in the meantime, or if you're a big fan of the money management features and scenarios of the RCT series, this is where it's at.","July 4, 2014","true","241.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I had a Steam account when this released, I'd have an unhealthy amount of hours docked on this game. The Wild and Soaked add-on packs are nice too, though the game is still just as fun without them. Your imagination is your own limitation in this game. The one very minor issue I have with RCT3 in general is the camera movement. It can be a bit of a pain at times when you're trying to build a coaster because it only shows from a downward angle and can only go flat when you middle mouse click and drag, then it holds it for a second and goes back to its original angle. The camera pan from left to right can sometimes get a little irritating as well. This didn't bother me so much as a kid a it does now (I use Maya for 3D animation and am used to moving the camera around in order to view all angles of whatever I'm building), however, it's not something worth condeming the game for.
