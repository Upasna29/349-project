Sure, we have OOTP Baseball, but it's not a baseball game. I love it as much as the next sabermetric fan, but I wanted a game to actually play baseball. And then we had RBI Baseball, which was a letdown. So naturally, I was excited when Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings was announced. And now that it's finally here, it feels like after years of being deprived of a good baseball game has finally come to an end.\n\nNow, I only really have three complaints about the game, but they're sort of not even complaints at all. More like a couple of things I want added to the game in future updates.\n\nLet's get those CONS out of the way first:\n\n- Lack of sabermetric stats\n\nBaseball fans LOVE stats. We love OPS, WHIP, AVG, and ERA, and I'm glad those ones are in the game, but over the years, baseball has evolved to embrace much more in depth stats. I want to know the WAR, BB/K, ISOP, BB/PA, RC27, and G/F of my players.\n\n- Lack of customizing options\n\nI want some of those Chris Archer stirrups. I want my player to look like that 20-something Jaden Smith-looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. My nasty slider needs the player look to match.\n\n- Lack of online multiplayer\n\nI want to have my Harry Butts dominate another man's bat. I mean, he has a 1.45 ERA, 11.4 K/9, and .122 OPP AVG. Let me show him off.\n\nAnd now we get to the PROS list:\n\n-The game is beautiful\n\nThe player models are clean and fun. the graphics are vibrant. And the stadiums. Oh the stadiums are gorgeous.\n\n- The gameplay is fun\n\nIT'S BASEBALL. IT'S INSANELY FUN.\n\n- There are no special pitches or swings\n\nTake notes, Backyard Sports. Nobody likes to play against a pitcher who makes the ball corkscrew while it digs underground and pop up only to burst into flames and then into the batter's ♥♥♥. Super Mega Baseball is cartoony, but it's never cartoony in an unfair way.\n\n- Ego difficulty slider\n\nI love this. You don't have an option of easy, medium, and hard difficulties to play on. You have an actual slider that sets the difficulty in small amounts.\n\n- The names of the players\n\nYou know the names you think of when you think of baseball? Babe Ruth, Clayton Kershaw, Sandy Koufax, Wade Boggs, Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle, Rollie Fingers, Gaylord Perry etc. They're baseball names. Their parents looked at them and thought, "Bob doesn't sound like a name for a future Hall of Fame catcher. Let's name him Buster." Well, in this game EVERY player has a baseball-sounding name. It's awesome.\n\n-It's a game\n\n-It's a baseball game\n\n-It's a baseball game on PC\n\n-It's a fantastic baseball game on PC\n\nWHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS REVIEW.

But it's not an MLB Simulator.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fun baseball game. It has all the essentials to make it fun, including smart controls.\n- Organic, real feeling physics. There is no "cheat spot", you have to adjust your timing for every swing, and getting a tater feels like an accomplishment.\n- Original difficulty system. Make your games as easy or difficult as you want, very precisely.\n\nCons:\n- No in-game save. Once a season game starts, you need to finish it or it will be recorded as a loss.\n- Some stats are weird, like, since there are no errors recorded, if you hit a grounder to first and the 1B flubs it... it's still a base hit. I understand why they do it this way, it just feels wrong to get a hit that way though.\n\nBottom line, it's a baseball game in PC, and it's fun.

There is no MLB license but what you have are great looking stadiums, lots of stats, and excellent gameplay.  The graphics in general are very good and the cartoonish style and names of the players give them character.  Hitting and pitching is what the game is all about and its very fun...fielding is there but not as in depth.  You can train your players, manage your team during a long season, and compete for leaderboard scores.  One of the best features is the Ego system which is a difficulty setting (from 1 to 100) that increases your points the higher level you play at.  I play at 50 right now after starting out lower...50 is where it starts to get difficult and I have close games...mostly losses but the system encourages you to get better slowly which is nice.","October 13, 2015","true","20.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","1"

It's taking me a while to get used to the controls, I'm now really good at batting though and can hit homeruns quite often, the graphics are real nice, very bright and "cartoon-like".\nI can confirm the optimization is good, the game runs really smooth 58fps constant with everything on the highest settings, 58fps seems to be the locked framerate on this game, this is run on a 960 GTX and an i7 3.4Ghz but to be fair I can't see why a much lower system would have any difficulty running it.\n\nOnly downsides, I am using a 360 controller and it appears the game has no "deadzone" so if your analogue stick doesnt sit exactly back in the middle when you release it then the "aim" will move into the direction the stick is slightly set into which is a bit annoying.\nA little bit of deadzone input into the game would be nice.\n\nAnd....

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Etheraeon/recommended/314070/","Etheraeon","Gryer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Etheraeon/","598 products in account","10/10 would KO a batter again!\n\nThis game is one of the most surprising titles I have ever picked up on Steam.\nI got it under the assumption that this would probably be a super simplified game with the bare minimums by how it looked and hoped for the best...\n\nWhat I ended up buying was not only an amazingly fun and addictive baseball game, but a game with one heck of a lot more depth to it than you would assume by judging this game by it's cover.\n\n=== Gird your loins ye who read the full review below ===\n\n\n\n\nThe batting in this game, completely on point.  The physics feel super tight and even in higher difficulties you don't feel like you're getting cheesed when you ground out or pop the ball a mile high.  If you swing on that pitch down in the strike zone and haven't reacted quick enough you know damn well you're going to ground out.  Everything feels very organic and proper as far as how the ball reacts. There are two different types of swings (plus bunting) : power and contact. You are also able to check your swing with both styles.\nFor the most part the same can be said about the AI as far as their hitting goes; If you make your pitches and place them well you will get your outs and K's.  Again, feels very realistic despite it's cartoony graphics and light-hearted attitude.\n\nThe pitching, my favorite part.  You have a plethora of pitches (8) to choose from, which is way more than enough considering every pitcher has the same choices. The pitches available are:  4 seam fastball (so-called Meatball), Cut fastball, 2 seam fastball, Slider, Screwball, Curveball, Changeup and a Forkball which is like a split finger fastball or Sinker as far as the movement goes.  You perform the pitch by first aiming for the spot you wish the ball to begin it's trajectory and then following the break of the ball.  You attempt to come as close to the break point marker (which appears after you start your windup) with your aim marker.   The closer to that spot you get the higher quality a pitch you perform. As with batting you have two different pitching styles available to you. Normal pitching and Power pitching. It is a very well done and fun system which I find more interesting than the common methods found in other baseball games like power sliders and such.\nAs much as I appreciate and love the pitching in this game, I also feel it is an area of the game that has a lot of potential to be made better.  Not so with how you perform your pitches but that each pitcher should have their own set of pitches. Along with that system it would more easily open the doors to having upgradeable pitches for each of the pitchers as well.\n\nIf you're familiar with baseball games and the game of baseball itself there is not much to go over with baserunning and fielding so I will not say much here.\nThe fielding feels good but I can see people getting a little frustrated with how quickly (or slowly in this case) your fielders will move.  It feels very laborious at first but it is something you get used to and everyone's on the same playing field in that regard for the most part.  You can make awesome diving plays if you time it correctly as well as jump walls to reel in those homers you'd all but given up on.\nThe baserunning, less to say here than the fielding.  Pretty much your basic baseball game here except you cannot be picked off on base by the pitcher.  The game uses an adaptive method, if it notices you are stealing a lot of bases it will start to give your runners less and less of a lead off.  That is one point of the game where it is lacking and unfortunately simplistic.\n\nThe depth.\n\nYes, depth! In case you haven't been convinced so far that there is more to this game than meets the eye, hopefully this will make it a bit more evident.\n\nAs you play the game with your team in season mode you will be able to hire staff to help your team on their way.   Each member of staff you hire will have 3 modifiers to offer your players in four different categories.  Gear vendors, Trainers, Coaches and Stylists.  Your players will start out with a few slots open and available to have modifiers placed in and their stats will improve according to the type of modifier you set.  Each player can have up to a maximum of 7  slots for different types of modifiers that will be made available as you play through your seasons.  Any extra slots and bonus modifications you have done will persist from season to season with that team and you will eventually be able to make your players superstars, for lack of a better term.\nThere is a bit of strategy behind this feature and you will also see the opposing teams players' improving in the same way as well.  In some cases even quicker than your own players if you did not approach the proper staff or applied your modifiers poorly.  For this part of the game I would recommend looking at SMB websites forums for a more in-depth description of the system itself just for a better understanding.\n\nThere is also a decent amount of statistics in the game including (but not limited to ;) ) BABIP, AB/HR ratios, walk and XBH percentages, OPS/OBP/Slugging, Total Bases, etc.  And if by chance you don't know what any of these actually mean it is described in game.\n\nOne more thing that adds to the depth of this game is the highly adjustable and customizable difficulty system, called "Ego".\nYou can adjust the difficulty across the board, or you can go into what's called Ego mode and adjust the difficulty based on the positions you're playing.  For example, you could have batting and pitching at 50 Ego, but fielding and baserunning at 80 Ego so the game doesn't hold your hand as much for those bits.  It makes it very easy to find a difficulty which you feel comfortable playing at and that gives you a good run for your money sometimes.    The difficulty goes all the way from 1 Ego, through to 99 Ego.  Anything above 60-70 Ego (once you've gotten comfortable with how the pitches look and move) will give people who are familiar with baseball games a good challenge while at the same time feeling like it's a proper competition.\n\nAn unfortunate truth that has been a big disappointment to many about this game is that there is no online multiplayer, nor is there plans for there to be in this game.   With any luck this game will have a sequel, which, from what I hear and have understood, online multiplayer will be one of the priorities for that as it has (quite understandably) been one of the most requested things by the community.\nIf by chance you happen to have friends within couch distance the game does have one of the most fun co-op playstyles I have seen for local multiplayer and a baseball game in general.\n\n\nIf you have stuck around to this sentence and read through the whole review I have written up, I commend you, and hope that this has given you a good idea to make a well informed decision.  This game and the team behind it truly deserve all the support they can get for this game.  It has amazing gameplay somewhat hidden behind it's cartoony facade.\n\nThanks for reading. :)","August 26, 2015","true","64.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insomniac_MA/recommended/314070/","Insomniac_MA","Insomniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insomniac_MA/","943 products in account","Super Mega Baseball strikes a strong balance between the action and presentation of an arcade game and the depth of a sim. The offensive side of things is pretty standard stuff, but it's the pitching that has a surprising amount of meat on its bones. Lots of pitch types, a twitch-based cursor-and-target system, needing to mix things up to keep the hitter guessing - it's a wonderful system once you get the hang of it. Fielding is somewhat CPU-assisted (less so at higher difficulty levels) although you can still take manual control of your fielders to chase down fly balls, leap for line drives and dive for ground balls. All of these mechanics are layed out via a helpful in-game tutorial system that works quite well.\n\nI really like how the "Ego" difficulty system is implemented. It allows you to ease yourself in and gradually increase or decrease the challenge until you find your sweet spot. And I'm very satisfied with the quality of the port - Runs smoothly on my 7870 and has settings for AA (up to 16x), AF and shadow quality as well as Windowed Fullscreen support.\n\nSMB is lacking when it comes to varying modes, unfortunately. Exhibition and Season mode is it. Something like a HR Derby or the option to jump right into a playoff tournament would've been nice. There are also only six ballparks, though all six are well designed and full of life. Baserunning controls feel a little awkward at first but I'm certain it's something that will only require a bit of practice. And while there is local co-op, the absence of online multiplayer is disappointing.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, SMB's finely-tuned gameplay and charming personality make it a joy to play. Easily the best non-OOTP baseball game on PC since MVP 05, and recommended for both casual and devoted fans of the sport.","August 21, 2015","true","47.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

There's much more depth here than you may expect. A ton of super-solid game mechanics with the right amount of control to satisfy those of us who want to jump in and play but also feel like we're mastering a game and crave the feeling of progression.\n\nSome of the solid game mechanics I enjoy:\n\nBATTING - has both tap button swing and power swing (hold the button to build up power and release at the right moment) all the while moving your mouse/controller to position the bat. Increasing the EGO (difficulty) will make positioning the bat more important!\n\nPITCHING - similar to batting, has a tap button pitch or power pitch by holding the button and aiming with the controller (or mouse).\n\nFIELDING - while simple, the options to jump, dive, and wall jump all exist. On higher EGO ratings, you will need to guide your fielders more towards the ball.\n\nBASE RUNNING - a nice feature here is you can tell all players to run at the same time OR you can control individual players (want 2nd base to run to third but 1st base to stay put? No problem).\n\nEGO (difficulty settings) - It has a difficulty system that allows you to fine tune the AI to provide you with the pefect non-frustrating balance of challenge (the values range from 0-99!), it's really quite incredible. This allows you to tweak the game's difficulty as you get better but keep it from being frustratingly difficult, unless you want it to be.\n\nTo put it simply, Super Mega Baseball is brilliant and an absolute joy to play.\n\nMy only con: multiplayer is local only.\n\nSuper Mega Baseball came out of left field for me and seriously hits it out of the park!\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nSome gameplay footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06YeN9BOu10","October 22, 2015","true","13.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","3"

I got it on sale and do not regret my purchase one bit. Yes, it's Baseball (my least favorite sport) represented in the form of a cartoon but it's game play does not lack whatsoever.\n\nFirst off, the game is local co-op. I just wanted to make sure everyone knows this because this is an awesome thing on steam. Second, the game play is also varied in it's works. At first, all the batting styles and pitching styles may seem relatively the same. Upon reading the instructions (as I usually do after an hour into the game) you can definitely mix up your style in order to meet the demands of the play. The batter can swing using "A" in which is a straight through swing. "B" will let you bunt while holding "X" will let you decide how much power to put into your swing. Alternatively, using the right thumb stick will let you sort of have a say in where the ball goes. This selection also uses a power setting in which starts at 0 and goes all the way up to 99 then back to 0. Timing is important in the game and plays a role from batting to pitching.\n\nWhen pitching (playing solo), the player will have to line up his pitch into a small box that is displayed. The game is even nice enough to show you where the ball is planning to go. These arrows may point in a different direction depending on what type of pitch you choose. I believe there are 8 different pitches to choose from including fast balls and forkballs. Playing local co-op though, there are no boxes displayed as to where you should line your shot up. This doesn't take away from the game as you can still get some fancy throws off.\n\nPlaying out field is relatively simple and you'll feel almost in complete control of your players. "LB" tells all players to run around the bases while "RB" tells everyone to run back to the previous. You can tell individual players to run to certain bases and even play some tricks running back and fourth. Pressing "RB" while playing outfield will make your player jump while pressing "RT" will make them dive. These are fantastic features but can sometimes be slightly misleading. Spacing sometimes plays an issue as I'm unsure whether to press one of those buttons or not in fear of completely missing the ball. You, as the player have to give some time to the actual players to pick up the ball. The ball is throwing accordingly to the button layout (Y - 2nd base, X - third base, A - home and B - 1st base) and holding down the throw button brings up a power meter of how hard to throw the ball. Releasing at the right time will give you desired power. The controls overall are pretty on point and you'll be blaming yourself more than it for mess-ups. Level of difficulty can be adjusted but be aware, anything over 20 is pretty tough (and 20 is medium)! The teams also have different characteristic settings as some are better at bat than pitching. All teams have ridiculously funny names.\n\n\nThe graphics are very enjoyable and the character designs are fantastic. Everything seems like it was taking slightly over the top but it's absolutely suiting. I wish they would add maybe one or two more arenas to play in. The ones that are given are none the less pretty.The local co-op scheme is absolutely phenomenal and well organized. Don't know whose pitching? Don't know whose batting? Don't know whose playing outfield? Don't know whose controlling what? Take a quick glance before the pitch is thrown and you'll see which player is assigned which task. Sounds are funny as the umpire will have you laughing when he sends you off the field (YOOOOOUUUURRRR OUTTAAAHEEERREEE isn't the start of it...  a deep low voice will be saying some random stuff that you'll have to listen to carefully to make out what the guys yelling in a mumbling fashion). From the bat making contact with the ball to the throws themselves, everything seems on point.\n\nOverall, a really fun baseball game that closely mimics a real one. Don't let the cartoon graphics fool you, this game will challenge you. Just wish there was multiplayer.\n\n\nRATING : 7.9/10\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B+	Overall 	B\n\nScreenShots :\nWhat a home run looks like\n\nA display of the teams and their unique abilities\n\nHe should of dived\n\nHey Arnold! is making his debut in base ball\n\nWhat a local co-op games looks like.

Comparatively, I actually like RBI Baseball '15 and the MLB players are nifty, but this is mostly because of my nostalgia for the NES/Super NES-gen games.

No. Is it as good as The Show? No. Is it the best baseball game currently available on PC? Yes (unless you prefer the number-crunching spreadsheet greatness of Out of the Park). Yes, the game is designed to be played with an Xbox controller, and this is overwhelmingly obvious throughout and cannot be changed. Yes, there is no online multiplayer, local only, which may be a turnoff to some.  And, yes, the depth of season mode is limited; there is no trading players, no injuries, and a limited number of teams.\nBut if you're willing to sacrifice depth for fun gameplay, then I'd say go for it. The art style is memorable, the characters standout (Hammer Longballo, you're my hero), and the lighthearted appearance does not detract from the fun of the actual 9 innings. If you have a PS3 or PS4, then you should obviously pick up The Show; it is undoubtedly the perfect baseball game. However, until we get anything remotely close to it on PC, this is your best bet. Long story short, pick this up before you even think of getting RBI, it is a much better game even without the MLB license.","August 27, 2015","true","14.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

(Idk if this changes on higher ego level)\n-Lack of team creating which is odd considering this game seems perfect for that kind of thing.\n-The creators seemed to try and market this game to people who dont like or know how to play baseball which is extremely odd for a sports game.

I've played the Xbox 360 trial of RBI baseball and thought it was terrible.  After this came out on PS3 one of my friends snagged it and told me about it so I purchased it.  Don't let the cartoonish graphics fool you, this game is tons of fun.  They did a great job on the physics and took care to make sure base runners were the correct speed compare to throws and whatnot so double plays are realstically difficult and you're not going to throw out a batter at first base from right field.  The thing I like most about the game is the hitting.  If you play on the lower levels you can get away with just using a button to swing.  The harder you make the game the less help you get with batting.  The increments of how much you get help with this go from 0 to 99 and it's called "Ego".  This makes it very easy to fine tune exactly how difficult you want the game to be.  The Ego setting also controls how good your fielder's jump is on a ball and how much you have to control them before they get to the spot where the ball is.  It also changes the difficulty of locating your pitches.  In the PS3 version there was just an overall Ego meter.  In the Steam version they've changed it so you can either just change the overall ego or adjust specific Ego settings for Batting, Baserunning, Pitching and Fielding.  I haven't messed with the individual Ego settings as it hasn't been necessary for my enjoyment of the game.\n\nI have my Ego set at 50 and can still score between 5 - 10 runs a game just using the single controller button to hit.  I've tried the game on higher levels but haven't really attempted to go above 60.  Above that and it turns into the kinds of games I've avoided since then I'd have to move the cursor to get a bat on the ball and that's just not fun for me.\n\nMetalhead did a really good job on this port.  My system has an i7 3770 and an nVidia 670 graphics card with 2GB of RAM.  I have all the settings maxed out and the game stays smooth all the time.","August 22, 2015","true","96.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When you're in the outfield, you have to move your mouse the direction of the base you want to throw too before throwing, otherwise it defaults to first base. I'd much rather see the base selection controlled via wasd. That aside though, it's a decent game. It's simple enough for casual gamers, but can be cranked up to be more challenging for hardcore players if desired. If you're a baseball fan, you'll like it. Me, I like it more then most baseball games, mind you I haven't really gotten into any since the days of Baseball Simulator 2000 and Ken Griffey Jr Baseball.","August 23, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I couldn't find any reviews or information as to whether SMB would play on this latest OS from MS (although by the time I write this they will probably have come out with another wallet sucking venture). As a result I was reluctant to purchase this game. However, I decided at the price, what the heck... I would give it a try.\n\nWhat a beautiful game. So happy that it runs smoothly with Windows 10. Don't let the arcade style cartoonish baseball players fool you. It is still baseball and so much fun in its simplicity. The EGO system is a stroke of genius. There is still enough tweaking that can be done to keep it interesting. Re-naming player names to Actors names was a hoot. It is a wee bit confusing at first, but within a few hours and some experimenting you will get the hang of it. If you want to micro-manage every little aspect, then don't waste your time. BUT if you just want to have a bit of fun playing an excellent baseball game... it is well worth the $20.\n\nThis game is visually stunning. The colours are vibrant and pop right out. The different ballparks are amazing. Please take note; the teams are not "linked" to any particular ballpark as there are more teams than ballparks. My understanding since joining the forum at www.supermegabaseball.com is that it takes time to create the ballparks and there will likely be more added in the future. The ones they have now are fantastic. The stands are full of cheering throngs of cartoon fans. The atmosphere is electric at times and you really get the feel of playing at a packed stadium. The cut scenes in between innings are outstanding. What a gem of a game. The streets outside the ballpark, full of traffic. Sparks flying off hydro poles. Subway cars, birds dive bombing the field, ferry boats... the detail put into this is absolutely amazing. I just cant say enough about the graphics. Outstanding!!!\n\nSince this is a console game ported over for computers it is a little tricky using a mouse and a keyboard. There is an option to re-map the interface controls to keys on your k/board, which I found useful. The fielding and throwing of the ball to different bases is very challenging. Using the mouse and finding the right "sweet spot" is difficult. Almost wants to make me go out and buy a controller, which this game supports. I would probably do just as bad though, since I have never owned a console platform and never used a game controller.\n\nThe devs and programmers are very quick to address any problems you might run into. They quickly answer your question and let you know how to solve a problem if one should arise and if it can be fixed. At least they get back to you and you are not ignored.\n\nBottom Line: Buy this game. It is well worth the money and I cant see it staying at this bargain price.","October 21, 2015","true","46.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

I've been playing baseball games since the days of Bases Loaded (NES), Hardball (Commodore) and some of the newer titles like MVP and The Show. It's definitely a blast to play and I'm only 40 minutes in or so. It's easy to grasp for someone new to the sport as the in-game tutorial messages are clear and concise.\n\nThe artstyle fits in nicely including the audio. I love how the umpire calls balls and strikes, and of course putting some wood onto the ball. CRACK!\n\nMy first game went into extra innings after I brought in my closer and I gave up a jack in the bottom of the 5th (played a short game to get my feet wet) leading 4-3. I lost 5-4 due to an outfield error in the 7th.  I played well after giving up 3 in the first. Solid baseball game even if it doesn't take itself seriously like some AAA ball games do but still delivers some good ol' fashion baseball. Batter up!\n\nDo check it out, you won't be disappointed but do your due dilligence in case you are looking for something specific.\n\nEDIT: Started a short season. The game actually has some nice stat tracking, too. If you're into that.","August 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The only option available out there was OOTP, which isn't really my thing.\n\nA good experience I remember having was back in 2007-2008, when Ulltimate Baseball Online (aka Real Baseball Online) was around, which then became inaccessible. Different attempts to bring it back by other parties also didn't go well.\n\nThen I saw this game. I didn't expect much from it by simply looking at the pictures. Yet I gave it a try and playing the game is a whole different story. It's "arcadey" and all but has everything covered.\n\nI am not really that versed with rules of baseball, and can't really say what the game misses, therefore I think it's a nice game that anyone can pick up, even without having prior experience/knowledge about baseball as a sport.\n\nApart from being able to play a full baseball game, the game also offers ability for players to assign their team members with new skills and traits that can be applied in a game. Those skills are gained at the end of games based on performance which is calculated with points.\n\nPlayers also have the freedom to set the difficulty of games using "ego" which decides how much control a player needs to put on the team members. The higher the "ego" the more attention a player needs to put into controls and depend less on the AI aspect.\n\nIn addition to that, the customisation of team members in terms of looks is also possible. It has a wide variety of funny looking faces and hair styles that don't really reduce the game quality but instead add to it a fun and less serious atmosphere. Don't let this stop you from enjoying the game.\n\nNot to forget the funny remarks that the umpire throws in his voice.\n\nSo it doesn't matter if you're a baseball fan or simply wanting to start getting into the game, then this game isn't a bad choice.","November 7, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the pitching, but still really bad at batting. I won't get too deep into the great things about the game since it's already been covered by many others. The game is true to baseball mechanics and that makes me so glad that they don't have MLB licence so they could simply focus on the mechanics, and what a superb job they've done.\n\nAnother thing is that Metalhead Software responds to their customers in a timely fashion. I think these guys really care. Thanks.\n\nWhat I wish the game had:\n\nPersonally I'd like to be able to swing at any pitch even if the indicator doesn't turn red and even if I miss by a mile, as I just feel restricted, but I'm sure there's a reason for it; I just don't know it.\n\nAs others have pointed out, it would be nice for an update to this game or included in SMB 2 (if any), that the seasons continue on to be recorded (but not a big deal) and each team had their own stadium (big deal).\n\nThe crowd should mostly root for the home team and boo or be quiet for the visiting team. For the most part, they cheer indiscriminately, and that makes it feel less like a real baseball game.\n\nI'd like to be able to skip the home run sequences.\n\nPractice features such as hitting and base running would be very helpful.\n\nThis game is very fun and very replayable. The models are really basic, but it more than makes up for it everywhere else, especially gameplay and controls, and that's much much more important than the models.

Don't let the cartoony characters throw you off. There is a lot of depth and challenge here. I especially appreciate that the difficulty sliders, or "ego" settings, can be varied in four categories; batting, pitching, fielding, and baserunning.I've always enjoyed the batting and pitching part of PC baseball, and less so the fielding, so I let the AI handle more fielding than the others.\n\nHitting has a very solid feel to it. When you jack one out of the park, you really do feel a sense of getting all of it. Solid base hits and extra base hits feel equally rewarding.\n\nThe "mojo" facor and emotional reactions are a brilliant touch. Watching the pitcher and batter literally sweat it out in a duel at the plate in late innings in a close game really brings the game alive.\n\nThere also seems to be a very nice balance in letting the AI batters swing at pitches off the plate rather than having a perfect eye like so many other baseball games have had. Even the umpires seem to have some leeway in their strike zone.\n\nCongrats to the developers. They were also very responsive to an issue I had posted in the dicussions page, which did indeed turn out to be a problem with my controller.","May 15","true","20.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I hate this game, so, so very much. The controls, especially for batting but even more so for fielding are just unintunitive. There are much, much better control schemes out there on $0.99 mobile baseball games. What makes things worse is there is no play-through tutorial to help you learn how they expect you to play, only a set of vauge unhelpful directions that don't explain anything and certainly do not show how to perfrom the actions. Maybe, just maybe that could be forgiven, since there seems to be a decent game hiding there somewhere (and all the positive reviews can't be that wrong) but with no way to just sit there and practice batting until I learn the controls except to play the game it gets frustrating and annoying fast. And there is no way to change the control setup on a controller, and moving the right stick and hitting a button on the same said on the controller is too complicate dto be fun. I bought this game because my dad's a big baseball fan and we used to enjoy playing the 90's era games where we passed the gameboy back and forth and I was hoping thsi was something we could play together locally. I'm willing to be proven wrong, though so if the developers read this review - please, please fix this game.","May 31","false","0.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Do not let my review stop you - just ask yourself why unlike the other reviews that are negative on here that could barely string two words together got commented against yet this review not a single person has been able to call it out for being wrong and explained why. Only Downvotes - no reasoning. You decide.\nEDIT Saved.\n\nI am not one for Bashing games. I'm really not, I will give any game a Chance pretty much and have a long history of Gaming and Developing.\nThen why was this game the first Game on Steam I have requested a refund for?\n\nQuite frankly its the lack of scope.\n\nThere are two modes in the Game.\n\nExhibition and Season. There is no practice mode to speak of - instead the Game forces you to learn through a trial by fire. Innovative? Sure, legit replacement of a Practice mode where one could practice pitching balls, batting and so forth? No.\n\nSeason mode is literally an extended version of Exhibition - this mode could have easily been fleshed out (and I speak of this from a Programmer perspective) to be a Career mode with RPG Elements seeing as there is a half attempt to do that very thing by including Coaches to train up your team.\nCoaches that apparently work for free and Players that just show up to play for the hell of it.\n\nThat is it.\n\nThat is what you are paying for - Two Game modes. No Tournament play, No in-house Leagues to speak of, no Multiplayer 4 way split screem where you could control a player each as they each take their turn on the plate and then maintain control of them whilst they are on the bases to REALLY bring that team play co op element out. Nothing.\n\nI am more frustrated at the limited scope this game has. I have left it on my wishlist despite refunding it and will keep an eye on its development. It has potential but if like me you are used to sinking time into a Game and actually have friends who come round to play (as I do as well as play with my Girlfriend) this is just too lacking in gameplay variety to be worthwhile at the price it is.\n\nCartoon Graphics which dont capitalise on the medium by including any wacky modes and yet doesn't take itself seriously enough to include staples that make games like these a long term steam purchase. By sitting on the fence between these two ballparks this Game is unimpressive.\n\nAlso I WILL echo what others have said in other comments - to launch this on Steam and not include a multiplayer section despite having Leaderboard highscores feels like a Rush job to me. Including such a Feature and/or online monthly leagues would make this game top ranked in no time especially given how you can customise players - Id happily pay for DLC to customise them further.\n\nIf you are looking for a Casual no depth Baseball game to spend a few sessions a week on, sure, pick it up.\nI won't be until the Developer actually gives this game the potential it deserves.","August 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 44 of 99 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","44","99","0","12"

I played in solo mode (not even sure if there is multiplayer) so i'll base my review on that.\nThe mechanics of the game are not that bad for a baseball game, in essence, it is what you would expect, you need to time and select a good strategy for pitching and batting and you have a few options for stealing bases etc. But overall, this was fun for 1/2 a game for me, the AI is not challenging so its sort of a walk in the park for 35 minutes watching cut scenes and being bored. At the end of the game I thought at least i would spend some time upgrading and whatever and maybe it would get more interesting with time but the upgrading options are so light that they could just be non existent. I tried a few games like that but it was just unbeareable as a "career" mode game.\nSorry Devs, nice effort, we don't see many of these in the market.

Can't say the same about the big name sports titles that get regurgitated every year by corporate drones.\n\nOn the surface, this game harkens back to RBI Baseball, Baseball Stars, and Ken Griffey Jr baseball.  Beneath the surface, though, is where it really shines.  The physics are remarkably accurate and repeatable, and the team management system is almost as fun as the gameplay in terms of balancing strengths/weaknesses and deciding exactly what kind of team you want to take the field.  Difficulty is user-managed by the EGO system (1-99), which determines not only how well the CPU will play but also how good your joystick skills will need to be to pitch/hit your way to victory.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough for baseball fans of all types.  It isn't just for older fans of the aforementioned games.  Rather, it should appeal to fans of almost any age or gaming desire other than hardcore simulation.","November 29, 2015","true","57.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game might have some PS2 level graphics, but at least it means basically any computer made past 2004 will be able to run it. The stadiums and environments are pretty cool. They’re nothing too spectacular, but at least there are some interesting things to look at in the background along with the crowd. Speaking of the crowds, visually they are very impressive. They all look like individuals and all have animations that go at different times, not just flat picture in the stands that bobs up and down. Unfortunately, the sound is off. They cheer just as loudly for both teams, and they usually end up rooting for the away team which doesn’t make sense. Also, the sound design in general is just okay. Most of it is pretty decent, but some of it is just really annoying. (Que the Ump). Overall, presentation leaves a lot to be desired, but that’s not the main draw to this game anyway.\n\nContent\n\nSuper Mega Baseball: Extra Innings does have a lot to offer in the content category. There are a good amount of teams to choose from to start your season. I love the fact that you can change every single one of your players from their physical characteristics to their name. You can hire and fire staff to help level up you players as well. The further you progress the better staff you are able to hire. I also like that you have a full stable of pitchers including multiple starting and relief pitchers, as well as a closer. You also have to manage their stamina so you can’t start the same pitcher multiple games in a row. It’s a really nice feature, one I wouldn’t assume a game like this would have, but it only adds to the simulation of the game. I wish there was some way to trade players. That is not too much of a big deal, but it would add to the simulation even more. There is also local CO-OP play, which is a must for me for any good sports game. Unfortunately, there is no online play for exhibitions or for season mode. I certainly wish there was as it would help with the replayabilty a lot.\n\nGameplay\n\nSuper Mega Baseball: Extra Innings really hit gameplay out of the park. The pitching is incredibly satisfying. Hitting can be pretty hit or miss. Sometimes it’s really easy and you hit 5 home runs in a row, sometimes you pop every one up. It’s still a really nice feeling system that I enjoy using. Fielding is okay, I don’t like that you can’t catch the ball on your own, the AI does it for you and diving could use a little work, but making nice diving catches and incredible throws feels really nice. I really like the scalable difficulty, the ego slider allows for basically 100 different difficulties as well as fine tuning the CPU’s stats with the Ego Mode button. This makes it a really easy game to get in to, as well as a pretty difficult game to master. My biggest complaint about the gameplay isn’t about gameplay at all. It’s actually the distinct lack of gameplay. When you are simulating until you play your next game, you have to watch each game. They usually take about 8 or so seconds to simulate, but when you have 15 games  to simulate, you spend a lot of time just staring at the screen doing nothing. Overall I love the gameplay.","September 9, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game plays like it should, and outside catching pop fly balls, you'll be in control of everything from pitches, swings, base control, and outfield control. It's just that the game focuses more on ease of use, something The Show fails at (in my eyes). This makes the game far easier to control than The Show, and thus is much more fun.\n\nCoupled with some funny characters, great looking stadiums, and some rediculous team names with the ability to change the team names for a custom team, the game is lighthearted, easy to play but challenging on higher difficulties, and a blast to play with friends.\n\nIn fact, that's the only downside. The game still has no online play. There are leaderboards, but it's just not as fun as playing with the person in real time. If this would be added, it would GREATLY help the game. But if you can live with playing against bots, or if you have friends in the same room, the game is an absolute joy and one you shouldn't pass up just because of the cartoony look.\n\nThis is a great baseball game through and through.

I really enjoy the batting and pitching mechanics, which are essential to a good baseball game, but everything needs some work. The fielding and baserunning are just ok. Both are too slow for my liking, even in season mode after you train and upgrade players. The difficulty curve is a little odd as well. The game has a Ego curve that goes from 1-100. I can absolutely crush CPU teams all the way up to EGO 60. Moving up to 65 to add more challenge just seems to make the game more unfair. CPU batters hit balls out of the zone off the tip of their bat a bajillion feet into the stands, CPU Pitchers get ridiculous strike calls.\n\nBatting is incredibly fun, except when it isn't. I think making contact with the ball and managing your power swings are done well, but I feel like you ending up hitting the ball directly to a fielding CPU player far too often. I once played a game where I went 8 innings just crushing the ball, and I bet the fielders in the had moved a combined 20 feet to gather them all up.\n\nI wish I could find a difficulty level that really hit the sweet spot. The core mechanics of the game are solid and worth a shot.","September 12, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers should be proud of themselves.  I think one of the greatest features this has is that it moves very quickly.  A 9 inning game only takes about 10-15 minutes to play.  Very very little time inbetween pitches, between batters and between innings.  Development of the players skills is done very creatively.  Hitting is challenging, pitching is interesting and choosing a fielders action is seamless.  If I were to change anything, I would give full control of the fielders movement to the player.  Fly balls are caught automatically, but what you do with the ball afterwards is entirely up to you.  9.5/10  If you've been waiting for a baseball game that you can't WAIT to play again, and play through an entire season without a minute of boredom, then get this game.

I was looking for a baseball game I can play season mode and I get this and more. I enjoy playing season modes in baseball not only to see if I can make it to the play offs and win but to see stats stack up during the season. How will each player has done for me through it all. This game not only gives me that but as you play consecutive seasons your over all stats are added together. I am right now in the middle of my second season in this game and I can see how many home runs I have hit, how many times I have struck out, how many pitches I have thrown how many double and triple plays I have made and on and on. I love this!\n\nThe difficulty setting is something I have not seen. I am use to difficulty settings of something along the lines of "Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard"  In this game your  difficulty is based on your EGO number. The higher the number the more difficult the game will become. It offers a grander scale to work with based on your desire so it is actually easier to find a good difficulty level for you than any other baseball game. (That I have played that is). Which brings me to my next thought, I was hesitant on buying this game, because I usually find in baseball games that you can create a team and just power slug fest your way through, having scores of 40-0 lol Its fun sure for awhile but then there is no difficulty and becomes boring after awhile. WIth the difficulty system you can avoid this problem.\n\nI have 2 things that I do not like about this game. The season is really short even on the longest length. 48 games. I can over look that though, it is just sad though.\n\nThe biggest issue I found in this game, and it may just be me, but the controls on the keyboard.

This will let me delete MLB The Show from my PS4 to save some space.\n\nThis is the perfect balance of Arcade and realisism that has been missing since RBI Baseball (that's NES RBI Baseball, not the reboot).  The games are fast paced, but there's a surprising amount of depth.  The pitching control is fun, but moreso it's great that they've worked the AI so that your pitch selection is equally important.  Batting is entertaining, though some of the base stealing controls can be a bit much when you're first getting into the game.\n\nHonestly, an MLB-licesned version of this would be my dream baseball game -- but as is, it's still very much worth the money.\n\nEdit:  The one issue I've found with the game is "in-betweener" infield hits.  I've lost two late-game no-hitters to either soft chops that landed between the pitcher and catcher, or soft grounders that went to the bermuda triangle of field coverage that is the area between the 1st baseman, pitcher, and 2nd baseman.  In these situations, all fields will soft charge, stall, soft charge, etc -- no one quickly gets to the ball.  It's wose in the 1st base situation, because the pitcher will frequently start running towards the base to cover 1st (as they should), but then back off and work back towards the ball.    Just putting this out here in case the devs ever check this feedback.","August 22, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, I believe I am the only person in the United States that follows baseball and no other sport. I am a student of the history of the game - especially the Dead Ball Era. As such, I have played every "serious" baseball sim with mainstays being OOTP and Baseball Mogul.\n\nI've been looking for a fun arcade type baseball game. In the glory days of the C64 and Amiga it was Hardball, MicroLeague Baseball and Earl Weaver baseball - the latter a decent strategy sim. My best friend and I used to stay up all night playing Hardball on the C64. I tried other arcade titles such as Star League Baseball, and The Show. None of these could touch the sheer fun of the first iteration of Hardball - until now.\n\nSuper Mega Baseball Extra Innings - known for the rest of this review as SMBEI - has completely captivated me. There are no trades, the longest season is only 40 games, there are limited substitutions, and the game looks like a nice little game forkids. But, don't be misled by these observations. SMBEI is a well done representation of baseball in an arcade format. Developer Metalhead have put a lot of love into this game and it shows. The game plays very well with KB and mouse even though the devs recommend a controller.\n\nThere is a visceral feeling to hitting the ball and pitching is a blast. The cartoon aesthetic may put some potential gamers off but, this is really quite a serious baseball game. The parks look fantastic, the fans are hilarious, and the cusomization is pretty good.\n\nDifficulty level is determined by a mechanism nown as "ego." The higher the number, the more challenging the game is. And I would strongly suggest that after a few games to ratchet up the ego rating for a real challenge.\n\nAll of that said, there isn't complete joy in Mudville.You cannot create your own teams, bench and bullpen are very limited and while replayability is good, it could be better with more teams as well as an option to import stats from the free Sean Lahman Baseball Database.\n\nIt's the perfect baseball game to play when you aren' feeling up to the intricacies of games like Baseball Mogul and OOTP.

Can't say the same about the big name sports titles that get regurgitated every year by corporate drones.\n\nOn the surface, this game harkens back to RBI Baseball, Baseball Stars, and Ken Griffey Jr baseball.  Beneath the surface, though, is where it really shines.  The physics are remarkably accurate and repeatable, and the team management system is almost as fun as the gameplay in terms of balancing strengths/weaknesses and deciding exactly what kind of team you want to take the field.  Difficulty is user-managed by the EGO system (1-99), which determines not only how well the CPU will play but also how good your joystick skills will need to be to pitch/hit your way to victory.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough for baseball fans of all types.  It isn't just for older fans of the aforementioned games.  Rather, it should appeal to fans of almost any age or gaming desire other than hardcore simulation.","November 29, 2015","true","57.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The lack of online multiplayer doesn't even matter because the AI difficulty system is so perfect. You can set the difficulty to any number between 1 and 100. I'm currently finding around 55 difficulty to be perfect for me (I win ~60% of the time maybe), but that number is always increasing as I get better. It's so refreshing to play a game against bots that isn't soul crushingly difficult or walk in the park easy. It's probably even more fun than playing against people online because the games are just so close when you find the right difficulty number! And I don't think it's really possible to be good enough to find the maximum difficulty easy, so don't worry about that. Really happy with this game.","December 12, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Was a huge fan of the old Slugfest games and Mario Baseball on Gamecube. This game fits right in. You can expect a lot of offense, but the pitching mechanics also are quite fun and old-school.  If you hit your locations and put together decent pitch sequences, you can really shut down the opposing team's offense. The game employs a difficulty modifier called "Ego" that allows you to tweak the difficulty as you get better and better, which is a nice touch that seems to work well at keeping the CPU competitive.  I've never been a huge fan of the MLB The Show franchise, it's just too serious for my taste. Super Mega Baseball provides a nice casual baseball experience on the PC, which has been needed for some time.\n\nPros:\n\n-Accessible, simple control scheme\n-Surprisingly fun pitching controls\n-Awesome player names\n-Pleasant graphics, nice colors\n\nCons:\n\n-No online multiplayer\n-If you're one of the stat-crazy sabremetric baseball fans, this game may not give you your crazy stat crack fix\n-The controls may be too simplistic for some\n-A narrow selection of stadiums","September 15, 2015","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me a few frustrating losses to get the hang of it but it's a fun game once you learn the controls. I only wish it had more customizable options such as team name, team logo, and choice of home stadium. The game would also benefit from more stadiums, more character creation options, a  salary system for upgrades similiar to Baseball Stars from the NES, and better fielding controls. It has an arcade feel but lacks bench clearng brawls and there are no commentators to add that since of realism that makes these kind of games unique. I have high hopes for strong DLC in the near future.","September 26, 2015","true","34.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oreomarshi/recommended/314070/","oreomarshi","MikeTrout","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oreomarshi/","19 products in account","I just got this game today and I have already played for 2 hours straight. I can already tell how fun of a game this will be for me. I love baseball, and I was waiting for a good baseball game to come to Steam. Although this game isn't licensed by MLB, and thus does not have real players or anything, it's still really fun. Don't be discouraged from buying it due to the cartoon art, as it has real baseball mechanics, the controls are easy to learn, and the gameplay is fun overall. I was quite surprised with the fact that you could even customize the players on your team. I was glad to be able to change my center fielder's name to Mike Trout and (try to) make him look like him. Of course, certain things can still be improved. On the first game I played, I somehow scored 10 runs and got a no hitter against the opposing team with no prior experience. I still have to experiment with whether raising the difficulty, called ego, will make a difference in making the game less easy. I won't hold this against the game, however, as in most baseball games you can score an impossible amount of points easily, but that doesn't make the game less fun. As for bugs, I've already ran into one where my game crashed at the end of the 9th inning, which I then used that time to come here and write this review. If you love baseball I would certainly recommend this game to you.","August 21, 2015","true","56.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
