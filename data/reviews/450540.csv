"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinxed13/recommended/450540/","jinxed13","Falandorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinxed13/","50 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI would highly recommend this shooting simulator for anyone interested in learning the proper functions of firearms or for just playing about. As a regular shooter and firearm enthusiast I find the skills carry over perfectly from real life to sim or vice versa. The sim is constantly being updated on the forums by a very active team of devs who are always keen to engage with the community. You could quite easily become proficient at range etiquette, safety and firearm handling in complete safety before ever stepping foot in a real range.\n\nIf you live in a country like the UK where access to firearms is quite tricky, even after you have your own license it can be a pain travelling distance to often indoor cramped ranges. This offers a fascinating perspective on shooting at home. I personally feel like the experience is on a par with real life shooting when you factor in all the extra expense and hassle of shooting in a country which is not enthused with firearms.\n\nThe developers also have a sense of humour and fun which is evident in the game design so this would also be great for anyone looking for something a bit different.\n\nPosting on my wife's account this is Falandorn from the /r/Vive subreddit and it's been a pleasure watching this simulator develop.","April 23","true","37.9"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","0"

But it is somewhat lacking in what you can do with your guns, as of this review you can either do a wave based shooting type thing. or set a range for some targets. would like to see maybe a NPC or AI or like a wave based zombie thing or just some foot soldiers trying to breach your area. other then that i think the models of the guns and scopes and such look AMAZING! and the sounds in this game are rather exquisite!

There are some mini-games like grenade skeeball and an arcade shooter, but mostly it's just toying around with firearms at the range. The guns are modeled to be a lot more realistic than your typical shooter. Using the M4 for example requires first attaching a site, manually loading the clip, pulling back on the handle, and selecting your fire mode. Only then can you shoot.\n\nFiring guns in this is surprisingly satisfying. I'm not a firearms enthusiast by any stretch (been to a gun range all of twice in my life). But using these virtual guns for target shooting turned out to be a lot of fun. It even has me thinking of getting an AR-15 stock and building some sort of holder for more realistic rifle shooting.\n\nMy favorite moment though has been dual wielding MAC-11's.

Unfortunately current VR headsets are still too low of resolution that shooting anything over 20-30 feet becomes a very muddy.  So it's a good things all the guns in this game look and function beautifully.\n\nGrabbing a grenade, pulling the pin, throwing it.  Pulling your pistol out, unloading into the boxes as the grenade lands and explodes.  Dropping your magazine and loading in a new one, popping the slide forward.  It all just feels so cool, and all without the actual danger of firearms.  With real guns it's important to put safety over fun, where here it gives you the freedom to have fun and feel like a genuine badass.\n\nThe only thing negative to say is that I now kind of expect this level of weapon interaction from other games and they just don't have it.","April 21","true","15.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

THIS game however. Love it. We just scratched the service and i want more. It's a bit pricey at 20 bucks. BUT the first time you pick up a grenade launcher and fire it....magic. Then you realize...you can actually use the targeting recticle. Sight it in and everything. I had to give a squee on that.\n\nThe mini games are just fun.

Not only are they making quality, it shows they are having fun with it. I cannot recommend this game enough. I have so many things i want with VR now that i've experienced just half of this game.\n\nThere are some downsides from still being in development.

The graphics are second to none, both on the guns themselves and the environments (love the Skee-ramp and that Arizona sunset!). Where this game *really* shines, though, is the interface. This is a developer who doesn't treat interface like an afterthought, but very carefully considers its role in all aspects of the experience. Using your hands to operate the guns, doing everything from twirling a revolver to popping the lever off a grenade, becomes so natural after a short time that you become *utterly* immersed. Immersion in visuals is great and all, but immersion via fluid interactivity is the soul of gameplay, and RUST is very much in tune with that soul.

Think of it as target practice with mutiple weapons to choose from (All of which have insanely good detail to their real life counterparts) at any given time with a few mini games such as skee ball with hand gernades tossed in. Looking forward to what the developers have in store for this in the near future. Some things I would like to see is a way to scale the weapons in game.

Seeing that this is still only early access, and the dev is very active and responsive to user feedback, this will be more than worth the cost by the time it comes out.\n\nDo NOT expect zombies or anything like that - but do expect to be able to augment your real life gun practice with some simulated VR training. The gun models and handling will be good enough that you can actually use it for various types of training as far as pistols goes. Rifles are very hard to simulate with two independently moving controllers, so until someone decides to produce and sell proper controller adapters that let you place the controllers into a rigid rifle like body, it will not be very realistic (I've made a PVC rifle mock up, it helps but it is still not quite there).\n\n75 % of the VR "games" out on steam by the time of writing this is nothing but tech demos, and hardly worth half the asking price - H3VR however is worth every cent.\n\nSo cough up your hard earned cash and support a really good dev who is working on a great product that helps show off one of the many uses of VR.\n\nHere is a gameplay video of the Early Access Week #5 build:\nhttps://youtu.be/F3WFdLio3N8","May 8","true","13.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Why is it so fun? It's hard to describe - it certainly feels like a 'manly' game where you just go in and unload clips at random stuff, yet somehow this is oddly very satisfying. As with most VR games right now, it is pricey, but definately worth it.\n\nEssentially, this is a sandbox of guns and shooting ranges, with little else. There are a few mini-games, but they feel like more of an after-thought.\n\nPros:\n+...Once again, a very nice way to show VR off to your friends.\n+Gunplay is super realistic with loading the gun, taking off the safety, etc. - and it is definately all different for each gun type.\n\nCons:\n-It is a pure sandbox. You have to find your own fun more-or-less. Because of this, mileage will very. You also have to like guns!\n\nIf you find firing guns fun, this is your jam. If not, I'd look elsewhere, or at least watch some LetsPlays before you take the plunge. Is it worth full price?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/voiderest/recommended/450540/","voiderest","Voiderest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/voiderest/","439 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is currently a firearm range simulator with additional fun features and gamemodes. Full gameplay is unknown as this in an early access game. I don't think the dev has a planned feature set and is just kind of developing the sandbox as he goes. Likely a bad sign if you want a complete game but I was willing to risk it for $20. This is less of a problem for a sandbox as it is more likely to be a collection of features anyway. The dev seems to be listening to and interacting with the player base for feedback on where things should go. I have actually spent the most VR time in this game. It is a lot of fun to check out all the guns and handfull of explosives that are currently in implemented. As far as I can tell everything is high detail and offers fairly realistic interactions.\n\nYou can load single bullets into the guns and all mags keep track of ammo count. A bullet must be chambered to fire and weapons have a safety if they do in RL. The angles of grips match that of the weapon's real life counter part although I don't know how well this works with the vive having a much different grip than most firearms. Currently there are mostly pistols but there is also 3 shotguns, 3 smgs, the M4, and a granade launcher. Most of the pistols are semi-auto but there is a revolver as well. A recent update added speed loaders which is nice as it can be kind of slow to load each round by hand.\n\nThere is a system to hold equipment on your person like a chest harness which is very handy. The menu on / triggered by the trackpad lets you teleport as well as pick stuff up from a distance. This lets you get stuff from across the room without teleporting or just lets you get something you dropped and you are too lazy to bend down. It might actually be my favorate feature. I'm playing the game in a space that is a bit too small to count as room scale but enough space to swing my arms around. It still plays fine. The dev has stated that he does not want to label the game as standing. I assume this can change in the future but currently works well for my setup thanks to the tools on the menu.","May 23","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It looks great, there are cool guns with real mechanics but thats pretty much it. We only have 1 pistol and 1 rifle, all the other stuff isn't that much fun to play with. Sure, there is some realism becasue of the guns but for $20 I would have expected a whole lot more. I cannot reccomend this game at this price to anyone. I am a huge proponet for VR and loved every single game I have bought and played so far with exception to this one.\nThe target practic is dull, the different shooting ranges all feel the same, only 2 guns to mess around with with excpetion of a grenade launcher and some grenades and dynamite. Lacking too much content. I see that it says early access so maybe there is a chance they add enough to make it worth it, otherwise they are going to have to lower this price. Maybe if they add a few more pistols, few more rifles, maybe a rocket launcher, at least 15-20 more items are needed to make it feel worth 20.  At this point I wouldn't pay more than 5-10 bucks for it. Also need to improve the target practice stuff and make better game modes. I have the utmost appreciation for the dev of this game and all VR devs out there but I feel like writing a review like this will do a service to people since there are so few of us out there. I'm not saying this is a bad game or to not support it but rather that it is just over priced.\n\nEDIT: 5/27\n\nAfter owning the game for a couple months I have decided to add to the review and edit my stance. This game is a lot more polished than some of the other stuff I have played in VR. it is in early access and I should have taken that into account more. That being said I still think there is not much to do, not many game modes yet but the most important thing to me is the Dev is working his ♥♥♥ off on this game bringing new stuff every week. The guns look great and if you treat this game as just a little gun shooting range simulator you should walk away satisfied. I think there is still a long way to go to make this a full game but just had to revise my review after playing some really crappy games made by some really lazy devs, you can see that in H3 these guys are putting in a lot of effort to make it a good game and worth the price so changing my reccomendation to yes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/recommended/450540/","thelonesoldier","Cyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/","188 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI originally bought H3 in late April and gave it a negative review at that time due to many glaring (and sometimes inexcusable) flaws in the game. I didn't expect much from the developers and ended up refunding the game.\n\nA month later, I checked in on H3 again and was startled to read about the massive changes they had made in just one month. Not since Space Engineers have I seen a game develop this rapidly. The devs have added a slew of new weapons and features that make H3 much more than the broken reloading-simulator that it was when it first launched.\n\nThis is very much a sandbox experience, but there are a lot of great features, plenty of guns to try, and lots of fun to be had. There are still some stupid little problems, but overall I think this is a solid investment if you are interested in firearms. Hell, it's probably worth the purchase price just for the gunnasium.","April 25","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just an FYI.\n\nAs the weeks go by, it's astounding to watch the amount of progress that this game makes. This developer is one of the most active and reactive that I have ever seen, so serious kudos to him.\n\nThe gameplay, guns and mechanics as it stands are 100% impeccable. BUT, it has some really basic arcadey modes, etc. And yes, there is a sandbox-ey type shooting range, but once you knocked everything over a few times, there isn't much else.\n\nI am excited to see where this game goes, and I hope that this game grows into something much more overtime, but right now, you'll be investing in watching a project take shape.","June 5","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
