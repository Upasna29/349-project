That’s a pity because this game deserves more attention, from both gamers and press. It’s a cute and sexy physics-based platformer with one goal: fun. And it succeeds splendidly in doing this.\n\nIn short Chariot throws you into a world where the King has died and you, as a Princess or her Fiancé, have to ride and pull his coffin (on wheels) towards his final resting place. The King’s spirit will guide you on your way and will let you know what he thinks of the burial places you come across. Correct, you’ll visit several burial places during the entire course of the game, because, you see, the King is hard to satisfy. On your way to these places you’ll also gather loot in the form of diamonds. This loot can later be used to upgrade your gear but more about that in just a minute.\nThis game is best played with a friend or partner because it really is a co-op experience, even though you can also get through the game by yourself just fine. However, there are a couple of sections that require that second extra player in order to be able to grab all loot, but these are all optional. Still, as someone who likes to explore it’s a bit disappointing.\nLoot can be found in the form of diamonds and later on you’ll be able to find bigger diamonds that take a few seconds to get unstuck. All you have to do is keep the chariot close, because the chariot is what collects these diamonds. A few levels in you’ll notice enemies appearing whenever you collect a big diamond. That is because collecting a big one makes noise, and this attracts enemies that will try and take you loot by assaulting the coffin. If you let them stay on it long enough they will carry a piece of loot with them. You then have a few seconds to recollect it before it’s lost forever. Of course, chasing is no choice is you have multiple enemies still assaulting the coffin. And oh, noise is not just made by collecting certain diamonds but also by dropping the coffin, or smashing it into something. You have to carefully drop it if you don’t want to attract any attention to yourself. This isn’t always easy, but it keeps the game a bit more challenging.\nSo, the game has five different environments spread over 25 levels and each level usually takes 15-45 minutes to complete, depending on how everything goes. There will be a few times where the chariot is too far away from you, and/or that you’re stuck. These moments won’t happen very often and even then you can easily reset the game and return to the last checkpoint by pressing and holding a button. The most important lesson you’ll learn is to keep yourself attached to the coffin, because once it’s on its way you can’t stop it that easily.\nThe levels branch off sometimes and each one of these levels usually has more than one entrance. These entrances open up once you complete more levels and you can then go back and enter from a different part and continue your quest there. These new entrances usually only give you a couple of minutes of playtime because they can usually be found halfway through the level or near the end. But still, it’s a great idea and one that’s quite original I think.\nYou’ll be pulling and pushing the coffin in a non-linear way. I don’t mean to say that this is an open world game, because it’s not, but you won’t be going in a straight line is what I actually meant to say.\nThere are a lot of times where you’ll be pulling up the coffin to higher platforms, dropping it straight down or riding (and jumping !) it forward. In all these cases the physics were realistically mimicked and not once did I think that something wasn’t possible or unrealistic. These physics are what make the platforming fun, because you have no idea how it will all react to, let’s say, snowy and icy segments. There are a few areas that don’t work as well as they should. The trampolines are the perfect example here; these are unreliable and take way too much time to pull off perfectly. In addition to that you also have to be a bit lucky. But thankfully, this is pretty much the only real ‘flaw’ I could find.\nIn every level there are three silver skulls to be collected. These skulls are hidden throughout the levels and once found will be added to your Vault. They serve no particular purpose as far as I can tell. But there are also blueprints to be found in each level and once you’ve collected enough of these you can upgrade your character’s abilities or coffin with things like pegs (that allow you to attach your rope to a surface) or a light (so that your coffin can ride through dimly-lit environments.\nThe blueprints can be collected by taking some sort of crate with you. These can be found in certain spots. You just ride under them with your coffin, it will then be loaded onto your coffin and off you go. All you have to do then is find a shredder that ultimately gives you the blueprint. But to do this you have to push and pull it as well. And the thing is, if you can’t keep it straight for a certain period it will be destroyed. So you have to balance it from time to time to prevent this from happening.\nBy the way, the abilities can be upgraded even further, with longer durations and shorter cooldowns. You just have to find more of them.\nBut the true and only real goal, of course, still remains to visit the best burial place for the King. This is why you’ll be frequently revisiting previously completed levels in order to find these places. It’s fun to revisit a level and start from a different entrance because there are always some new places to find, including loot and secrets.\n\nAnd wow, these graphics are just wonderful. They are colorful and even though the game has a bit of a sad vibe to it it’s all shown in a cute and detailed way, where you’ll still frequently see your character(s) smiling. Nothing depressing here; the art style is just amazing with some excellent subtle graphical effects here and there. It’s magical to see flowers pop-up from out of nowhere or to see ice reflect your image. All very cool stuff.\nThe music has a bit of a medieval vibe to it all and the voice acting is amazing. You won’t hear your characters chatting or anything but the King’s ghost will frequently talk about certain (hazardous) situations and what he thinks of a specific burial place. The vendor also speaks, but he mostly produces one-liners. Unfortunately, these usually aren’t very funny. But they’re still well made nevertheless.\nThe quality of this game is amazingly high, let me tell you.\n\nI expected to play a fun game here but nothing this fun. Chariot succeeds on many levels and can easily stand on its own between many of the bigger budget platformers out there. It’s a game that I will gladly recommend and I hope enough people will (eventually) agree with me.\nThis game needs more attention and I hope this review will at least give it a little push towards success. But it still needs all the help it can get, so come on everyone and let’s make this happen.\nIt’s crystal clear to see how much effort and love was put into it and this is the reason why you should be playing games in the first place.\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","November 12, 2014","true","9.1"," 77 of 94 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","77","94","0","0"

I thought it was going to be another simple yet endearing platformer with straight-forward mechanics and tranquil atmosphere.\n\nBoy was I wrong.  The difficulty curve on this game is very steep, and goes near vertical at the end.  Never have a played a more unfair, un-fun, absolutely punishing game like this.  I made a steadfast attempt to complete this game, but the fact that you are locked out of 100% completion by a controller-throwingly hard hidden level is almost baffling.\n\nI've gone through much of the game in both single player and co-op, and the results are roughly the same.  Initial levels are simple, and actually enjoyable.  After you leave the starting zone, the game kicks up the difficulty in all the wrong ways.  Slippery ledges, timed switches, needless enemies, weird flippy bridges. It makes this game an overall chore to play.\n\nTo add insult to injury, some levels are repetitive and excessively long.  A couple of the sections are more tedious than difficult, forcing you through five minute platforming ordeals, only for you to slip and fall to some unforeseeable physics glitch or auxiliary mechanic.  At which point, you have to pick yourself back up, and do it again a couple more times with similar results.  The game goes from enjoyable to unbearable very quickly.  You know something is wrong when you greet every checkpoint with a "God, finally".\n\nIt strains my brain to think why this was the intended difficulty.  Who is the target audience for this game?  Is this really supposed to be a casual buddy co-op game?  If so, it's far too difficult in its current state.\n\nI can really only recommend this to the most masochistic of co-op players, or perhaps the most suicidal of single-players.","June 6, 2015","false","30.0"," 60 of 78 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","60","78","6","4"

The king has passed, and your duty as the princess is to deliver him in his coffin to his final resting place. Navigating your way through the catacombs and caves by pushing, pulling and riding his coffin may seem easy at first but the gameplay definitely gets more complicated as you move through the levels. There is a bit of humor in the game as well, the dead king's spirit will speak to you with funny comments and suggestions about what to do at some points. Upon completing levels you can unlock alternate entrances to them along with speedrun availabilty which creates a lot more return playability for levels.  Cooperative gameplay is available(Couch Co-op, Not Online), and the other player gets to play as the princess's fiance. Playing cooperatively also changes the gameplay a little making some things easier, and some things a lot harder. There is also areas in the levels designed specifically for 2 players and you will need a partner if you plan on getting some of those gems that require 2 people. If you can get a friend to play this with you, I'd recommend doing so as it really adds more fun to playing. Chariot is also not very compatible with a keyboard and mouse so having a controller is Highly recommended for easier gameplay. Remember people, Xbox controllers are plug and play on PC.\nSo.... if moving dead bodies is your thing or something your good at for some reason. I won't question why, but I will tell you that youre gonna want to grab this game and convince a friend to get it too!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs0QFlCa8lA","November 14, 2014","true","2.9"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","1"

I saw it on the Xbox One in a Giantbomb quick look. I was waiting for it to come to PC, then one day I searched for it and was suprised to learn it had come out with basically no hurrah.\n\nAnyway it is one of the best couch co-op games I have played. I imagine it would be kind of a lonely experience to play alone, but with a friend it is excellent. You pull along a dead king in his Chariot, he comes out as a ghost to berate you for not finding him a good enough resting place so you continue on a journey through underground catacombs.\n\nYou need to keep the king's chariot near you most of the time, as you can't pick up gems or collectables on your own. So your two characters "physics puzzle" (best verb) their way through the world with the king in tow. You just need to watch a short video to get a feel for how the game plays but in essence it feels very smooth and manageable to get around. It is surprisingly effortless to get the chariot over bumpy terrain and on and off platforms, though I feel bad for the guy and girl who are doing it.\n\nI thought perhaps having to look after the king might become a burden after a while, like one long escort mission, but because the chariot won't move on its own (unless you leave it on a slope of course) and you have such fine controls to move it around, it hasn't gotten frustrating yet.\n\nThe game also looks great, very crisp. If anything lets it down it is these dark levels half way through, they are quite oppressive compared to the earlier game, I am hoping they don't continue like that because it really bums me out when you miss lots of things because you can't see, it forces you to compulsively explore every nook and cranny which isn't really that fun (Edit: Watched a trailer, looks like they don't stay dark, it is just a few levels, so all is well!).\n\nOverall though it is very nice to look at, very enjoyable to play moment to moment and a lot of the puzzles, especially the special gem ones that require two players, can be very challenging. My friend remarked that it kind of feels like a game Nintendo could have made and I can understand that. Nothing that bad every really happens, except now and then a bat might steal some of your loot.\n\nThat skeleton needs to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up though seriously skeleton shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.","December 6, 2014","true","8.4"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

You are on a quest to gather riches, and to find a suitable final resting place for the king. Beautiful graphics also make this game a high reccomendation :) You can also grab a player 2 to join you and help you gather more precious jewels *I have yet to know how I can rate 2 player games* But I bet it would be great!

You are a princess who has to take her father's funerary chariot around to amass a treasure worthy of a royal burial.  The game mechanics of this physics based puzzle game are easy to grasp and pretty much acts in the way you think it should, which makes the barrier to entry low enough that I just started playing the game with a friend in co-op and was immediately able to manage my way pushing and pulling the wheeled casket (chariot) around the obsticles and puzzles.  The game has special co-op only areas which, when playing co-op, just beg to be solved since you can only find the solution with two people.\n\nOverall this is a very fun game to play and I highly recommend it!","January 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It IS a fairly polished game.\n\nThe problem is that it's just not a fun game under all of that polish. I mean, is that really all there is to do in the game? Tug around a crate on wheels that sucks up money? Your characters move so slow in the game it feels like you're wearing fat suits, and you constantly feel like you're being restrained. If you leave the casket for move than a few seconds (and it takes you ten to move a screen length to begin with), a timer starts ticking down and you (or it) will die. So it's even annoying trying to explore a potential pathway.\n\nMy wife and I are always looking to find games to play together. I'm a hardcore gamer, she's more casual. We've been playing hours and hours of Splunky--but it's so hard for her that I wanted something more casual for us. This game looked like it fit the bill... but while it's much more relaxed, it does so at the cost of excitement. There's nothing much going on. It's just rolling that casket, pulling it up and down, and that's it.\n\nAnd I REALLY wanted to like this game from the first chance I heard about it.","May 6, 2015","false","3.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

Developer Frima have graced us with the amazingness that is Chariot. A humorous, physics-based, couch co-op platformer.\n\nChariot takes us on a crazy adventure through the royal catacombs with the Princess, her Fiance, and the corpse of her father, the King. With the comedic commentary stylings provided by her father’s spirit (or ghost dad, if you will). What has brought them all to the catacombs? Well His Majesty has decided the place that should have been his final resting place just wasn’t good enough. So Princess and her Fiance have to push, pull, ride and swing the King’s funeral casket on wheels through the catacombs until they find a resting place that tickles his fancy. He’s pretty demanding, even after death.\nFor the rest of the review, please visit, http://gamershonesttruth.com/chariot-review/","December 3, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I highly reccomend having a controller to play it, however. The music is great, the art is simply fantastic, and local co-op is a blast.

However, I feel that in Chariot, the majority of your gameplay will be wondering why a physics based platformer has terrible physics and terrible platforming.\n\nPhysics was a major issue for me. Because I played in Single-player, I used the tie down ability (first item in the game) a lot to help me out. Through this, though, I discovered that while hanging from a rope, you could move left/right and you would almost reach parallel to the ground. Another problem is the rope itself. Whenever you jump your character give the rope some slack but does not let go, this is ok. However, what is not ok is forcing the character to somehow lose all momentum because you decided to give the rope More slack.\n\nAnother major issue is level design, which I found to be horrible. The levels offer a forked round marked by a sign with a color and the number of stars which represent the difficulty of the path. The problem is that these paths only give moeny. Rewarding money in any other game would be fine, since money's value is backed by the player's interest in progression. In other games money would mean getting better things and all. However, in this game money only allows you to buy new equipment that has been unlocked. However, new equipment comes so rarely within the first 6 gruelingly long levels that it becomes unrewarding to collect money.\n\nAnother serious problem for this game is the core mechanic. In Chariot you pull a wheeled-casket to different objectives. But holy ♥♥♥♥, holding the rope for the entirity of the level is boring. The main aspect of this game's platforming is climbing ♥♥♥♥ and pulling up the casket, which means pulling your cart in position, jumping on the cart, jumping to the next platform, pressing down, and then pulling up the casket.\nYou can expect to see this obstacle to be the majority of your gameplay.","February 26","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are huge and mostly boring to complete. I didn't understand how certain things work in the game.

This is the short attention span summary of my review: Chariot is a puzzle/platformer where up to two players pull a cart housing a recently deceased king around a crypt in hopes of picking up treasure and dumping it off in a place his ghost won’t whine about. The presentation is mostly well done, with a unique visual style, though it could use some work in the audio department. Likewise, the mechanics and level design are very solid, though the various stages feel like they drag on a bit. It also could’ve done with an online co-op functionality. Still, if you’re looking for an imaginative platforming experience for you and a friend, Chariot is a safe bet.","October 16, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

She is kind of pulling a coffin with her father corpse, so she can bury it somewhere, but the kind, even while being pretty much dead is not giving her any breaks, like "Guuurl, I want to be buried like a king, so get me to the best spot and bury me with my money" and there you go, traveling from a place to place, pulling your dead father's carcass in a coffin on wheels with a psychotic smile, hearing him talking and seeing talking skeletons and stuff. Why would they do that to their princess? Do they really want the new ruler of their kingdom to suffer from a coctail of several traumatic experiences and mental illneses? Well, anyway, I got carried away a bit...\n\nThe game is good and fun, you should buy it to your kid instead of Call Of Duty.","August 30, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I downloaded this game without hesistation because I love playing adventure co-op games with the partner for hours of joyful fun, but after an hour or so, it started to go downhill, but I'll get to the issues as they come to mind.\n\nGameplay & Story - 7/10 - You drag a dead king in a box to lay him to rest in a suitable area, but sorry, your resting place is in another plot of land! That's the main plot of the story thus far for me, which looks like is the whole game, the gameplay is addictive for completionists, but leaves me frustrated when the game doesnt allow you to get that thing which is arms length away due to an item you get later on in the story, it's frustrating to not get the best score possible just because we haven't completed it yet.\n\nSound 8/10 - The sounds are okay, nothing special, the latch onto the coffin thing to save it from oblivion will be heard alot, and the caves arne't too bad, but it's nothing too noticeable, feels the same every level.\n\nVisuals 8/10 - I would give this game a higher score for visuals, but I just cant when so many things look the same, no memorable landmarks and nothing that wows me, apart from the pretty plants that bloom from the chariot, and the glimmering lights alongside pretty collectable gems, which is a nice touch.\n\nIssues - As well as what was mentioned in the Gameplay paragraph, there are technical issues that have made us quit the  game a few times, again, the concept is great and so is the game, but here are the things that should be fixed\n\n- Controller jams up, and one player takes the form of an out of control chicken in Zelda, rendering the player useless to maintain control of him or herself, the "chicken" will fly around in the air whilst holding onto the chariot, this can only be fixed by disconnecting the controller and trying again, losing your stance if you are currently holding the chariot.\n\n-Whilst climbing your own rope, you can glitch and fling yourself somewhere unexpected if you have the chariot in a tight position\n\n-The physics of the game are not explained clearly, I know we shouldn't have hand holding, but some things punish you too much for falling off a ledge (Yes I'm looking at you Co-op challenges and platforms the side of a pea)\n\n-The "maze system" and multiple paths are opinionated, some parts you can't get to can be annoying and having to pause just to see the map is a bore, halting the experience, mainly what was explained earlier, completing a level perfectly doesn't mean you did great, just means you're going to want to grab it all again when the story takes you back through the area.\n\nVerdict 7-10 - I can't say it's a bad game, it's very pretty and feels good in my Steam Libary, but I also can't say it's great, I'm hoping to keep playing it but the issues are too frustrating to ignore, even after coming back fresh and ready to try again, I shall recommend The Chariot, but I'm skeptical about doing so, fix the issues, and everybody's happy","August 4, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
