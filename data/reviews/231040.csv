The title suggests this game is all about music and in a way it is, but don't expect something like Bit.Trip Runner, Symphony or Audiosurf here. Beatbuddy is an action adventure where your enemies produce the sounds resulting in a track for each of the six levels. The levels themselves are big and should take you around 30-45 minutes to finish. So completing the game will take you about 5-6 hours. I can tell you that that's more than enough because Beatbuddy just doesn't have enough variety to keep things interesting for much longer than that. True, it introduces new puzzles and enemies in every level that you play, like so many other games really, but for Beatbuddy is just isn't enough.\n\nPlus, the fact that I experienced 2 game breaking bugs made me realize that Beatbuddy is a good game, but nothing groundbreaking. I can understand that a game has bugs, as long as they don't break the game but for a game that's 2D and somewhat linear it's unforgiving. Especially if it's such a short experience.\nOn the other hand; the levels are well made and have beautiful art so it's not all bad.\n\nMy advice to you: grab it when it's on sale.\n\n[Rating: 65/100]","August 15, 2013","true","5.9"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","54","62","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stakmaster/recommended/231040/","Stakmaster","StakAttak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stakmaster/","513 products in account","I really, REALLY wanted to love Beatbuddy. Games that incorporate music into their gameplay are kind of my thing, and to the game's credit it does start out VERY strong. The first half hour or so is incredibly fun and inventive as you experience how the game layers beats on top of each other to create the main song of the level, and discovering each new creature and how it interacts with the soundtrack and Beatbuddy gameplay wise is incredibly novel. Sadly the gameplay fails to stay fresh for very long, relying on the same bounce pad and reflector tile gameplay for the majority of the game, which is pretty disappointing for a game that's only 3 hours long.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice are how floaty the controls feel. The game (appears) to be set underwater, so that point can be somewhat forgiven, but if you're playing with a keyboard and mouse the poor controls are really put front and center. The majority of the game is based upon interacting with your environment, using keys in locks, hitting things to the beat, etc. However this quickly becomes INFURIATING when Beatbuddy simply refuses to pick up an object or swim a certain direction, ESPECIALLY in time sensitive situations. I can count on one hand the times during my playthrough that Beatbuddy picked up or placed an object where I wanted to the first time without having to click the mouse repeatedly. Another totally bizarre control issue is that Beatbuddy will occasionally just stop listening to your commands altogether and swim in completely random directions, sometimes coinciding with your mouse being over the foreground art but sometimes due to nothing at all. All this leads to a very obnoxious gameplay experience at best, and a potentially maddening one at worst. Eventually you get used to it (about 30 minutes before the end, unfortunately) but when the game throws handfuls of enemies at you at once and you're being helplessly knocked around while the game ignores mouse input, or given a time sensitive puzzle and Beatbuddy flat out REFUSES to pick up an essential piece of the puzzle in a timely manner, you can't help but feel let down.\n\nThankfully Beatbuddy is forgiven some of its gameplay missteps with a very charming art style, which is a 3D character model on top of very beautiful layered 2D art, although for a musically driven game the soundtrack is surprisingly mediocre, save for a few standouts. While the first level is designed extremely well in regards to introducing not only the layers of song throughout the level in a gradual and fun way, but also the creatures of the world and how they interact with you and the song, that detail seems to go out the window past the first few levels. The soundtrack becomes just the backdrop as the game progresses instead of a major gameplay element, with a few exceptions of course. The fact that the game forgoes a lot of these fun ways to introduce the song of the level compounded with the hit or miss controls and the fact that you see most of what the gameplay has to offer very early on makes the Beatbuddy segments seem like filler until you get to the next vehicle sequence, which is when you get to hear the level's song in its entirety (or as much as they were allowed to play, as the "level's song in its entirety" actually only ever ends up being maybe a 15 second loop of a chunk of the chorus). It began to feel like I was just chugging through the same old bounce pad, reflector tile and collect the gems sequences as Beatbuddy until I got to play the next vehicle segment, which turned out to be the game I ACTUALLY wanted to play.\n\nAs for the story, it serves its purpose. For a 3 hour game it does its job. The characters are all very likeable and cute, too. Their designs are pretty unique and fit the world well, and they all speak in their own style of beatbox which is pretty endearing. The game has some decent humor in the way of your companion, Clef, dismissing the very clearly falling apart vehicle you both ride in and the Prince character doing some very tongue-in-cheek villain things. Slight spoiler alert here, but the ending seems to happen all at once and with very little fanfare which is very disappointing. For a big, boisterous music game I was expecting a large boss battle with some rousing music, but the ending really comes out of nowhere and happens very quietly. For a short little music game like this I suppose it's fine, I was just hoping for more.\n\nEven with all that being said, there's still something about Beatbuddy. I'd be totally lying if I said a few of the songs weren't still stuck in my head, and I beat it in one sitting and didn't want to stop, which is saying a lot nowadays. Maybe it was because I wanted to see what the next level was going to look like, or what new mechanic they would introduce, or maybe I just wanted to hear what the next song would be. Unfortunately with the gameplay flaws and short gametime Beatbuddy comes off as less of a good videogame and more of a really enjoyable interactive music video. If that's fine to you, by all means pick up this game. If you're really pining for a new music game, pick up this game. For everyone else I'd say maybe avoid this one. Pick up some of the greats (Audiosurf, Beat Hazard, etc.) or maybe get it on sale.","March 30, 2014","false","3.8"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","60","72","0","0"

While it's got a lot going for it, I just can't get past how buggy it is. Although I did manage to complete it, it wasn't without some serious issues. Several times I got stuck in various ways that prevented further progress - sometimes it was a matter of a game event not triggering properly, and sometimes it was due to going some way the game wasn't expecting me to (apparently). I also encountered issues where the controls would just stop working for no reason. Restoring to the last checkpoint sometimes fixes the issue, but this is rarely the case. Most times, there is no choice but to start the level (or entire chapter) from scratch. Do you know how annoying it is to have 30-40 minutes of progress wiped out, have to start over again, and hope you don‚Äôt make the same game-breaking mistake again (whatever it was)? Let me tell you - it's really f%@*&g annoying. I ended up having to do that multiple times. And would you believe, as a final bug-ridden cherry on top, the very end of the game also glitched out on me as well? Well, believe it. So on top of all the other frustration I experienced just getting through the game, I didn‚Äôt even get to see the full conclusion of the story.\n\nNow, putting all of that aside, what‚Äôs actually good about Beatbuddy? Quite a bit, actually. The hand-drawn layered 2D graphics look great, the controls are responsive, the puzzles are generally well-designed, and the music is decent. And that‚Äôs a good thing, because the music plays a large part in the gameplay - the environment works in time with the beat of the music, requiring specific timing to pass obstacles or solve puzzles. The first couple of hours are great, as the basic mechanics are introduced. Unfortunately, it starts to lose its luster a little bit after that, as most of the subsequent puzzles are pretty much variations on things you‚Äôve already done several times. So you might start to get tired of it after a while (or maybe I was just burned out from having to replay several areas). I would estimate the overall playtime to be somewhere around 4-6 hours.\n\nOverall, the game is not bad, and I enjoyed it while it was working properly. The frustration from all of the technical issues I had just ended up being too much for me to give it a full recommendation. If you enjoy action/puzzle sidescrollers, music-themed games, and/or games with pretty 2D artwork, it‚Äôs definitely worth a look. Just be aware of the potential issues. I suppose it could very well be possible that you'd encounter no glitches at all‚Ä¶ but I doubt it (several posts in the Steam forums seem to corroborate my experience). At the very least, don‚Äôt buy it at full price unless the developers hire more QA people and/or release a patch that fixes the game-breaking issues.","August 24, 2014","false","7.2"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

I'm talking about those titles that fill up the lower end of the Steam Sales, and they show up as coupons that you get but you wonder what the game is, and whether or not you should commit to it despite the lower cost of entry. Beatbuddy is one such example of those games. It's not perfect, and could use a little more polish, but it's a solid idea for a first outing by the team at Threaks.\n\nBeatbuddy stars it's titular character who has awoken from slumber and must save his friends from the nefarious prince of Symphonia. It's not a terribly deep story, but it does give you the sense of purpose necessary to proceed through the game. It's a bit of a short adventure, clocking it at just under six hours to get through your first time. Whether you'll go back or not depends on the amount of collectibles you found during your experience and how much you care to see the inner workings of Beatbuddy's development. The extras that are unlocked are a lot of storyboards telling about how Beatbuddy came in to being, and how Threaks has spent the past four years trying to get this game off the ground. Let it be known that game development is never an easy task.\n\nThe biggest star of Beatbuddy though is its excellent soundtrack that contains some choice tunes from Austin Wintory, Europa Deep, Parov Stelar, Sabrepulse, Curtis Newton, and La Rochelle Band. Each stage features a song by these artists and serves as the backbone to the experience of Beatbuddy, and it's interesting to see how the guys at Threaks managed to break down elements of each song and make them part of the gameplay. The only negative here is that the stages tend to be thirty to forty minutes long, and while the tracks themselves are good and are broken up really well, there is still that same sense of music droning on, and if you happen to get stuck during a particular puzzle, it starts to get a little grating.\n\nAt its core, Beatbuddy is a puzzle-adventure game with musical elements that make timing on some puzzles a much bigger factor than you'd normally expect. The rather gentle tutorial stage gets you in the swing of things, showing you how each stage's musical elements come in to play. Like snare crabs that when knocked out cause the surrounding slugs to retract, opening a path forward. But the hook here is how the creatures and puzzle elements all move in time with the music, and knocking out the crabs will cut that part of the musical track out, but you'll be given audio cues along with visual ones to let you know that they're about to come back and potentially impede your progress once again. Once the tutorial is complete, more puzzle elements come in to play that require you to deftly maneuver Beatbuddy through some tight situations and eventually some light combat comes in to play. It never gets to the point of being overly challenging, although there are a few times where some of the ricochet puzzles seem to be a bit too clever for their own good and require a little too much precision from the player, making them seem overly difficult.\n\nThis game also has a fair share of bugs that can wipe out the progress you've made on a particular level. I ran in to one instance where I died against some enemies and when I respawned and defeated them, the puzzle elements that they blocked did not become available. And since this was tied to the auto-save, I had to restart the entire level. This wouldn't be a problem if the levels weren't so long. These aren't rampant bugs, but it pays to be very careful when playing through, and thankfully Threaks has been issuing updates to address some of these, so it's quite possible that this may be resolved by the time you're reading this review.\n\nThis game is certainly pleasant to look at, thanks to its wonderfully colorful aesthetic. The animation of Beatbuddy and his friends is also rather impressive, even though they don't move around a whole lot, their idle animations show a lot of love went into making each of them feel unique. And hearing their speaking as beatboxing to the music is also a clever addition. The hand-drawn backgrounds have an element of Rayman to them, though they can get a little repetitive if you stop and stare for too long.\n\nI don't really talk about controls much, but I have to say, play this game with a gamepad, or even a keyboard, because the mouse controls make a lot of the timing puzzles difficult to deal with. I spent a majority of my time playing with a mouse, and found it to be a bit detrimental to the experience, especially after I switched to a gamepad. The keyboard option is there as well, though the devs don't recommend using it.\n\nThe music is a big draw for the game, and while the levels could have benefited from a bit of fat trimming, they complement the music nicely. For a first effort, the guys at Threaks have certainly gotten off on the right foot. Hopefully they'll have more titles in the future that combine their excellent audio work with their well-crafted visuals.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 27, 2014","true","31.1"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

When you're outside of the submarine, the music is disjointed, the music is made by the enemies usally to the beat of the music. Snare crabs, bass flowers, etc. When in the submarine, the music sounds pretty good as all the sounds are put together however it's on such a short loop that you'll tire of it quickly. The game moving to the soundtrack was a cool concept but it's execution leaves me wishing that it did more with the actual music.\n\nThe objective of the game is to solve puzzles and get from one point to another on a 2D plane. The puzzles are boring. They are fairly simple and are pretty much the entire game. The stages are extremely long, about 30 minutes  a piece with the same 3 minute track on repeat.\n\nUnfortunatly I cannot recommend this game at 14.99.

The main feature that lets this game is exactly that, the game. The gameplay is sloppy and poorly executed, often you will find you must send input at an odd off-beat to the music, not exactly off-beat, but at a completely different timing. The levels within the game begin to become overly repetitive and mostly the music is never fully playing, with the small loops of songs only having one or two 'instruments' playing at any one time. This sort of dissociation with the environment creates a very unsatisfying experience, ending mostly in failure to complete a level in good time or simply a rage-quit.\nConclusively this is a great game, save for the gameplay elements.","June 19, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At first glance it looks like Beatbuddy does a good job of bringing that concept into reality. Unfortunately that just isn't so.\n\nOn the 3rd of 6 levels I ran into not one, but two different level breaking bugs that required a restart from the beginning of the stage. Exiting to the menu and continuing from last checkpoint did not fix either problem. I stopped playing the game after that. Normally I would persevere through these kind of issues but this brings up Beatbuddy's other fatal flaw: it's not fun to play.\n\nAt its core Beatbuddy is a pretty simple 2D exploration game. The environment moves to the music but your character does not. That detachment from the beat makes playing the game feel like any other average 2D adventure game. Couple that with collectable shards that are completely worthless unless you get every single one within a level (e.g., 411/412 won't cut it!) and you're in for a ho-hum experience.\n\nDon't let Beatbuddy's snazzy soundtrack and visuals fool you; save yourself some time and money by just listening to the soundtrack on YouTube.","June 4, 2014","false","2.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The music style is closer to electric, beatbox, and dubstep.  (Sorry dubstep fans, I didn‚Äôt hear any wub wub wub) The gameplay itself was more focused on solving puzzles.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u7hb9yM6ug\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: There are two cinematic throughout the game, the beginning video and ending video, you  are the character ‚Äúbeat‚Äù who has been awoken from his sleep and must save the other two guardians and go back to sleep. The guardians are the ones who create the music for the world, so it‚Äôs of the utmost importance that they all go back to sleep soon.\n\nGame Play: The game itself plays to the music, everything is done in rhythm, if you‚Äôre boosting, you need to do it in rhythm, if you‚Äôre hitting a parasite, it‚Äôs in rhythm. There are two ‚Äúplay modes‚Äù that you experience in the game, one in a ‚Äúbeatbuggie‚Äù where you‚Äôre in a vehicle that bounces along to the music on its own, the other is when you‚Äôre just swimming through the water as Beat.\nAs I indicated in my quick review, the game is quite focused on the music quality, and but to me the gameplay was focused on rather simple fun puzzles. I had been playing the game A Virus Named TOM for the past week, so the puzzles were very simple and relaxed compared to my earlier game.\n\nAchievements: First time playing through I got the majority of the achievements (this pleases me, I want to get through my indie games sometime this year) There are the notorious ‚Äúspeed run the game‚Äù and ‚Äúcollect all the things‚Äù  achievements, but as a whole most of the achievements you will earn simply by playing through the game once.\n\nPrice: Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians costs $9.99, that‚Äôs a consistent price for indie games on steam apparently, I‚Äôd suggest waiting for a steam sale, or purchase the game in a humble bundle. I noticed there is also a demo you can download and test out. As always; if you‚Äôre really interested in getting a game, checking out a demo is always a smart way to go.\nFor me on my personal value system (price divided by time equals value) I only played 5 hours of the game until I had It completely beaten, I do intend to go back and try to get tougher achievements, however 5 hours of entertainment for $9.99 would be too hefty for me. For most other people though, that‚Äôs a perfectly reasonable price.\n\nConclusion: I really enjoyed this game, I found myself bobbing my head with the music as my character dodged with the music. I would recommend this game to anyone who really wants to play a game with A) Great music B) A beat-based music Game.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update May 26, 2015:\nAdded a link to my updated version of the review -- my YouTube video!","May 13, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The scenes of undersea here aren't dark and quiet but lively and bright. The design of the stages with the concept of the beat sound from objects which are interative and those which aren't have their own styles.\nSecond, the puzzles here are simple. However, the standard about difficulty of puzzles is different based on players' different gaming experience and the experience they're seeking from thie game. To me, puzzle games don't have to be hard to challenge but simple to relax myself.So, in my opinion, if you don't want to beat it one day after playing several hours but just relax yourself by playing games, it's good for you, too.\nLast but not least, the game will be around 2 bucks on sale, which is pretty cheap to get. If you're pretty sure that this game is your type or at least you won't hate this game, I would say it's worth the price with the hours you spend enjoying youself.","August 17, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You work your way through worlds that react to the rhythm around them, and by interacting with things, you can progress. But sadly, it's just a glorified platformer that doesn't bring anything new or fun to the table. Nothing even FEELS music based - it just so happens that things pulse to the beat, but you're not really rewarded for good timing or anything - you just move through a world that plays music.\nThe first level took me half an hour to complete, going at a reasonable pace. In that time, I could see that the game was trying to be funny and trying to have intriguing plot elements, but by the end of the first level I was bored, nothing had me hooked, and I quit the game without caring where the story was going.\n\nI sadly cannot recommend this game, but to try and give a positive outcome to my review, I would recommend that you, the reader, try playing Aquaria.\nAquaria is a slightly similar game with underwater platforming metroidvania-style play, some musical aspects to gameplay, and a great plot.

Its one of the better ones Ive found in a rhythm game, and I like how they incorporated it into the actual gameplay and environment. I liked having to time my hits to break through bubbles or to break those flower things in the later levels. I can see how some people might get irritated with it though because the game is set underwater, and you have a bit of lag/delay. It isnt too bad to get used to though.\n\nGraphics were pretty nice too. I loved the animations, especially the idle ones. The environment was a little same-y after awhile (lot of recoloring it seemed like), but still gorgeous.\n\nControls (especially vehicle ones) werent my favorite, but luckily they dont stick you in the bubble car very often. Trying to actually time the speed boost in the vehicle was a bit irritating, but holding the right click seemed to do it automatically, so I cant complain too much.\n\nThe puzzles themselves werent too bad. None of them were overly complicated or frustrating, but some did get a little repetitive in the earlier levels. Still pretty enjoyable though.\n\nThe story is one of the weaker parts of the game. It isnt the strongest story out there, and the characters arent very memorable. Personally, I think the gameplay more than makes up for the weak story though.\n\nIts different, which is nice to see with so many puzzle platformers out there. The controls take getting used to, but once you do it plays very well. The audio is beyond relaxing and the environments are gorgeous.

You follow the music and go with the beat. It doesn't work out well.\n\nThe best parts of the game are with the vehicle since the beat part of the game is actually working and the music is usually at full blast there. Till then you usually have to solve really dull puzzles. (Imagine doing mirror puzzles from Zelda, but you get those puzzles CONSTANTLY.) and when you're not in the vehicle part, the music is really really slow and just not there. You're expected to follow the beat, but the Beatbuddy thing doesn't really follow it at all.\n\nIf this game could be JUST vehicle stuff, I'd be able to recommend it. It would be good enough. But as it is, even 2.50? I don't think so.

In a nutshell, it does have a funky take on mechanics and the music - and the sound bumps - are really pretty cool (though it grated on me after a while of playing it - it's relatively constant). When I started playing, the first thing I noticed is that the bumpity music part of the game really isn't as ongoing as you might think. You bounce off "bass drum" bumpers, you have to time yourself to move through tom-tom-like globes, you have to hit high-hat-crabs. To an extent, it does work, but it just doesn't really get executed quite perfectly enough.\n\nIf you do pick this one up, force yourself to watch through the introduction story, at least half way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/231040/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Suprisingly solid game, with just a few problems that bring it down. First off, the main character and his friend are awesome. Little things like leaving him to stand still prompt him to choose one of multiple dance moves that align to the beat, are a nice touch. There is some awesome music and having gameplay and mechanics align with the music and beat are a new and inventive touch. Some of the middle levels lose the quality music and just seem like opera music that doesn't really fit the level and the gameplay doesn't rely as much on it which is disappointing. Also multiple different beats and songs per level would have been better than just one. Problems are a lack of difference as levels, as each one looks and feels the exact same. Another problem is the game uses the same few puzzle, enemies, and game mechanics for the entire game, leading to way too much repeition. There are also numerous reported bugs, some of which you must restart the entire level over again for, such as I had to, which can lead to 20-30 minutes of lost time. Seeing as how the game has been out a while not as many bugs should persist as you see reported on the message boards. The ending is anticlimactic. More of the game should have been spent platforming/fighting enemies etc as opposed to just breaking barriers which bouncers and moving gateway triggers. The levels are big and have multiple branching paths which can be confusing because you have to spend way too much time solving similar puzzles. Some levels such as running from something, or guiding the way for someone, break up the monotony, but are too few and far between. I would there would have been more of those different type of levels. Each level boils down to using the ship and the guy, each of which feels like the last time you used them. Still a fun game and inventive way to incorporate music into it all. Also there is the cuteness factor. 7.5/10","January 1, 2015","true","17.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AQuestion/recommended/231040/","AQuestion","Question","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AQuestion/","1092 products in account","Nothing particularly bad about this, just completely not notable in any way in my opinion. Felt very run of the mill. It's not awful or bad even, it's just a way to pass a few hours I guess. But there are more or less objectively better ways to do that (like I'm sorry, I understand that it's opinion but I really think that if you're a person that's been playing video games for any semi-significant length of time at all, you will think this is very generic--I think that's a fairly reasonable assumption to make). The game just doesn't feel like it has any identity or reason for existence beyond "another indie 2D platformer/puzzle game in a sea of indie 2D platformer/puzzle games".\n\nIts underwater so you're not tethered to the ground in the 2D space. Has some strong music (I mean it's called Beatbuddy and it's sorta music-themed in concept so the music is fairly varied and not bad). 6 Levels, about 40-60m each. Really not challenging at all, even near the end as the difficulty ramped up, everything was fairly easy. Honestly, any difficulty or annoyance came almost entirely from the annoyingly floaty controls (I used mouse option, there are "Keyboard" and "Gamepad"  options as well. It's never bad enough to hinder progress though, as the difficulty isn't high at all as mentioned for it to become a massive headache. The "puzzles" are all very on-rails, you don't have to think, it's just sorta "pull lever, push crate" (figuratively). A lot of repeating puzzle pieces just thrown together in different ways throughout the game, more pieces as you go further.\n\nThe game seems to be into this idea that the beat of the music tracks in each of its level is synchronized to various environmental elements and mechanics of its puzzles, and while this might be technically true (i.e., an object you can interact with that serves as like a bounce-pad is pulsating to the beat), in practice I never found myself actually concerned with using that to help me *play the game*, which it sort of advertises as a selling point, but also via it's early tutorial. This might be somewhat subjective, as maybe other people would use that more as a play tool, but I found it far easier to just ignore all that and use visual cues as in any other game (i.e. if there are like spikes that drop and raise, even if they "cycle" with the song, it's easier to just watch the spikes and then time your passage...).\n\nGraphics are uh, fine. Somewhat pretty , levels look repetitive (similar art assets I mean) but they all sort of have a cartoony stylization. Really nothing eye-popping, definitely far from the most beautiful 2D game I've seen, recently or otherwise. Look at some screenshots to judge of course.\n\nI encountered a bug in Level 5 , where upon going through a door and the camera starting to zoom out on the environment after a certain puzzle, the client crashed literally every time (Unity engine error). Was not a 1-time thing, always hapspened as I moved the character through this point. After looking around and finding no solution, I verified game cache and that seemed to work. Notably, the game hitched and stuttered , but didn't crash at that point still.\n\nAlso , the game has no v-sync option, v-sync force doesn't work via Nvidia control panel. I'm running a GTX 770, and it was basically just eating the card to run at like 1000+ frames per second (no, that's not a zero too many. Over 1 thousand frames. Basically if you have a dedicated gpu of any description, beware). Was incredibly annoying, and I ended up artificially capping the frame rate with RivaTuner. Which caused the game to occassionally experience some weird stuttering. Sort of amateurish that there's no Vysync option tbh, or anything else that'd solve that issue.\n\n________________________________________\n\nPros:\n\n- Strong, varied music, all catchy and pretty unique in the video game landscape.\n- Visually decent.\n\nCons:\n\n- Boring puzzles, not challenging or thought-provoking\n- Poor control of character (floaty)\n- Repetitive level design\n- Generic\n- Somewhat buggy\n- Doesn't support vsync","April 16","false","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/recommended/231040/","okram","okram2k","http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/","289 products in account","Is awesome visuals and great music alone enough to sell a game? Not to say Beatbuddy offers nothing else but that was my first thought as I spotted this brilliant looking game. It seems to me often indy games either focus on game play or art and usually sacrifice one for the other. It is an unfortunate decision when it comes to the meager budgets such studios often have to work with. Beatbuddy certainly focuses on the visuals with some amazing eye candy that I can tell was lovingly crafted by a very hard working artist and on top of that it incorporates some amazing music into it as well.\n\nSo the game looks amazing and features some pretty good music. But the ultimate question we always have to ask ourselves, how fun is it? Visuals are great but in my experience after a few hours of playing the wow-factor always wears off no matter how pretty the game is. At that point I just focus on the whole purpose of the game, playing it! Steam classifies Beatbuddy as a ‚ÄúCasual Indie Platformer Action Adventure‚Äù game. And while it does fit into the extremely generic Action Adventure classification, platformer seems not to do the game justice. Was Echo the Dolphin a platformer? That is what reminds me most of Beatbuddy‚Äôs gameplay style. And it is refreshing to see something similar with your little Beatbuddy swimming around the world rather than jumping from platform to platform. If anything its more of a puzzle action game as you traverse the beautiful looking water caves of ‚ÄòSymphonia‚Äô.\n\nPart of me feels like there was some sort of checklist over in Threaks‚Äô development studio. What does a good action puzzle game have to have? Launch springs? Check. Vehicle sections? Check. Teleporters? Check. Dashing Combat? Check. Collectibles? Check. Open and closeable doors? Check. Moveable walls? Check. While nothing is particularly ground breaking it is certainly full of your typical puzzle elements. The vehicle section seems to offer the only really unique little caveat with your vehicle only being able to shoot in one direction and you have to find these arrow points to rotate you around so you can blast through different parts of the maze. Overall it‚Äôs a pretty good set of puzzle game components but I have one annoying complaint. Beatbuddy introduces one element at a time and gives you time to master each element before adding a new. This is a good idea and all but I feel they take too much time introducing new elements. Because of this the first 4/5 of the game feels like little more than a long drawn out tutorial where you master each element and then mix it in with some old element, then move on.\n\nThis makes the first few levels feel incredibly unchallenging. Frankly I was starting to get bored but kept plowing through anyway. The visuals and music were almost enough to make up for the slow increase in complexity but the game was really lagging halfway through. Yet when I reached the last level and all the different complex systems were used together, the game was really quite fun. The only problem was I had about 45 minutes of fun after about 4 hours of meh. If the game had kept going, had a few more levels with all the toys in them, I‚Äôd have been really really happy with this game. Yet it left me somewhat disappointed when it ended. And the game is really much too short. Even though I was taking my time (flower sniffing as my MMO friends would say) I still completed the whole game in under 5 hours. That seems a bit of disappointing value for the $15 cost of entry even with the great music and visuals. Hell, you know a game might be too short when there‚Äôs an achievement for beating it in under 3 hours!\n\nThe music system however is really quite good. I actually hope mainstream game developers might take a few chapters out of Beatbuddy‚Äôs book here. Each level (or track) has a unique song that flows in the background and changes dynamically based upon what you are doing. It will kick up into full gear when you‚Äôre in a vehicle or lulls back to a simple beat when you‚Äôre just mellowing in empty water. It is further enhanced as enemies add their own tracks that work into the rhythm of the song. This gives me ques as to upcoming enemies such as snare drums means I‚Äôm going to be running into some spike guys soon or a throbbing base drum means there‚Äôs a springy thing around. The best use of this is the snail mounted turrets that shoot at you in beat to the song. It‚Äôs really quite clever and makes me really feel the rhythm as I try to dodge deadly flying objects.\n\nFor the most part I felt like Beatbuddy might be too easy. The game is incredibly forgiving most of the time with your character able to take many hits and plentiful sources to replenish health abound (heck your vehicle automatically restores health after just a couple seconds). None of the puzzles are mind bendingly difficult and only one or two near the end even take more than a few moments of thought to figure out. I almost feel like the developers didn‚Äôt want you to have any troubles in seeing their beautiful art/music project and made sure the game did not get in your way. There are a couple places that I got a little frustrated at but nothing so bad as to make me rage quit and generally I was able to figure out a way forward and continued my progress.\n\nWhile the game seems fairly well polished I did run into a few blemishes along the way. The intro and ending cut-scenes (which featured a horribly annoying beat-bop voice that I just wanted to strange!) had a white border around the hand drawn visuals. And then the caption, in white, bled over the border making it hard to read what was said. Since the voice was trying too hard to be beat-ish I could hardly understand was was said either. Also I found a few places when running from a collapsing ceiling (check) where I would get stuck. The ceiling collapsed down then stopped and locked me in a small box with no escape and I ended up having to quit and launch the game again to go back to the most recent checkpoint. For that matter, checkpoints? I thought we were past that ancient system! Another thing that really drives me bonkers is the camera constantly zooming in and out. I wish they‚Äôd pick a zoom level and stick to it, preferably far enough away that I can see where the hell I‚Äôm going rather than the tight shots that make it far too easy to get lost.\n\nAlso don‚Äôt look for much in terms of story here. I think there might have been somebody somewhere with a nice story but almost none of it is portrayed in the game. It feels like it was ripped out of your typical tropes, some army invades some temple, kidnaps the princesses, and you have to rescue them. Also once you finally catch up to the end boss don‚Äôt expect some climactic final fight, the ending is more anti-climactic than doing laundry.\n\nFinal Score:\nGraphics: 10/10\nGame Play: 5/10\nMusic / Ambiance: 9/10\nStory: 3/10\nValue: 4/10\nOverall: 6.2/10\n\nRead more indy game reviews on my blog!\nhttp://markofithian.com","November 26, 2013","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Plays like a puzzle platformer but without the platforming, since you swim about freely.

Rather, the main draw here is Beatbuddy's personality and soundtrack: every time a character speaks, the text box is backgrounded by a different beatboxing track, and, as you move through the stages, the music changes in complexity depending upon what's happening around you.\n\nThis sense that features of the level design are actually creating the music doesn't seem as potent or as 1:1 as in some other games that have done similar, most notably 140, but the music itself is good.

Nearly every moving object on screen has a set sound, which all combines into a really cool beat that plays throughout your adventure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masem/recommended/231040/","masem","Masem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masem/","3952 products in account","The concept behind Beatbuddy is smart - it's a platformer (taking place underwater so you have free-form of movement) where there is a constant beat of music where by doing certain actions on the beat makes your progress through the game much easier. You don't need to have the precision of a musican, fortunately, as the game is very generous with beat-matching mechanic as well as frequent checkpoints and health drops. Add in that mst of the music is from the emerging Electro Swing genre, and the game works in concept.  Puzzles are generally of the right amount of effort and complexity, with a decent learning curve to all the various moves, enemies, and obstacles in the game.\n\nThe major problem I had with the game is that the levels are on the long side - 30-40 minutes, and while the backing song does change with the various sections of each level, you're listening to the same basic music over and over again.  And as this is a bass-heavy track to keep that beat going, it does wear on you over long periods.  The graphics for the levels also get a bit weary.  But as noted, the game wisely has lots of self-saving checkpoints so playing brief segments is possible.  The game is definitely worth your time to play through, though the type that you should keep your eye out for a sale to get.","March 12, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an explorative puzzler of a game that will have you dodging obstacles like the conductive hand of the Hi-Hat crab, or bouncing your way through the water on Bass drum plants on the quest to stop the evil prince attempting to take total control of Symphonia's music.\n\nEach stage of the game hosts its own unique tune, and it's incredibly fun seeing just what part of the environment is playing each instrument in the composition, with parts picking up or slowing down depending on where you are in the map. They've got all sorts of genres in store here and you're sure to find a favorite or two during your time playing.\n\nThe art style is also gorgeous, with several layers of hand drawn visuals across every inch of the screen. Every new level hosts  a barrage of eye-popping visuals. From giant coves of crystals, to wide open expanses of sunset colored anemones.\n\nI do have a few complaints. Portions of the game that are more fast paced and on the clock can be a bit tricky to maneuver with the underwater controls, as you'll sometimes find your little Beatbuddy drifting in another direction or bouncing off the walls from trying to move too fast. I almost find it better just tapping the fast movement button for a quick burst as you're first taught in the game, rather than holding it down.\n\nAnother bit of an issue can be the combat. It's not too often at the start, with just a mere enemy or two to smack. However when a multi-targeting system is introduced about 3-4 stages into the game, it can be a bit dodgy to use when 5-6 targets are constantly moving about. Thankfully there's usually enough health pick ups to make up for the health loss when I resort to spamming the punch button on everyone in the room.\n\nGripes aside, the main pull of this game is in it's core mechanic, rhythm based puzzling. And that is where it definitely succeeds. There is an incredible charm to seeing the stage move in perfect harmony to the musical score as you solve it's mysteries to move to the next area.\n\nI also do enjoy the story and characters dollaped on top. This sort of game could've easily been done with no plot tying it together and more abstract environments, but the plot adds just enough without being too serious or overbearing to affect any enjoyment you'd get. All the characters have fun designs and quirky dialogue to carry it all along, and none of them overstay their welcome or take away from the gameplay. (Even if the character's various beat-boxing voice boxes can get a little jarring to hear after the 12th time that it's looped)\n\nI'm getting a real kick out of it, and as of writing this review I happened to pick it up for a steal at over 75%, so it's MORE than worth the money if you catch it on sale. It has it's quirks, but not enough to completely ruin the fun you're sure to have.","January 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The puzzles are overally pretty good, a bit repetitive by the time you reach the last level though I suppose. The art and music are both fantastic, gorgeous-looking game world and a diverse soundtrack despite being only 6 songs long. There is some bugginess however and trying to complete the collector achievement isn't really worth it in the state the game is in however, as it requires collecting everything in each of the rather long levels in a single go, which is probably the most negative aspect of the game. Still fun enough and certainly unique enough to deserve being played though.","November 27, 2013","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure, it's not exactly a strict move-on-the-beat game like Audiosurf or DDR, but instead is an adventure in a world that was created by music. The fact you can move freely and miss the beats doesn't really ruin the experience for me - it is a free-movement game, of course. The world itself moves to its own rhythm and you can try to follow it, or not. Using mouse controls makes a world of difference to the experience in comparison to other schemes. The art style is vibrant, the music is fantastic and so far it's proven to be an experience worth experiencing.

The game has a cool art style with hand drawn environments in a 2D world. The levels themselves are fairly large, but have multiple sections in them usually containing puzzles that then allow you to progress to the next sections of the level. Each level takes around 30 minutes to an hour to complete which works well and the levels flow nicely.\n\nThe best thing about the game is definitely the music and how it syncs to the gameplay, and how everything just moves together. You can definitely tell how they really wanted to integrate rhythm based gameplay into the game and it works well.\n\nIn most of the game, you'll play as Beatbuddy himself, opening up paths to progress and also solving various puzzles that usually require you moving a device to another area to open doors and so on. But in other parts, you'll be in a vehicle with a companion doing the same thing which keeps the gameplay fresh.\n\nThe only downside I found, was sometimes the movements can be a little clunky and frustrating but that's mainly in the vehicle parts and not so much when you're just controlling Beatbuddy himself. This viewpoint is only from playing with the controller however, so I'm not sure if the mouse and keyboard gameplay is any different or better.\n\nOverall, the game is definitely worth a playthrough.","March 11, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So let's take it from the top.\n\nThe environment is underwater. The beautifully made areas are hand painted, and filled with rock formations, plants, and cute sea creatures. It is all very pleasing to the eye, and generally forces me to smile throughout the whole experience. Also, the environment is not motionless, it is all vibrant, pulsating, bouncing, and swinging to the soundtrack.\n\nThe main character is called Beat Buddy. It's a small, blue, bubbly creature with big eyes, and... earphones. Whenever you stop to figure out a puzzle, he floats in the water bouncing his head and swinging his arm, like a real DJ. Did I mention it is adorable?\n\nThe game is basically an action-adventure with loads of puzzles, all focused around the music playing in the background. Each obstacle, element, creature has it's own unique sound which always incorporates nicely with the music, creating a beautiful, energetic soundtrack. From jazzy oldschool sounds, through clubby electronic, and even funky-rocky sounds.\n\nWhile you can solve any puzzle and go through any obstacle without even turning the sound on, listetning to the soundtrack gives you an advantage. The beat, the sounds actually give you small tips and clues, when and how you should move to go through a challenge effortlessly.\n\nThe puzzles slowly progress from absolutely obvious to very complicated. It requires logical thinking, timing, and a good ear.\n\nFor me, the game is very relaxing. As I traverse the underwater environment, searching for my friends, hoping to save them.. as I bounce, float, punch my way through complicated labyrinths, I feel myself unwind. The music, the soft but vibrant colours, the sweet personality and feel of the game have a wonderful, positive impact on my mood.\n\nSo if you would like something gentle, soothing, and adorable. Something that will make you smile, but will still challenge your gaming skills, try "Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians". And don't forget to wear good headphones or turn your speakers up.","December 28, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's well made, but it's too bland for a definite reccommendation.\n\nThis game, uh... I don't know how to put this.

I don't feel like my time was wasted, but there are more interesting games out there that I can't say pick this one up. I got it as a Humble Bundle order, and honestly wouldn't have played it if it weren't for that fact. Don't get me wrong, what it does is alright. For the most part the obstacles move to the beat rather than you, which is unique along with its art and setting.\nI'm only giving it a thumbs-down because I don't ESPECIALLY recommend it. If there were a more neutral option I'd give it. It's not an involving game, so if you need that then it might suit you. I'm pretty sure this was a college project.","February 10","false","4.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But after an hour and a half of playing, I didn‚Äôt get to hear one song in the heavily-promoted soundtrack. All you‚Äôll hear are drums and cymbals, with an occasional snippet of sampled music. Basically, you‚Äôre listening to a drum machine for hours on end, which I found so irritating that it killed the game for me.\n\nIt‚Äôs a shame that the ‚Äúdrum machine‚Äù aspect ruins the game, because it‚Äôs otherwise a decent-enough game.","October 4, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I read some of the reviews while playing it, and for a while I disagreed. I have a lower end computer, and for most of the game the fps was fine, which worked for me. I loved the music, and at first worried that I would get sick of hearing the same song for upwards of 45 minutes or so, but it was always just fine, seeing as how it would always play differently depending where in the level you are. The songs are fantastic, no doubt about that. The problems with the game are all in the final level. Many of the puzzling elements are quite forgiving, and moving around each level is relaxing a majority of the time. Not so for the final level. It was buggy (I ran into three bugs within a half-hour), ridiculously hard (most puzzles in the game I cleared on the first or second try, for the final level the last puzzle took me twenty minutes alone), and the game wraps up in a cliched ridden and unsatisfying way. It could have been so much better, had it been anything like the previous levels. The worst part is, it leaves you on a sour note. The last level makes me bring the game from a 9/10 to a 6.5/10. I still suggest you play the game. Just set your BS tolerance on high for the final level.","October 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Of sorts. The thing is the game world is, presumably, underwater. So your character (and all others) swim, so it's not like you jump, making the platform part kind of moot. I say it's a rhythmic game because the entire world runs to a beat, each level has it's own song, sadly there aren't many levels. Within each level are several puzzles which, of course, you have to do to progress.\n\nIn honesty I think I spent most of this game just listening to the  soundtrack.","April 17, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The soundtrack had its moments but the same 10 second loop gets ANNOYING after a while. There is a story there with something about taking over the music or something but its so underdevoloped that you basically can skip all of it. Also, its very short (I took my time and beat it in 6 hours). There are collectibles but I just basically gave that up realizing that all it had were extras.\n\nOverall, it had potential but it lacked a good amount of challange.

It is confusing in parts: beautiful paintings doesn¬¥t show you your way through in some places.

It's not a bad game, but definitely not my cup of tea.\nThe setting is unique - underwater world full of sea life. World is beatiful and levels are rich in details. Graphical style is unique. Sounds are beefy and music fits the atmosphere. Controls are weird. They definitely are bound to rhythm and you have to learn it. Mechanics are simple - collect things, shoot and destroy obstacles and enemies. Often you have redirect bumpers to lanuch things to destroy something. You are often required to time things and that's what I personally hated. Constant timing of movements, not getting hit, doing things in time... zzzzzzz. Nope. I don't like it.\nPerformance and controls are fine.\n\nYou can see that I'm bored, and I don't enjoy it. Yep. The setting and mechanics don't appeal to me. I just hate timing actions in game and that's what this game is about. I had to redo certain parts several times and that just killed fun for me. I can't enjoy a game that is constantly punishing me. Just let me get to another checkpoint. Nope, you have to time things right... Pffff, bog off.\n\nThe best time I had with this game was the moment when I hit "uninstall" button and I knew I would not launch it anymore.

No reason to pay that ammount for what you get. Wait for a sale.\n\nOverall? 7/10\n\nIf there weren't game breaking bugs, I would most certainly give it an 8/10. A great sidescrolling puzzle/adventure game in the spirit of Donkey Kong under water levels. It's not perfect, nor is it the most in-depth puzzle scroller I have played, however... It's a beautifully executed casual game. The music is enjoyable to listen to, and (in my opinion) doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out after listening to it for 10 minutes.\n\nA lot of the controls/environment effects are themed, of course, around the beat of the music... and timing according to that. Though I don't think it adds anything particularly "unique" to the game, they implemented it well... and it fits in with the world and story.\n\nPros:\n-Very beautiful game, the hand drawn environments added to my enjoyment.\n-It's really fun. When you aren't stuck with a bug.\n-Not entirely unique, but it puts a good focus on timing your movements with the beat of the music.\n\nNeutral:\n-Controls are a little looser than I would like when interacting with objects, not enough to be a con.\n-Puzzles, they aren't too hard.. and they arent too difficult. Very casual. This could be a con or a pro.\n\nCons:\n-Game breaking bugs.\n\nEDIT: This isnt accurately refelcting my played time.","December 20, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game isn't really fun but it isn't really boring either. It's just a simple game where you flip switches and flow down corridors whilst the music changes based upon environmental hazards. The music is enjoyable but the game doesn't really compliment it a lot of the time. If you want a Music game this one has music and it's a game but that doesn't make it a music game.\n\nThe story isn't something to write about as I felt there really wasn't a story. The Deus Ex Machina at the end really ruined anything that was going on in the game and then it just suddenly ends. The story feels tacked on and hardly there.\n\nThe Soundtrack is nice but doesn't really compliment the game in any way. It's a very Electro Swing heavy OST by some big names but overall I felt that it's more of an advertisement for the artists than anything.\n\nOverall this game is very mediocre. It isn't really fun and only held my attention for the first couple levels. The last levels just left me dissatisfied and overall perturbed when I completed the game.

The art style with its bright colors is also easy on the eyes, but the music certainly is the game's strongest point. I terribly suck at music games, but here I kept bobbing my head to the rhythm here out of sheer enjoyment of the tunes. This, of course, helps a lot in playing as you benefit from doing certain actions within a rhythm.\nBut anybody entirely unable of keeping a steady rhythm needs not to fret either, as the game is rather forgiving.\n\nIf I had to criticize anything, it would be the fact that it's entirely possible to miss collectibles on your first trip through a stage. Take the wrong turn, and you can't go back. Sure, that's a minor complaint, but for a completionist like myself, it can be a bit jarring as you need to replay a stage at least once to grab all trinkets and possibly once more to finish a stage in as little time as possible for the "beat the game in under x hours" achievement.\n\nAlso, the controls feel wonky at times, but you get used to it, and in no time you'll swiftly sway though the ocean.\n\nStill, it's an overall wonderful and quite unique experience that's well worth trying out not only for its great style.","November 6, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the first half hour roughly you'll learn what "Beat" can do and how the world works around him. There is some awkward, slightly whimsical story that surrounds everything but it's not always clear what is happening.\nGameplay is derived from moving around fluidly while creatures and things in the world all move to a beat. This is where I say musically the game shines. At some points you get an almost Fantasia feeling as a selection of sea creatures all make their own music, animating to the beat of the tune for the environment.\n\nThe music itself is catchy and immersive. My favorite moments in the game was when I would transition from just playing as Beat to navigating the watercraft vehicle. When this transition occurs, the levels music transitions to a chorus of sorts, making the song pretty powerful.\n\nUnfortunately with all the cool rythmn actions happening, this is where gameplay tends to become awkward or constricted. Often times you'll struggly to effeciently pick up the object you need without spamming the mouse button. It just isn't a clean action, and since it's used heavily, you'll have moments of pure frustration sadly.\nMovement is fluid as I mentioned, which once you learn the small nuances is easily adaptable. I was able to navigate almost all regions with ease.\n\nThe overall game is good and worth a play certainly, if not just to experience the cool music and beautiful 2d art and subtle animations. They definitely maximized the use of Unity for this game and it shows nicely. The overall game will feel repetitive after Environment 3 imo, but it'll be an enjoyable experience nonetheless.","July 27, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course you have some puzzles, you have some exploration, action, even some auto-scrolling... plus, regarding how you're playing, it can be a point'n click, and that is quite funny, I love it that way. You can choose between gamepad / keyboard or mouse. Not keyboard AND mouse, but keyboard OR mouse.\n\nSo yes, it's a rhythm game. You're free to go where you want, but the enemies and various obstacles are all based on the rhythm of the soundtrack (which is great, try to listen to it in iTunes). So if you're not fond of this kind of gameplay, maybe you'll not like this game. Plus, the puzzles are not really that hard. It's not an easy game, but it's not really hard either.\n\nBecause what I like is this kind of "flow" you feel when you're playing, your actions matching with the tempo, that feeling that everything is going well, you're "in". I don't really know how to explain it, because I feel it, but you got the idea I hope.\n\nPros:\n- amazing OST if you like electronic music (electro swing and stuff)\n- easy controlling\n- the graphics, not really the quality (it's good though) but the atmosphere you know?\n\nCons:\n- not really hard\n- low replay value\n\nThose are not really cons if you can enjoy the game enough the first time you play.

Let‚Äôs get rocking (and rightly so with this one).\n\nThe Good\n\nTo be honest, I hadn‚Äôt even heard of this game until it came with last week‚Äôs Humble Bundle, but am I glad that it came in that glorious bundle of games. Beatbuddy is easily one of the most satisfying games I have ever played and an multiple levels at that. The whole game is, quite literally, moving to the beat. Do you have any idea how good that feels?\n\nNot only was the whole game keeping rhythm, the music was excellent. I‚Äôm personally a big fan of Parov Stellar, so, when I found out about that contribution to the soundtrack, I was pretty stoked. Every level features a different song from a different artist, but manages to keep the same flow.\n\nThe design in Beatbuddy is simply marvelous (for the most part). It‚Äôs rare to see such a creative game in terms of world building and (especially) naming things cleverly.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI‚Äôve got nothing bad to say about this one, sorry.\n\nThe Meh\n\nThere are some parts of the game where it becomes overly difficult to maneuver with your character. It‚Äôs not a huge problem or anything (and maybe I just suck), but it can be quite frustrating.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nYou have absolutely zero reasons not be playing this game within the next week or so. If you‚Äôve been looking for something new and something far different than most platformers, Beatbuddy is the game for you. You can find it here on Steam if you‚Äôre interested (and you should be). It may end up on Humble Bundle‚Äôs End of Summer Sale too so keep an eye on that. As always, thanks for reading.","September 1, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything around you moves to the beat of the music. Even your own vehicle gets a speed boost every other beat.\n\nThis all comes together to make a game that *usually* feels great to play. While the developers have obviously put a lot of thought into designing each level, there are still segments that are simply not fun to play. In many situations, you will find yourself punished and killed for making a wrong decision in a fast-paced segment. This happens often enough and comes with a large enough punishment that it really does detract from the gameplay.\n\nIt feels like this problem comes from over-attachment to problematic gameplay elements. For example, throughout the game, there are these "music sources" which are unstable and explode after you've held them long enough. You have to deliver these sources to an appropriate receptacle or risk restarting the segment. While having segments like this helps the game from feeling too same-y, it's a bad choice and should have been scrapped or re-imagined.\n\nTo be honest, though, these flaws are the kind of thing that most games have. It might have a few more of them than average, but they only stand out because they occasionally disrupt the magical experience that this game has to offer. Despite my occasional frustration, I finished this game in a single sitting and came away delighted that I'd put in the time. I would recommend this game to anyone who's at all interested by the trailer. Just don't expect it to be perfectly polished.\n\n(For those who care, playtime isn't tremendously long for a $10 game. But I don't really think it's fair to judge games by playtime; you're paying for the art, music, and creativity. If you're hesitant, get it on sale.)","August 22, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beatbuddy tells the story of the 3 awaken guardians of Symphonia, a land moved by music where everything including life itself, acts in response to the music. That's probably the strong point of this game, the synchronization of the animations with the soundtrack itself is just perfect. To be honest the game is not exactly nothing out of extraordinary, in my honest opinion, it's good at most but like I said, the soundtrack turns Beatbuddy into something much more enjoyable. The game takes about 5-6 hours to complete and each level has several chapters. There's checkpoints spread throughout the levels in which you save your progress. Overall the levels are pretty well designed along with the background artwork. Most of the game involves bashing walls using the "bass plants" which propel you foward and you might change your path by going against mirrors and rotating them in order to go to the right place, there's also times in which you drive some kind of submarine which is actually pretty fun because it moves in bumps synchronized with the beat, other than that is basicly just beating down enemies and moving some kind of devices from one place to another in order to open doors. The game was surprisingly fun for me to play through and relatively short. If you enjoy a good soundtrack then you'll probably have a great time with Beatbuddy, if you're expecting a platformer or something more elaborated, you're not going to get it here.","March 9, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game in total is relatively short, yet the levels are extremely long, but the ability to autosave from your last checkpoint helps it feel less like a marathon while playing.

It's been said a million times, but the soundtrack to this game is amazing (and I'll probably be buying it next chance I get).  The graphics and general atmosphere are really nice to look at, and it's clear that a great deal of care went into the game design.  The story isn't particularly groundbreaking; it's tongue-in-cheek, really, but the most important aspect of Beatbuddy is gameplay, which does not disappoint.  It is a rather short game, but the behind the scenes extras give it some replay value.\n\nTLDR: It's short, but fun and pretty to look at with a great soundtrack.  Despite getting this game in a bundle, I would have gladly paid full price for it had I known how good it was.\n\nEDIT: Thought I should add that I used a gamepad, and had no issues, didn't need to remap, etc.  Just worked straight out of the box, so to speak.","April 27, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So much that I am writing my first review about a game.\n\nThis type of game is meant to make the player use the clever beats and rhythms the designers implemented to go along with the level environment.

When I thought the game showed everything it had, something would always surprise me and that's one of the things that kept the game interesting.\n\nI highly recommend it for those players who like games for their art, music, platformer and puzzle/problem solving elements a game offers. Great game. It kept me busy for some time. Don't zip through the levels, just take your time and really take in the hard work the makers put into it. Aside from art work and music, the puzzles were fun and there were parts that were quite challenging.\n\nOh! One more thing of course. The extras that are given really make you appreciate the game that much more. It tells you the story of how they made the game.

You just can't stop your foot from tapping the floor while playing this game. I'm listening to Beatbuddy soundtrack even after finished the game\n- Artwork looks very neat. Concept art and developer notes show us how much work you have to do for the beauty which Beatbuddy is.\n\nCons:\n- Game is actually short. I don't know how long it takes to finish the game, but after you did you feel unpleased.\n- Controls. I think best controls are with mouse only if your keyboard can't stand ghosting (for this game you often need to click 3 buttons at once). Mouse isn't great either, especially when you have to pick/drop an object...\n- Big SnareMonsters or whatever they're called. Just hate those things. I got bumped by it many times by them.

I loved the art style, the music was awesome, the level design was exceptionally well done especially considering how it could've been extremely easy to get lost (yet I never seemed to), the only issue I really had was the controls.  On the Mac side, the mouse controls were terrible and a 360 controller didn't function properly.  On the Windows side, everything worked great on the controller and it made the game enjoyable since the controls were so tight.  If you only have a Mac, avoid this game.  If you have a PC or dual boot (and have a good controller), it's absolutely worth a buy.\n\n\nV.1 - I want to like this game.  The music seems cool, the art style is interesting and the concept is a fresh take on the genre, but technical problems (at least for the Mac version) are holding me back.  The game crashes more often than it runs and the menu navigates without fail via 360 controller, only to have none of the buttons work once actually in the game.  Mouse control feels supremely subpar compared to what a gamepad setup would allow.  I'll try this game again on the Windows side later, but as it stands now, I'd pass if on a Mac.","June 29, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls felt really weird through out the game and I never got the hang of driving the vehicle. I just rammed through everything. Few bugs here and there and bad design choises overall gave a bad impression. The art was okay mostly, but didn't strike as something I would remember. Though sometimes the art cluttered the screen so that I didn't see anything I was doing. Too much stuff going on on the screen. Characters were good, but not used much, so the story was very thin. Most of the time I wasn't sure what was going on. Level design didn't help when I was just pushing one way without knowing what I'm supposed to do next or where I'm going.

The controls felt really weird through out the game and I never got the hang of driving the vehicle. I just rammed through everything. Few bugs here and there and bad design choises overall gave a bad impression. The art was okay mostly, but didn't strike as something I would remember. Though sometimes the art cluttered the screen so that I didn't see anything I was doing. Too much stuff going on on the screen. Characters were good, but not used much, so the story was very thin. Most of the time I wasn't sure what was going on. Level design didn't help when I was just pushing one way without knowing what I'm supposed to do next or where I'm going. The game just wasn't fun to play and the beat/music part felt sometimes superimposed. The soundtrack was good though.\n","April 14, 2014","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's been said a million times, but the soundtrack to this game is amazing (and I'll probably be buying it next chance I get).  The graphics and general atmosphere are really nice to look at, and it's clear that a great deal of care went into the game design.  The story isn't particularly groundbreaking; it's tongue-in-cheek, really, but the most important aspect of Beatbuddy is gameplay, which does not disappoint.  It is a rather short game, but the behind the scenes extras give it some replay value.\n\nTLDR: It's short, but fun and pretty to look at with a great soundtrack.  Despite getting this game in a bundle, I would have gladly paid full price for it had I known how good it was.\n\nEDIT: Thought I should add that I used a gamepad, and had no issues, didn't need to remap, etc.  Just worked straight out of the box, so to speak.","April 27, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game isn't really fun but it isn't really boring either. It's just a simple game where you flip switches and flow down corridors whilst the music changes based upon environmental hazards. The music is enjoyable but the game doesn't really compliment it a lot of the time. If you want a Music game this one has music and it's a game but that doesn't make it a music game.\n\nThe story isn't something to write about as I felt there really wasn't a story. The Deus Ex Machina at the end really ruined anything that was going on in the game and then it just suddenly ends. The story feels tacked on and hardly there.\n\nThe Soundtrack is nice but doesn't really compliment the game in any way. It's a very Electro Swing heavy OST by some big names but overall I felt that it's more of an advertisement for the artists than anything.\n\nOverall this game is very mediocre. It isn't really fun and only held my attention for the first couple levels. The last levels just left me dissatisfied and overall perturbed when I completed the game.

Of course you have some puzzles, you have some exploration, action, even some auto-scrolling... plus, regarding how you're playing, it can be a point'n click, and that is quite funny, I love it that way. You can choose between gamepad / keyboard or mouse. Not keyboard AND mouse, but keyboard OR mouse.\n\nSo yes, it's a rhythm game. You're free to go where you want, but the enemies and various obstacles are all based on the rhythm of the soundtrack (which is great, try to listen to it in iTunes). So if you're not fond of this kind of gameplay, maybe you'll not like this game. Plus, the puzzles are not really that hard. It's not an easy game, but it's not really hard either.\n\nBecause what I like is this kind of "flow" you feel when you're playing, your actions matching with the tempo, that feeling that everything is going well, you're "in". I don't really know how to explain it, because I feel it, but you got the idea I hope.\n\nPros:\n- amazing OST if you like electronic music (electro swing and stuff)\n- easy controlling\n- the graphics, not really the quality (it's good though) but the atmosphere you know?\n\nCons:\n- not really hard\n- low replay value\n\nThose are not really cons if you can enjoy the game enough the first time you play.

As a producer, musician, and lover of music, this game appeals to me in many ways.  I love music-based games (see Cosmophony for Wii U/Android/iOS, Guitar Hero, etc.), and I love quirky indie games that have charm in their premise, and this game has both.\n\nThe fact that the platforming and the puzzles are based around the individual drums in the beat (hi-hat, bassdrum, snare) is a cool idea, and it appeals to me as a musician.  Beat is a cute character, and the art style is vibrant and visually pleasing.  The art is pretty, and the underwater theme is rather well executed.  I don't really have anything bad to say about this game, but maybe that's my bias as a musician speaking.\n\nI got this game on a Humble Bundle, and I most definitely do not regret getting that bundle for this game alone.","September 27, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only real pro was the music, but it never reached its full potential. The reason why I bought this game was to hear the music, yet many of the games mechanics like hitting objects to remove spikes and finding secret buttons muted the music. The puzzles did not feel satisfying because generally you have to just memorize paths and could be done in one go. Controls feel delayed especially when in vehicles as it forces you to move to the beat. Dashing around also feels really weird as when you press and hold you move faster at the expense of control.\n\nOverall this is a bellow average game where its strengths are hurt by its gameplay.","September 13, 2015","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No reason to pay that ammount for what you get. Wait for a sale.\n\nOverall? 7/10\n\nIf there weren't game breaking bugs, I would most certainly give it an 8/10. A great sidescrolling puzzle/adventure game in the spirit of Donkey Kong under water levels. It's not perfect, nor is it the most in-depth puzzle scroller I have played, however... It's a beautifully executed casual game. The music is enjoyable to listen to, and (in my opinion) doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out after listening to it for 10 minutes.\n\nA lot of the controls/environment effects are themed, of course, around the beat of the music... and timing according to that. Though I don't think it adds anything particularly "unique" to the game, they implemented it well... and it fits in with the world and story.\n\nPros:\n-Very beautiful game, the hand drawn environments added to my enjoyment.\n-It's really fun. When you aren't stuck with a bug.\n-Not entirely unique, but it puts a good focus on timing your movements with the beat of the music.\n\nNeutral:\n-Controls are a little looser than I would like when interacting with objects, not enough to be a con.\n-Puzzles, they aren't too hard.. and they arent too difficult. Very casual. This could be a con or a pro.\n\nCons:\n-Game breaking bugs.\n\nEDIT: This isnt accurately refelcting my played time.","December 20, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course you have some puzzles, you have some exploration, action, even some auto-scrolling... plus, regarding how you're playing, it can be a point'n click, and that is quite funny, I love it that way. You can choose between gamepad / keyboard or mouse. Not keyboard AND mouse, but keyboard OR mouse.\n\nSo yes, it's a rhythm game. You're free to go where you want, but the enemies and various obstacles are all based on the rhythm of the soundtrack (which is great, try to listen to it in iTunes). So if you're not fond of this kind of gameplay, maybe you'll not like this game. Plus, the puzzles are not really that hard. It's not an easy game, but it's not really hard either.\n\nBecause what I like is this kind of "flow" you feel when you're playing, your actions matching with the tempo, that feeling that everything is going well, you're "in". I don't really know how to explain it, because I feel it, but you got the idea I hope.\n\nPros:\n- amazing OST if you like electronic music (electro swing and stuff)\n- easy controlling\n- the graphics, not really the quality (it's good though) but the atmosphere you know?\n\nCons:\n- not really hard\n- low replay value\n\nThose are not really cons if you can enjoy the game enough the first time you play.

I've a downright sensational rhythm if I do say so myself.  I played the demo for this nearly a year before it was released and was absolutely hyped... then the full game came out.\n\nWith such an ominous intro like that, how could this be a thumbs up?  Well, it's still a nice and casual adventure game with a silly story and characters that functions correctly most of the time.  It has a lot of heart put into it with the fine details like the "voice overs" and the graphics and rhythm syncing, but it feels... lacking.\n\nThe demo had this insanely upbeat and cool song that's difficult to find today, and being a beta demo I figured some things would change from there to the final product.  I was wrong.  The songs now are more like background beats that the game just sort of arbitrarily bounces to.  You could take the rhythmic pulses out of the game and have almost the same game with less "stuttering".\n\nI can still recommend this, though.  The characters are cute, the mood is lighthearted, the songs are still fun, and it still pulls off the adventure bit with light puzzle elements, but oh what this game could have been.","June 24, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the kind of game I'd get immersed into and play for hours straight... rather 10 minutes at a time, because the game tends to get annoying if you play it for longer periods. The graphics are colorful and nice, the animations smooth, the gameplay a bit dull, the controls somewhat tedious but not catastrophic either. I'd still recommend it because the way the music is integrated into the game is original and pretty well done, and the tracks themselves are good (except for level 5 which was quite a bit grating...). I also appreciated the nice little details, such as skippable intro logos (a rare and precious attention) and the fact that you can still control the character during the ending credits.\n\nI give this game 6/10, and if there was to be a Beatbuddy 2 with solid improvements, I think I'd consider buying it.","July 19, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game mechanics are simple and I've seen it done in many others. That said, what sets this game apart is the incorporation of the music into the gameplay. You have to match the beat to get through certain areas. The music is great, and I love that the character voices are different beatboxing beats for each character. The artwork in the game is very pleasing with the bright colors and the animation in the environment adds visual cues to help you match the beat.\n\nWhile playing this game I found myself tapping my foot and nodding my head to the beat. Great way to spend a relaxing afternoon, and the little blobby characters brought a smile to my face.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game.","July 19, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But really, this game was really a lot more than I was expecting. Here's a list of things I find noteworthy about the game:\n\n+The music has flavor and creates a distinct, interesting tone for the game.\n+The art style is attractive and simple.\n+- The play style is pretty simple, this may be good or bad!\n+- The controls have a bit of a learning curve. At first they seem a bit bad, but once you master the art of dash canceling by punching, you'll feel more in control.\n\nDefinitely a worthwhile game and a "must try" in my book.\nGoes down especially well with some Mary j.","May 21","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
