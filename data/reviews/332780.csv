The animations are bad or nonexistant. Movement is clunky. The view is restrictive would be better a little more zoomed out. You die from 1 hit so i dunno why there is a health bar or the heal thing. The video of the game looked fun but the game, well its more fun to watch the video at this point. Overall this doesnt feel like a complete game.","December 15, 2014","false","0.4"," 291 of 328 people (89%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","89","291","328","21","32"

If you like those, then that's a redeeming factor-- I guess...\n- Ragdoll physics are the ONLY thing that makes this game enjoyable, but only for the first few times seeing it.\n- Day/Night Cycle ACTUALLY WORKS... (Be prepared to hear nothing but bird chirping/cricket chirping throughout the game)\n- I guess(?) it was made in the Unreal Engine.\n- Heavier weapons ACTUALLY become a burden and slow down your already slow-as-balls character! WHAT FUN!\n\nCONS:\n- The only way to swap weapons is to drop what you're currently equipped with, and hope and pray you switch to whatever it was you wanted to use. THEN you must pick up whatever it was you dropped to begin with to keep carrying it around.\n- The game is literally devoid of any atmosphere, despite being in what I assume is a park (because there's trees and plants everywhere?). Had this game been a third, or first-person shooter, heck maybe even with better animations and a better enviroment, this game would be mounds better to-- look at.\n- Like the atmosphere, the zombies are quite lacking, until you go blasting off a loud rifle, or shotgun. Then they come pouring out the off-screen faucet that is this game's artificial difficulty.\n- The flashlight's batteries must all come from the dollar store, despite the model being that of a car battery; because your flashlight WILL run out in about a minute's time of continual usage.\n- For a game supposedly made in the Unreal Engine, it certainly looks unpleasant considering the character models are stiff, lifeless, and lacking of any form of genuine animation. Think I'm talking about the zombies? HO HO! That's ONLY if you're lucky enough to find any. The playable character takes the spotlight on this.\n- Be prepared to walk, and walk, and walk with no clear goal, or story to help set the game in motion. You'll be thrown into the game and a random grab-bag of items, and you just "SURVIVE".\n- The BIGGEST problem with this game. The meter on the top-right. Apparently, you are infected with... Something... Maybe not, I'm unsure. It's never explained, at all. You have to keep a close eye on what seems to be either 'the infection', or some silly mechanic where blood slowly reaches your brain in hopes of killing you via aneurysm over how boring this game is.\n\ntl;dr -\nIs the game fun? Maybe if you're high on Percocet, and wish to hold your breath everytime you're chased by zombies.\nShould you buy it? Not if you think torturing yourself with bad games is worth murdering your wallet.","December 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","86","32","37","15","1"

Why would you be playing this and starting over and over? There's no story to uncover, no random objectives to complete, no high scores to compare...you just aimlessly wander the mostly empty area hoping to find some ammo and antidote while also praying that the game's framerate won't betray you when a zombie is near.\n\nIt's not only boring, it's pointless, and these- in my book-are two cardinal sins in a game: add to this the technical problems and the low production values and you'll see how this game is one I can't recommend at all. Even the devs probably realized this was a total mess since they abandoned it a few days after release.\n","October 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Hit detection is weird, you die instantly if the zombies get close, and the only interesting part of the map to explore are unground bunkers, but you can't see anything, and there doesn't appear to be any items to give provide light in the darkness.\n\nIf this was a free flash game on Kongregate, I'd say skip it... but since it actually costs money... run away!","October 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

Oh... Dear, God, no... I have to say, from the pictures on Steam, the game didn't look half bad. Believe me. It is. If you're a person who's really into zombie games, and you like hardcore realistic zombie simulators then DO NOT GET THIS GAME. For the first thing, the game runs REALLY SLOW. I have an old Windows 7 desktop computer, and I know it doesn't have much ram, but this game looked like it would run fairly quickly. I mean, there's not really anything going on in it. It seems to have okay graphics, but not like super detailed. Well, those graphics on the screen are the highest quality they get in the game. Literally, it ran like 2 frames per second. I tried bumping down the graphics, until I got to the worst possible graphics, and got about 40 fps. These graphics, are, to say the least, look about equivalent to mid nineties graphics, and not even a high quality game from the nineties; like a crappy, low quality one. Now, it was the lowest quality, so I'm not picky about that, but DEAR GOD. It STILL ran pretty slow. Not to mention that the gameplay is... Um... Terrible? There's literally nothing to do but kill zombies, and the whole setup is actually pretty terribly designed. I actually think, LITERALLY, they probably spent more time on the title screen than the ACTUAL GAME. I was extremely dissatisfied with the game. I got it 90% off, and I regret buying it, and anyone who paid full price, should honestly get their lawyers on this. I laughed when I played the atrocity for the first time. It got old. This game ACTUALLY MAY BE... THE WORST GAME... EVER... It's really bad. EVEN IF THIS GAME IS 100% OFF, DO NOT BUY IT. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING. DOWNLOAD SOME OTHER ♥♥♥♥. A MINECRAFT MAP, I DON'T GIVE A ♥♥♥♥. DO NOT GET THIS.","December 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

For the game being at it's stage at develpoment I'd have to say it is pretty empty. The game is mostly filled with vegetation with the occasional building here and there. Combat reminds me of 'Hotline Miami' due every enemy can instantly kill you and you can kill almost every zombie first strike on the first day. I have been fortunate to make it a few days into the game and the difficulty was noticably increasing with higher density of zombies and more types. Also found an underground area which was cool and difficult but made the loot inside that much sweeter when found.\n\nPros:\n- Cool Combat\n- Collected loot feels earned\n- Keeps you on edge\n- Supplies run fast requiring you to keep a look out for more\n\nCons:\n- Relitivly Empty\n- Doesn't introduce you to the controls very well\n- Random frame rate drops\n- Confusing health system for a one hit kill game\n\nAll in all i would say to give this game a whirl, it is early development so bugs and such were expected when I bought it but i can see this game has alot that could be added to it so there is so much potential in it. I'm going to keep up with this game in hopes it improves and the experience gets better, just gotta hope the developers don't abandon it this early.  Would recommened to people that would like to be involved in a game that will hopefully undertake a great modification :)","December 15, 2014","true","2.0"," 48 of 121 people (40%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","40","48","121","8","0"

Very hard and sometimes unfair but good. Most of your time will be spend walking backwards away from zombies while reloading but hey- same as real life, right? :D","May 9, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 39 people (15%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","15","6","39","3","0"

I would really like to have developers create the game with bette graphics although the current graphics are not bad. The gameplay is ok in terms of the genre but it does get repetitive at times. I have played other fps, rpg etc. games and this game seems to cover the elements. I would give it a thumbs up but still i would be biased if i didn't say anything negative as a lot of gamers have given more negative reviews than positive. I just think that developers need to polish it a little more and add to it. Overall it is an okay game.","February 15, 2015","true","5.0"," 7 of 46 people (15%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","15","7","46","2","0"
