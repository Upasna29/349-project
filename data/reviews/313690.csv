After all, the game is advertised to have full controller support :)\n________________________________________\n\nTL;DR: This game builds upon Lego Batman and DC Super Heroes. It improves controls and visuals, and offers a new, unique story. Combine this with a change of scenery, and you’ve got yourself a hit.\n\nI’m not going to say much that others haven’t already said. But to sum it all up, this game is like “Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes” on steroids. All the classic features that made people love this game are present. That “Batman: Arkham City” style free roam. The “brain friendly” (detect sarcasm here) puzzles that made “Lego Indiana Jones” a hit. The powers of all your favorite childhood super heroes. And now, a story worthy of the game! If you’re like me, and have played any (or all) of these titles, you’ll get a major de ja vous.\n\n\nThe last two Lego Batman games were astounding, but this ramps up everything to a new level. As mentioned above (in other reviews), the graphics in this game are improved. And when I say improved, I don't mean a tiny bit, I mean A LOT. I know this might not be the best comparison to make here, but if any of you have ever played Minecraft with the R3DCraft resource pack and/or Shaders (SEUS) mod enabled, you might have an idea as to what I mean. For those that haven’t played Minecraft (haven’t played it seriously, I mean) try googling images of the Shaders mod. It’s a night and day difference between the standard shader pack. While the difference between “Beyond Gotham” and “DC Super Heroes” might not be quite THAT drastic, I think my example gives an accurate portrayal of how much better the game not only looks, but feels. And keep in mind, Lego Batman 2 was NOT a bad looking game. The change of scenery doesn’t hurt either. I love the fact that this game takes you places you don’t often get to go in the DC universe. It’s really quite refreshing. Honestly, I think that this game rivals even “Arkham City” in terms of the best Batman game. Well, that might be pushing it. But one thing’s certain: It’s certainly a great deal better thank “Lego Marvel Super Heroes”! :D\n\n\nIt sometimes boggles my mind; why make such a great title a Lego game? But in actuality, I think it’s that fact that makes the game as enjoyable as it is. For any newbies, don’t let the fact that it’s a Lego game discourage you; this game is definitely worth the play. I know as well as anyone that the constant sales sometimes, or often, make us want to spend no more than the price of a sandwich on a game. But this is one worth full price. Honestly guys, you should have picked up the Premium Edition yesterday!\n\nP.S.  “Lego Batman 4: Justice League” anyone?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaseS19/recommended/313690/","ChaseS19","ChaseS19","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaseS19/","435 products in account","Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham is a solid Lego game for better and for worse. Sporting over 100 characters and numerous locations, Lego Batman 3 has to be the most expansive and diverse Lego game to date. However, platforming is still frustrating and at times it all just seems so overwhelming and underwhelming at the exact same time.\n\nLego Batman 3 from Traveler's Tale interactive is the 4th game in the Lego video game franchise to feature DC comics’ characters. The title “Lego Batman” is incredible loose at this point especially after 2012’s Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes added a bulk of the Justice League to the line-up. The story starts with Batman and Robin as they chase Killer Croc through the sewers of Gotham City. Meanwhile, the Joker, Lex Luthor, Solomon Grundy and Cheetah invade the Hall of Justice in order to take over the Watchtower, the Justice League’s space station.\n\nSoon after the Justice League bring their villains under control in the Watchtower earth is invaded by Brainac who has stolen the power of all the Lantern Corps’. Using these powers, Brainac shrinks the earth and the Justice League and their villains have to work together to save the earth and free the Lantern Corps’ power.\n\nThe Lego franchise of video games have never bolstered a great story and the same goes for Lego Batman 3. The story primarily serves as a means to bring all of the DC comics diverse characters together. However, cute, clever, or down-right goofy events allow for fun and exciting moments. Early in the game Batman, under the control of Brainac, begins tearing apart the Bat Cave. I played as Alfred through most of the encounter and giggled when I got the chance to beat up Batman as his butler. Moments such as that are the highlights of the franchise.\n\nLego Batman 3 offers the same simple cooperative option as the previous titles. It is still fun working out side quests and free play mode of the story with another person. It also makes exploring the multiple hub worlds easier to manage. However, the dynamic screen split that started in Lego Indiana Jones is still confusing, but the option for a fixed screen split is still available. The co-op mode still remains the best way to truck through these games. It will always be more fun to bring a friend with you in the story missions.\n\nOutside of the main story, Lego Batman 3 features several unique hub worlds to collect new characters and golden bricks (the trophies of the franchise). In the previous Lego titles Traveler's Tale has pushed to feature large open worlds that the characters need to explore. These huge worlds were overwhelming at best and rage inducing at worst as it made tracking down side quest difficult and confusing. Lego Batman 3 breaks away from that by only having a handful of hub areas that are incredibly easy to navigate. Side activities no longer feel as much of a chore now that the player can easily bounce from one to the next.\n\nThe side quests and who assigns them to the player is the real highlight of the game. From the expected characters such as Booster Gold and Aquaman, to unusual like Ace the Bat-Hound, Conan O'Brien and writer/director Kevin Smith. The game even features a prominent role from the Green Loontern, Looney Toons’ Daffy Duck with the powers of the Green Lantern. Traveler's Tale has gone out of their way to offer the silliest and most surprising cameos in this game. Seriously, the Bat-Cow is in this game.\n\nThe best and most surprising cameo in the game is a collectable that is devoted to Adam West. In the various story missions and hub worlds Adam West is in trouble and the player has to rescue him. During the first story mission I heard, “This is TV’s Adam West and I’m in trouble!” and I became immensely giddy. However, to save Mr. West I needed a character I had yet to unlock which was annoying and frustrating to encounter in the first mission.\n\nThe Lego games have always locked away secrets and goals behind unlockable characters, but this game seems to handle that in the worse ways. After completing the main story I had only completed 20% of game and was only able to unlock maybe 10% of the secrets hidden in the main story. The franchise has always been about replayability, but it would be nice to at least end the story unlocking more of that content\n\nThe Lego games have always had a fatigue associated with them. I love this series and have played a majority of the titles, but I have yet to 100% one of them. The Lego fatigue stems from a bloated run time and story missions that feel far too long. Story missions in this game took me between 45 minutes to an hour each and the thought of having to truck through one again for a single unlockable adds to the fatigue. I burned 24 hours in this game, but I doubt I will spend much more time in Lego Batman 3.\n\nExcluding the bloated nature of this title I do feel like the franchise is improving. The platforming in the game is still terrible like all the previous Lego titles, but there is far less emphasis on jumping puzzles. Flying characters such as Wonder Woman and others are unlocked early in the story missions and aid in the navigation of the worlds. This is better than Lego Batman 2 where I had to wait till the very end of the game to unlock Wonder Woman.\n\nLego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham is proving to me that Traveler’s Tale is improving the franchise. The game is fun and a nice diversion during the crazy video game season that we are currently in. It is great for kids, a good time sink for any adult and almost a must play for any DC comics fan who will get excited at the thought of playing as Wonder Woman disguised as Cheetah. I am mainly referring to myself of course. Oh, and when you fly as Wonder Woman it plays the theme song to the 1970s Wonder Woman tv show! That detail and others make Lego Batman 3 a game worth playing.","November 17, 2014","true","31.7"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","43","52","0","0"

NOTE: This game's free roam is NOT like LEGO Marvel or LEGO Batman 2. There is no large city or area to mess around in. Instead there are multiple small locations and planets that are free roam-able. This is similar to LEGO Indiana Jones. I bought this thinking that I would be able to fly around in Gotham as Superman but this is not true.

It was a steal and I am glad I did. However, I wouldn't advise you to pay full price just yet.\n\nBatman 3 is the sequel to Batman 2 (duh) and shifts the series' focus further from Batman and more onto the Justice League and the DC universe in general. It also extists purely to not fall behind on Marvel because all the gameplay additions made in Lego Marvel over Batman 2 can be found copy pasted into three. Anyway, the regular production values from Tales give a good show. The evil Brainiac has come to Earth to shrink it and to collect it. He kidnaps the seven Lantern corps leaders and uses them to power his beam weapon. Up to the heroes to stop him. Once again you punch and puzzle your way through the DC galaxy collecting bricks, figurines and powerups to stop Brainiac.\n\nThe thing plays like a lengthy cartoon episode and is certainly fun when played with a partner. Be it your sibling, offspring or spouse. The selection of characters is considerable, with virtually every franchise providing at least five representatives. Unfortunately, the powers and abilities are all pretty much standard fare by now. Nothing really new is introduced from Marvel. Some characters feel downright lacking (lantern corps can't even light a dark room. LANTERNS!) Still, it is a funny game to buy and play at a discount. Especially if you're a comic buff. The game likes to reference its own past even includes Adam West from TV.\n\nUnfortunately, it reeks of bad business practices. The main menu greets you with a wealth of DLC that can be unlocked for rather unreasonable prices. Most packs contain about 20 batmans and a single stage. Not much to write home about, so you can do without.","April 18, 2015","true","42.4"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

First and foremost let me say how much I hated the storyline in this game.  For me it was the  worst of all the lego games I've played (the other Batmans, Harry Potter, Marvel, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, Lego Movie).  I will admit my biggest problem is that I'm not a big DC person.  I only like a few characters and Batman is one of them so when I buy a game called Lego Batman I expect the storyline to be promeniently about Batman.  This wasn't that.  This was Lego Green Lantern or Lego DC Universe but it wasn't Lego Batman.  I realize that they probably called it that to make more money but it really irks me.  Don't get me wrong I still had fun with the game, as I do with all the lego games.  I was just really looking forward to a batman centric story.  That being said I did not run into as many glitches as others have complained about.  I also played this game with the XBOX wired controller for Windows and never had a single problem with the controls as some other people have said.  The controller worked fine for me and I played all nearly 70 hours with it.\n\nThese are the glitches that I did run into however:\n-The bat computer doesn't work in the bat cave to allow you to see levels and replay them even though Conan says it does.\n-When you run over a heart after taking out an enemy it doesn't always add a heart to your meter if you are low.  This is a problem I also noticed in Lego Marvel but not as prevalent as here.\n-When I was free playing the level Lantern Menance the game crashed on me three times.  There wasn't a checkpoint before each crash so I lost everything each time.  I had to save and exit a few times as well as start at a different point in the level then go back before I could get everything.  The game never crashed before or after this.  Only when I free played this level.\n-Some of the Quests glitched in various ways.\n-The rest were standard Lego glitches that are pretty much in every game.\n\nOk so I guess this is where I'll go through my pros and cons:\nPros:\n-All the suits in this game can be accessed by holding down the Y button if you're using a controller, once you find the corresponding token.  Makes things a lot easier when you need different suits, also if you place the character by where they need to do the suit change sometimes you can just hit the B button and it will automatically change to the suit you need.  I liked this a lot better than the previous games.\n-The Bonus Batman '66 level and the DLC levels which I enjoyed more than the game itself.  There's a lot of fun stuff there. Totally can't wait for the Arrow, Bizarro and Suicide Squad DLCs.\n-Geoff Johns, Jim Lee, Kevin Smith, Adam West and the Green Loontern are playable characters which is just awesome.\n-That they shut up Conan O'Brien in the last update so he only speaks if you walk up to him and hit the B button.  He's incessent talking was annoying before but you may want to talk to him the first time through just to get the lay of the land.\n-managed to finish the entire game in two weeks and sixty-seven hours which isn't bad for a lego game.\n-Voice acting was fun and good as it usually is since they started letting the characters speak.\n-There are a plenty of characters in this game so have ample combinations for free play, quests and races\n-There are many places to visit with quests and races including the bat cave (which has a room modeled after the batman tv show), the hall of justice, the watchtower, the seven lantern planets and a moon base\n-Each free play level is broken up into different sections so you don't necessarily have to start from the beginning\n-You can find unlocked red bricks in both the bat cave and the watchtower by going to the trophy room.  Much of what's in the watchtower is also in the bat cave so you can decide where you want to go.\n\nCons:\n-This game has the fewest checkpoints I've ever seen for a lego game. This became a problem when I went on to free play as I mentioned above\n-Couldn't access any free play levels or characters that were unlocked until after you got so far into the story.  Once you were done with the story you could access unlocked vehicles in Oa, unlocked characters by holding down the Y button or visiting one of the Lantern planets and free play levels from the control room in the watchtower.  It could sometimes be annoying to go from one to the other just to unlock something, especially since the bat computer didn't work.\n-The map wasn't as good as Lego Marvel and when you got past a certain level in story mode you kept going back to the control room and had to find your next level on it.  I really didn't like that, it was a bit obnoxious.\n-there are no extra hearts or invincible red bricks in this game, which could have been useful, but there's a ghost stud collector... except there is almost no ghost studs in this game.  Pretty stupid.\n-VR Missions- I really hated these.  Almost threw my controller at my monitor a few times.  Need to do them to get some characters, vehicles and gold bricks though as well as complete a few missions. Was glad when they were done.\n\nOverall I like the game and do recommend it though I wish there was more batman but I believe the dlcs in this game surpass anything they've done in the others and I can't wait to play them all.  Below are some tips and suggestions if you are not the kinda person who likes that stuff stop reading here.\n\nTips and suggestions:\n-I found the red bricks for the gold brick detector, quest detector & adam west in peril detector were very useful on the hub planets\n-If you are like me and like to get all the achievements then to get some of them do the following things: visit all the hub planets on a single gaming session; Jump on something 50 times in a row; the one with Krypto in the Man of Steel level you have to change both characters to Krypto; When you are in the control room there is a room to the right which you will need to go in for two of the achievements.\n-Wait until you're done with story mode to do free play, it's just easier\n-I found doing quests and stuff area by area worked best.\n-On your way to Oa for the first time inspect the moon instead of going through the grate. There's an achievement with cows that isn't too hard to find.\n-When in Oa I used the cars for the land races (Flash's Car worked best for me) but I used flying characters for all the air races because the planes flew like junk.  You just got to find the right one to use (Zatanna, Red Torando were among the ones that worked best for me) and may also have to boost the character in flight when the gates are farther apart.\n-Zatanna is good character to use on things because she can fly, blow up gold objects and go through grates.  Cyborg is also cool cause once you have the space suit when you double jump with him (no matter what suit he's currently wearing) he'll switch to the space suit and fly.\n\nWell if you've read all this you must have had a lot of time on your hands lol.  Thanks for reading and good luck!\n\n**UPDATE 3/20/2015** Since I wrote this review all 3 of the remaining DLCs for the season pass have been released. Due to space limitations I decided to combine my updates on these into one.  My favorite of the three was the Arrow DLC.  Good length, plenty to do and and a cool lego riff by Stephen Amell of his Arrow intro.  My least favorite was the Bizarro DLC.  It was really hard trying to figure out what you were supposed to be doing in that one.  Felt like throwing my controller at my monitor.  The Squad DLC was pretty cool but felt shorter than the others.  All the DLCs give you more cool characters to play around with so worth it for that reason alone.  Now I'm just counting down the days until Lego Jurassic World is released.

Just not the one people were looking for...\nThere are definitely a lot of characters to choose from, and that is a nice feature that I love. Some mechanics of the game and the story were disappointing. Some of the main heroes and villians, such as Batman, Robin, Joker...each has 8 different versions of them, each with unique abilities. Trying to remember who was which became frustrating. Of course, though, there is Cyborg. Cyborg is the most overpowered character in any LEGO game ever. He can literally do everything, and while it may be useful, I wanted to rely on more than 1 character to get the job done. Instead of me trying to widen my character range, I was stuck going back to one guy, over, and over again.\n\nOne of the things that I really enjoyed about LEGO® MARVEL™ Super Heroes was the city of New York, which you could freely explore. In the second LEGO Batman, you could explore all of Gotham. This one sadly had a couple little planets, which you could fully explore in about 2 minutes. Something that really brought it down, as I love free roam.\n\n73 / 100\n\nIt isn't the worst LEGO game out there, but its one that doesn't stand too high on my list. Too many features made it fall short for me. If you can get past the fact that there is really no Free Roam at all, and that you will rely on 1 character for just about everything, than you should give it a go.\n\n(SPOILERS) One thing that also really frustrated me with the story was the mission where the Joker dresses as Batman, and Wonder Woman as Cheetah, and it was just too confusing.","December 30, 2015","true","49.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/313690/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","LEGO Batman 3 starts slow and then gets a lot better, and then overwhelms with so much content it's hard to be disappointed.\n\nI don't think I've ever played a game so clearly made with hardcore fans in mind. Not only is LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham a DC fanboy's dream come true (unless you happen to love one of the few characters not included), but also a LEGO fan's too. If you happen to fall into both categories, knowing, for example, both who Mr Plastic is and what LEGO master builds are, then you've hit the jackpot. For everyone else, this is another slick, content-packed LEGO game that will feel incredibly similar to previous LEGO games you've played.\n\nDropping the open-world design seen in LEGO Batman 2 and the more recent Hobbit game, Batman 3 returns to a series of individual levels and a number of hubs and planets that can be explored. With a storyline that centres on the evil Brainiac's intention to shrink down planets, and the involvement of the Lanterns, an open world wouldn't really work. The result is a game that offers some lovely diverse locations, and a lot of fun, once it actually gets going.\n\nThe opening few hours were a bore. Mainly set inside dingy locations or dull space station rooms, it all felt rather 'been there done that'. New playable characters were slow to arrive and the introduction of new suits for characters (giving them new abilities, such as magnetism, electricity, flight, etc) made for a rather prolonged tutorial. I wasn't feeling the love. It was another LEGO game, done well, but there was no spark. And then things suddenly got a lot more interesting.\n\nIt takes a while, but once you're outside the game comes alive. Not only do the levels become more colourful (especially the Lantern planet levels) and clever in their design, but the characters can use their abilities more and the increased cast plays off each other very well.\n\nWhile the game is largely played from the same fixed camera angles the series has always used during levels, meaning you can't pan around to take in the environments, parts of Batman 3 look lovely. A couple of boss encounters really impress, as do a set of shrunken city levels that are entirely made of LEGO. Sure, this isn't a next-gen showpiece, but I paused on more than one occasion to take some snaps. Of course, the audio work here is brilliant, with top notch voice acting to deliver the humorous script, and all the classic music associated with the DC super heroes.\n\nSpeaking of the DC heroes, LEGO Batman 3 can't help but suffer to the casual audience in comparison to last year's Marvel Super Heroes game. While Marvel is on a high at the cinema, unless you are really into DC you'll struggle to recognise most the characters here. Batman and the rest of the Justice League characters, along with some of the enemies, will be familiar faces, and if you've played the Arkham games you'll at least know some of the Batman friends and foes, but this will largely be a game of discovery for many players. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and you'll know going in how much fanservice here will excite you or go completely over your head.\n\nDesigned for an audience so diverse in age (very young kids through to fully-grown adults with kids of their own), LEGO Batman 3 often feels like it can't quite be challenging enough. I'll admit to being stuck from time to time (entirely down to overlooking objects in the levels that needed to be destroyed in order to be built into something else), but the puzzles are borderline pre-school level and the mini-games are atrocious (aside from the shmup-lite sequences that resemble a super simple Resogun). A set of stages in which you have to run around Tron-like worlds are so poor I'm surprised they made the cut, and offer nothing other than tedium.\n\nIf you're disappointed about the lack of open world, you can explore the Lantern planets via a moon base (Oa, for example, lets you drive vehicles around, but they all offer plenty to do along with the moon hub itself) and the hub zones (Batcave, The Watchtower and Hall of Justice) have so much to find that you'll be playing well beyond the end of the main missions. As is always the case in LEGO games, there are an obscene number of characters to collect, bricks to find and secrets to uncover. This is a massive game that will keep you (and a split-screen friend) happy for a long time if you're into collectables of the DC variety. Freeplay has always been a series staple and it's great here, and there's even a character customisation tool.\n\nLEGO Batman 3 starts slow and then gets a lot better, and then overwhelms with so much content it's hard to be disappointed. It's hard to get really excited about a game that feels largely similar to how the series started with LEGO Star Wars almost 10 years ago on the PlayStation 2, but DC and LEGO fans won't care as much about the sameness. For everyone else there's no doubt this is a classy package packed to the brim with content, but new ideas are definitely needed. LEGO Batman 3 eventually becomes very good but it's time the studio attempted to build a new mould.\n\n9/10","April 3, 2015","true","57.7"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","27","38","0","0"

I've all but given up doing the Hub missions because I'm getting motion sickness from the Hub Worlds design, I definitely would have prefered a cityscape like Lego Marvel or Lego Batman 2.  Overall I find the game to be more of the same Lego fun and the replay and collecting of tokens, bricks on freeplay is a lot faster with the option to start from checkpoint sections instead of the beginning of each level.

The Doctor Who refrences were cool. (plz make lego dr who). I love how much care is put into the characters. Characters like Frankenstein, Polka Dot Man, and Atrocitus are awesome. Giving other characters suits was really cool. This game had a better story mode than Marvel. The space ship shooter levels were fun, but it would help if the player's ship was easier to see. My favorite level was the bonus classic level based on the 1966 Batman tv show. Some of the "virtual reality" levels were fun, but some were not.\nThere are a lot of characters, BUT I was really dissapointed at how many popular characters were left out: Raven, Starfire, Terra, Scarecrow, Power Girl, Two-Face, Doctor Light, Clayface, and more. WHY!!!?? The hub planets made me feel dizzy. I did not like having the horizon being so close because of how small the planet is (its like walking on a giant ball). Conan Obrien is really annoying after hearing him over and over again. The BatComputer does not work. The levels in the DLCs were terrible. The narrator with the australian(?) accent was annoying and weird. They made the scene from Dark Knight where batman stops the joker using his batpod a comic book cutscene. That was dissapointing. Instead you shoot at cars and make a crane. I really did not like all the wasted space in the hubs. Blowing up cars in the Marvel game city was fun, but there is none of that in this.\nWhat really made me mad was finding out that the TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY gold bricks that I collected did not make anything. No secret level door, no secret character or vehicle. Instead, it rains studs in 1 room. At that point in the game I had studs x6 unlocked and plenty of studs to spend, which means I got ALL THOSE GOLD BRICKS FOR NOTHING. Lego Lord of the Rings made use of gold/mithril bricks the best. Each one was used to make something. That is how it should be done.\n","November 25, 2014","true","54.6"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","22","33","0","0"

Players are tasked with visiting the Green Lantern hub worlds and each one starts off the exact same way with a Daffy Duck-led tour of the planet followed by repeated treasure hunts. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. On all six planets. This is a stark contrast to Lego Marvel Heroes where the open world allowed for a more varied game experience. There is no "open world" in Lego Batman 3, just a series of hubs and levels. Worse, “invisible walls” exist in every level, taking away much of the fun of having a flying character by limiting his range and mobility.\n\nMinor glitches abound throughout the game, including NPCs with poor pathing getting stuck behind (or inside) objects and Lego Red Brick choices (minikits, gold bricks, character studs, etc.) either not properly showing the locations in the level, or showing white arrows above locations that were already discovered.\n\nFinally, the voice acting was atrocious throughout. Unlike Lego Marvel Super Heroes which maintained a stellar performance by all while still maintaining a fun atmosphere, the majority of the players in Lego Batman 3 seemed to have been told to ham it up with their worst superhero parody voices. The biggest offenders were Robin (Tim Drake), played as a cross between American Dad’s Steve Smith and the Cowardly Lion; Supergirl channeling an 80’s valley girl; and Joker by someone desperate to make you wish he was Mark Hamill. Luckily, Clancy Brown reprised Lex Luthor (the best actor who ever played the villain) and Tara Strong, Harley Quinn. The best voice over in the game was easily Kevin Smith as a parody of himself (#37-emblazoned hockey shirt included), although Conan O’Brien is worth a mention. Gilbert Gottfried earned a paycheck phoning in Mr. Mxyzptlk.\n\nRegular Lego gamers will also welcome the fact that Traveller’s Tales FINALLY made it so that Video Effects and Red Brick Extras settings are saved so you don’t have to turn them on (or off) every time you continue your game.\n\nBottom line, this was another good entry in the Lego games catalog but nothing extraordinary.\n\nLego Marvel Super Heroes is still the cream of the Lego crop.","November 16, 2014","true","48.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

With this being DC we have the return of other previous characters from the previous title and the known DC universe as well as new characters. The story is very well constructed yet I was dissapointed on the portrayal of Braniac when comparing him to the DC comics and films.\n\nCredit goes to the designers as they have carefully inserted lesser knwon but amazing characters with great backstories as well as witty little remarks and jokes that in some cases only the die hard DC fans will get. Although the gameplay is fun and you'll get hours out of the game there is the case of replay value and repetition. Freeplay offers around another 8 hours of play depending on the player and is even better with a friend but as with most Lego games there is repetition which deters players after a while.\n\nHaving played the game thoroughly and completing it several times I was very pleased with the time I spent on the game, there are some features that could do with looking at or improving but not by much. Despite these very small issues I would definately say give the game a go.

I've played/own a ton of Lego games, and I gotta say that with Batman 3, it's really apparent how TT's matured much of their control scheming and gameplay "modes". Comparitvely, flying is a lot smoother than it was in Batman 2, and I think they've taken a lot of the critical feedback to heart and really optimized the game well. I haven't had many frame stutters, and I'm running max settings all around.\n\nI really appreciate the suit changing system too, which in Batman 2 involved you finding a suit changing station. That was pretty tedious to say the least, but Batman 3 makes it much more fun by allowing players to switch to the various suits at any time simply by holding a button down (Y, if you use an X360 controller).\n\nI haven't spotted any errors/glitches, and I haven't touched Open World yet, but if it's anything like it was in the Marvel game, it's gonna be awesome.

Generally light hearted humor riffing on the licensed source material, LEGO humor appropriate for younger audiences but still amusing to those of us who have never really grown up, and fun but not particularly difficult gameplay that is a perfect way to relax in a gaming world becoming obsessed with having more and more difficult challenges to achieve in games.\n\nThis game builds upon the previous titles in the series with a few new ways of using various characters powers, and a slew of heroes, villains, and passersby from the greater DC universe. Play as Swamp Thing or Solomon Grundy to bash enemies to bits, or Sinestro Corps Batman to harness the power of fear in order to instill it within your enemies.\n\nAcquisition of red bricks is also quite a bit easier, and most of them can be acquired by doing free play of the missions as soon as you finish them, as soon as you have gotten Plastic Man that is.\n\nThis game has been a good addition to my collection and I am currently well on my way to completing my file 100%.","December 31, 2014","true","66.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've played many of the LEGO games, then this one is an amazing continuation of that same wonderful formula.\n\nLEGO games have a way of taking beloved franchises and turning them into fun, self-contained video games. Too many people ignore these genius games and shrug them off because they believe they are "too kiddie" or "not CoD enough." Those people don't know what they are missing.\n\nThis game is a hilarious original story of everyone's favorite caped crusader, with all of his allies and friends fighting against a common threat. This game's story is funny, full of action, and wonderful voice acting and animation. The gameplay is the same fun gameplay, with some new added components. This game has over 150 characters, then if you add all the DLC it gets to be about 200. Between this version and the one on my console, I've spent easily 100 hours playing this game. There is a ton of post-game content, especially with the DLC. It leaves you playing and playing and playing.\n\nThe verdict is that this game is definitely reccomended. If you haven't played this game, you're missing out. Don't skip over this wonderful game.\n\nBeneath this I will be reviewing the DLC individually.\n\nDark Knight DLC pack:\nThis DLC includes a range of charaters from Christopher Nolan's trilogy, including Batman (a new skin), Bane, Joker, Scarecrow, Two-Face, Commisioner Gordon, SWAT Officer, and Catwoman, as well as a few vehicles. The DLC also includes an exclusive story level, where you play as The Joker, Batman, and Commisioner Gordon in reinacting the scenes from the 2008 movie The Dark Knight. The characters in this DLC aren't all that unique, but I can't say I'm not happy that Scarecrow and Two-Face finally showed up in the game, albeit in DLC. As for the level, I love how they redid the scenes from The Dark Knight. It has 10 minikits to find and a few other collectibles scattered around.\nThe Verdict is that this DLC is worth getting, especially if you liked the movie.\n7/10\n\nMan of Steel pack: This DLC provides a range of unique characters such as General Zod, Man of Steel Superman, Jor-El, his wife Lara and a few other random characters, as well as a random DropShip..?. To me, this DLC is essential, if only for its story. This story is the best of the bunch. The characters, though, are practically useless.\nThe Verdict? An 8/10, for the spectacular story level. But not for the characters.\n\nNext up is the Batman 75th pack. It has a huge range of Batman characters from throughout his 75 year history, including Azrael, First Appearance Batman, Sinestro Corps Batman, Brave and the Bold Batman, Gotham by Gaslight Batman, Dark Knight Returns Batman, Zebra Batman, and Vampire Batman. The story is pretty much garbage. It has Harley and Mistah J trashing a party. It's pretty lame.\nThe Verdict? an 8/10, for epic epic epic characters, but a lame story. Still worth it.\n\nAfter that is the Arrow DLC Pack. This one has a cool list of characters from the hit TV show. It's got Arrow, Black Canary(Arrow), Felicity, Diggle, Arsenal, Huntress, Malcom Merlyn, Island Guard, and Slade Wilson, as well as 2 vehicles. I watch the show, and was thouroughly entertained by this adaptation. The story has Arrow and Slade on the island fighting for their lives. I won't go too much into it, but it's great fun.\nThe Verdict? 9/10. It is epic and amazing.\n\nFollowing the Arrow DLC is The Squad (DLC pack). It contains a bunch of characters from the Suicide Squad, but this game is E10 so they just call it the Squad. Pretty lame. The DLC itself, however, isn't. It contains Amanda Waller (not the fat version), Captain Boomerang, Deadshot (The Squad), Deathstroke (The Squad), El Diablo, King Shark, and Harley Quinn (The Squad)! Epic, huh? It not only contains all those fabulous characters but also an equally fabulous story where you break out of or into somewhere, idunno. I forgot. The point is, there's a point where everybody does the hula dance so there's that.\nThe Verdict? With awesome characters, reskinned and new, and a great story, this DLC lands a 8.5/10.\n\nThe final story and season pass DLC is the strange Bizarro Pack. Well, TT had to force Darksied in there somehow, so why not in a DLC that has nothing to do with him? I know, I know, there is some small story corellation, but it's not enough. This DLC was a bummer for me, because I expected an epic story level featuring Darksied and the Omega Sancition but, in the words of Batman, "Darksied. You look how I feel." This DLC has a story as boring as a sunscreen commercial. The only redeeming quality of this DLC is the characters. While not a huge fan of the Bizarroed-out characters, Batzarro has some history, and that I liked. I also liked playing as Darksied and Guy Gardner, but it wasn't all that unique. Much like the Batman 75th pack, this has a bad story and a great character roster.\nThe Verdict? 7.5/10.\n\nA seperate DLC is the Batman Beyond DLC pack. It doesn't come with a story or a level, only a group of characters. Is it still worth it? YES. This is, surprisingly, one of the greatest DLCs in the game. The characters are Ace (Beyond), Batman Beyond, Blight, Bonk, Old Man Bruce, Inque, The Joker (Beyond), and Mr. Freeze Beyond. All of these characters are extremely unique, even to someone who is only a loose fan of the TV show. I've watched a few episodes, and I thought it was just OK. But this DLC is far from OK.\nThe Verdict? A straight 8/10. That's right!\n\nNext are 2 free DLC's that don't really add all that much, but are worth mentioning.\n\nRainbow Pack: This DLC includes 2 characters. Yes, 2 characters! That's it. But, it's free so why not? The characters are Batman (Rainbow), and Rainbow raider. Ther both are pretty unique, and both are fun to play as.\nThe Verdict? For what it is, and for being free, an 7/10. THIS IS NOT COMPARED TO THE OTHERS FOR THIS IS FREE.\n\nHeroines and Vilainesses: This free DLC comes with 10 all new female characters! It includes Batwoman, Killer Frost, Mera, Plastique, Terra, Power Girl, Raven, Spoiler, Starfire, and Vixen. This pack is awesome. All the characters are original and very unique, with practially no reskins. Batwoman, Mera, and Vixen may be similar to Batgirl, Aquaman, and Catwoman, but they each have their unique twist.\nThe Verdict? 9/10. NOT TO BE COMPARED, THIS IS FREE. IF IT WASN'T, IT WOULD BE LOWER.\n\nTL,DR-Get it, and the season pass. Not to be missed.","August 12, 2015","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Braniac's evil plans to shrink Earth forces all heroes to come out to stop Brainiac. Who will win?\n\nI shall now give a proper review. The gameplay is well done. Great voices and graphics. Pretty much everything you need for a lego game.\n\nGameplay: Smooth controls but the camera isn't very good. You can only go up and down and side to side... it feels limited. The minifigs you play as give great response to the controls making the gameplay very smooth. Building as usual is good. Combat is a little slow...little. Driving cars have bad keybindings which means you have to set your self. Airvehicles are PERFECT they're fast and the handiling is really good.\n\nVoices: One word: PERFECT.\n\nGraphics: Shiny world. Smooth graphics and the cutscenes (because i think they count as graphics)\nare well done especially the head with tentical things. No lag when i played, high graphics could be supported by most pc's.\n\nAudio: Like the voices: PERFECT\n\nFree roam: This could possibly be the negative part of this review. You can not free roam in Gotham but... you can free roam in places like the watchtower, Oa etc. The problem is that it feels very small\nand can't we just use green lantern and teleport instead? Going into the watchtower and going to the moon base and then end up going to a tiny planet? Atleast the planets look nice.\n\nVerdict: This game is great and I would reccommend it to anyone. Though it does have its downsides but trust me....it's not that bad at all.      I give it an   8.5 out of  10.","November 13, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

One thing to point out is once you do finish the campaign, the game doesn't just end there. You can replay the levels you've already completed, unlock new characters, and you can do all this while playing as pretty much any character you have unlocked. ( Side Note: The whole 'after the game is done' exploring and replaying is known as FreePlay. ) The hours you spend playing the game really come down to the type of player you are. If you just finish the campaign in average time and don't do much else, you can take less than 24 hours to be done with the game. However, if you want hundred percent completion, you can look forward to putting A LOT of hours into the game.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a great buy, especially if you plan on playing even after the campaign. Are there flaws? Yes. There isn't much of a 'open-world' aspect to the game, unlike other Lego games ( for example: Lego Marvel: Super Heroes. ) Some people may not like the game for that reason, but to me, this is a great game overall. The game isn't so difficult that you need a walk-through every mission, and has some humour in cut-scenes that you may get a laugh out of.

Don't believe them. This game is totally different than Lego Marvel. Both Lego Marvel and Lego Batman 3 let you choose from a wide range of characters and both have excellent voice acting... however, that's where the similarities end. Lego Batman 3 is not open world but the level designs and character combat is so much better than what I've experienced in Lego Marvel. You can definitely tell that the devs have put more effort into everything since the game isn't open world but still, has the same replayability of Lego Marvel. This is a great game to compliment Lego Marvel or Lego Barman 2.","April 7, 2015","true","11.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I'm talking here about static camera. This is the first title on which we had to switch from dynamic camera to static because the fast movement of either flash or flying character made me feel ill and confused.\n\nMinor issue: Overcomplicated gameplay mechanics\nThis is a problem I had in LEGO: Hobbit but here, the mechanics of what which character in which stance/suit can do to either gold/silver object is a bit more complex making us stuck few times, trying to figure out where is this tiny gold/silver thing we need to melt or blow up to advance the story. When we destroyed some bushes and found a silver rock, behind which was a destructable wall it felt unnecessary and annoying. It isn't a puzzle, it's an annoyng search for destructibles.\n\nOverall, the story is fun, the humor is typical for LEGO games titles but if you are new to the series or want to try another LEGO game after playing the awesome LEGO: Lord of the Rings game I cannot recommend this one. If you are a die hard fan of the series then there is no need for you to read this review - you'll get it anyways.","May 17","false","11.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I, frankly would recommend Lego Batman 3 to all people of all ages. Unless your dead. Probably not the best idea then. Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham is one of the most thrilling games I have played this pas cenetary. To begin with, the story is amazing with great character development and has twists and turns at every corner. My favourite character was Harlequin (she has the biggest boobs, dont tell my wife). The gameplay was some of the best I've seen in a while (and I've played ET for the Atari) complex as well I mean I was stuck on this game for ages some puzzles took me hundreds of hours to complete. The graphics really utilised my 4K cinema screen, 1080p 60fps bro all the way. This game really helped my periscope channel launch I couldnt have had my 14 followers without it. I love the variety of characters for instance you can play batman, batwoman, batgirl, robin, joker, bane, harlequin, penguin, and my favourite batman villian of all time Captain America. The controls are great I love how the base controls for moving forward is q. Jumping is x and using your controller is for sad weebs not like me Frank Underwood (kappa Naruto for lyf Goku is my waifu). The online multiplayer matches for Lego Batman 3 could use some improvement as I keep playing with this person called insert another controller idk who the ♥♥♥♥ you are but stop stalking my steam acc you ♥♥♥♥. My favourite pastime in this game is playing freeplay with my best friend Barack Obamba and his favourite character is Black Panther as he is of the same origins and is in to latex when he has sex. My favourite character when playing DC LEGO BATMAN 3 is probably Gandalf from Star Wars Epsidoe 3: Dragon Ball Z Strikes Back. When i play this game I feel a sense of enlightment almost as if I am Buddha in my temple getting revealed the secrets of the universe by our almighty god Nicktron. My favourite youruber is KILLER KEEMSTARRRRRRRR and I love how he helps me get riiiiiiiggghhhhttt intoooooo the neeewwwssssss. Anyway back to the topic at ahnd. Lego Batman 3 is a calming experience that makes me want to rip out my eyeballs and shove them down the throat of the nearest giraffe, like I said, calming experience. Whenever I hear the word batman I get a big long subway footlong sized hard on and begin to feel the essence of batman invading my soul. To sum up my feelings about this game I will give you some reviews from my close friendos.\nIgn: 10/10 would game again\nGamespot: 10/10 best game LCK\nRotten Tomatoes: 100% best game ever made in the history of ever\nNow some reviews from my close steam friends\nbookit and spid: This game is my life, there is nothing better to use your spid to put in a bookit than Lego Batman 3\nYado: Meatballs\nAn Unhappy Goat: My dad is a woman 10/10 best game ever\nOaksey: I dont need a sweeper Im more about that blue trinket life bois (best game btw)\nfrankie: "I kiss boys"\nThis friend would like to remain anonymous (I dont know his steam name): My name is Hayden, Rockets are my favourite food and form of ♥♥♥♥♥.

The mini versions of the lantern planets and some of the non-flat levels made me feel dizzy - perhaps that's just me though.\n\nThe celebrity tie-ins were acceptable and amusing for the most-part, but Conan O'Brien? That put me off slightly.\n\nIn summary, I'd recommend this game to anyone who has already played LB2, and if you can pick it up cheap and you enjoy spending a few hours doing side missions to unlock your favourite niche DC characters, then it's worth the time investment.","January 3, 2015","true","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Family action games don't get any better than this, easily one of the best games of 2014.\n\nTt raises the bar for family games, and gaming in general. I would recommend this game to anyone, heck I am enjoying this just as much as my siblings.\n\nThis game is a must for people who love fun, like super heroes, want to play a good action / adventure game, and overall want to have a good time. Suitable for all ages, and I am sure everyone will find something to love about this game.\n\nEven without the DLC the game packs a lot content. I would have liked if the season pass had included The Ps4 exlcusive mission, but the Season pass itself is well worth the price of admittion.\n\nThe only two negative points about this game would be some pesky bugs, but there are few of them, and they aren't even worth mentioning. Co-op controls could be better. Outside of that I would like to see an increased difficulty curve in the next titles, but that's just a friendly suggestion,\n\nI'd rate this game very high in my list. I think it is a must if you like DC or comics in general, and it is worth checking out if you like puzzle or platforming games.","January 3, 2015","true","57.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Once in control configuration select change device and tap a button on the controler and then the game should auto fill in the remaining buttions. finally click accept and you will be good to go.\nThe main problem with this is while playing the game does not use the Xbox controller button colors and button referances like it will say use button 4 or 3 and not Y or X with its associated color which will be a problem for my kid. THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED AND WILL NOT CHANGE MY RATING UNTILL IT IS.\n\nThis game will not work with my Logitech f710!!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/petersonrules/recommended/313690/","petersonrules","Captain Zaphod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/petersonrules/","148 products in account","TLDR; No open world and for the most part stupid dialogue, pass on this one.\n\nI had the highest of hopes for Lego Batman 3. I love lego and the DC Universe and Lego Batman 2 was one of my favourite games of 2012. I had completed the first game to 100% and it was fairly by the numbers for a lego game, hub area and missions branching off of that, the thing I really enjoyed was the villain storyline, noticably absent from subsequent releases. Anyhow, trailers for Lego Batman 2: DC heroes unite hit the internet and I was super hyped, with promises of heroes from other DC books including the flash, green lantern and superman. I bought the game and it delivered in spades, but what I didn't know I wanted was the amazing open world hub of Gotham city, now obviously it was scaled down but it was all there, arkham asylum, ace chemicals, and nothing could beat the feeling of getting a mission and racing to arkham in the batmobile, or running through the city at ridiculous speeds as the flash, and flying with the old superman theme blasting away was absolutely stunning. My two gripes were however, even though we saw metropolis, it was not available for roaming around in and the other dc heroes apart from superman were introduced late and kind of an afterthought, but it didn't matter because I could fight crime as them in the open world. Inbetween the release of lego batman 2 and 3 there was an amazing game by the name of Lego Marvel Super Heroes, and I am less of a fan of the marvel stuff but it was incredible, new york city was huge with the baxter building and the sheild hellicarrier available to fly to or jump from. "Okay" I thought, "how are Lego gonna up the anti in the new Lego Batman game?" "What's the subtitle again?" Beyond Gotham, In my head this was going to be what Lego Marvel was but the helicarrier was the watchtower and we could have metropolis and coast city. But no. I bought the game on a sale as I didn't have the money on release, I played the story to the point where I could return to watchtower, and was dissapointed. "Okay" I thought "I'll just beat the game and then we can see what we unlock" not a single city is what. No patrolling gotham to kill time, no flying over in the batwing or chilling in the batcave before rushing through the secret door to the rescue. You can now access the suits anywhere by holding Y, now in theory I see this working for overworld fun, instead of having to place suits everywhere, you can just change on the go. But it doesn't work because batman with a jetpack is amazing in gotham city but boring in the hall of justice, so all it does is force the suits to require these charging stations which limit your use of batman with a jetpack in order to make the puzzles less easily solvable,  this creates a "you can't tell me what to do feel" toward the game because you have the suit, the game just won't let you use it. The writing is stupid save for some admittedly funny lines, braniac is not in the least intimidating and sounds like an annoying idiot who likes collecting things rather than the calm calculating evil mastermind he should be. Apparently batman thinks heroes shouldn't have emotions which is stupid for so many reasons but mainly because his emotion of greif for his parents' deaths and his love for the city and not wanting anyone to go through what he did, he becomes the batman. Don't buy this game, if you haven't played Lego Batman 2, go and buy it instead and if you have play Lego Marvel and if you have played both wait for lego batman 4 or lego marvel 2 because this one really isn't worth your money.","May 3, 2015","false","5.9"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","15","32","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/recommended/313690/","mokushiroku","Moku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/","694 products in account","[New Review]: Batman 3 is no longer a Batman game, instead focusing on Green Lantern lore. There are only a handful of Batman characters you'll see throughout the story, and even then they all play miniscule parts besides Batman, who himself only plays second-fiddle at the best of times. Only two levels have anything to do with Batman, while major characters like Poison Ivy and The Penguin from the last games are nothing but unlockables with no helpful skills.\n\nThere is no open world like Batman 2, instead letting you explore a number of sperical levels and three hubs, which isn't necessarily worse, but does feel very limiting. Vehicles are all but worthless, limited to a single level of gold brick races. The introduction of VR missions is very interesting, but fairly limited. The gameplay in general is exactly what you'd expect from a Lego game, though there's less of a grind for studs, but this just refocuses the grind on having to play levels multiple times to get everything, long after studs are worthless.\n\nThis game has more bugs than any other Lego game I've played, both progression-blocking and crashing. It is also impossible to get 100% of the acheivements without buying all of the underwhelming DLC. And as much as I enjoyed the old TV series level and characters, Adam West is overplayed SO much in this game that it will stop being cute long, long before you're finished.\n\nIf you want to play a BATMAN game, go for Lego Batman 2 instead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Old Review]: Lego Batman 3 is a strange part-forward, part-side-step in the series. While clearly better than the first, Beyond Gotham does away with the vast, open world of Batman 2, instead giving us a handful of 'hub worlds', which are like a typical level comprised of a few rooms that you can free-roam around - much like the 'base' you have in any of the Lego games. Each hub has multiple side-missions and other 'mini-puzzles' to unlock bricks and characters, as you'd expect, as well as each having their own version of important rooms, like character creation, etc. - While this fits in with the story, it makes the game feel very small and confined, while limiting the sense of freedom you got from heroes with travel-powers.\n\nBatman 3 is a game for a different audience. While previous Batman games required only a basic knowledge of lore found either in Arkham games or the old movies, this game seems focused solely on long-time comic readers. There are multiple references that go over my head and many characters I've never heard of, and I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of "oh wow!" moments. In fact, most of these character-moments feel like they might as well have been OCs since they fall so flat on me.\n\nAnother issue is that Brainiac's power to shrink things turns levels into the same all-lego style of the bonus rooms from previous games, which were by far my least favourite thing in them. Maybe I'm just not into lego as much as I should be, but fully-lego worlds feel completely devoid of charm of interest to me. Not only that, but the real-world locations weren't even close to accurate, which may seem petty, but it frustrated me, and was a missed oppertunity in my opinion.\n\nBut to get to the real meat of the matter: This game has had more game-breaking bugs than any other Lego game I've played so far (and I've played plenty). At only 7 levels in, I've already experienced two bugs that required me to fully quit the game (and lose my level progress), as well as a bizzare one that made the game load extremely slowly, which was again fixed with a restart for no discernable reason. And this isn't counting the typical bugs you find in Lego games, just the progress-blocking ones.\n\nSo in short: This game is for DC fans in general, but diehard fans specifically, which is a weird focus for something that is  allegidly a childrens' game. Almost all references here will go over a child's head, leaving them with little more than the slapstick humor and goofyness to enjoy... which is fine I guess, I don't really care. If you're into the comics, even the obscure ones, then this is made for YOU. If you just have a casual, pop-culture knowledge, then you'd better already be a fan of Lego games to enjoy this.\n\nI wanted another world of Lego fun to enjoy with a Batman twist, but instead I got a few connected rooms, 75% of the roster is either not Batman related or I don't know them, and an equal amount of frustration and fun so far. If this were LEGO Justice League I wouldn't be complaining, but a lot of the Batman characters I know and love are relegated to side-missions and nothing additional characters since, frankly, this isn't a Batman game anymore.","March 30","false","31.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

While I haven't played The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings games, and barely played Marvel Superheroes, I will say that from my experience this is the best LEGO game by TT Games for far.\n\nIf you are a fan of DC Comics and everything within, you're gonna love this. While Batman 2 has offered us some sort of DC Superheroes experience, Batman 3 takes it to a whole new level, going Beyond Gotham, which you can feel. I fell in love with this game because it's not Gotham anymore, no more depressing rainy city filled with crime, but space missions, Watchtower and even Lantern Planets instead! Needless to say, there are way more characters than in any TTG game before, and probably it hosts more characters than LEGO Indiana Jones 2 and Star Wars The Complete Saga together!\n\nThe story is alright - it involves Brainiac as a main antagonist who we have seen at the end of Batman 2, and Story itself takes us to variety of places. While some characters could have worked better as leads than the others(Bain instead of Solomon Grundy would have been better, imo), the story and characters are still great.\n\nRemember Suit system from Batman 2 where you had to find a specific pad for Batman or Robin with a specific suit? Well, TTG have realised that nobody wants to deal with this anymore and added a free selection of any unlocked suits for characters that have suits, whether during story or free play missions. oh and, Batman and Robin are not the only ones who have got different suits!\n\nOverall, I would say this is the best LEGO game by TTG so far, and it's a must have for any DC Comics fan, no matter your age.","November 16, 2014","true","39.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Also i found the game takes a LONG time to boot up.\n\nIn summary i think people who are new to the lego game franchise may enjoy it but people like me who have completed multiple games in the "series" will probably be a little bored and a bit disappointed in the lack of a real open world.\n\nP.S i played this game with a 360 controller.","June 24, 2015","false","15.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Well...  It's pretty much the fact that they removed something that was the part I enjoyed the most out of the few ones I played...\n\nSo I'll just let it out, this game has NO hub world.\nI mean, yes, there's a hub, but it's nothing compared to the one in Lego Batman 2, which considering it's ♥♥♥♥ING CALLED BEYOND GOTHAM, it kind of goes against your expectations.\n\nWhich really saddens me because... There's still so much of it that it's an improvement\n-I like the new designs\n-The humour's way better\n-Once you get a suit you don't need to find its platform to put it on anymore\n-Batman can glide without an special suit!\n-There's a flying theme for Wonder Woman now too!\n-Flying controls are much better now!\n-The new space shooting missions are a lot of fun... For the few there are...\n-There are way more characters\n\nAnd yet, with all these new features, all I can think of is how nice it would've been if I could've enjoy them playing in a city hubworld or something like it.\nand by the way, even thought the fact that Wonder Woman has a flying theme is awesome at first, you get REALLY sick of it after a while, Why? Because since there's no hubworld, IT SOUNDS IN THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MISSIONS!!\n\nIt really breaks the mood to be constantly changing themes you know, I'd say the same thing for Superman's since it's returning too, but you barely play as him during the story so it doesn't matter.\n\nYou know, hearing it was in space, what excited me the most about this game was how we'd roam around it, going through space sounds awesome!... That was a big missed opportunity, Tt, It wouldn't been so hard, just do like with the hellicarrier in Lego Marvel, going up gets you to space (Trhough some load time I guess) and there you can see the planets there are to explore alongside the Justice... Space something (I'm sorry, I forgot its name) and flying towards one gets you to it (through another load time probably too)\nSure, that'd mean each planet would have a smaller hubworld to fit in the game, but hey! It'd be way cooler than none at all!!\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the planets you visit in the game are... Boring, you only go to the lantern ones and they're one color themes grow old really fast, I guess this was to tease Green Lantern fans after the cancellation of the animated series, or maybe the developers didn't had any idea of what other planet could they add, but it's still very underwhelming.\n\nIt also helped me realize how... Boring the levels are over all, normally, it doesn't stick with me so much because I have this big hub world to explore that keeps me entertain, but ♥♥♥♥, now the boring levels are the only thing there... AND THEY'RE BORING!!\n\nsigh, so... They also come and tease us with their approaching Lego Jurassic World in the credits, You know what? That sounds great!! Exploring the whole park, and if we get to play as some of the dinosaurs that'd be even better!!\nDON'T ♥♥♥♥ THIS UP!!

Well because it is only fair to compare this to Lego Marvel Super Heroes. I purchased this for my daughters and frankly Travelers Tales should be ashamed of themselves for this being the more recent of the two, but far lower in quality in almost every way. First of all, LMSH has a true open world. You explore, you can mess around and you have an abundence of side-quests.  LBBG has a quest hub which consists of around 12 'rooms' which really doesn't justify any exploration or provide anything to just play with. Next, the personality of the two games. LBBG gives you an especially simple story with a narrow group of characters that lack any kind of charm. Superman is an egomaniac, Batman is boringly serious and Robin is child-like. To try and make the game amusing they decide to hit the characters with Spectrum energy, a cheap attempt at comedy which the developers cling to for the rest of the story rather than trying to be genuinely creative. LMSH however, gave you a wide and varied cast with some genuine comedy moments. Plus the story itself was genuinely interesting.\n\nSo between the two, what does LBBG give you? More characters and more abilities per character. But that is it. Puzzles are more varied at first, but again it seems that the devs ran out of budget or time for the last half of the game resulting in a severe lack of variety in puzzles. The 'space battles' are a 2D side scrolling mess which feels like someone had to toss in some content quickly and this was what they came up with.\n\nFrankly, if they took all of the great bits from LMSH and added the additional characters and abilities from LBBG and put them into Lego Avengers, due to be released in 2016, then it should be an amazing game. As such, save your cash for that release or purchase Lego Marvel Superheroes rather than this half-baked mess in the meantime.\n\nAdditionally, it seems that although TT added DX11 functionality, it is very unstable and causes some Nvidia drivers to simply stop responding mid-game. The solution I found is to change the game to use DX9 in the settings or remove the dx11 executable from the directory. Did TT even sit down and test this thing?","August 24, 2015","false","28.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I have a friend over, drink a bunch of coffee, have a couple snacks ready, and play a game. Lego games are awesome for 2 player co-op, but for some reason, this game is paced for 1 player. You wait for the other player to do the work for every action. Then when you finally complete one of these "puzzles" you then MUST wait through the cut screen. As the odd man out almost everytime, waiting for the other player to complete his/her character-specific puzzle, I'm then forced to wait through a cut screen that doesn't really add much to the game itself. These cut screens happen often... very often and are unskippable. Friend gets bored and drops out, or decides to commit murder suicide until I quit. I would have enjoyed this much more if the pace of the game was meant for two people solving puzzles together, and being able to skip passed the pointless cut screens. This particular title in this franchise does not add anything new from any of the other titles. The Lego Star Wars series in this franchise is probably the only one that you need to play. As much as I love local co-op, you can pass on this if you've already played any of the other titles from this franchise.","March 23, 2015","false","1.9"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

Now that being said i have to voice my concerns about this game and why i found it to be a let down. Toggling and camera panning: i found this to be horrible and especially so when i visited the lantern worlds. Characters: i enjoyed using characters i haven't used before and most were in there that i like but there are a few i wish i had seen. Levels: meh, i expected more. Free play: most times i wasn't given the characters needed to collect all the minikits. Vehichles: i would have liked to see more and personally hated most of the vehichles available. Character customizer: a let down. DLC: i bought the season pass, a let down, i feel most of the characters in the DLC should have been standard, no real reason to buy it, waste of money, the vehichles were okay i guess. I wish Adam West had actual powers so when i recue him all 30 times i might feel satisfied. Marvel superheroes was a gem, the pinnacle of lego games thus far, this game provided nothing new      and i wish i had spent the money on a different game.

Beyond Gotham goes even farther with tons of post-storyline quests and locations, different fight animations for different characters, and an amazing amount of voice-over recording.\n\nFor me, though, my favorite thing about LEGO games is the humor, and I didn't find as much as usual in Beyond Gotham. Maybe it's just that I missed all the inside jokes (I'm less familiar with the DC universe than with other LEGO game topics). Normally, I find myself laughing out loud frequently, and wanting to show all the silly bits to friends. But my snickers-per-minute ratio was far below standard with this particular LEGO game.\n\nSo, if you want hours of gameplay, especially co-op with a less-skilled friend, Beyond Gotham is a fine choice. If you want silly humor, there are better LEGO games to start with.","February 28, 2015","false","63.0"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

The view of the scene you are in never changes and so the game plays a lot like a 'side-scroller'. At least the limited amount of time I played it.\n2.) The controls are terrible. There is not even mouse control, just keyboard only.\n3.) It seems more like a puzzle game than a fighting game with puzzles being things like 'gather these things and put them over here'.\n4.) It seems like certain 'puzzles' need two players. I got stuck almost immediately because of this. I think I needed both characters to do an action simultaneously.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/highlysuspectURL/recommended/313690/","highlysuspectURL","highlysuspectusername","http://steamcommunity.com/id/highlysuspectURL/","421 products in account","Gameplay: It has the staple LEGO game style.  Break stuff, collect studs, build LEGO objects, solve puzzles, and various interactions of specific objects.  It's the same formula.  A few things have changed though, the game has included costumes with purpose.  In previous LEGO games they would have multiple skins for characters, but they had no primary function outside of aesthetic.  Now each costume has a specific ability.  It's a nice addition though it does make the player have to switch costumes for different tasks quite a bit which is a little tedious.  Having all these costumes on top of having a huge character roster is wonderful.  I've also noticed that the levels feel longer.  They are about a half hour each, and I've noticed that at least one level I entered didn't have a saving checkpoint until over half way through which was an inconvenience.\n\nPuzzles: The puzzles are perhaps a little more difficult this time around, but ever so slightly.  It is still definitely playable for adults and children alike.  This game in the franchise is not an exception in the LEGO game formula in which the puzzles can occasionally feel like artificial barriers.  A new added problem with puzzles is that at least a few options seem viable to solve them.  But the game will only allow you to use one option, so it can be confusing as to which one you think the game expects you to use.  This often occurs because of the different costumes abilities.\n\nEnvironment: The biggest problem I have with this game is the hugely disappointing lack of exploration. Having played LEGO Marvel Super Heroes I enjoyed the free-roam of New York City immensely.  Not only that, LEGO Batman 2 also had free roam of Gotham!  It feels like a step backwards not to have this free roam area.  It's great that we get to visit all these locations in the DC universe but it feels like I'm getting a few slices of different cakes when I need at least a whole cake before I want to try any other slices.  The worlds that the player does get to visit that are large enough to roam, are completely empty.  There is practically no one in them.  It's isolating and depressing and it leaves much to be desired.  I really feel like the game is playing out linearly.  Playing as superheroes with the linear progression feels like there's even more artificial barriers.  I don't feel like a super hero.  If I am a super hero, than I'm a super hero stuck in a lab rat cage. It's really a shame.  The world feels silent as there's almost no one around you and when there is someone around you it's almost exclusively enemies.  Because the hubworlds are at the locations they are at, this is understandable but it certainly doesn't help the gameplay.  The utilization of vehicles was also great in previous LEGO titles.  Now hold on, LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham also has vehicles, doesn't it?  It's true, it does.  But I have completed 7 missions and spent over 6 hours in the game (roughly 47% of the main story line) and yet still have not accessed a hub world large enough to use a vehicle.  The worlds that I have seen others play on with vehicles lack any enjoyable exploration.  The game blocks off a lot of areas from players until they've progressed in the story.  Again, more artificial barriers.\n\nThe game seems to suffer because of a huge polarity in what it knows the players wants it to be and what it provides to the player.  We want to expand from Gotham.  But we didn't want to lose it in the process.  When I say this I mean to say that this is a Batman game, and most of the focus is on batman and robin (of which you play as them in most levels), which is the biggest influence in level design.  Batman and robin can't fly, they're powerful, but navigating the world is difficult for them.  So the levels are designed with that in mind.  The ceilings are low, flying is made more difficult (especially with the inclusion of the requirement of fuel).  Yet, the game gives you super powerful characters to play as.  I think it's appropriate that they call this a Batman game and not a DC Super Heroes game for that reason.  While you can certainly play as those other characters the game is not designed with their powers in mind.\n\nPerformance: Many users are reporting Xbox 360 controller issues.  I don't know if it's a universally true issue or if people just refuse to do their own keybinding.  I myself ran across a breif moment with controller issues when I loaded up my game.  Quite hilariously every single command on the screen for navigating the menu would say "Enter (no input) to do x." None of the controls were pre-set so I had to manually choose what buttons were assigned to for all the commands, but after that everything worked as advertised.   I run the game on max settings and my PC is actually a quite dated gaming laptop (Asus G74SX).  I've encountered only two moments where my frame rate dropped lasting at most 4 seconds each.  I assume these controller issues will be fixed for most people within a short time and when they do this game will be a solid port.\n\nMeta: If you want to get a better idea of the disparity between what the game is and what it tries to be look at the OPENING CUTSCENE when you start the game up.  It starts off in Gotham, you see a few armed men from jokers gang on a rooftop.  There's tagged graffiti of Joker on a wall nearby and smoke rises from other buildings in the city.  The thugs start to become frightened as Batman closes in on them - they're not completely one dimensional evil minions.  Batman captures them with awesome moves and stealth, capturing the frightened foes.  Then we finally see Batman grapple on to another roof top; he jumps away and with his wings extended in front of the moon and its an epic display.  Now that game looked great! It had serious atmosphere.  It looked like you were on the rooftop of an inhabited world where you were having an impact on those who reside there.  You're fighting crime.  Making a difference.  If I were playing a game like that, I'd feel like a real super hero.  But quite literally within FOUR seconds of that scene it moves to a shot of the watchtower over Earth.  What?  Where the hell did that come from?  The intro was showing an entirely different game until the last moment!  And that's a perfect allegory for what it feels like to play this game.  It makes promises for what we want it to be, but ultimately fails to deliver on that promise and ends up being something entirely different.  The game feels so empty and what they do offer to inhabit the environment feels sheen yet bland like if apple store designers built the interiors of this game.  it makes me think it's release was pushed and the game was unfinished.\n\nPros:\n+ Classic Lego Gameplay\n+ Tons of playable characters\n+ Costume implementation\n+ Good for all ages, encourages playing together\n\nCons:\n-  Levels are too long, not enough checkpoints (I love that I get to play the game longer, I just wish instead of longer levels, there were more levels)\n- Don't feel like a super hero.  Trapped in my environment\n- Hubworlds are too small  and often feel empty\n- Identity crisis in level/character design\n- Left too much to be desired\n\nOverall:  It's still has a lot of potential.  But that's exactly what I see with where I am at in the game.  Potential. LEGO Batman 2 is a better, and cheaper option.  Consider waiting for this game to drop in price if you do want to play it.\n\nI unfortunately have to give the game a disappointing 6.7/10.  Travellers Tales has really taken steps backwards in this title and it's really a shame.  I hope they learn from this mistakes of empty and small environments in the future.","November 11, 2014","false","7.4"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","1"

Its humor is rather childish but it is a kids game and I still got a good chuckle for quite a bit of the story, even laughed pretty hard at other parts. Gameplay is simple, and the new suit system is a great addition to the game. If you love DC comics then you will probably love this game, especially if you don't mind laughing at charactatures of the heros. The game does make fun of the heros to a certain extent but its all a good fun. The best part of the game is the huge list of playable characters especially the stange ones from the depths of the comics. One criticism I have is the many of the cameos (aside from Adam West) are rather unnecessary and pull the focus away from celebrating DC comics.","February 2, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

LEGO games are always intended for all audiences, so the more extreme antiheroes in the collection are a bit toned-down to make them more accessible and less nightmarish for young minds.\n\nAs with each of the LEGO games we've been fortunate to play thus far, my four year-old son and I are enjoying this title and each DLC tothe hilt.\n\nBe aware that the levels contained in the various DLC packages are by no means lengthy, and it may serve the player to  tackle these first to enjoy the various characters in the course of Free Play in the main game itself.  Free Play allows the player to use each unlocked (and purchased) character in the single/two player story levels without being constrained to the characters required for the mission.\n\nPurchase this and play to your heart's content!","January 14, 2015","true","271.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a comic aficionado. Although I'm familiar with a lot of the characters from both DC and Marvel, I have no preference to either. Since we all know what fun Lego games entail, I'm only going to focus on the negatives.\n\n- I didn't find the story very interesting, as you have to suspend your belief to below zero to keep going on (yes, I'm aware videogames do not have to make sense 100% but this goes beyond that imo).\n\n- The biggest problem is the characters: most of them are either too powerful or practically useless, which leads to the implementation of their powers sometimes illogical. Why can't Superman just tear apart Brainiac's ships? Why can only "Lantern" people dig? Animal-types make sense of course, but if all it takes is to materialize some jackhammer or such, then some other characters with their many skills should have some capability as well.\n\n- Too many horizontal plane shooting levels. No car or rearview plane levels from previous games.\n\n- I personally didn't enjoy the virtual hacking","December 25, 2014","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are only 3 characters that use this Batman (1966), Robin (1966) and Batgirl (1966) when you break something with one of these 3 characters words like BAM or POW will appear.\nCharacter Roster: The Roster in this game is huge  You of course have characters that are unlocked through the story like Batman, Robin, Green Lantern and Superman but you also have charcters that are purchable with studs and even DLC Characters\nHumor: This game is funny from Robin's Animating in cutscenes to Cyborg and Flash's random diolage to the Joker himself!\nGraphics: The game looks gorgous j-j-j-j\n\nNegatives:\nMusic: While I'll admit it's good, most of it was taken strait out of the previous LEGO Batman Games! Including the Final Boss Theme! WHY?!?!??!?!?!??!?!!??!?!?!??!\nNo Custom Bigfigs: Lego Hobbit and Lego Marvel came out before this game and you could make your own BIGFIG Lego Hobbit's Bigfig Customiser being the better. so why can't we make Bigfigs in this game?\nSuperman: He is SUPER BROKEN he can't die (Even when he's Clark Kent) and he can fly and shot lazers from his eyes\nDifficulty: This game is a bit easy it's not to easy but it's still at a low difficulty\n\nFinal Rating:\n\nI give this a 6/10 I cannot see why some people hate this game (even with it's easy difficulty) I still havent got this game at 100% yet don't worry I'm working on it","December 21, 2014","true","164.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Fun game, story is so-so, but good character choices. Many things to do once you are done with the story. Even if you arn't a lego fan, Its still cool to see all the lego people and play it. As all lego games are, Some replay value, going to get characters, but not much. The studs in this game are much easyer to aquire, so even if you don't like to complete things in video games, it is still fun to try and unlock more characters.

There is a fair number of places where you can stuck your character without escape. The next step in the mission progression is sometimes unclear, or what exactly to do in order to interact with an item or a scene. Some abilities or scene let you control remote or tiny vehicles which open a new way to get stuck, or just lost when you drive in the dark...\nObviously, those issues won't happen to everyone. But I ran into much much less issues with the preceding game in the LEGO Batman serie.\nThe puzzles are very basics and not particularly entertaining (I prefered the ones from LEGO Marvel)\n\nBecause of the story, everything is set to interiors. And they more or less all look the same. The feeling of repetition is coming quicker when LEGO Batman 2 offered fun moments driving in gotham city (when pursued by the Joker robot) or flying above the city (the Joker chase or asaulting the robot with Superman).\n\nThe plus, you can play a expanded roster of characters, including some villains, during the main story. There are new suits. And there is a new story so you don't have to replay the previous game for your LEGO Batman needs.\n\nSo you can get the game, be entertained (or in my case, have my kid boy entertained). Just don't expect the greatest LEGO Batman game or, actually, the greatest LEGO game even.\n--------------\n\nNo support for XBox 360 controller. All other LEGO games work with a wireless XBox 360 controller, not this one.\nI recommend to wait until they (if ever) fix it before buying.\n(issue has been fixed)","January 1, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Tedious and pointless cutscenes filter in at every level breaking up the pacing of the level, boring level design and excessive waves of enemies that never end leaving you with never a good chance to explore the level and collect things which was the main aspect of the Lego titles.\n\nThe story is sub-par and the cutscenes aren't anything to write home about, especially now that we've got voice-acting, with their inclusion the cutscenes are all bogged down and a chore to go through whereas in previous unspoken titles the scenes were more punchy and to the point.\n\nLevels feel extremely long and tedious, it's not so much a game you can pick up and have a quick round in as you'll find yourself slogging through longer than you expected, which is something I also noticed in the previous title of Marvel, but alas I've yet to see someone else suffer of the same issues.\n\nThe combat feels like a dodgy Arkham system, where in your character will sometimes jump to the enemy and hit them but sometimes you end up just comboing air as enemies wail on you. Characters who have ranged weapons will also end up melee-ing most of the time as well.\n\nSometimes in combat, like in the previous Marvel title, a character will perform a finisher on a mob, normally this wouldn't be too bad if they weren't so long and took you out of the combat. It slows the pace and after you've seen it once it gets extremely boring and monotonous.\n\nMain characters also have access to different suits, unlike in Batman previous however, where only Batman and Robin could change, multiple characters in this game can change suits, making pretty much most of them boringly the same. The intricacies are lost.\n\nCharacter creation seems bland and stale, even in Marvel you could at least have more variety in the weapons you had, but in this game, not so much, which is unfortunate.\n\nRe-running levels has now officially become the most painful of processes in the Lego titles, cutscenes that can't be skipped litter throughout and you'll find yourself being burnt out when all you need is that one minikit towards the end of the level.\n\nAll in all, the devs have truly lost sight of what made the early games so amazing and since Batman 2 we've gotten bad after bad. If you must buy this game, get it on sale.","April 13, 2015","false","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a large roster of characters to play as and a good amount of things to do. If I were to have one complaint it would be the nearly non-exhistant free roam.

Fun game, story is so-so, but good character choices. Many things to do once you are done with the story. Even if you arn't a lego fan, Its still cool to see all the lego people and play it. As all lego games are, Some replay value, going to get characters, but not much. The studs in this game are much easyer to aquire, so even if you don't like to complete things in video games, it is still fun to try and unlock more characters.

I'm almost to 100% at 40 hours without touching the DLC, which from what I understand adds a bunch more levels.

Its humor is rather childish but it is a kids game and I still got a good chuckle for quite a bit of the story, even laughed pretty hard at other parts. Gameplay is simple, and the new suit system is a great addition to the game. If you love DC comics then you will probably love this game, especially if you don't mind laughing at charactatures of the heros. The game does make fun of the heros to a certain extent but its all a good fun. The best part of the game is the huge list of playable characters especially the stange ones from the depths of the comics. One criticism I have is the many of the cameos (aside from Adam West) are rather unnecessary and pull the focus away from celebrating DC comics.","February 2, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it lacks an open world to explore like the previous installment and the recent Marvel Superheroes game, it still delivers a satisying LEGO experience.  Gameplaywise, not much has changed.  The LEGO game format is in full use, but still manages to be fun enough to push you through the story.  You break bricks to build with bricks, and pummel enemies with your vast array of characters given in each level.  This game elaborates on the tool specific costumes from previous LEGO Batman games, adding more suits for Batman, Robin and other characters.  The story is pretty light, but is entertaining enough to keep you playing.  As LEGO games always are, the story is childish; there are many instances of cringe-worthy jokes being littered through each scene.  But, as LEGO stories go, it's good enough for an original tale.\nAll in all, LEGO Batman 3 is a fun, family-friendly adventure taking you through the heart of the DC Universe.  So many amazing chracters are represnted, and their inclusions alone should warrant interest from any avid DC fan.\n\n7/10  Pros- Fun story, Consistent gameplay, Good value, Plenty of DC love\nCons- Repetetive missions, Cringe-worthy comedy, Okay PC port","February 22","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have not beaten it yet.\nThe original LEGO Batman game is one of my favorite LEGO games ever, so I was really excited to play this game.\nThe first thing I noticed is that the voice acting is actually very good. The gameplay is kinda repetitive at times, but still fun.\nThe story is interesting, taking 'Batman and Robin fighting Villains' and turning it into 'The Justice League fighting an Alien'. The cast of characters is huge, with oddballs like Batcow and Adam West as himself! My only complaint is that there are alot of glitches like in some missions characters not appearing AT ALL and some mechanics like a lever dissapear.\nI give this game a 8/10.\nTL;DR: This game is good, but very glitchy.","March 24","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, a more apt title for the game would be LEGO Justice League. Don't get me wrong -- I loved playing with the other DC characters in LB2 and I'm enjoying playing with the DC characters in this one. But if you're looking for something more Batman-centric, this could be a bit of a letdown. That being said, just buy it anyway because it's fun (and currently on sale). The season pass is also worth the investment.\n\nThe game runs smoothly and the graphics look good on my quad-core AMD. Although some cut scenes play statis or lose sound and the image may stutter -- it's nothing major and it is more than likely my laptop. Game looks great through am HDMI connection to TV as well. The new feature to change character costume abilities as needed is very convenient. The pop-up game hints are really very annoying. This game features save checkpoints like the previous one, however, the checkpoints can be few and far between. If you're running out of gaming time and encounter a checkpoint, keep in mind that the next save point could be in 10 minutes or much longer.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game, especially to fans of LEGO games.","June 13, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of Lego games and/or DC comics, you will enjoy this game. You can mostly overlook the game's flaws as there is more good than bad in this game. This game is a blast for anyone, regardless of age.\n\nWhile the game is very fun, it isn't meant to be played on PC. It lags and the saves keep crashing.

They give you new perspectives and add hilarious alternations to famous, well known storylines. Well let me tell you something.........LEGO BATMAN 3 THROWS EVERYTHING THAT MAKES A GOOD LEGO GAME AWAY AND RUINS THE BATMAN FRANCHISE. As a fan of the amazing firs two lego batman games, I had high standards but wasnt going to critisize one of the games in a franchise I love, but this terrible game has pushed me to do this and tell you all why this game wouldnt be worth getting, even if it was FREE. First of all lets focus on the title: 'Beyond Gotham'. This title basically explains that there is ABSOLUTELY NO GOTHAM IN THIS GAME.....NONE!!! The only time you enter gotham (once), is for a mission, where everything is shrunken and you are limited to a REALLY small area. I bet your thinking, 'So forget gotham, we have a new city and all of space to explore!). Well first of all, there is no other city, and second of all, SPACE SUCKS! You can only visit about 5 different planets, which are SMALLER THAN ****, and they have nothing except a different color, plants, and a couple of bad guys on each planet. You also get a useless tour of each planet from daffy duck (thats right, daffy duck) where you literally walk around the planet with him and defend him from a couple of enemies EVERY SINGLE TIME! There is nothing to explore or any quests/temples/jungles/other characters/boss fights/structures/special items ect. (I could go on). All you get to explore is a TINY (thought bigger than every planet) hall of justice and of course the only thing they got fight in this game, the watchtower. To add to the freeroam and not-so-open world, a lego game needs side missions. Batman Beyond Gotham has absolutely no side missions that actually require effort. Take the killer moth mission for example, all you need to do (no joke whatsoever) IS TURN A COUPLE OF LIGHTS ON WITH THE PUSH OF A BUTTON, just to lead killer moth to WHERE HE WAS PLANNING ON GOING IN THE BEGINNING. Basically  other side missions pretty much have you break something or collect something within a limited time.......BORING!!! NOW your probably thinking, 'at least we have our good old batman storyline and our favorite notorious villians plotting', well guess what, throuought the whole campaign, ALL the villians except braniac, ARE ON YOUR SIDE!.....Thats right, you only fight killer croc once in the beginning and thats pretty much it. The rest is taking on braniac and his minions, which weapons or appearance dont vary at all. The storyline is that brainiac is shrinking earth and you must stop him, and there is no change or plot twist through the whole story. Its all the same: you go to each of the planets, steal a ring, and fight braniac. Its way too predictable and definetely way too short. There are only around ten missions which feel no different to the others. Now with the characters, this is definitley where Batman Lego really let us down. None of the characters had any deep personality like in the other games: Joker has some failed attempts at some jokes, and batman in completely expressionless (and not in the cool batman-ish way). Now with our final, most important, most failed element of Batman Lego 3......the gameplay. First: the missions. As I previously said about lego games being for thinking and solving puzzles, lego batman 3 is the complete opposite. Each level basically requires you to pull a lever or push a single button, WHILE BEING OVERWHELMED BY ENDLESS WAVES OF ENEMIES. This game has become just another fighting game, where now  your goal is to fight and kill your enemies. Its lost the meaning of lego games and has made beyond gotham a huge disappointment. Now what makes lego BATMAN special? Its the characters (failed), the city (failed), the personalities (failed), the dark atmosphere (failed) and lastly, the vehicles and gadgets. Let me just say that its clear the developers of this game were lazy and didnt bother to add ANY NEW GADGETS. Yes there are new suits, but thats the bare minimum. Now with the vehicles that we were all looking forward to blasting our foes to pieces with, guess what, THERE ARE NONE! Thats right, not ONCE in the game do you get to control or even see the batmobile/batplane/batcopter/batbike/batsub/batboat. All we get is a crummy bat-space ship sort of thing. Of course spaceships SOUND cool but actually using them is TERRIBLE! You get a zoomed out side-view of your ship and only fly around a single structure, only being able to shoot in a STRAIGHT LINE! Now I WOULD say that the replayability is good.........but you just cant enjoy something when its forced on to you. In every level is some special (but ultimatley useless) item that can only be accessed with a character that your not given, meaning later you will have to replay the level with characters you might not even want to play with. Overall I guess the only good thing was the extra level, where you play as a retro-comic themed batman, robin, and batgirl agains retro-comic themed villians (which you acually get to fight this time). That was fun but ultimately this game that had so much potential, ended up terrible and I would definitley NOT recommend this game. Batman Lego 3 Beyond Gotham has scored a pathetic 3-4/10 in my opinion. Go save yourself some money and get the second batman lego, which I really enjoyed and really captures the batman universe.","September 25, 2015","false","37.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How did that make it past testing?\nThe controlls can be a special kind of annoying because they fallow the Nintendo Mario approach of mapping mutliple actions to a single button, so instead of switching costumes, you could switch characters, or instead of getting into a vehicle, switch characters.  And switching characters itself can be a chore as there's no consistant format to which character you're going to switch too.  Instead of cycling through a list, you instead are required to face the character you want to switch too, which can be very difficle if you're party is spread out.","January 2","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite the lack of Outsiders, Adam Strange, and Legion of Super Heroes, I was glad to see Doctor Fate, Blue Beetle, Zatanna, Black Adam, Red Tornado, Manchester Black, John Stewart, Martian Manhunter, and other characters included as playable. The character ability variation is well-thought out and very few characters feel like clones of another. There are several DLC characters that are useful and fun to play as. Also, there are a lot of flying characters. What I didn't particularly enjoy about this game: Bat-Mite, no maps for individual Hubs, and the flight controls.

Well let me tell you something.........LEGO BATMAN 3 THROWS EVERYTHING THAT MAKES A GOOD LEGO GAME AWAY AND RUINS THE BATMAN FRANCHISE. As a fan of the amazing firs two lego batman games, I had high standards but wasnt going to critisize one of the games in a franchise I love, but this terrible game has pushed me to do this and tell you all why this game wouldnt be worth getting, even if it was FREE. First of all lets focus on the title: 'Beyond Gotham'. This title basically explains that there is ABSOLUTELY NO GOTHAM IN THIS GAME.....NONE!!! The only time you enter gotham (once), is for a mission, where everything is shrunken and you are limited to a REALLY small area. I bet your thinking, 'So forget gotham, we have a new city and all of space to explore!). Well first of all, there is no other city, and second of all, SPACE SUCKS! You can only visit about 5 different planets, which are SMALLER THAN ****, and they have nothing except a different color, plants, and a couple of bad guys on each planet. You also get a useless tour of each planet from daffy duck (thats right, daffy duck) where you literally walk around the planet with him and defend him from a couple of enemies EVERY SINGLE TIME! There is nothing to explore or any quests/temples/jungles/other characters/boss fights/structures/special items ect. (I could go on). All you get to explore is a TINY (thought bigger than every planet) hall of justice and of course the only thing they got fight in this game, the watchtower. To add to the freeroam and not-so-open world, a lego game needs side missions. Batman Beyond Gotham has absolutely no side missions that actually require effort. Take the killer moth mission for example, all you need to do (no joke whatsoever) IS TURN A COUPLE OF LIGHTS ON WITH THE PUSH OF A BUTTON, just to lead killer moth to WHERE HE WAS PLANNING ON GOING IN THE BEGINNING. Basically  other side missions pretty much have you break something or collect something within a limited time.......BORING!!! NOW your probably thinking, 'at least we have our good old batman storyline and our favorite notorious villians plotting', well guess what, throuought the whole campaign, ALL the villians except braniac, ARE ON YOUR SIDE!.....Thats right, you only fight killer croc once in the beginning and thats pretty much it. The rest is taking on braniac and his minions, which weapons or appearance dont vary at all. The storyline is that brainiac is shrinking earth and you must stop him, and there is no change or plot twist through the whole story. Its all the same: you go to each of the planets, steal a ring, and fight braniac. Its way too predictable and definetely way too short. There are only around ten missions which feel no different to the others. Now with the characters, this is definitley where Batman Lego really let us down. None of the characters had any deep personality like in the other games: Joker has some failed attempts at some jokes, and batman in completely expressionless (and not in the cool batman-ish way). Now with our final, most important, most failed element of Batman Lego 3......the gameplay. First: the missions. As I previously said about lego games being for thinking and solving puzzles, lego batman 3 is the complete opposite. Each level basically requires you to pull a lever or push a single button, WHILE BEING OVERWHELMED BY ENDLESS WAVES OF ENEMIES. This game has become just another fighting game, where now  your goal is to fight and kill your enemies. Its lost the meaning of lego games and has made beyond gotham a huge disappointment. Now what makes lego BATMAN special? Its the characters (failed), the city (failed), the personalities (failed), the dark atmosphere (failed) and lastly, the vehicles and gadgets. Let me just say that its clear the developers of this game were lazy and didnt bother to add ANY NEW GADGETS. Yes there are new suits, but thats the bare minimum. Now with the vehicles that we were all looking forward to blasting our foes to pieces with, guess what, THERE ARE NONE! Thats right, not ONCE in the game do you get to control or even see the batmobile/batplane/batcopter/batbike/batsub/batboat. All we get is a crummy bat-space ship sort of thing. Of course spaceships SOUND cool but actually using them is TERRIBLE! You get a zoomed out side-view of your ship and only fly around a single structure, only being able to shoot in a STRAIGHT LINE! Now I WOULD say that the replayability is good.........but you just cant enjoy something when its forced on to you. In every level is some special (but ultimatley useless) item that can only be accessed with a character that your not given, meaning later you will have to replay the level with characters you might not even want to play with. Overall I guess the only good thing was the extra level, where you play as a retro-comic themed batman, robin, and batgirl agains retro-comic themed villians (which you acually get to fight this time). That was fun but ultimately this game that had so much potential, ended up terrible and I would definitley NOT recommend this game. Batman Lego 3 Beyond Gotham has scored a pathetic 3-4/10 in my opinion. Go save yourself some money and get the second batman lego, which I really enjoyed and really captures the batman universe.","September 25, 2015","false","37.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ownly problem with this game is that the free roam is not as fun as lego Batman 2. In lego Batman 2 you can explore a huge city that gos on for miles but in lego batman 3 there's just small hub worlds to explore (lantern worlds, the batcave, ect.). That is not a deal breaker though because the game is still fun. The thing that makes the game so cool is the characters you can play. There's like 150 characters to play plus about 40 some dlc characters (which I recommend you get).

I have not beaten it yet.\nThe original LEGO Batman game is one of my favorite LEGO games ever, so I was really excited to play this game.\nThe first thing I noticed is that the voice acting is actually very good. The gameplay is kinda repetitive at times, but still fun.\nThe story is interesting, taking 'Batman and Robin fighting Villains' and turning it into 'The Justice League fighting an Alien'. The cast of characters is huge, with oddballs like Batcow and Adam West as himself! My only complaint is that there are alot of glitches like in some missions characters not appearing AT ALL and some mechanics like a lever dissapear.\nI give this game a 8/10.\nTL;DR: This game is good, but very glitchy.","March 24","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Mostly Lantern Planets, though). It also has the largest amount of playable characters in a LEGO game (over 210 including all DLC characters), and most of my favourites were included, too. Despite the lack of Outsiders, Adam Strange, and Legion of Super Heroes, I was glad to see Doctor Fate, Blue Beetle, Zatanna, Black Adam, Red Tornado, Manchester Black, John Stewart, Martian Manhunter, and other characters included as playable. The character ability variation is well-thought out and very few characters feel like clones of another. There are several DLC characters that are useful and fun to play as. Also, there are a lot of flying characters. What I didn't particularly enjoy about this game: Bat-Mite, no maps for individual Hubs, and the flight controls. I did get to 100% though, so with that in mind: 8/10","April 20, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lego Batman was finally a shift to an original story, somewhat, based on the source material and then Lego Batman 2 had full blown dialog for each main character. It became much more funny and an interesting game to play since then. Lego Batman 3 continued that and its working fanstastic now that theyve increased the scope of these Lego games to be actual, games, instead of cheap nostalgic trips. I found the replayability parts of the Lego games to be fairly weak (aka going back to the story and gaining 100% stud pieces, etc) so I was happy to see they made multiple hub worlds with small extra bits of questing from various NPCs to be refreshing.\n\nLike any smart PC gamer I got this on a mega discount so I feel sorry for all shallow gamers that paid for the Season Pass early on. It was nowhere near worth $30. While, of course, funny, they were insanely short levels.","January 9","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, a more apt title for the game would be LEGO Justice League. Don't get me wrong -- I loved playing with the other DC characters in LB2 and I'm enjoying playing with the DC characters in this one. But if you're looking for something more Batman-centric, this could be a bit of a letdown. That being said, just buy it anyway because it's fun (and currently on sale). The season pass is also worth the investment.\n\nThe game runs smoothly and the graphics look good on my quad-core AMD. Although some cut scenes play statis or lose sound and the image may stutter -- it's nothing major and it is more than likely my laptop. Game looks great through am HDMI connection to TV as well. The new feature to change character costume abilities as needed is very convenient. The pop-up game hints are really very annoying. This game features save checkpoints like the previous one, however, the checkpoints can be few and far between. If you're running out of gaming time and encounter a checkpoint, keep in mind that the next save point could be in 10 minutes or much longer.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game, especially to fans of LEGO games.","June 13, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of Lego games and/or DC comics, you will enjoy this game. You can mostly overlook the game's flaws as there is more good than bad in this game. This game is a blast for anyone, regardless of age.\n\nWhile the game is very fun, it isn't meant to be played on PC. It lags and the saves keep crashing.

Don't believe them. This game is totally different than Lego Marvel. Both Lego Marvel and Lego Batman 3 let you choose from a wide range of characters and both have excellent voice acting... however, that's where the similarities end. Lego Batman 3 is not open world but the level designs and character combat is so much better than what I've experienced in Lego Marvel. You can definitely tell that the devs have put more effort into everything since the game isn't open world but still, has the same replayability of Lego Marvel.

They all have roughly similar gameplay dynamics - each figure has special attributes that you use to negotiate the level (use Superman's heat vision to melt ice, use the Joker's joy buzzer to jumpstart an electric turbine), then you come back through again with your choice of characters and you can do more things to unlock more characters and rewards.\n\nMuch of the stuff added for Lego Marvel is here, just with giant "DC COMICS!" stickers slapped on them - instead of Deadpool Bricks, you collect Plastic Man Bricks, the "Stan Lee In Peril" puzzles now feature Adam West, and so on.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Of particular note is an entire level done in the style of the  '60s Batman TV show.  It's cute, and silly, and hits the sweet spot for those of us who have fond memories of Cesar Romero covering his mustache with greasepaint.\n\nThis particular iteration of the series leans heavily on DC's contemporary Lantern mythos - there's not just a Green Lantern, no - all the colors of the rainbow have their own Lantern teams, and chaos ensues when bad ol' Braniac kidnaps all the Lantern leaders to do, you know, villain stuff.  Goodies and Baddies have to team up to stop Braniac from doing whatever, you know, just go hit stuff and solve puzzles and let the paper-thin plot do its own thing.\n\nSome of the puzzles are a little complicated, especially for the 6-10 crowd that these games seem to be aiming for, and the presence of filmmaker Kevin Smith and comedian Conan O'Brien in the game is downright weird, but at the end of the day, it's a Lego Superhero game.  Either you like these, or you don't.\n\n(One particularly nice thing - they licensed the iconic John Williams "Superman Theme" for the game.  That's a lovely piece of music, and I'm quite content to just soar around the world as Superman, letting it play in the background.)","July 16, 2015","true","79.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you answered yes, then you will like this game.\n\nThis game is a Lego game, so the mechanics, and gameplay is very much the same as the other games, but with this one it's different.\nLego Batman 3 brings Batman and friends along with over 50 other characters from DC, such as, Shazam, Aquaman, Super Man, etc. People might not like this because it says Batman in the title, and when you play it, it's more of a Green Lantern game with other DC things in it, but if you are willing to realise that it's not just Batman, and take it for what it is, it's probably the best Lego game out there.\n\nThere's so much to do in this game it's crazy. I will admit though that the story mode is very boring at the beginning, but once you get to the Lantern levels (spoilers?) the main campain gets much better.\nAfter story mode is completed, there is extra missions, freeplay, Full Lantern planets (all 7) to explore, VR missions (not really), and much more.\nEvery character is fun to play as, and is mostly different, and every character you see in this game is playable at some point, which is amazing.\n\nIf you are willing to get past the first really boring marathon levels of the story, you will have a great time.\n[Note: You will have fun if you like the standard formula for lego games, and like DC even just a little bit]","May 30","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
