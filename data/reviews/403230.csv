This is the type of game you play when you just want to relax and zone out for a couple of hours.  Nothing challenging, just a colourful, mindless, zombie-bash-a-thon.\n\nIt clocks in at around 3 hours from start to finish so it doesn't outstay its welcome.  At first I was appalled at the graphics and horrendous job of optimisation, but it didn't take long for the cartoonish style to grow on me.  The zombies themselves are quiet varied, and the game throws plenty of easy bosses at you along the way.  Unfortunately the majority of combat is just bash the attack button and then throw out your special attack once its ready  (there are multiple special attacks, but when you get the best one right off the bat, that being the jump and stomp move, there really is no need to mix it up). There is only one type of powerup, beyond health items, which lets you speed up noticeably for a decent period and hit harder. There are stores where you can trade the coins you harvest from the zombies but you'll rarely bother as the zombies have healing items coming out their ears.  In terms of weapons there isn't a huge variety.  You'll end up hitting zombies with a baseball bat for 80% of the time, or your fists if it breaks on you.  And the rest is ranged water pistols, holy water (turns zombies against each other), and popcorn (to distract zombies).\n\nThe basic story is your girlfriend is stranded in the middle of the zombie apocalypse and its your job to rescue her.  This is the very height of it so don't be expecting a convoluted plot.  This minimal presentation however has you visiting an impressive array of environments, all of them appearing and disappearing one after another in quick succession so it doesn't grow stale.   They range from flooded church basements to ravaged towns, to mines, to army camps, to a haunted house.  There isn't much to do but run across them and kill or outpace zombies as you go, clocking up one objective after another.  It's very linear, and the most the game has you doing in terms of "puzzles" is pick up the key/explosive to open door/clear barrier.  There are a range of other collectibles but as none of them appeared to do anything they quickly fell by the wayside for me, and it just became of soothing journey of zombie whack-a-mole.  There is the very odd bit of imprecise platforming but thankfully this is kept to an absolute minimum.\n\nPeople have complained about bugs/crashes in other reviews but the developers seem to have fixed the majority by now.  I didn't have a single issue the whole time.\n\nNot everyone will find this fun and it isn't worth full price but get it on sale if you want a lazy evening to turn your brain off.\n\nAlso be warned, this game does not have developers who speak native English, so be prepared for some ridiculous dialogue.  Thankfully there isn't much, and it mainly consists of your character's hints whenever you come up to a door/barrier.","February 1","true","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Ora , questo giovane dovrà avventurarsi per le strade dominate dai morti per raggiungere la casa della sua amata prima che il peggio accada.\nLa tua avventura inizia dentro in casa. La struttura è stata invasa da ragazzi del quartiere e tocca a te buttarli fuori tutti per proteggere il nonno che sta riposando al piano superiore .\nI marmocchi zombie sono i più agile di tutti, quindi bisogna essere abili per fermarli prima che corrano a mordere. A peggiorare le cose, le piccole pesti sono piccole e difficili da colpire.\nNel corso dei dodici livelli sarà necessario affrontare potenti zombie che si trovano in situazioni insolite e comiche\n\n\nFeature:\n- Dialoghi divertenti\n- Zombie Unici, soprattutto i Boss\n- Gameplay alla portata di tutti\n-Tante armi ed extra da sbloccare\n- Supporto completo al gamepad\n- Carte Steam\n\nParere personale: ZombieZoid® Zenith è un gioco molto divertente, offre un gameplay semplice ma solido, all'interno del gioco ci sono tanti boss, uno diverso (e bizzarro) dall'altro, e tante armi ed extra da sbloccare.\nInsomma lo consiglio senza problemi, anche perché non è difficile e si lascia giocare senza problemi e poi molti dei dialoghi presenti sono molto divertenti.\nSe non pretendete troppo dalla grafica e cercate qualcosa di semplice e divertente ZombieZoid® Zenith è il gioco che fa per voi!","October 28, 2015","true","8.3"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","0"
