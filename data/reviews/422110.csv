It has it's own unique and compelling art style, easy to understand and fun gameplay and of course, a great music to tie it all together while you are swearing at your friend!\n\nEach time you complete a level or game with our friend, you gain exp and the ability to unlock characters, levels etc. Which will soon get you hooked!\n\nIt's a great party game, I played it with only one other friend but I can imagine the chaos of trying to hold my own in a 4 player game (the good kind of chaos, of course!)\n\nI would definitely recommend this game, especially if you and your friends enjoy screaming at each other.","April 13","true","0.5"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/422110/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Wand Wars is an frantic arena-brawling game for both single and multiplayer, where you have to catch and toss a killer orb at your opponents while trying not to get turned into a chicken.\n\nThe orb mechanism is easy to grasp and you'll be an expert in no time. Press a button when the orb is close and you capture it for a short time, giving you just enough time to aim and fire it at the nearest opponent. Once fired, the orb just keeps going, bouncing off walls. As the match proceeds, the orb gets larger and faster.\n\nIt's about timing, basically - hitting the button just before you get smashed in the face, then turning the tables on whoever threw it. With the full 4 players, it's pure twitch gaming.\n\nWand Wars gameplay review video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrBZzu1F23o\n\nOn its own, that would be a decent but limited game. But your second ability is to fire black arrows. If you hit an opponent, they briefly turn into a chicken, whose only ability is to run away. The arrow can also be used to neutralise the orb, making it slow and harmless until next caught.\n\nTogether, these two things add an element of strategy to your attacks, although nothing complex or clever. The only way to really add strategy to the game is to play in teams, 2 vs 2. So perhaps one player would be on chicken duty, the other orb. Or you could pass the orb between you (you can only harm enemies when firing the orb), and only strike when the time is right.\n\nPowerups are sometimes added to the arena (and you can optionally start with some in Versus). They're massively powered deadly attacks of different kind, and can turn the game into chaos as everyone tries to fire them off at once. When you fire them, the game pauses for a couple of second for an animation, which can get tiring!\n\nThe singleplayer Story Mode is split into the stories of six unlockable characters, each consisting of several matches. Each match has something unique about it - number of players, teams, weird levels with moving walls, different game types etc - so it never gets dull.\n\nVersus Mode consists of single, customisable 1-4 player matches (including however many bots), with a choice of 5 game types. This includes the basic battle type, a type where your team has to get the orb into the opponent's goal, and more.\n\nPleasingly, Wand Wars works well in singleplayer. The bots are well programmed in the basics (with multiple difficulty levels), so it doesn't feel like you're not really playing the game properly. They're not so clever at guarding the goal in that game type, but that's a team-focused game and should really be saved for humans.\n\nWand Wars feels slick, it's easy to learn and not difficult to master. Pulling off a good move is very satisfying - stuff like turning an opponent into a chicken just as you're about to grab the orb, then bouncing it off the wall into their stupid clucking face.\n\nThe limited strategic potential means this game will have an exciting but fairly brief life in your library, but if you have a good local multiplayer scene going, it'll fit happily into the rotation. And if you play it singleplayer, the Story Mode keeps changing things up enough for you to want to keep going.\n\n* Version reviewed: 13 April 2016 build\n* More indie gaming videos by Randomise User","April 13","true","2.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

No online multiplayer sadly).\n\nWas keeping an eye on this game for a while but never got that excited for it until I've played it and played a lot of matches.

Every button you press feels impactful and juicy, and timing is everything. Local multiplayer is where this game truly shines, but even if you don't have a group of friends to meet up and play games with, imo it's well worth the price to check out the story mode and play some bot matches. Even when you're playing with the AI things can get pretty intense. I've logged about 4 hours total so far (probably more than half of that in single player) and I feel like I still have a lot of improving to do before I'm good enough to take on the top level bots and the final stages of the story mode - but I get a little better every time I play! Make sure you play with a controller for the best experience, and make sure you play with the volume up, as the music and sound design is also top notch.","April 13","true","4.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I've played quake for quite a few years now and it's a hard game. Wand wars gives you that same feeling. It can be casual and fun with your friends but, also very intense and skillful. If you love to game vs your buddies face to face and compete or just have a great time. Wand wars is an easy 10/10. I play a handful of games and I think this game rocks.\n\nI play\nQuake Live, Starcraft 2, Reflex, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, and recently Overwatch. Wand Wars is this calibur with quality game play. Plus the soundtrak is awesome.

You can even change some game rules.\n\nThough, if you're buying this for the campaign only, it's good, a bit short and it's basically a story-based tutorial introducing you to the game modes and spells and building this "I can't wait to play this with friends" feeling insde :)\nAnd it's actually pretty challenging on hard mode. Saying that if only intend to play alone I would wait for a sale.\n\nI am hoping this game gets the deserved attention and fanbase and some post-release support (some leaderboards, score based modes, etc.). And who knows, maybe we get an online multiplayer down the road?","April 21","true","6.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
