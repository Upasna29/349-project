Does away with everything fancy and focuses on getting the gameplay right. No weapons outside of your fists (true ninja!), no crazy combos and most certainly no dubstep. Would think the chosen colour pallete might be hard on the eyes or make the game more difficult but it did not. Keyboard was manageable but gamepad is recommended, both were able to be remapped. Supports 4k+ screen resolutions, unlimited fps and 120hz+ panels.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0z3rmcFbVA\nPrice is low due to the length not the quality, 7 worlds to traverse each with a boss fight at the end. Levels contained collectable coins that are used to unlock 'extras', which generally made the game more difficult, eg no checkpoints. Veterans will find it on the easyside but still very enjoyable and worth a playthrough for the price.","August 13, 2015","true","5.0"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","34","41","3","0"

STOP RIGHT THERE!\n\nThere are a lot of reasons this retro platformer is worth your time:\n\nIt's a dramatically improved update of a quirky Xbox Live Indie game (which comes packed with this game as an unlockable, btw)\n\nIt's a love letter to the retro platformers of days gone by, well-served with tight controls, tough challenges, and a tongue-in-cheek story to string it all together.\n\nIt oozes with a silky-smooth, visual style that actually has function! Anything bright red is certain to kill you, and enemies delightfully explode blood everywhere like action tomatoes as you slay them.\n\nIt's cheaper than lunch at a fast-food joint.\n\nThe game can be difficult but there are no cheap deaths. Everything depends on your skill, and though you might die (a lot) the game doesn't waste your time. It wants you to learn how to beat whatever it throws at you and feel proud in doing so.\n\nCongrats if you are still reading this, but seriously. Go buy this game.","August 15, 2015","true","9.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","1"

Similarly to the old Ninja Gaiden games.\n\nThe controls are responsive, which is very good for a game like this. You won't ever feel like the game cheated your death.\nThe music is really catchy, and helps get you into the mood of the game.\n\nAlthough the art style is similar to older games, the animation itself is way better. It's nice and smooth. It looks really cool.\n\nThe game has 8 chapters. As you progress through the game, it gets harder. There are also collectibles scattered around if you want the extra challenge. If you die before getting to a checkpoint, you'll need to grab the collectible again. You're rewarded with some extra rewards if you collect enough of them, such as: Classic Mute Crimson mode, and disable checkpoints.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, you're also met with a boss. They're a nice change of pace. Before and after a boss, you're treated to some cutscenes. The dialogue consists of broken English. I'm pretty sure it's done like that on purpose, to emulate the times some older games were badly translated from their Japanese versions.\n\nFun game, with some really cool music.\n\nRecommended!\n\n","August 13, 2015","true","3.4"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","0"

This game is actually a huge update of an older Mute Crimson game, which is actually included as well if you want to try it.\n\nThe main character doesn't have many different resources and skills but I can tell the dev made some effort to squeeze them, and to feel that every level feels very different. Mastering this game might require some practise since the jump mechanics feels quite odd at first. But once you get the hang of it the experience turns to a much more pleasant session.\n\nEvery world features some different levels with a unique background condition (i.e World 2 levels will have wind and you'll have to deal with it the best you can) plus a boss fight at the end, which is your common pattern-learning thing.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Charming pixel style contrasting black/white with red (being anything red as hostile).\n+ This game features Engrish!!! It's totally intended and adds a very original fact that most people have forgotten.\n+ Catchy chiptune/8-bit music that gets on well with the rest of the game very properly.\n+ A total of 7 worlds and 7 bosses, with about 50 levels in total. I would say that a blind run might take you from 3 to 4 hours.\n+ Growing difficulty that ends to be pretty challenging. If you're an experienced platformer player then you'll only find issues from world 5 to beyond, but if you're more of a newcomer get ready for one hell of a run!\n+ Many different game modes, including Boss Rush (<3) and Arcade Mode speedrunning (9 lifes for the whole game).\n+ Challenging achievements not meant for everybody!\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n· Getting the collectibles is needed in order to unlock further modes. I'm usually against this but since they add some sort of extra challenge into levels it wasn't that bad.\n\nCONS:\n\n- No diagonal detection for gamepad players. I know oldschool games didn't have it either (joysticks came much later in the end) but that's the kind of thing I would pass since it's a little adapt to the nowadays devices. Several times I died because some frames before grabbing a wall I was pressing my joystick more "up" than "left/right", causing me not to grab it and therefore die.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nMute Crimson+ is a very enjoyable platforming experience, getting us back to the old days in the best of ways. I can see a lot of feeling put into its developing and despite not being crafted for eveybody, I'm sure all of you will appreciate how good and polished this game is.\n\n8.25/10","January 15","true","16.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

The strongest element is the game's aesthetic, as the red, white, and grays aesthetic and animation quality definitely makes for an experience that's visually appealing as the blood scatters on the walls. The difficulty curve is a good progression over time, even if the game doesn't necessarily have that strong of a variety. The controls are strong as it give you enough precision to get you through some of the more tricky elements of the game, while not being too forgiving. The length will be an issue for some, but for 5 bucks, can you really ask for that much out of it? A solid 5 dollars title.\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nStrong aesthetic with good use of minimal colors.\nGreat animation quality.\nStrong appropriate controls.\nThe bad “translated” dialogue seems to be purposeful, and is hilarious.\n-:\nSome boss fights are pretty boring.\nLength isn't that long, even on the more difficult sections.\nSome inconsistent rules can lead to a death or two.

There are very intense platforming moments, memorable bosses as well.  It definitely is a challenge as it is a OHKO game, but everything feels rewarding and like an awesome challenge more than it is frustrating. I had very, VERY few moments where I felt frustrated.\n\nEvery world has a gimmick that is used throughout the levels so the entire game feels fresh as you play through it and figure out how to handle each one.\n\nBosses were a tad difficult at times, but again, I found it more to be a fun challenge than a burden of defeating it.\n\nThe music is fantastic, every track is wonderful to listen to throughout each world.\n\nThe color scheme is minimal, which I like. Everything is in black and white other than hazards, enemies, bosses, and some background elements.  You also can change the color in the options menu to a variety of colors to suit how you want to play.\n\nEasily one of my new favorite games on Steam.

But this one is worth your time and your money - and come on, $5 USD? That is impulse buy territory, and if you do, you won't regret it!\n\nWhy is it worth playing?\n\nThe gameplay is tough but fair. There are no "cheats" in the level design, and the controls are tight and responsive, so any mistakes you make are your own. You end the game with all the moves you had at the beginning; there are no power-ups or bonuses, and no random gameplay elements - it's a game of pure skill and experience, both of which you'll need in abundance to meet the game's solid difficulty and complexity curve.\n\nThe art design and soundtrack are both very much in the NES vein. The best way to describe the colour scheme is "black and white and red all over" - but although the backgrounds are monochrome, they're also lush and distinctive. The red is reserved for anything that can kill you, and the contrast makes this distinction very effective. The sprite animation is smooth and flows well. The cutscenes are very well done, with a great comic book feel to them, and although the "Engrish" dialogue isn't for everyone, I personally find it hilarious. The music is very solid and catchy, with some great (and varied!) melodies and basslines going on.\n\nIn short, there's a lot to like about this game. In addition to the main game mode, the extras add greater replayability to the game. It's clear the developers put a lot of effort into making the game both fun and charming, and they definitely succeeded!","September 16, 2015","true","32.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For a ninja themed platforming game with simply controls and straightforward levels, this is one serious little game!  The levels are well laid out and the idea is simple, anything red all over will definitely kill you.  There are coins that you can collect, at your peril I dare say, that unlock certain game cheats or bonuses that only serve to make the game harder to be quite honest like, no continues for example.  The music and sound effects are top notch in this game as well and lend a hand in creating the familiar NES feel of eight bit gaming.  As I said earlier, the controls are super easy to use.  Only two buttons are used in game with the d-pad/control stick and that too gives the game an NES feel since the NES only had two buttons on their gamepads anyway.  All of this familiarity doesn't just stick out in the graphics/art/sound and controls either.  The levels are no nonsense and straight to the point kind of like Ninja Gaiden or Castlevania.  The bosses at the end of each level are also pretty well designed and definitely have been programmed like bosses from the great old days of NES too!  The challenges of the game are pretty damn good and will have veterans of the platforming genre memorizing their layout and timing.  All in all a great game and well worth the price of admission!

The artstyle is nice and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC, while the gameplay starts out trivial and becomes much more difficult towards the end. 100% worth it for the price.

I also love that the checkpoints are very common throughout the game, so if you die at a certain stage you never have to replay a huge chunk of the game. The soundtrack also suits the game perfectly!\n\nGreat job with Mute Crimson+ Iced Lizard Games, I recommend this game for people who are after a solid platforming experience while also keeping in touch with their retro side! :)","August 20, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Challenging. The epitome of what platformers should be. Each level design is unique, and while you can treat the first 1/3 - 1/2 of the game like you would most modern platformers (i.e. it takes skill, but to an extent you can succeed just on luck and repeated attempts), ultimately end level gameplay is reminescient of a time when the only way to win was to learn to intuitively "feel" the pattern/ timing when making jumps to dodge death. If you can't sense that you need to jump while you still see the laser glowing red in front of you in order to make it to the next section where it's safe to stand, you're going to die. Again, and again, and again, until you stop f@!#ing around and pay attention to the timing.The developers did a particularly great job of forcing you to re-calibrate /learn new timing patterns after each section (of which there are 3-4) in of each of the levels, which kept the game interesting, and avoided that platformer burnout you get when you feel like you're making the same jumps all the time. There are mid-level save points, and the spacing is perfect. Far enough apart to make it difficult, close enough to not make you rage quit. Definitely worth the money (or even twice as much as they're charging).","March 25","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, the difficulty curve is a bit confusing at times. Sometimes you'll find a pretty long and challenging section without a single checkpoint (see video below for one example) and other times you'll have more checkpoints than you'd know what to do with. I guess it's one way of increasing difficulty, but I would be hard pressed to say that it's a good way to do so. An overly long section where you're chased by lava while running through a gauntlet of timing based precision platforming challenges that you have to restart if you die (and you will die if you e.g. miss a cycle) is just not fun to me. I mean, I like challenging precision platformers more than most people (probably) but this particular section just isn't fun to me. Not in the slightest.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KdpCMNs0oQ\n\nBut as I said, the rest of the game is great, hence the thumbs up. Absolutely worth the money in spite of its flaws.","April 21","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Faithful retro look with detailed backrounds and smoothly animated sprites. The red + grayscale color scheme worked perfectly.\n\nMusic fit the look and theme. Very old school in a good way.\n\nDifficulty was, in my opinion, perfect. It took me about 4 hours to complete. Difficulty ramped up pretty steadily, starting extremely easy and finishing quite difficult.\n\nGripes:\n-some of the perils had slightly too big of hitboxes, especially the flying skulls. It seemed they were a pixel or two too big. Some of the grass looking stuff also had the same issue.\n-no way of knowing that when you reached a boss, it hard saved, given that checkpoints generally didn't hard save.\n\nFor anyone who likes old school platformers this is an absolute no-brainer. I'd even recommend it to people who like platformers in general. It's charming, fun, and doesn't overstay its welcome. The price is great too.","August 19, 2015","true","25.1"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"
