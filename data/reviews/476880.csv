I would say yes\nbut hope to see some small improvements in the future.","June 3","true","2.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Much better made than your average Flash game or item hunt. Spooky pretty ambient music, this game's pretty good.","June 3","true","10.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Is not much story or scenes but the challenge is that literally no hints or help throughout the whole game.\n\nThe items didn't have any descriptions, so I ended wandering around the mansion and randomly use a item, except of that, I love the atmosphere and monsters ! ♥","June 4","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art is ultra-awesome. Audio is also nice. Thou I really recommend some text tips and dialogue, that would bring more life and meaning to all those items and monsters.\nI still didn't find Lucy.","June 3","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The art is okay and the music is just great.\nYou play as a little girl who has just lost her dog Lucy. You investigate the mysteries of a dark forest and all the creatures in it. You should not expect 10h+ of gameplay, but at the cost of €3, you really cannot go wrong with this one.","June 5","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
