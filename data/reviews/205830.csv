Smooth control, well-balanced difficulty, gorgeous photoelectric effects and nice soundtrack provides me lots of fun. It took me around 3 hours to beat the whole game on normal difficulty when I first play it, which is just an appropriate length for me.\n\nI'd like to promote this game to those who enjoy old school game and love to experience new gameplay. Through this game, you could gain both at the same time.\n\nFun to play!!!\n\nLuxor Evolved\n[8/10]","March 26, 2014","true","13.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

This version of Luxor, after almost 10 years, takes the cake. Fast paced action, amazing soundtrack, and definitely more intense than its predecessors. Not only that, but you also have bonus levels within the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/205830/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","I played several games of the Luxor franchise and, I must say, this is looks more different than any of the other games. Luxor Evolved has bright, neon graphics with a very dark background whereas other Luxor games have been based on Egyptian architecture. This game appears to pay tribute to 1980s arcade classics such as Asteroids, Berserk, and Pac-Man.\n\nThe basics of the gameplay remain the same: you are a scarab at the bottom of the screen shooting spheres that correspond to the colors being pushed by the evil scarabs in an attempt to breach the pyramid. If they do breach the pyramid, you lose a life. What is different about breaching the pyramid from previous Luxor games is that the spheres will move back and you will have to shoot them down again. Previous Luxor games simple rushed the spheres into the pyramid upon breaching the pyramid. In Luxor Evolved the spheres will be rushed past you into the pyramid only after losing all your lives. Making three consecutive matches of spheres will throw up a powerup in the air that you must catch to gain some advantage such as reversing the horizontal movement of the spheres, turning a group of spheres into one color, or stopping the spheres temporarily to give you time to shoot them with less stress.\n\nThe neon lights are accompanied by a retro soundtrack. I think the soundtrack is not very diverse, but still entertaining enough to keep from being boring. As in previous Luxor games, you will find bonus items after destroying a scarab and your scarab gobbles it up in a Pac-Man like manner. There are bonus rounds that require you to take out spheres flying in patterns using your throwing knives. Secret levels are very interesting, but must be unlocked by collecting a fixed number of treasures, including fruits and coins. Survival levels test your ability to withstand several scarabs moving spheres toward the end of the pyramid within a set time. Another new type of level is the boss level. Boss fights require you to shoot spheres into the sphere chains circling the boss’ eye. In the meantime, the boss is attacking with rows of spheres below the aforementioned sphere chain. All of this action is occurring while listening to the techno soundtrack.\n\nIf you are a fan of Luxor games, you will be surprised by the dark background and neon colors presented by Luxor Evolved. However, you will be familiar with the chain reactions that look quite dazzling when a string of three or more spheres are eliminated. I found it quite entertaining to see secret levels showing a Pac-Man like maze and a Berserk inspired background. In my opinion, however, the Luxor games presenting Egyptian hieroglyphics were aesthetically better looking than Luxor Evolved. I first played this game in the Hard difficulty mode and I finished it after 8+ levels. It was unique and a laugh out loud (lol) moment to be able to continue shooting spheres when the closing credits were running. Scarabs were still moving rows of marbles when the game was over and the credits were running.\n\nI think that Luxor Evolved is a fun game for those who enjoy arcade classics that have been remade in modern times. It is a game that will be entertaining for a few hours, but I do not view it as a puzzle game with a high replay value.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n\n\n","November 10, 2015","true","6.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Now it looks like Tempest, sounds like Blade Runner, and plays like Galaga.  Quite intense stuff, unlike anything you would usually associate with the brand.\n\nIt still banks on the 3 matches -> powerup mechanic, and there is only one play mode which is score attack through ~50 levels.  While levels differ only in marching patterns of neon marbles, plenty of variety comes from whopping 25 kinds of powerups you gradually unlock.\n\nIt's mindless fun to pull off combo, pick them up and trigger spectacular vector-shatters and sound effects in bullet time, easily enough to hold interest for ~2 hours of one playthrough (which can be suspended/resumed anytime.)  Regular powerups are instant RNG, but supers can be deployed at discretion, so some forward-thinking is called for as well.\n\nExtra point for the dubstep music which ebbs and flows with the gameplay.  Bonus stages, secret levels, and epic boss battles wrap up a lean and mean package.\n\n4 difficulty settings with separate Steam leaderboards inject much-needed speed boost (if nothing else,) but I won't suggest serious score runs because of obvious balancing issues.  Achievements are supported as well.\n\nA bit thin on the content, nevertheless what's in there is a sublime arcade experience to zone out to.  Highly recommended if vector is your kind of retro.","April 7","true","25.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Comprei este aqui na Steam porque estava em promoção e era o único que eu tinha visto com suporte para controle. Este é um daqueles casos de jogos que passam despercebido por nós por acharmos que ele é apenas mais um na multidão, mas Luxor Envolved trouxe de volta o prazer de jogar Luxor, como se nunca antes tivesse jogado. O jogo é visualmente empolgante, tem vários tipos de power-ups desbloqueáveis e o mais legal: Bosses. Isso mesmo, ao fim de cada estágio, um boss aparecerá com um quebra-cabeça diferente para você resolver e vencê-lo. Achei essa adição ao jogo fantástica e tudo a ver com o visual futurista e si-fi.

Luxor has always been towards the runty end of casual, what with taking the least interesting bits from Breakout and Puzzloop and not even really trying to do anything vaguely interesting with anything it does take from. It always, always felt like a bit of a "yeah, I want a marble blaster but totally not Zuma honest guv" thing.\n\nAnd yet here we are with a vector reimagining of the game, somewhere in the region of Dark Castle Software or Sokurah's house styles and very, very pretty it is too. Yeah, I'm easy and I'm easily sold on things which glow. I can't say I actually imagined for a second it'd be any good but it is good and I'm not sure I know how to parse that. Sure, it's easy. it's tremendously easy and the difficulty curve is pretty much close to non existent but it's satisfying so that's OK, I think.\n\nIt is, still, Luxor at its heart. You have a bat that you move across the bottom of the screen to fire the appropriate coloured marble at the marble snake thing that makes its way down the screen. But I dunno, whilst the formula remains the same, the stark neon glow, the great sound effects, the classic arcade bonus rooms, it's like someone really took the time to try and make it work as best they good and then make it pretty too.\n\nI like it. I like it a lot and it surprised me. It's perhaps trying too hard to straddle the casual divide but who cares when you've got neon exploding marbles all over the shop? Did I mention the bonus stages are great btw? The bonus stages are great.","September 29, 2014","true","2.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Graphically, it's very nice to look at. The game also includes bosses this time around. You basically try to match 3 or more balls circling around the boss a few times to pass the boss stage. There are 4 difficulties. Unfortunately, the game lacks any sort of depth to make me want to keep playing. If you enjoy the single game mode that the game offers to play over and over, then you will be happy with it. The upgrades you can unlock will reset everytime you start a new game. If those stayed permanently leveled up, that would give me a lot more reason to play it. It's also the hardest Luxor game in the series. Normal difficulty is hard enough, but the 2 harder ones will require lots of game overs and restarts to pass the stages. I got about 4 hours out of this game, before I didn't feel like playing anymore.","January 4, 2014","false","4.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

It's got a whole bunch of ancient motifs like Scorpions and Pyramids, and some unique boss battles against what I think are Egyptian gods. I'm quite surprised at how good I became in so short a time. It's entertaining and never happens the same way twice, and it's the kind of addictive where you start seeing the shapes around the edges of paragraphs even when you're not playing. I'm seeing that right now. And even if you're colorblind, each colored ball has a different symbol on it, so you can tell where you need to shoot in order to explode all of them massively with fire and lightning. The achievements are also not too difficult but they do require quite a bit of effort to get.

Luxor Evolved first got my attention with its unusual retro vector look, imitating arcade classics like Asteroids, Tempest, and Black Widow. Earlier Luxor games had an offputting sort of Egypt kitsch, but Evolved nicely ties the scarabs and pyramids into stylish, colorful vectors.\n\nIt's not entirely skin deep, either. Evolved still follows the basic Luxor design, with the player shooting colored marbles from the bottom of the screen at a train of marbles twisting across the screen, trying to match them three or more at a time before they can reach their destination. But the tempo of play is dramatically faster than other games in the genre, power-ups have more dramatic effects, and visual effects are exaggerated, all helping to create a genuine feel of arcade mayhem.\n\nThe bosses have a clever design that creates tension by forcing the player to manage matches in several places at once. Secret levels are cute homages to arcade games from the early 80s. It even encourages a one-credit clear by disabling high scores if you choose to continue after losing your last life.\n\nLuxor Evolved is certainly a casual matching game in genre, but it's got enough arcade trappings that it might grab you where similar games failed.

It's a typical score hunt game yet has a pretty lengthy campaign to go with and can be really challenging if you increase the difficulty. I would not recommend this for most gamers, while it has different powerups and such, in the end it lacks depth and relies on addictiveness. It's pretty decent game for what it is though, and those who'll enjoy a game like this will see it from the trailer video on steam store.","December 9, 2013","false","2.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

People love this game and candy crush and they are just repetitive matching games that have pretty much no innovation. The only way you'll do well in this game is if you play luxor all the time. You have to stop 2 different trains of colors that are completely rainbows and move super fast and have super short tracks. Not even the mechanics make sense or follow a set rule. If you form a combination of three sometimes the chain will shrink backwards to the closest ones, but other times the ones on the side towards the end will keep getting pushed forward, meaning each time you try forming a group of 3 on them they keep moving further and further forward which makes no sense since you have to form 3 to stop it. You basically have to get lucky and get a special power or you already lose, which makes no sense. You never get the colors you need and the things move 30 miles an hour. Then if you form a group of 3 and break the chain but it still pushes the other side forward into the end thing you lose. You only get 3 lives then you lose everything, and it's not explained how you get more lives, are there tons of power ups and different symbols that fall but you have no idea what most of them are and if you actually need them or they do anything. Not to mention they fall super fast and sometimes 3 at a time meaning you miss 2/3 the stuff because you're busy trying to stop the chain thats moving way too fast on the super short track. Unless you're one of the casual luxor/beweled/(insert any other repetitive ♥♥♥♥ casual game derps eat up) then don't waste your time on this steaming pile. 4.5/10.","February 23, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

If you are a puzzle game addict this and need a different game the Luxor games are good, but if you occasionally play puzzle games like that just play one of the great ones.","May 14, 2014","false","0.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

The game is fast paced and constantly visually stimulating and enjoyable. The music compliments the actions on the screen and blends in smoothly with all the noises the game produces as if it were meant to be orchestrated in that way. Combos feels fantastic, and getting a big score actually feels like an acomplishment. Boss stages are also a very entertaining aspect, a proper balance of chalenge and orignal gameplay keeps it interesting and fun. Power-ups are powerful and bonuses are bountiful. The loading times are seemless, as you just fly onto the next level.  I really have no complaints about the overall quality of the game or the game its self.

There are these snakes of coloured balls, you need to shoot matching coloured balls to make them disappear, before they get to where they want to go.

It's easy to screw up and lose your buttkicking momentum, yet it's also easy to recover from your stumbles and get right back into it. The stage designs homage both the older Luxor games and classic arcade games as well, and the mechanics are actually closer to the first Luxor than the second or third, since depth of field and reflective bumpers are nonexistent. While the Luxor series is solid for all types of players, the speed and flashy nature of this one make it ideal for swifter, quicker-thinking individuals who would like a challenge with a side of visual popcorn.","December 11, 2013","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
