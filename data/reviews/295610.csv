I suppose you can call this game a "metroidvania" in the same sense that a half-empty parking garage is a metroidvania. Sure, you have complete freedom to wander back and forth between a wide variety of drab-colored largely uninhabited levels that all look the same, but nobody would ever mistake it for entertainment.\n\nHonestly, the game was more fun at the beginning when falling more than a few feet at a time killed you. At least that made some of the mindless jumping between platforms bits a bit more challenging. Apparently "adventure style puzzles" actually means "and now your player comes to a gap that can only be jumped if you nudge forward until you have approximately one pixel of sprite box left on the ledge," and failure doesn't result in death, you just fall back to the beginning of the level and have to loop back through three stories of tedious ladder climbing.\n\nEventually you do pick up a few more weapons and powers, but what's the point when 99% of the game is wandering around empty terrain, occasionally shooting a bunch of identical monsters in the face and ducking to avoid their bullets?","May 22, 2014","false","0.9"," 77 of 99 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","77","99","6","3"

Yes, but and it's a very big BUT you need to be in the right mindset in order to get enjoyment out of it. If you expect something like (Super) Metroid or a game that has expanded on the groundworks laid out by Nintendos masterpiece you will be severely disappointed and if you are hardcore about your Metroidvania you will hate this games guts.\n\nHowever, I don't think this game was ever intended to be a spiritual successor to Metroid or the post-Symphony of the Night games. Instead, the game feels much older - the gameplay and scale of it is more reminiscent of early 2D "freeroam" titles.\n\nThe way it handles reminds me a lot of old Amiga games, I think there are influences from Shadow of the Beast for instance - merged with ideas from other titles. I get a bit of a Flashback-vibe from it too (though the game itself is nothing like Flashback at all, mind you). You get a maze, some storybits thrown in and pretty basic combat against rather unspectacular enemies. Apart from that you spend your time going back and forth through the maze (without a map!) and grabbing items to open doors. And then the game ends. You are done. That's it.\n\nSounds terrible, right? So, why on earth would I recommend this? Because it feels so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ old and simple - and I love it for that. Not only does it look properly early 16 bit (the color palettes used feel just right to me) - it kind of looks just like an actual Amiga-game or some second generation Mega Drive / Genesis title with a bunch more colors. There is also no music - as someone who still regularly plays games that either have no background music or force you to pick between SFX or music I don't mind that at all. Somehow, I think, it even adds to the atmosphere of solitude - being a stranded guy uncovering some dark secrets on an alien planet.\n\nAnd it is all so nicely simple - just the way I remember games, you can't do much but run, jump and shoot. Even in 2014 nothing beats the simplicity of the old ♥♥♥♥ that I love to death. Occasionally you pick up an upgrade for your suit giving you some abilities to overcome certain obstacles - but they don't mix up the gameplay enough in any exciting way. But I really don't mind - it's just like a game straight from 1990 without the brutal difficulty. You can easily beat it in an evening/afternoon and would be even faster if you know what you are doing and then scratch your head about the weird ending (that in it's own way fits with the oldschool style - I remember a lot of weird homecomputer games with these kinds of abrupt and strange endings).\n\nIt all boils down to this: do you want to own/play something that feels right at home in your library between titles like: the original Duke Nukem (the 2D platformer) or MURI for example? Meaning it's outdated, archaic and simple? Without any comfort functions and lacking pretty much all modern influences? Would you get kicks out of discovering a "lost" Amiga-game from 1990 in this day and age and get all giddy to try it out and enjoy yourself in the process?\n\nIf you are a person like that (I know I am) - you will enjoy "Inescapable". It is decidedly old and limited. If you expect anything "better" than a game that would have been cool 25 years ago and feels outdated today, you will be disappointed.","May 23, 2014","true","2.1"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","49","62","0","4"

I never took any health damage except at the start of the game before you get the upgrade to negate fall damage.\n\nThe game claims to be a metroidvania game, but in truth it's completely linear. The optional areas- which contain nothing except suit energy you don't need- only serve to make you waste time walking back and forth.\n\nBasically, the entire game is fighting trivial enemies that are no threat, doing annoying platforming, and then the game abruptly ends before anything interesting happens.\n\nThe game's "ending" is an anticlimax that felt like the developer just got bored of the game and decided to end it half way through.\n\n=========== SPOILERS BELOW ================\n\nYes, we all know that video game protagonists always manage to heroicly save the day despite a single person defeating hoardes of enemies being completely implausible.

I want to like Inescapable more than I do.  I followed it for a while during development because I like the retro graphics and "metroidvania" always gets my attention.  But this is not a metroidvania.  It's a rather linear experience of fetching a relic, back-tracking, and opening the corresponding door.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Oh, and that back-tracking?  That's about 75% of the game.  Not exploring and the sense of progression you get with a true "metroidvania", but endless back-tracking.  And there is no map, and most of the backgrounds are just palette swaps.  So you will get lost.  A lot.\n\nAlso, no music.  Which I didn't mind because the ambient sounds helped set the mood.  No story either.  There is some vague, generic sci-fi stuff going on.  But it is never explained.  And then the game just ends.  Seriously, the least-climactic, most unexpected ending I've ever experienced.\n\nThat being said, there is still something about this game that I like.  I won't recommend it at $5, but since you can get it in a bundle like I did, it's worth a shot.  It won't take more than 2 hours of your time.\n\nProbably the least helpful recommendation ever.

I would say its look is inspired by early PC or Amiga games, its tone is inspired by lonely sci-fi like The Dig, and its platforming is inspired by games like Flashback, Blackthorne, or Prince of Persia. I liked all three of those things and that's in large part why I'm recommending the game. It tells the story of a mining company ship that crash-lands on a planet and what your player character finds on the surface. Combat is a secondary focus, primarily you just platform and solve puzzles.\n\nMy hesitations: The game's default control bindings on a controller are poor, so you'll want to rebind them. The game is short and ends somewhat abruptly. The controls don't quite have the precision they need for some of the late game platforming. But the serious limitation is that the game does not have a map or minimap--for a Metroidvania, this is a problem. Often times, I'd get a new item and say "okay, I need to go find this room to use it"... and then spent a while trying to actually find the room. This could have been mitigated if I kept a paper map, but I didn't because I didn't know I'd need to until it was too late.\n\nI disagree with some of the feedback from other reviews: At the time I played the game, it did not have unavoidable fall damage for most of the game. Items were always clear to me.\n\nI just wanted to end with a little discussion of the plot or theme. The ending is basically an extended quote from David Foster Wallace about the nature of heroism. I did find it interesting, and it did connect to the game in a tangential way... but I couldn't help but feel that the game could do more to earn this critical perspective. It's a pity, because I really liked the text and lore throughout the game and wish there were a little more of it, building towards the ending.\n\nAt the time I played the game it did not have achievements or cards, so playing the game is a one-and-done. Again, my verdict is a very mild recommendation and I recommend you read carefully to understand whether you'd like the same things about it as I did.","December 31, 2014","true","1.7"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/295610/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3057 products in account","I can recommend playing Inescapable, so long you understand several very important things about this title. First, despite the visual similarities, know that this is not Super Metroid. A comparable situation would be like saying a triple decker sandwich is proportional to a single slice of lukewarm bologna. Second, this game is very short, and I would suggest not even playing unless you have ample time to finish it in a single go, because, third, there is no map (or hidden collectibles). Even though the game’s world is relatively small, I imagine most will simply give up upon booting back up and realizing that they can't recall where they'd been. And that would be a shame, because once you get past the fact that the supposed similarities to Metroid don't really exist past the visuals, you will still find a competent and mysterious adventure that ends long before it has the chance to overstay its welcome.\n\nTo better explain what this game is, lets again bring up the beloved Super Metroid. Now, remove the myriad of hidden hallways, collectibles and bosses, remove the enemy variety and all music, remove all but a few non-linear pathways, and cut the world into, oh… 1/5th the size, if even that. Now, you might have an idea of what to expect upon starting Inescapable, an inspired take on the metroidvania style.\n\nAs bad as the all of the above may sound, know that I enjoyed my time with Inescapable, as brief as the 2 hour journey was. The game is very “indie”, with only a handful (read: 3) of enemy types, lack of weapon variety beyond a pistol and variant thereof, and whose combat consists solely of ducking below enemy bullets. Worse yet, there are doors that can only be opened upon finding the proper jewel or thingamajig that fits a slot, and so backtracking becomes an integral part of the experience. You may understand now why completing this title in a single sitting becomes paramount, as “misplacing” that blasted door was will undoubtedly infuriate, and the likelihood of such an error may lessen if you’ve yet to pause your journey and allow forgetfulness to set in.\n\nWhat story exists is told through snippets of dialogue found through interacting with computers, murals, plaques and the like, but it’s typical sci-fi nonsense of “ancient alien power” and man’s greed. What gets me most, in regards to the story and this title’s aforementioned Indie quality, is that this story doesn’t end, or rather, there is no ending. In typical indie nonsense fashion, the game ends with a “deep” quote and a The End screen. The story sees no resolution, and the player receives no reward for their work.\n\nSo why, then, the thumbs up? Simply, the journey was enjoyable, and the lack of resolution to the meager story did not diminish that feeling. The world that you explore, as lacking as it may be, and the adventure it brings ends before it becomes stale. Lack of a proper conclusion in favor of a silly quote screen notwithstanding, I enjoyed this short title for what it was. And if you can forgive the lack of a proper finish (and that it sure as hell isn't Super Metroid), as I did, you will likely look fondly on your time with Inescapable.","May 31, 2014","true","1.9"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","5"

And as I observed and seemed to spend more time analyzing than playing, a pattern began to appear, one which seemed to subliminally cry out “there is no point to any of this.”\n\nInescapable is a game built-in the image of the greats which came before it, most clearly Super Metroid, but it doesn’t know where to go beyond replicating elements that worked in other games. There’s a suffocating sense of routine running through Inescapable, each piece fitting cleanly in its designated space as if that alone gives it a purpose.\n\nMonsters populate every hallway and cavern, upgrades section off parts of levels, and backtracking is used heavily as if to create an illusion of larger scale. But why? Why am I fighting so many of the same creature when shooting is neither fun nor gives any reward? What is the point of an upgrade with such a minimally used application? Why are levels so large if there’s nothing within them?\n\nI don’t want to say that Inescapable was designed to waste your time, but it definitely feels intentionally drawn out for the sake of it. There is never an end goal to anything you’re doing beyond continuing to explore, to collect, to fight off the incessant monsters whose only real crime is forcing you to stop every few steps to take them out. It’s as if the game desperately wants to keep you playing to give it more time to find the reason you’ve been forced to run around so much. It doesn’t find it though, and what’s been put in place is such an earnestly fabricated attempt at relevance that I just wished Inescapable had come out with it at the start and saved us both the needless journey.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndCJ8wcoCA\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 7, 2015","false","2.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

If you're looking for a good game, rinse and repeat. If you're looking for tedious garbage that lasts 2 hours then you've found the right place. Inescapable's page asks the questions of "Unravel the mystery uncovered by a remote interplanetary mining operation. What did they find? What threat does it pose? And ultimately, what does it truly mean to be a hero?" None of those questions are answered.\n\nYou "explore" this planet in what is pretty much a straight path majority of the game. Other times it will acknowledge you picked up an item and ask you to return to another previous location 10 minutes away because it happens to open a door that lets you pick up another item. You'll also occasionally complete braindead puzzles that required you pressing a switch and then continuing on your way. The creator seems to have played a Metroid or Castlevania sometime in his life and decided to make a game about it without realizing what makes those games any good.\n\nIn those games you usually picked up upgrades that had a meaningful impact on your movement or how you dealt with enemies. In this game you acquire 12 total grenades off random bodies throughout the game and a spreadshot gun that depletes your suits energy/health every time it's fired. Besides that you'll be running around with an average gun majority of the time shooting the same enemies for 2 hours. There is 3 different enemy types. There is a regular mutant, a flying mutant, and about 3 enemy soldiers you fight in the game. Take that regular mutant and change it's size and color palette and that's 95% of the enemies you will be killing in this game.\n\nNow another one of the things that makes Metroid and Castlevania good is they include a map and each area is very distinct so you always have a feeling of knowing where you are. There is about 5 or less different tilesets in the game. Majority of them are present in the screenshots provided on the page. There's rocks, lab looking stuff, temple stuff, metal stuff, and I can't honestly think of any more. Majority of it is just different colored rocks. I think it's an accomplishment that a single guy made this, but I can't believe no one told him to maybe make the game fun or interesting.\n\nThe only thing that could be construed as interesting in the whole 2 hours would be the broken up narrative that you get from reading tablets throughout the game. It's to be believed that this planet you crashed on was being dug up and researched by some group of people we don't care about. We're to believe they found an old ancient civilization that had a secret thing no one has ever discovered. This secret thing had a lot of power and was cool or something so people wanted it. I might be wrong in my synopsis, but it's not like it really matters when at the very end you don't even get an ending. It mocks you instead. You put the final item in an old tomb, the game cuts to black, and then shows a shot of planet you're on. You are then presented with a completed unrelated quote from an author named David Foster Wallace. The quote tells you how your childish entertainment was just that. It was childish entertainment. It was theatre, smoke, and mirrors. It was all meant to excite and gratify an audience. In reality though, there is no audience. There's no one to clap for actual heroism.\n\nThe ending is a slap on the face to anyone who might of bought this. If I were to take a guess, the creator might of enjoyed the authors books and this quote. He also might of just needed a quote that talked about how entertainment is meaningless that could also be construed as why do you need an ending. I imagine the guy working on this didn't know where he was going with the story while writing the three pages or less of text in the game. He then realized at the last moment he needed an ending to his 2 hour affair. He then couldn't think of one that left the audience reasonably satisfied and maybe one that also left them a few questions so they could possibly theorize what was going on. Instead of thinking of an ending like that, he decided to just go with a quote. Again, a quote that basically said that you completed the game and because of that, you don't deserve any praise and contentment you might of gotten from a real ending.\n\nI hope the guy who created this takes his skills and applies himself to another endeavor, but actually gets feedback throughout his process to realize what makes games good and fun. I hope the creator can learn how to make a video game engaging and enjoyable. Maybe then he could go on to make something that actually is like a Metroid or Castlevania. Still,  looking at this overall, I'm left with disappointment. It had the possibility of being a tightly packed metroidvania that lasted a few hours, but instead we got a straight path through the same rocky areas and fighting the same enemies for 2 hours. The only thing I think I enjoyed about the game might of been the art and animation on main character, but that is not enough for me to care about this game.\n\nUltimately, it's just a bad indie game that could of been much better if the creator put more time into it and actually had feedback on what makes video games fun.\n\n\n\nAlso, a side note. Most of the reviews in the description of the game are either badly written, misleading, or links to a random person on tumblr who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n","May 27, 2014","false","1.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

It reminds me a lot of a sega master system title Zillion in that it really isn't a metroidvania as advertised. You just have to get through each screen and a branching path either results in a key or a door.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the animation isn't great but the controls are ok, the graphics are fine and it is "just" interesting enough to draw you in. There is some story here, but it is mostly told through snippets of text that appear at the top of the screen. I feel you would really need to be in the right "mood" to appreciate them. I probably wasn't so I found it really hard to care. Still, at least there is an attempt at a narrative here (not so much an attempt at an ending).\n\nOn the negative side, I think it can be compared to something like Cave Story+ in style. But where cave story shows you all the "cool" scenes, inescapable tends to skip them. For example the game starts and you are told there is 2 minutes until everybody dies on the spaceship. Then the game cuts to you leaving your escape pod on another planet.\n\nGoing through those two minutes to escape, even as a tutorial area is the type of added detail that is missing at the moment. It doesn't ruin the game, far from it, but it could just do with things like that to elevate the game further.\n\nThese initial impressions of an underwhelming experience carry through to the later stages. It was ultimately fine, but nothing much happened and the game only really made you back track more towards the end, with no real changes or challenge to keep it interesting. The areas you go through (some several times) are large, but mostly empty and any combat resolves down to a careful strategy of simply ducking all the bullets.\n\nEven the upgrades are rather unexciting. They seem to centre on letting you last longer underwater. This sounds fine and "metroid-esque" but you still need to tackle these sections in a linear order and they are just long empty sections where you can only move slowly. As such, you never feel like you are getting powerful and strangely can still drown by the end of the game (it just takes ages).\n\nAll up, it only lasts an hour and I kind of enjoyed it well enough, but I don't think it is worth buying at this stage.

The download size is 2.5MB, so very small even among today's lightest indie games. I don't recommend buying the game at full price but it you get it as part of a bundle or as a gift then at the very least it's a decent way to waste some time.\n\n\nLonger, more detailed review below:\n\nYou start out with nothing and gain weapons and upgrades. Gun, upgraded spread shot gun, and grenade... very simple.\n\nThe enemies are blan "alien" creatures that come in two types with about two or three variations on them. One type is like a zombie that shuffles around slowly on loop and only attacks with projectiles when facing you. The second is sort of a ghost of a half corpse and persues you with flight. They both do little damage and are nothing more than an annoyance. You do find actual human enemies towards the end but they're so few apart and are only really just another upgrade of the first alien type only they shoot and walk faster.\n\nYou progress through the game by using items/keys you collect to open doors that lead to more areas. The collecting is so horribly repetitive it gave me a headache just doing the same thing over and over again. Obtaining an item/key is usually just killing an enemy and it popping out of them or just finding it on the ground at the end of an area. There seemed to a sort of attempt at puzzles in various parts of your quest for these items but they just consist of making your way to a switch, lighting fires, or using a water filled pot to set on a floor switch. All of it very unimpressive.\n\nAs you play the game you'll come across what seem to be small parts of an actual story forming. It's not that interesting and horribly written, giving the player no real reason actually pay attention and read any of it. There was a sort of "build up" to the story as you progressed through the game and made me think I was in for a boss fight of some sort...\n\nThe game abruptly ends when you get to a sarcophagus to insert the last item you found.

Must've been no other metroidvanias that year. It's pretty but the actual gameplay, the stuff that matters when making a game, is crap. The game is short and empty. You backtrack through huge cave areas picking up items to open doors and 'upgrades' to let you explore more huge caves all while fighting the same three enemies and their recolours over and over.\n\nSeriously, you got walking thing that has stronger forms that can shoot, flying torso ghost thing that takes one hit and it's stronger form that takes two, and evil soldier with a gun.\nThe bosses, if you can call them that, are a bigger red version of the walking thing and at the very end you fight a soldier with a gun that fires a three way shot.\n\nYou get three weapons. Grenades which are limited, there's maybe fifteen in the whole game. A pistol with infinite ammo. Another pistol that fire a three way shot but costs energy.\nAs for the upgrades? Let's see if I remember them all, no longer take fall damage, ability to read the ancient tablets, double jump, breathe underwater longer, breathe underwater even longer than that. Yeah, real fun stuff there.\n\nAs for plot, the game just throws info at you that means nothing as there is no context. You go to this mine where there are these guys from some other group that aren't supposed to be there and there is a name drop about Templeman, whoever that is. You find they dug up some ancient temple and this other group is trying to awaken something. Along the way you find tablets that ramble about ancient magicks and technology and sealing this thing the soldiers are trying to awaken.\nWho were these ancient people, are the enemies related to them? If not where did these monsters even come from?  Who are the soldiers that are trying to awaken this thing and why are they doing so? Who is Templeman? Who are you? All I know is that you walk around picking up keys shooting things that get in your way.\n\nThe ending is what was really a kick in the teeth. You kill slightly different soldier, which I thought was the first real boss not the last unique enemy in the game, and take an amulet and another orb to open some tomb thing. The tomb is of course back at the other end of the game's areas so you can backtrack more. You get sealed inside, the end. You get a view of the planet and a quote about how heroism isn't glamorous and no one is entertained by it.\nNow I admit, I like the idea of the ending, but not the execution. I would enjoy it if something had happened actually happened or was explained. All the amulets and stuff are sealed in the room with me, does that mean I stopped them? Did I save the galaxy by sacrificing myself? Did I fail to stop them and humanity gets destroyed? I don't know, the game told me nothing.","June 2, 2014","false","1.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's really too bad, because if it'd gone a little harder in one direction or the other I probably could've liked it.  As it stands, it's just kind of dull at the best of times, frustrating and cringeworthy at the worst.

The plot does not thicken or develops enough to the point were the story becomes complex and interesting and the 'ending' is composed of nothing more than a random quote that (while itself alone is indeed full of insight) hardly has any correlation to the rest of the game and serves no other purpose than to give the game an undeserved sense of depth. If this game had the right to be called intriguing and insightful then if I were to make rom hack of a random NES game and put a quote of Plato in the ending then that rom hack should also have the right to be called intriguing and insightful.\n\nInescapable is nothing more than a lazy game that makes a generally poor, boring and unfinished application of the old metroidvania formula and that despite it's claims of having a meaningful plot, does not really manages to build a interesting story with anything resembling a climatic ending.","September 20, 2014","false","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

As a gigantic fan of Super Metroid, the cavernous screenshots practically had me salivating, but the Metroid influence is only part of the story, here, with considerable influence coming from early DOS and Amiga platformers. Another World would be a good talking point, although the visuals are less stylized. Whether you grew up with games on those platforms or, like me, you were raised mostly on consoles, you have to appreciate the dedication and authenticity at work here. The pixelart is excellent making great use of the limited color palette. The game lacks music, but it lends a harshness to the proceedings with nothing to accompany the player except the ambience of gunshots.\n\nWhat's more, though, is that the game plays well. Some have complained about the lack of a map here, but perhaps that just shows that people have become too dependent on them. The world is well designed, small but quite labyrinthine. Despite that, the gameplay itself is rather straightforward with the focus on finding a series of keys and powerups that enable the player to progress through the game. It's nothing that we've not seen before, but it hits all the right notes, getting a nice balance between obscure and obvious by usually showing you where to use keys before acquiring them. As usual with open-world adventures, the amount of backtracking may bother some, but over the course of the game, you do find a few shortcuts. The game also adds a few twists that are less common such as severe limitations on drops early in the game and a health bar that doubles as ammo for a special weapon, though admittedly the action rarely gets heated enough to necessitate the risk.\n\nAll of this makes for a decent game, but it's the storytelling that makes it stand out. Many will find the obfuscated approach to revealing the plot frustrating as there is very little traditional exposition, but I appreciated the subtle way that the details are graually revealed. There's an elegaic quality rarely seen in the loud and fast world of video games. The ending, in particular, has clearly rubbed some people the wrong way, and it can't be called anything but an anticlimax, denying its audience of any reward, but by way of a quote from David Foster Wallace, the game makes some interesting metacommentary on the hero worship we often see in games and other media and how it disconnects from the reality of courageous people.\n\nUndoubtedly, Inescapable is designed for a very specific audience, and while it's well made, it does have problems, particularly  in its challenge or lack thereof. While the level design is good, there is very little variety in enemy types and there are far too few puzzles. It lacks the polish that we might expect from a Metroid or Castlevania. This game is unlikely to be seen as a classic, but developer Mangetic Realms shows a lot of potential here, and the conclusion while unexpected is gutsy and smart. Although the game left me wanting more, it's a testament to the craft here that I would have been willing to keep playing.","May 24, 2014","true","2.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

While you're at it, also remove the ability to LOOK up and down.\n-The varied gadget? Forget them, and replace them by keys. Make sure your key doesn't look like a key. Use an ID card, a dagger, a necklace, whatever.\n-The different weapons? Remove them, and keep only a lame weapon who does pathetic damage, or a shotgun who drains the shield.\n-The enemies? Forget them, just make a bunch of humanoids monsters, give them different colours to give the impression there's a couple of them, and have them patrolling in a platform. -Later, you may add flying enemies, because shooting constantly moving enemies with a gun that can only fire straight is fun.\n-The music? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA there is no music at all in that game. The only noises you hear are the character's grunts, the gunshot, and the monsters' moans.\n-The main character? Take Samus's combination, put Old Snake's face on it, try to add some backstory, fail pathetically, and decides he won't comment on anything he sees. Including soldiers from other factions cooperating with the local monsters.\n-The graphism? Well, it's pretty good. COMPARED TO ANOTHER WORLD. THE OLD ONE.\n-The inevitable backtracking? Make it more boring by having most rooms being just a corridor with two exits, and REMOVE THE MAP.\n\nI honestly do not suggest it. 20 years ago, it would have been good, now it's almost insulting. You can find better games for free on the Internet.\n\n\nFor the sake of honestly, I must admit that you're warned about the graphisms on the store's page.\nI personally think it's an excuse (of the "it's ugly, but it's on purpose, it's a reference!" kind), given that, on the same page, they try to sell that game as horror/metroidvania.\n\nYou know, I don't consider myself attracted to games just because they're beautiful. But I think it's extremely hard to make a scary game when all monsters look like giant pixellated feces.\nThat other game, Alone, I think, where a guy with a breathing mask tries to survive, was way better.\nBecause there was lights tricks, some area were darker than others, and monsters actually looked like something, and there was sounds and music to create an ambience where you expect things to pounces you and scratch your face until you look like a chile con carne.\n\nIn that game, I don't know if I'm shooting a giant pile of goo who looks like a human, or if I shoot zombies with crystals in their backs. Add to that the RIDICULOUS death animation (a small flash, usually used for teleportation instead of death), and you have a game where it's impossible to be scared.\n\nAnd another complain about the monsters : some of them spits fireball.\nExcept that there's no animation for that. They just walk, randomly cough a fireball at your face, and turns around. And that's not the worse thing, the worse thing is that, to avoid that fireball, you just duck.\n\nYes, that's the main problem with that game, each time you meet a zombie/mutant/whatever, you stops walking, you crouch, and you spam X until the monsters are dead.\nUntil you understand that it's more interesting for you to ignore the small fry and just shoot the mooks, since they're the one dropping shield energy.\n\nAnd have I mentioned that the game is a maze, and that there is NO MAP?\nI said no map? Have I also mentioned that there is NO INVENTORY EITHER?

By today's standards it is pretty bare-bones. Even the upgrades typical of metroidvanias are rather lackluster: shock absorbers to remove fall damage, handgun, energy shield, double jump. There's also grenades and an improved gun but there's hardly any need to use them more than once. Combat is a non-factor and once past the fall-damage part there is almost no danger of dying.\n\nPresentation-wise Inescapable looks like an early snes-era 2D platformer and lacks any music other than a few ambient sounds. Sound effects are basic as well so really most of the game is spent in silence. Dialogue is scarce to say the least and mostly takes the form of the ship's AI providing basic narration and translations of alien script.\n\nYes, it seems like there isn't much to the game at all. Still, it is a short metroid-flavoured adventure that'll help fans of these games pass an hour or two of time.","May 26, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I really like this buy for five dollars.\n\nIf you hear the "Metroidvania" tag and expect something along the lines of Super Metroid, Fusion, or such, you may be disappointed - the MV genre is the closest easy genre to throw at it, but this is something a little different.  It's less like a modern era Metroidvania throwback, and more like a Metroidvania era Amiga throwback.\n\nCompared to what one expects from an indie MV style game, it's simpler in many ways, but with a little more push on narrative.  I'd really like to see what the fellow making this can do with a few more resources.\n\nIt's stripped-down approach, while it may just be an artifact of the single-dev approach, is quite suiting to the game.  It comes across as slightly haunting, really.  It's like a really good indie record from the 80's - rather than being hindered by it's limitations, it has embraced them into part of the aesthetic, and made something better for it.  I think trying to make a game with the same sort of emotional resonance that is attempted in modern titles, within the confines of a vintage-styled 2D game, and to succeed on the level this game has is quite the accomplishment.\n\nFrom a gameplay aspect, while I often like something in this genre with a more open and less linear map (Aquaria was one of my favorites in this regard) given the size of this game, and the slow speed of movement, I appreciated the "looping" nature of many of the paths you take - while it does create a slightly more linear experience, it removes a lot of the "grind" of making your way across repeated terrain.  Teleporters and shortcuts and other work-arounds wouldn't have worked as well with the feel of this game, really, and allowing the character to move through the environment faster would have ruined the feel and mood of the game.\n\nReally, there's been an incredible balancing act in a lot of aspects of this game.   Every decision in it's creation seems to be quite deliberate.\n\nHonestly, I have a hard time not recommending this to anyone - the dollar and time cost are low enough to not feel like a waste even if you don't like it, and it's an intriguing game.  It doesn't quite hit every note it reaches for, but if you like 2D styled games, and games driven slightly more by story than action (without being action free) this is a good try.","May 31, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After spending two hours wandering around near empty locations in near silence, fighting identical bad guys, wrestling with pixel-perfect jump sequences, 'solving' puzzles that more involve randomly thrashing around the world until something works and then getting thrust with an ending that really looks more like the creator ran out of ideas I can genuinely say this is not worth the money.

The enemies seems generic and nothing alien-like.\n\nSounds and effects are underwhelming. everything seems uninteresting!\n\nI once read someone( in steam even) describing how this game have a old school-game feeling, being a empty space, since older games were kinda empty. I disagree on the argument that, this games seems empty because there is literally nothing to catch your eyes, or interact, or see, or anything!, older games had rich backgrounds and even with no enemies on the screen, you knew the ambient, you could see the world you're in.\n\nIt is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game.","April 6","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I certainly did.\n\nI will tell you now, that you will likely be disappointed. The game itself is not terrible, though it doesn't really standout, or even stand-up to those old classics you may have played and thoroughly enjoyed. You will probably not get that proper feeling of nostalgic satisfaction, as this game does not have much in terms of content, no real upgrades, and very few secret or 'extra' things to find, which in my mind is the core part of any metroidvania game. None of the sort of hidden things are cool, or interesting. There are also no bosses. That's right, you simply fight the same enemies throughout the game with no real challenge, no climaxes.\n\nThe story itself is ok, but the final nail in the coffin of this game is the ending (no spoilers)...you essentially suffer through some bad level design, and ok gameplay to reach what you hope is some sort of epic, or at least intriguing/satisfying conclusion...instead what you get is, not a bad ending, not an unexpected ending, or dissatisfying ending storywise...no, what you get, is essentially an insult for finishing the game. It informs you of something that most of us already know about playing video games in general. It has nothing to do with the game. I have to say that with that ending, this was in fact the most dissatisfying gaming experience I have ever had. That is saying a lot. I have played thousands of games over the years, and plenty of them were not very good. But the ending to this just leaves an absolutely bitter taste in your mouth. I have to say, I beleive that is exactly what the developer intended.\n\nDon't bother spending a cent on this, unless you enjoy torturing yourself.","June 21, 2015","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is unfortunately pretty weak. It has no music. There are only three types of enemies in the game. There are only two types of environments. All of the "puzzles" involve finding an item and putting it into a slot with the appropriate shape. No map helps you with a sense of exploration. The plot is all communicated through scanning alien artifacts, and it involves... an alien mining operation that uncovered something. There are 0 secrets. It has at least two serious game-breaking bugs that I suspect you will encounter even if you don't like to play games looking for bugs, like me.\n\nWould have gotten 4 out of 5 stars from me in Ludum Dare, but not worth the time on Steam. :(","August 30, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
