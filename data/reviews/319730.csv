However, do I recommend this game? No for the long run. Feel free to check it out, because it is interesting for the earlygame. Just like how most pay2win MMOs work, this is no exception. The end game is one long grind that either costs a fortune in real cash (I was young and naive and spent 800 dollars on it over 5 years), or hundreds upon hundreds of hours of grinding, requiring a clan and high level gear to do many of the endgame content. I'm not quite sure how the community is now, but when I left 4 years ago, it was a wretched hive of scum and villainy. The closer you approach endgame content, the more you encounter drama between many elitist and veteran players and clans. Often time the drama would get out of hand and affect their personal lives such as players holding grudges over each other and sometimes even hurting themselves mentally and physically.\n\nGameplay wise it was actually fun and unique at the time. You would control 3 different characters at the same time in RTS style click based movement, switching between characters to use their individual skills. You dont really create original characters. Instead, you as the player name your family and then recruit various unique characters into it. Characters have what are called "stances" that when switched to, depending on equipped weapon, give you a different set of skills. One thing that I didnt like is that when using skills on other player's characters it would stop the character in its tracks and play a sort of animation, and they cant move or be attacked by other players until the animation is over.\n\nThe music really made the game. It was simply amazing. Many songs range from classical victorian themed music to highspeed electronic techno rave music. The game sports a music player that you can select tracks depending on the area you are in. If youre reading this review I recommend you at least check out the music on youtube. I can't listen to the music anymore, because when I do I suddenly get PTSD flashbacks of some horrid times involving horrible money sink RNG systems in game.\n\nPros:\nCute female characters with lots of costumes and hairstyles to choose from\nVery nice music\nUnique gameplay\nCons:\nCommunity is a wretched hive of scum and villainy\nHundreds of hours of grinding\nPay2win\nHeavy RNG equipment upgrade system\nCant be played antisocially, need a clan to get to middle to end game content\nedit: i tried running it to see whats up, but it wont even start...so theres that","January 7","false","0.1"," 248 of 284 people (87%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","87","248","284","24","23"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VioletRosefall/recommended/319730/","VioletRosefall","Vi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VioletRosefall/","123 products in account","Redownloaded for old times sake. Played this game back when it was called "Sword of the New World" on GamersFirst so many years ago.\n\nPros:\n+ The soundtrack. I stopped playing the game long ago but to this day I still listen to much of it's amazing music tracks. Some weird/funky tracks here and there but overall the soundtrack for the game is just amazing.\n+ Designs of the playable characters and the armor/costumes you can buy for them are pretty well designed, many with that old victorian style, especially the ones for the Musketeers. Even the looks of the starter armors you get when you first play the game look good.\n+ Designs and graphics of the zones. Most of them are the same old "MMO grassy plains or woods" type of zones but there are some pretty neat ones. And even when this game is so old, the graphics still look pretty good if you run it at the highest settings (not amazing mind you, but still).\n\nCons:\n-Grind. Grind. GRIND UNTIL YOUR COMPUTER BLEEDS. AND THEN GRIND SOME MORE. No, seriously, I know grind is a common thing to be expected from any MMORPG, but this game takes the cake. The game even motivates you into leaving your characters afk, auto-attacking any mob that comes nearby in order to level up, or in order to farm for super rare items (some of which you need to progress in the storyline and that usually have a 0.00001% drop chance) if you have the money to pay for your pet.\n- Pay2Win. Perhaps not when you are just first leveling, but once you get your first characters to "cap" level (or at least the "first cap level"...) you will either enter the pay-money grounds or get out. Pay money to buy an item that lets you break the level cap on your character (1 per character!)! pay money to enter the zones that let you afk-level faster! pay money to get the items needed to recruit X characters! pay money to but the only items that sell for anything on the market so you can buy others of the same items! PAY MONEY TO BREAK THE 2ND VETERAN LEVEL CAP SO YOU CAN LEVEL UP TO EXPERT NOW!... you get the idea.\n- The story and its translation. The story of Granado Espada is not really the best ever but its... eh, decent? The problem is that you are more or less thrown at it before you even know who is who or what is what, not to mention a lot of it is locked behind grind walls the more you progress (ie: farm this super rare item on X zone which only has a super low drop rate). But the worst part is the translation work this game got... holy cow, is it hilariously bad. "HEY. YOU LOOK STRONG!!!!! BUT ALSO FEAR!!!! AND FEAR LEADS TO ANGER, ANGER TO HATE AND HATE TO SHOOTING LIGHTNING FROM YOUR FINGERTIPS!!!!!!" (no joke, this was more or less an actual line on the game from a main character, excess of !!!! included).\n\nTLDR: Play this only if you really have nothing better to do with your life and you are just poking around for new games to play. But even if you don't play it, please by all means DO get the soundtrack, it's amazing.","January 8","false","0.6"," 161 of 179 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","161","179","15","8"

Well, Purchase their Specials to go into Ancient Areas which give out better Exp Output then Stock Maps with Real Money.  Can't Afford that?  Then be ready to fork over Tons of In-Game Gold in order to be able to grab yourself access to this.\n\nWant to enhance your weapons? Better be ready to buy their Game Shop Enchantments with Real Money to upgrade your weapons just to have a higher ratio of success.  However if you wish to not do that...Fork Over A LOT of Gold to get the Enchantments.\n\nPets can pick up items when you're Afking in battle however however certain pets can pick up items faster then others.  To get those little baddies you'll have to get ready to fork over Real $$ or be ready to throw down some serious In-Game Gold to grab one.\n\nThe funny part is that they're purposely implementing Pets to remain stationary for a second or two, before picking up items, instead of continuously being in motion.\n\nReasons behind this is that even with Pets...You will STILL lose out on items/gears/drops that you may be able to use or sell for Value.  I had the Fastest Pet at the time (not the stock white pet btw) and when I left my game afk, and came back a few hours later, I noticed that I had a sea of item still on the floor.\n\nSo even with the fastest available looting pet, you are STILL moving too slow (2-3 second stalls on each pick up is absurd!).\n\nWorst yet were valuable drops that were being bypassed by my pet for random fodder drops.  It makes no sense to how they never implemented something to have the pet prioritize more valuable drops, or simply REMOVE the lag of the Pet lag in between pick ups all together.\n\nAll in all, you'll never make your full potential profit from pet looting because of their pick up rate.\n\nWhat can possibly be worse when using pets?  They Require Food in order to operate, and Food cost Fesos, and Fesos which also requires real $$$.\n\nDon't want to pay Real Money?  Get Ready to Spend A tremendous amount of Gold then, and with sustaining a pet, this is a Must!\n\nEven certain recruited NPCs require GameShop items in order to have them accessible to you, or before their released they'll be put into RNG Boxes.  No to this?  Some of the heaviest Gold Drops you'll have to make.\n\nWant Wings?  They are literally 100% Mandatory in Late-Game due to the significant Stats Boost that they give.  However they are only from the Game Shop, unless once again, you're willing to pay Gold for them.\n\nDo you see where all of this is going?\n\nConsider the above and really start to gauge just how much Vis (Gold) will be required in order for you to stay somewhat relevant.\n\nSure you don't "have to use real money" however all of your resources basically points towards churning the soup of the cash cow.\n\nBecause even as a Non-Paying player you're forced to relying upon Paying Players who make these purchases to sell at the market, who also in turn filters right into the games Direct Force Feeding of Pay 2 Win.\n\nAnother Big Flaw that occurred was during the transferring of Accounts from the Old Server/Host to the New and Current Server/Host.\n\nIn My Own Account, Along with many others that I knew whom played this game ended up losing Gears/Items when we were transferred to the new Host.\n\nTheir were people that had completely Lost Everything on their characters, and even in their personal storage when this occurred.  Basically making the game Completely Unplayable for them, because they had No Equipment or Resources to turn too.\n\nWorst of all, the Company who ran this Transfer did Little to Almost Nothing to Compensate or Return their Items, and because of this the action.  The New Host (which is the Current One Right Now!) lost a great and significant portion of it's dedicated playerbase!\n\nPersonally, I had the Majority of my Best Weapons/Gears lost during the transfer, however like an idiot that I was, this didn't stop me from playing and I continued to play this game for a the next 2-3 months.\n\nOn the believe and hope that with enough support tickets being sent to T3Fun that my situation would eventually get resolved.\n\nDid I ever get my items back?  Nope.  Never.  Did I ever get compensated for my losses due to their own faults with the Transfer?  Nope.  Never.\n\nInstead all I received with my replies were the Constant Same Statements and Responses from them stating\n\n"We're still currently looking into this matter.  Please be Patient with us while we are doing our best."\n\nA week into the situation?  Okay, completely understandable...\n\n"We're still currently looking into this matter.  Please be Patient with us while we are doing our best."\n\n2 weeks into the situation?  Okay..but will you resolve this soon?\n\n"We're still currently looking into this matter.  Please be Patient with us while we are doing our best."\n\n2-3 months into the situation?  Okay, now I know you're just full of sh*t.\n\nSo finally, after all of the garbage from the people who ran T3Fun, I dropped Granado Espada permanently and left, Forever.\n\nSo Ask yourself hard...\n\nWhy Spend Time, Effort, And Real Money on a Game, in which even the Backers of this particular MMO can't even properly help or compensate the players?\n\nPros of the Game\n\n- 3 NPC System, making it interesting\n\n- Beautiful Characters, Costumes and Cosmetics if you're a fan of that\n\n- Incredible Music going from Orchestra to Modern Techno\n\n- Afk Battle System allowing you to move away from your pc\n\nCons\n\n- Pay 2 Win\n\n- Newly recruitable NPCs popping out faster then two rabbits trying to make babies.  How is this a Con?  Most of the time they're either in RNG Boxes, or require Cash Shop Items to Recruit.  Lastly, because it's such a frequency they can quickly dilute the qualities of the previous NPC'sd.  Basically you're always chasing with $$$.\n\n- Many of the Best Costumes, cosmetics etc can't even be bought regularly but only through High Priced RNG boxes which for the most part give you terrible game shop items\n\n- Majority of Late-Game Work involves resources pertaining to Game Shop\n\n- Long, Long Hours of Grinds\n\n- Pets which pick up items are made on purpose to always stall during each pick up animation phase, thus lowering your income ratio on drops\n\n- Long, Long, Long Hours of Grinding - Posted twice for a Reason\n\n- Afk Battle System is still defective due to the fact that Melee characters will run outside their range and by doing so end up auto-resetting, making them no longer able to attack while afk.  This is the very reason why most teams use range NPCs which limits the versatility of Afking, especially when you're specifically trying to level up certain characters.\n\n- Pay 2 Win - Posted Twice for a reason.\n\n\nI am saying this as someone who played this game for years (2007-2014)...DO NOT GET THIS GAME!","January 12","false","0.3"," 138 of 161 people (86%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","86","138","161","15","0"

You can't buy content such as costumes, wings, pets, etc... the way you can in other games, rather you pay to rent them (yes rent in-game content) and pretty much anything of worth you buy disappears after 30 days. Pets require premium cash-shop pet food to function.\n\nI "get" the Free To Play market, and I've spend decent amounts of money in F2P games before (like Star Trek Online) but this game takes it to another whole level. I just cannot recommend the game in it's current form, despite some truely great ideas and the fun idea of controlling an entire party of adventurers.","January 12","false","25.3"," 121 of 139 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","121","139","4","5"

Since then, it's changed ownership (and names) quite a few times, and in one such transition process, my original account with hundreds of hours of grinding (and more cash money spent on vanity gear than I care to admit) was lost, and to date I've gotten absolutely zero assistance regarding its recovery. I'm not about to start again, and I'm sure as hell not giving them another dime.\n\nIn fact, I only redownloaded it so I could leave this negative review and warn people away, now that its infected corpse has floated downstream and lodged itself here.\n\nThe game itself is your standard grindy Korean MMO affair, made only slightly more palatable by the fact you can take 3 characters out at a time, allowing for what is essentially your own raiding party. Whatever 2 characters you aren't actively controlling will follow basic AI commands, so you can adapt your play style on the fly. The visuals are okay, if a little dated, but everything else is just typical, boring MMO material. Kill 10 of these, collect 5 of these, wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nThere's no real plot or storyline to speak of, and plenty of Engrish dialogue to go around -- in-game and out. They couldn't even write the game's description properly, for crying out loud. The technical aspect of the game rarely functions correctly, and frequently requires some ridiculous hedge fixes to make it function, such as updating and installing java/flash plugins for Internet Explorer, of all things. And as for actual support? Well, I think you know my opinion on that.\n\nTake it from someone who knows; there are far better ways to waste precious hours of your life.

But I would not recommend it.\n\nLike others have mentioned, the fabulous soundtrack was a major draw for me. The Pokemon RNPC system had me sucked in, and the styling and scenery was amazing. But I would not recommend it.\n\nHowever much I loved the game, I would not recommend it. (The following is from the SEA publisher, I dunno about this one, but odds are it'll be similar) This is the worst pay2win game I've ever made the mistake of buying into ever. The best RNPCs are the godly premium ones hidden behind gambling style paywalls, and so are the best end game gear. You CAN have a chance of crafting the end game gear free in game, but the journey to achieving that is paved with the golden bricks laid down with souls of wallet warriors and your paychecks. There were awesome free characters, but their stances required insane effort or selling an organ, sometimes both.\n\nThe best part? All that cash and effort is voided and nulled with the next patch and wave of premium characters and end game equips.\n\nA subscription game like FFXIV actually saves you way more money than playing this game.\n\nGet the soundtrack, get all the wallpapers and pretty art, and save yourself some serious money.\n\nAll this is void if they've fixed the cash grabs.

Anyways as you can already tell from my recommendation, I don't support it anymore.\n\nI won't be listing down the strengths of this game as it is rather subjective to one's beliefs so I will be only saying the main issue the game is in its current state (I would cover this whole review more objectively by also mentioning what it did well in, but I would exceed character limit sadly). Two words: Obvious pay2win.\n\nSome things I'd like to mention is that I absolutely abhor pay2win games. They for one, aren't fair to poorer people, ruins the fun of leveling the game, destroys the game's value. I really tried to go into Granado with an open mind, but no matter how much I tried to change my view, the game's mechanics spoke for itself.\n\nMy highest characters in the game are currently Master lvl 1, they being Emilia, Bernelli and Lisa, semi decent characters that were very op in the beginning. However overtime I noticed they were getting weaker and weaker. They needed better gears (I had crescementos for them), but these gears (which for your information is not 1 or 2 for each character) are really expensive! I realised that in my past 30 days+ of playing this game, more often than not I had to actually spent time grinding for Vis (Granado's currency), and I am not talking about idle farming (which I do everyday for 6 hours thereabout) because I have to specially dedicate my Fridays to afk farm from the afternoon till the next morning just to earn Vis. This is the funny part though, it barely earns much! The most I could get everyday was a few millions. One decent gear cost at least 250 mil (and on top of that, to make it even better it would cost at least another 100+ mil)! And that is only for one gear, for one character. There are over 80+ (or so they say on their outdated website) characters playable! Like damn this game also actually encourages this (as seen in the pets picking up for you items) and expects you to? I am appalled at the game in its current state because this is my first time taking the time to understand the sophisticated mechanics of this game. Oh right, and how does this lead to pay2win? Growth Stones.\n\nGrowth Stone is like the mediator between Vis and Feso (Granado's cash). For every 5 USD spent on this game, you can get 6 Growth Stones which are worth at least 4 mil each (exclusive of market tax and after market tax). And this part is clearly evident to see how much the developers are fat greedy people. It is a scam, yet a boost still regardless. If we do the calculations to achieve 250mil from selling Growth Stones alone, you would require at least 55 USD to buy one decent gear. And there we have it, grind or pay. Either way you still lose out because you would be wasting electricity leaving your computer on if you're planning on grinding.\n\nSo my conclusion. Is this game fun? Yes, in the short run. Is it worth investing time on? No, if you plan to play it regularly. Should I try it out? Yes, don't base your judgement off of mine only, decide for yourself if you like it.","February 22","false","311.0"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","19","25","4","0"

I have a lot of great memories of making a new family, running through the first missions and recruiting my first NPC characters. At the time it was the first MMO I'd played (not really an MMO person usually) and I loved the experience. Great music, interesting characters, cool themes and design, cool setting...and the combat system (of 3 characters at once) was pretty unique.\n\nAfter a while the grind (typical to eastern MMOs) started to wear on my teenage brain, and I only ended up playing it for about 5 months. I think my highest level characters were about level 80, because I'd play it for maybe an hour a day and we didn't have good enough internet (or a pc) capable of handling leaving it on all the time to AFK level (although that was also a cool feature).\n\nSkip ahead about 5 years. I rediscovered the game when the American servers came online. Still entranced by the graphics, music, themes, and character system, I downloaded it again (I seem to remember patching it being a ♥♥♥♥♥ and the technical support a nightmare, but I finally got it working) and checked my account. Oh wait, that's right...I'd been playing on the Korean server...so I had to start from scratch. No problem, no problem...I remembered the AFK system and, as I'd now upgraded my pc and net speed, all good!\n\nSo I'd leave it on while I went to work and come back in the evening excited to see how far my characters had leveled. I was making progress! I had maybe 12 characters at Master level 1 (131) and all of the recruitable character quests up to Byron completed. So I started researching what I would need to do to acquire my next recruitable characters (the main reason I played the game)...\nHOLY F*%&, I have to grind HOW MANY MILLION rare drop resources to get this character?!\nWTF, I need how many MILLIONS OF GOLD to get it off the market?!!!\n\nAfter swallowing the sinking pit in my stomach, I shook my head, cracked my knuckles, and did some research and numbers crunching over the next couple days. With the minimal minimal help of the apparently entirely non-english-speaking members of the forums, I managed to piece together that I really needed to stop trying to get NPCs for now and instead gear up for end level raids. Getting the rare raid drops was going to be the only way to get the money I needed to either buy the NPCs off the market or buy the materials to do their quests.\n\nSo how to do end-game raids? Yet another thing I had to research. Apparently I needed better weapons. Some of those I couldn't access until I completed the Byron story missions. Ok, no problem...\n\nUntil I ran into one questline. In it your characters go to scout out a castle area and are attacked by one of the recruitable NPCs. I wiped in like 5 seconds. And the next time. And the next time. No matter what combo of characters I brought or how carefully I used my skills or how many health potions I spammed, I wiped. I must have run that stupid mission 30 times before I realized no matter what I WISHED for, my gear wasn't enough to cut it.\n\nSo here I found myself in a predicament. To get to the end game characters and content I needed better gear. But, in order to get better gear I needed to run raids. Which required...better gear. So in order to get the minimum gear I needed for those I needed to either spend a f*&@ton of cash and sell cash items on the market, or run low level raids hundreds of times and sell the drops I got.\n\nWhich I did. For about a week. At which point I purchased (off the market) my very first 31AR +3AR pistols (was running an Outrage Shot dual-pistol musketeer character for DPS). YAY! I was so happy to go and try him out...\n\nHe died. Oops. Need armor too. How much does armor cost? That's right...3 F*@&ING TIMES the cost of the guns :\\n\nNo way. No way was I going to sit for 2 months, grinding every day all day, just to get the loot i needed to sell to get the gear I needed JUST TO COMPLETE THE MAIN QUESTS. That's not even considering the actually worthwhile raids, which were what I would need to run to get the highest quality ingredients and weapons (which I'd then sell just to get my DAMN CHARACTERS lol).\n\nSo I bit the bullet and caved and bought some cash shop items. Sold those, bought a couple (3? I think?) characters off the market...and was disgusted with myself.\n\nDid the game succeed in making me pay? Yes. Yes it did. I'm sure the devs would have considered this an astounding success story. Except that I do not believe in pay-to-win games. The only kind of cash shop I approve of in a F2P game is one that sells purely cosmetic or pure boost items. I'm not even going to get into the Lydon Box/Gambling-Box-of-Satan item (which is the only way to get some of the rare Characters)... True, the cash shop does sell some boost stuff. But that's not the problem. The problem was I needed gold (vis), and the only way to realistically amass the amount I needed in any reasonable (re: sane) amount of time was to use the cash shop. I couldn't progress in the damn game unless I did.\n\nDisgusted at myself for becoming one of those 'paytards' that I always criticized, I stopped playing. I've barely played the game in the last 5 years. I log on once every couple months to look at my characters, check market prices (just for the hell of it) and reminisce. Because that's all there is for me to do without paying.\n\n\nTLDR; This game has beautiful artwork, an amazing soundtrack, and an interesting theme (and storyline, if you can get past the atrocious english translation work...did they hire a 5 year old to translate this?!).\nIt is also a shallow grind-fest, which no meaningful depth to speak of, no good crafting systems or professions, no newbie-friendly guides or help, very few players (in comparison...especially few actual english-speaking players), and end-game content locked behind a paywall. I honestly can't even say that it was ever any better, although probably some would disagree. Either way, what it is NOW is a nonsensical trainwreck.\n\nIf you have any interest in the world setting, graphics, or characters, go ahead and play for a bit! I won't say it's fun or enjoyable, but hey, you can walk around and take screenshots right? That's what I did before I stopped playing. Take some screenshots for when it inevitably dies (the game runs primarily on income from pay-to-win players or moneybags (especially in its Asian incarnations). Because that's all its developers see it as: a money machine. Not a game, not a piece of art...MONEY. "We don't believe in customer service...we believe in MONEY. POOLS OF MONEY."\n\nBut...if you have any interest in actual exciting combat or gameplay, well-written characters or dialogue, end-game content or raids and don't want to spent 800$ to make that happen, go play just about ANYTHING else. Please. I implore you.\n\n\nAs a bit of reference:\nI checked the Market just before posting this. The newest NPC character is currently listed at:\n3,500,000,000vis\n\nYup. That's three BILLION.\nThat character is a rare character only available from the Lyndon/Satan boxes. So realistically, you'd probably have to spend 100-200$ on buying the boxes to drop one of that character. Which I'd like to say is a direct correlation to the vis (gold) cost, but it's not. That's a ridiculous price. even a number of the older characters are in the billions.\nTo give some context: currently, AFK farming for 24 hours (a whole day) at Castilla Ruins nets you ~14million vis. A DAY. That's MANY HUNDREDS OF DAYS of grinding to be able to afford a billion-vis character or weapon. And I'd like to say 'throw down a few bucks and it'll be faster!'. Not really. The most market-worthy cash item is the premium area passes which sell for ~120million. For 20$. :\","June 4","false","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

I normally play solo so I can't speak for the social side of this game. I've done a few raids and it looks epic.\n\nI'm going to vote this up purely because I enjoyed it, but do read the Cons below to see the flip side of this game. Can't really speak for the P2W aspect as I do not join PVPs or Faction Wars.\n\nI would honestly rate this as "Mixed" if there was such an option.\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful aesthetics & graphics: victorian women that looks like JRPG characters\n+ A huge roster of characters: has that Suikoden gotta-catch-em-all feel\n+ Unique setup: you relatively control 3 characters at once (similar to FF XII)\n+ Easy to start: you're given beginner items and the gear to play towards middle of the game\n+ Farming mode: requires a bit of setup, but you won't need bots to farm in this game\n+ Park mode: you can leave your characters to grind for exp by themselves\n+ Fun plot and side stories\n\nCons:\n- As an MMO, its designed to be a time sink\n- Mid-to-late game items need a LOT of in-game currency, quest item farming, and grinding time\n- 3 Characters means 3X the grind for those gears\n- Some quests are non-intuitive: half of the time you're spoon fed; the other half, you'll be left clueless (google ftw though)\n- Some plot devices are not designed with a non-linear game.\n- Big updates = huge patching: there were times you needed to download 8.2gig of data to patch up\n- A tax system recently imposed; problem here is that we're seeing high tax rates on starting maps (not beginner friendly at the end of it)\n- Some bugs here and there (i.e: mismatched voices, teleport into zone doors, etc.)\n* though there has been some bugs from lag that made me laugh out loud at times!\n\nI'm now at Family Lv26, the real grind starts - still enjoying the game, but I need to lessen my time in it (because life outside the house beckons)","February 15","true","380.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Playing for 20 minutes and saying "oh, this is different than I recall" is simply betraying this glorious wonder of a game.\nDo you want a fun MMO? This is the right place.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are a bit outdated\n-A few minor bugs\n-A few translation errors\n\nPros:\n-Tons of playable characters, each with unique stats and stances.\n-Control 3 characters at once!\n-Strategy involved.\n-Beautiful mind blowing music.\n-Politics.\n-Lots of daily events.\n-Newbie friendly (easily get to 'master' level with your first 3 characters, later develop your family using those).\n-Lots of starting and level-up gifts, you help you get into the game.\n-♥♥♥♥ loads of raids and high end bosses.\n-Enormous amount of content  (lots of end game content).\n-Can leave your characters to attack while AFK, this helps a lot in training and resource gathering.\n-Most "cash" items are trade-able, and thus purchase-able with in-game money from other players. Among the very few things that are not trade-able, is "premium dungeon entry tickets", which are very cheap (2$ for a weeks worth).\n-Brilliant story, I enjoy reading the conversations with most npcs (but if you don't, you can skip it easily ^^).\n-Recruit your favorite NPC! a large portion of the game's NPCs can be recruited to your family, and you can use them in your adventures!\n-Great PVP.\n-Clan wars.\n-Fun quests.\n-When you need to grind, you grind happily and enjoy it!\n-Another huge list of PROs that I can't think of at the moment.\n\nI Used to play this game while it was owned by GamersFirst, and on that server I had easily 3000 hours of gameplay (a few continuous years).\nMy experience on this server is enough to determine that the game is indeed as fantastic as I remembered it. A lot of things have changed, and I can say that 99% of the changes were for the better.\n\nTL:DR\nI recommend this game to anyone who seeks a fun and thrilling game.\nThis game is the whole package - from the classic 'train and get stronger', to the complicated strategic play style.","February 2","true","426.9"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","10","22","3","0"

Not because of that, but because of Real Life, i left Granado Espada untill recently i saw it back on steam again.\n\nFirst i want to state that a lot of the reviews given are based on earlier versions of this game (before steam and even before the current owner, T3). A lot have changed since then. For example:\nI've read a review that stated to progress after lvl 100, you need to pay. This is false. You pay some shiny crystals which drop enough within 30 minutes in (almost) every area to promote and advance.\n\nIs this game pay to win? Depends on how you look at it i think. You can make enough ingame currency to get almost everything you want. There are a few things that are behind a paywall, but for sure not needed to win. The beauty about this game is that you don't have to do the grinding yourself. Leave them on a proper spot over night and you will have results. For my life, which includes a job, child and woman, this is ideal. I don't have to actively grind to progress, i can leave them and check later whenever i want to. But, patience is required with this game. If you are one of those greedy (usually kids) that have to have everything as fast as possible and expect it to be free, don't play!\n\nYes, sometimes it is a buggy game. But, look around you, what device or software comes without any bugs these days?\n\nI would defenitaly recommend this game if you wanna play something else then generic. If you have a real life and still want some virtual fun, this one is a good one to play. Give it a try, it's free!","January 16","true","026.9"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","1"

(Supercooled Girl *this is my favorite).\n+ Stance System : Like PT points system in Rising Force Online. the more your fighter kill by equipping a sword, the more powerfull skill is usable in sword stance, and the passive effect is stronger. Same with rifle,dual sword,dagger etc. (Each mercenary have multiple stance).\n+ Player based market.\n+ PVP.\n+ Enchant,Socket etc.\n+ Auto move Map.\n\nCons :\n- Outdated Graphic (obviously).\n- No potion macro.","February 14","true","44.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

TL/DR version at the end.\n\nGoing straight to the point, the game's monetization changed for the better over the past few years.\n\nYou can now buy character slots with in-game currency and it's actually pretty cheap for the first 30 slots. Some quests' pay walls have been removed, and the new Crescemento items will perform much better than low llvl elite item, for literaly no cost at all, which means you can play the game without giving a damn about the market until lvl 100.\n\nOne thing you should know, though, is that the grind is real. It's been there since 2009 and it's not going anywhere anytime soon. There is an AFK tool that makes power leveling those lower level newly-recruited characters a breeze, but still, if not for XP, you'll be grinding for items or cash. Don't get me wrong, grinding in this game is actually fun, but there really is a lot of it.\n\nAs for the end game pay wall, while it took me about 3 days to get four character to lvl 103 and collect most of the chraracter cards available (based on my level, an inexperienced player can easily have fun for over 200 hours before even considering buying something from the cash shop. Hell, there's really nothing you need from the cash shop until level 110, and the game gives you a lot of bonus cash items over as your family level increases (as of now I have about 90 days of 50% bonus xp/drop).\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful art style and soundtrack\n- Great variety of fighting styles and characters\n- Grinding is actually fun\n- Many of the cash shop items can be bought from in-game shops, at fixed prices, for in game currency (Feso)\n- Lots of content to be played before any form of pay wall.\n\nCons:\n- No room for casual players on PvP these days\n- At a certain point, you either have to grind even harder or pay up to get what you need.\n- Not a single newbie-friendly guild as far as I can tell\n\nTL/DR: There's a lot of fun to be had before the dreaded pay wall, so you might as well give it a try for a couple hundred hours. Also, any review based on experiences from 4~5 years ago is utterly outdaded and does not reflect the current state of the game - you'd do well to disregard those.","January 13","true","63.0"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","4","14","2","0"

They have been used potentially everywhere nowadays, for example, they have been used frequently in some TV Shows, Weather Forecast and so on. The title music "Granado Espada" and the character selection screen music "Barracks" was composed by Korean composer Kim Junsung, rest of the 100+ tracks are composed by Korean game music group SoundTeMP. I love both the style of them. Kim Junsung is good at composing orchestra music, and SoundTeMP, they tend to combine different types of music perfectly into 1 single song, and they also good at EDM. The music in this game is extrmely worth listening seperately from the game. I make music too, the music in this game has inspired me alot. So, if you are a music fan or a musician, copy the MP3 files to your iPod, and start a tremendous game music trip, there are around 150 tracks of this game, which is a huge amount for a game like this.\nSome tracks in this game that I highly recommended:\nTOP1. Beyond Hope\nTOP2. Barracks (Character Selection)\nTOP3. Rising Sun (First Battle, not in this game version)\nTOP4. Granado Espada (Title)\nTOP5. Nangman Trance\nTOP6. Nangman Waltz\nTOP7. Zona de Calle\nTOP8. Rapid Eye\nTOP9. Cite De Reboldeux\nTOP10. Nexus\n+5 Multi-Character Control is a super good idea but it's delievered poorly at most cases, the gameplay is complicated and hard to get started for new players. When I am controlling my "family". I feel like I am controlling a huge chunk of garbage which is impossible to clear from my screen\n\n\nCONS\n-10 Besides music and multi-character control, I feel the graphic is generally .... bad, the graphic is lame even it's from 2006, the worst is, when one of the graphic setting is on, your screen will become grey and impossible to play and look at it.\n-10 The game is currently unplayable, the publisher of this Steam version is the real MOTHERFKER, NO PLAYERS, UNFINISHED TRANSLATION, BAD PUBLISHER'S WEBSITE (Good Game Website).\n-2 The lanucher setting window is from last century, it's cheaply designed and disfunctioned.\n-3 Kinda Pay To Win for a game which is doomed my its publisher.\n\n\nFINAL RATING\n0\n\n\nRATING SYSTEM BASED ON GAMING EXPERIENCE\nAbove 15: Extremely Recommended\n9 - 15 Highly Recommended\n0 - 8 Recommended\n-5 - -1 Not Recommended\n-6 - -10 Lame as Crap\nLess than -10: Wasting your life playing this game, please withdraw it from Steam","January 14","true","0.5"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","2","12","0","0"

Back when you could just go to sleep for school and leave your game on and let your characters grind for you... It was beautiful. Kinda like AFK grinding with the summoner in 2Moons....anyways. THEY SAID NO MORE OF THAT. So now you actually have to play the game. it's a fun game to play. If you're playing it for end game, Well, I wouldn't.","January 7","true","0.1"," 17 of 54 people (31%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","31","17","54","4","0"

I even still have the BOX. never did i think it would ever come to steam let alone alive after they like killed it in 2009. then lots of people went to private server. give the game a try, back in 2006 this game got Game of the Year in Korea and had best graphcis. Its over 10 years old. free 2 play might have ruined the game and killed it again only time will tell.","January 8","true","0.1"," 9 of 37 people (24%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","24","9","37","4","0"

Been looking for the same type of MMORPG, never found one. The battle system is enhancing the game's unique 3-char control. Collecting playable characters will be an objective by itself for those that want to fill their family mansion with a plethora of heroes to choose. And finaly what I like about this game, the music, come on, hunting mobs accompanied by a nice beat makes you fired up.","January 7","true","23.5"," 18 of 59 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","18","59","2","2"
