You are having a tea party with a stuffed animal (Ted), who demands certain items be dropped in front of him. You just go down the list. There are like five different environments.\n\nPros:\n+It gets laughs just like Surgeon Simulator did\n+You can actually walk quite a bit around the area now\n\nCons:\n-Regretfully, I didn't realize until after I purchased this, that this game is not made by the same developers that did Surgeon Simulator, which is fine except they totally rip off the game style (same font, idea, and graphical style)\n-There is alot to interact with, but I feel there could be more. For example, there are many items/cabinets/handles on the fringes of the rooms that look interactable, but are not\n-Only five environments, as I have heard (I have witnessed two)\n-Price is steep for what it is\n\n\nOverall, it was fun, but I certainly won't get anywhere near 10 hours out of this. I was on the fence about the 'no' vote - but this is fair warning so my Steam friends know what they are getting into. This does not have the content of Goat Simulator. I suppose the cheap laughs might be worth it if it is on deep discount.","April 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 128 of 174 people (74%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","74","128","174","11","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpageable/recommended/363620/","unpageable","Unpageable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpageable/","473 products in account","The game was fun for a couple of minutes when you just start out, playing for the sake of laughs. If for any reason you actually want to progress however, the wonky physics and terrible controls will make you rage like no other. God forbid if you wanted to complete the achievements, cause it will redefine the meaning of frustration for you, personally.\n\nThe placement of tea sets and cutleries are random by default, so it is possible to begin with an impossible setup. Lucky, you can turn that off in the options. On the other hand, the wobble in the plane stage, the low gravity effects in the space stage and the rain of fruits in the wonderland stage are fairly random in their impact. That my friends, cannot be adjusted in the options. Thus it is always best to pray while you play, since there are no skills here, just luck and RNG.\n\nI’ll give you an honest opinion, the game is badly made and the content is bare bones, it is nowhere near the worth of its asking price. Please don’t fall for the “oh-so-funny” reviews, you can do a lot better with your hard earned money.","March 23","false","9.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

If, however, you are looking for something other than basic monotonous gameplay with some funny one-laugh achievements, move on.\n\nPresentationThe game itself looks really nice for the asking price. Running the game on fantastic the arm is actually very well rendered, and reminds me of the renderings presented by some AAA (big title) games. But that is when the graphics stop being “fantastic". Most of the objects in the game are made of 1-2 colors. It almost looks like the developer attempted a cell-shaded graphics style and failed. The music changes level to level, but on each level is just a trill that lasts around 10 seconds and constantly repeats.\n\nInterface/ControlsThe game is limited in its technical settings: you can set up the graphics and controls before entering the game, but once you are in-game, if you want to change anything again, you will actually need to exit before doing so and use the pre-game console again.\n\nPlotThe plot this game offers is very minimal, and may not even be able to be given the title “plot.” The different levels of the game are effectively simple map changes, and, while they do parody some elements of pop culture, they become monotonous and boring. The Teddy bear that you are tasked with giving tea to does have some funny one-liners, but then repeats them several times in the span of one map.\n\nGameplayTo sum this game in one sentence: fun for the first couple minutes until you realize that you are doing the same action for the rest of the game with no variation in its mechanics. None of the elements change at all. For each level you are tasked with doing the same exact thing repeatedly. You have the exact same mission in every map: get the tea, cake, plate, cup, and biscuit. The first level was a little entertaining, but the game quickly became a chore to be completed and not an enjoyable nor compelling experience.\n\nReplayabilityI might play this game again only to get the Steam achievements as they deliver some more relatively funny one-liner jokes by the Teddy Bear character. Other than that, this game is almost the first level copy and pasted 5 more times.\n\nConclusionThe game offers a challenge, like all simulators do, to both master the controls and be able to eloquently and literally set a table. In the end it is hard to recommend this game. Some were lucky enough to receive this game for free, but those that have to pay the asking price will be sorely disappointed.\n\nFollow Giveaways Reborn ! curator for more reviews\nThis game has been given away in Giveaways Reborn !","May 22","false","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game has some awkward controls, but yet it can still be fun, due to the lack of control you have over your player. I enjoyed playing this, it was very weird, but I learnt that it was possible and you can have yourself a bit of fun, by playing with Jelly, and a teddy bear, maybe even some cake! I do not seem to envy this game, but instead I can sit back and play this as a comedy game, or possibly even a competitive game.\n\nConsThis game can be very frustrating, and can be extremely pathetic at times, due to the confusing controls, and the weird objectives. I can play this game, yet I cannot seem to work out what the point of this is? Personally I wouldn't take this game seriously if I was you, but instead just as a weird type of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. I hope you can responsibly tolerate my review, but this is my honest review.\n\nOverall reviewThe game itself is unique I agree, but I don't want to play this game for longer than 10 hours, I don't think my brain could take it, I can play this game respectively, and I can enjoy the physics (Not A very serious game at all) I can recommend this game only to those who can make content on YouTube following your genre of games, or if you just want to have a laugh while you have free-time.\n\nThis was a short review I know but there wasn't really much you can comment on this game.\n\nExtra InformationDeveloper(s): Liens, Power Up to Maximum\nPublisher(s): Liens , Power Up to Maximum\nPlatform(s): Windows\nRelease Date: April 23rd 2015\n\nSourcesPersonal Experience\nSteam Store Page\nWikipedia\n\nWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group","February 12","true","3.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

(The beach, Airplane, more)\n\n- Cons\n- It's a pricy game, I got it as a gift.\n- The boards, cups, breakes really fast. (the mission was loaded and everything was already broken in the plane)\n\nRating\nI liked to play this game so I give it a 7, It's a nice game with several missions.\nThe graphics are really good, even if you got a bad computer you can play this game on medium or low, but if you got a good pc, you can play this game on beatiful.\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow here!","October 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","11","25","2","0"

This isn't. The whole point of the game is to grab a few objects and throw them in front of a teddy bear without the plates or cups breaking, which is really hard to do because there will always be a lot of other stuff on the table in the way and if you try to move those out of the way you will end up messing the whole table up.\n\nThe second level is nearly impossible to finish because everything spawns in random places everytime and most of the time stuff just breaks and flies somewhere you can't reach it.\n\nThe game is obviously made so that youtubers like Pewdiepie or Markiplier can get some nice views cuz the game is "lol so randum XDD" and it's definitely a waste of 10eur if you bought it. And if you got it for free, like most of the people probably did, at least you will make some profit from the trading cards.","November 19, 2015","false","5.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

There is no in-game options menu, though you can adjust screen resolution, toggle fullscreen, and adjust the graphics quality via a separate window before launch (my guess is that this is a Unity game).  $10 is a bit steep, but I tend to find things expensive by default due to my frugalness.  Like "Goat Simulator", I'd wait for a 50%+ sale...though if you are a diehard "Surgeon Simulator" fan, you might feel like the price is justified.

There is no in-game options menu, though you can adjust screen resolution, toggle fullscreen, and adjust the graphics quality via a separate window before launch (my guess is that this is a Unity game). $10 is a bit steep, but I tend to find things expensive by default due to my frugalness. Like "Goat Simulator", I'd wait for a 50%+ sale...though if you are a diehard "Surgeon Simulator" fan, you might feel like the price is justified.
