"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Taroth/recommended/252690/","Taroth","Taroth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Taroth/","349 products in account","Fantasy Grounds is quite honestly the best virtutal tabletop software. I've tried several, but I run campaigns exclusively on this now. This software has a massive learning curve. You can get the basics quickly, but to master it takes a while. It is so feature rich that you can automate 90% of the DMing with enough planning and set up. My players love the system - other DMs that play in my campaigns want to switch over.\n\nCombined with other software (map designing, photoshop, ect) you can create excellent and wonderful campaigns loaded with graphics built upon a fantastic under-the-hood ruleset system which takes the technical (mathematical) aspects comepletely from the game so you can have lightning quick combat encounters and focus on roleplaying. Of course the combat traker is wonderful if you want to have a combat heavy hack-n-slash campaign and only makes combat more enjoyable.\n\nThe story design part of the game is great. You can pin combat encounters, NPCs, story elements, loot, exp, and more directly to the map. Experience can be awarded on command. Loot can be dumped into the party inventory automatically and the players can divide it themselves.\n\nCharacter creation is simple and easy. All of the math is again automated here. Just drag items to your inventory. Same with spells, but things get more complex if you multiclass, but its just part of the learning curve.\n\nSome will complain about connectivity issues. Port-forwarding is a simple thing to do, but VPN software can get around it. Mac -> PC does have some issues. I only have one Mac user in my games, but he has the majority of the technical issues. Tech support is very fast as well, but I've only had to use it once.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this software enough. I have had hours of use with it.\n","January 29, 2015","true","278.9"," 82 of 91 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","82","91","2","0"

I must admit I had some hard times figuring everything out in the beginning, mostly with parsing my homebrew. The good news is that as long as you play a supported system you need no parsing. The software does what it promisses and I like that there's no full automation as it allows me to change values and add my own houserules.\nI recomend ppl intrested in this software to not look at the guides at first (atleast for me it was confusing in the beginning) but instead look up ppl on twitch/youtube who use Fantasy Grounds, I would recomend looking at 5e or Savage Worlds campaigns.\nAlso take full advantage of the forum and meet the great community, there's alot of help, mods, extensions, tips and fun over there.\nFor me this software is simply the best software investment I've made in recent years and have become a necessity that I play around with even when I do not play a game. Just letting my fantasy flow and creating adventures or having a parsing session.","September 22, 2015","true","336.9"," 67 of 74 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","67","74","4","0"

WOW WHAT A STEAL! HHKKKKKhhhkkkjfjgggg :fmad: $$$$$$ remember to buy our special ruleset DLC, unless you want to invest significantly more time and effort than it would take to just homebrew something with actual pen and paper! boy do we love your nerd money!!! $$$$$$\n\nEDIT: since some people have, justifiably, called this a nerd rage review, allow me to expand, particularly upon 'well what ELSE does this and that?' and the greivances i have (this comes from my response to Smiteworks in the comments to this review). Roll20 does all of the things FG does, and does not come with a forty dollar pricetag. Roll20 does not ask for a pile of cash because Roll20 did not acquire meaningless licenses to things that players could have and would have created and distributed for absolutely free, and Roll20 did not slap a massive pricetag on it based on that. what if i don't want to just change spells and monsters? what if i want to have the All Flesh Must Be Eaten's Unisystem rules in place? i will have to MAKE it myself using the world's least user friendly formats- XML, LUA, as Smiteworks has stated- or wait for someone ELSE to do it- or for Smiteworks to release it as a fifteen dollar DLC. Roll20 instead hands all the tools and most importantly FLEXIBILITY i need to customize my campaign's rules right off the bat- i could have a standard 3.5 high fantasy game or AFMBE campaign on my own terms at my own whims. forgive me if this comes off as a cashgrab to me and i can't give it a serious review.","May 10, 2014","false","0.1"," 1,047 of 1,541 people (68%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","68","047","1","29","43"

As I started pricing it, it became obvious that the D&D components were priced the same as full priced retail manuals - since they come with the full text and in-game functional tables, this makes sense.\n\nOnce I saw it as a licensing issue and understood that this really was an electronically functional version of the game manuals, I was on-board - I wanted the real rules and the full text to be available to me.  Since none of my players had an FG license, I also elected to carry the burden and nabbed an ultimate license.\n\nOne thing that you will hear is that Fantasy Grounds has a learning curve.  This is true.  I was 12 hours in before I felt comfortable with it and it was another 12 hours before I realized that I could have done a better job on some things.  As time has gone on, I have realized that I want things structured a little differently to better facilitate online gaming - things that don't become clear until you are actually hosting a game.\n\nTo learn Fantasy Grounds, I recommend finding a PDF module that you want to use and then 'port' it as a module.  Create a campaign just for the module and start moving the text, creating encounters, and building parcels as needed.  There is a lot to learn, so use youtube and ask questions in forums when you get frustrated.\n\nAt the time of this writing, I've DMed a pair of 4 hour sessions via Fantasy Grounds and have had a blast.  My players are satisfied with the visual and rules assistance provided by FG and I am thrilled to be DMing my first campaign since 1989.  I anticipate putting over 1000 hours into this software and appreciate what it allows me to do.","January 24","true","377.5"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","62","69","0","0"

I like it so much, I actually use it during table-top D&D to show the maps, images, take notes and track hit points. As always, it's a huge amount of work for the Dungeon Master. I leared to use their PARSE tool so that I create my own add-on modules for the adventures with it's own creatures, items, token, and images. The game lets us focus on role playing and talking smack while it takes care of most of the tedius tracking stuff.\n\nIt's not the same as when I played with pen and paper in the same room with my friends 20 years ago, but now that we moved all over the country and all have families, this is the next best thing. I payed for the full DM license so that my friends all just need the free version.\n\nNow that AD&D 5E is available, this has gotten even better, since that's the rule set we're using.\n\nIt does not come with voice, so you do need a seperte voice server (like Mumble) to talk to each other.","April 17, 2015","true","464.2"," 56 of 60 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","56","60","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aliandris/recommended/252690/","aliandris","Aliandris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aliandris/","434 products in account","This is a really good program.  We've been using FG for over three years now to run Paizo's Kingmaker Campaign Path.  Several of us are in China with the rest of our players in North America, and combined with Hamachi (to get around the Great Firewall) and Skype (for the live talking part), it's as close to a face to face game as people who live on opposite sides of the planet can get.\n\nFantasy Grounds isn't always the easiest program to use, admittedly, but once you get over the learning curve it's an amazingly robust program.  As the GM, the ability to create (or in my case, input from the Campaign Book) the stories and fill them with handy links to maps, npcs, encounters, treasures, and everything else imaginable is incredible.  Even if I was running a face to face game I'd use FG just to organize my notes.  No more need to have reams of paper around or to flip through books.  Just click a link and the thing you need is right there, right away.  It also allows you to keep track of xp earned, separated into story rewards and combat rewards.  You can see what the players have received with just a quick glance.\n\nInsofar as Pathfinder is involved, it has loads of free modules to increase this functionality, with everything from a complete list of spells to abilities, magic items, and the entire collected bestiary (including monsters and NPC's from the adventure paths!), all one click away.  This means I'm free to use my planning time to improve on my campaign instead of flip through stuff looking for informaton.\n\nNot only is this a great virtual tabletop, it's a splendid GM tool.  My campaign would be worse if I didn't have all the organizational tools FG provides.\n\nThere might be other free programs out there, but nothing I've seen has the depth and robustness of FG.  Along with tremendous dev support, I can't recommend FG high enough.\n\nTL, DR; Great program, something of a learning curve.  Great for GM's, which is great for players.","October 4, 2014","true","305.4"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","53","64","2","2"

And when it works, it works very well.\n\nUnfortunately, "when it works" = not nearly consistently enough. My friends and I have been playing a 5th edition campaign using Fantasy Grounds and recently its been nothing but crashes to desktop CONSTANTLY. It seems to be a memory problem, where if Fantasy Grounds approaches using 4 GB of memory it shuts down.\n\nFirst, this program has NO business using that much memory - its just sloppy code. I can play Witcher 3 and NOT use that much memory.\n\nThe networking code is also atrocious. Absurdly long load times on connection to a campaign, lag rolling dice, etc. Its just not well done.\n\nI can't recommend this product to anyone. Our previous campaign, a 4th edition one, was run in Roll20, and we didn't have nearly the problems we do now using Fantasy Grounds. Fantasy Grounds is DEFINITELY more robust than R20, but that doesn't help when you can't use it due to stability and lag issues. Pity.

I think it is very important to realize that Fantasy Grounds by itself is not a full game - it is a tool and might be better fitting for the Software Section of Steam rather than the Games section.\n\nThere is a high learning curve to the game for a Game Master. It takes a few hours to get used to the rules sets, the various tools provided and all the little things you need to consider. Once you do spend these hours to familiarize yourself you have a powerful tool to handle campaigns, battle maps and characters.\n\nWe started playing Savage Worlds in Fantasy Grounds and are having a blast. As an experienced pen & paper player, I have to say that gameplay is actually sped up by the tools provided, allowing us more time to actually roleplay and less time discussing rules, piece positioning or anything else.\n\nIf you are willing to tackle the initial learning curve and understand that FG is more a tool than it is a game, I can highly recommend it to you. If you are expecting a highly interactive video game however, you might want to direct your attention towards Divinity: Original Sin or something similiar.","May 19, 2014","true","660.5"," 122 of 187 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","122","187","0","0"

I have gone through nearly every pay product and user creation that's hit the internet in that time. I would like to think that if there’s anyone that could compare the products available right now, it would be me. That being said, Fantasy Grounds is my client of choice. Let me give you a few reasons…\n\nRules Automation:\nIn other Virtual Tabletops (hereafter VTTs) when you roll the dice that’s the end of it. You have to go look up the AC of the target, check it vs. the roll, make sure if there is cover, or if the target is prone you add those in to see if you hit. There’s room for error and everyone is waiting on you to give them the result of the roll.\n\nIn Fantasy Grounds when you roll to hit, the program tells you immediately. You’re not waiting, there are no math errors, it’s immediate, it’s correct, and you’re on to the next turn. Faster rolls to hit, means more gaming, and more fun.\n\nSystem Libraries:\nAgain, in other VTTs you’re face down in your books or PDFs looking for what Burning Hands does. Did they save? How much damage does it do? Does your character even have it.\n\nIn Fantasy Grounds you know your character has it because it’s right there in the game on your in-game character sheet. You know its range because the in-game library you dragged it from included that information. It also included how much damage it does, what the save DC is, and how many times your character can cast it. In fact, if you include what I said above about Rules Automation, you can just click on it and it casts it on the enemy, tells you if they saved and then you can roll damage with again, just a click. Easy, Fast, and Accurate to the rules you are playing.\n\nProfessional Developers\nSome VTTs are community projects. Amateurs banding together to make a program. The energy is great when it's new and everyone has input and it feels great to be a part of it. But once things are done and it's out, someone needs to do the boring part and support it, answer nagging questions and be the guy that all the newbies turn to. This isn't nearly as fun as making the game, so some groups just don't do it, or turn it over to other users. It's also at this point that all those little bugs those users are telling you about need to be fixed. This is maintenance and its not fun either. People tend to let that go, and just run it with the problems and work around them. Worse yet, many VTTs are based on another platform they don't control, Java, or a web browser means some other software could be causing the problem with your game. Java, and The Browser makers don't care about your game problem, and the VTT makers will just say it's Java's fault... or it's your browsers fault, and shrug when you have a problem.\n\nFantasy Grounds is a professional team that stands by their product. They have an excellent bug testing procedure and plenty of people willing to run the betas before a patch comes out. The developers are given enough time to test thoroughly and they are good at debugging. Even the other pay to play VTTs have companies that just patch, patch, patch and end up with bug forums filled with customers with problems after every buggy patch. Fantasy Ground's patches are clean and professional. Also, Fantasy Grounds is stand-alone. Everything Fantasy Grounds needs to run is made and maintained by Smiteworks. There is no passing of the buck when you have a problem.\n\nMy Work is Mine:\nWhen I make map in some VTTs it becomes theirs. I have to keep paying subscription fees to keep that map… I MADE. This is unacceptable. It is my work, I should always have that available. If I make my own adventure. I should always be able to run it for my friends. It’s my creation, you can’t keep it from me just because I didn’t want to pay my subscription, again… (and again, and again)\n\nThe art, story text, tokens, and everything else in Fantasy Grounds is YOURS. It’s your creation, it’s your Intellectual Property (I.P.) and every law in most lands respects that. Did you know if you create a story you automatically have it copyrighted? It’s yours it came from your imaginative brain. You own it. Fantasy Grounds respects that, other VTTs don’t and hold your creations ransom for more subscription payments. With Fantasy Grounds you’ll ALWAYS have access to your creations.\n\nI Control My Wallet!:\nYou should decide when you want a new feature, you should decide when you want a new ruleset, or adventure, or art pack, YOU! There should be no subscription. You shouldn't have some company reaching into your wallet every month controlling your finances. You shouldn't have to tell your group that the game is on hold this month because you got a new credit card and there was a problem with moving your subscription over to the new card. Don’t you have enough subscriptions as it is? TV, Internet? Phone? MMOs? Now even single-player computer games are getting in on this? Enough is enough with the subscriptions!\n\nWith Fantasy Grounds whatever you buy, you can use in perpetuity. There will be no recurring fees to continue to use what you already paid for. Nobody will be reaching into your wallet deciding when you need to pay them money. That is entirely up to you. For example, if I had bought another web-based VTT that charges subscriptions back when I bought Fantasy Grounds in 2006, I would currently be $960 in the hole with them, and if I ever stopped paying them, all my work would be gone.\n\nConclusion\n$40 (on sale now for $30) for a lifetime of gaming fun isn’t such a bad deal after all, is it? Free yourself from fees, pick Fantasy Grounds run the fastest, most professionally made game and say no to VTT companies digging around in your bank account every month.","May 13, 2014","true","53.3"," 189 of 310 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","189","310","0","9"

During that time I've played with dozens of people from all over the world and even managed to reunite with my old group from the 90's. It does have a learning curve especially if you're the GM but over the years a large amount of tutorial videos and manuals have been released by the community so you will become a pro in no time.\n\nThis software never ceases to amaze me! You get everything you need that you would use in real life except voice chat and SFX of soda bottles opening and snack bags crumpling. And that without the need to toggle back and forth between windows. Some rulesets will offer the books in the library. You get free beautiful tokens/miniatures too! As for maps, you can use any jpeg/png image you want, character sheet are automated so no need to create custom macros (even though the option is there for you to create macros and conveniently drop them in your hotkey bars). Prep time for the GM is cut down by using reference modules, just drag and drop what you need on the map and combat tracker! You can organize your campaign however way you want.\n\nEverybody on the official forum is very helpful and if you have a problem someone will rise up to help you fix it. People are creating free custom content every week, they work hard at it because they are passionate and we are so grateful for their work.\n\nWhether you're new to the hobby or an old timer like me looking to rekindle your passion for the hobby you will find what you need with this software. What's $40/$150 for a game you will play for years and pour countless hours into? Some of you probably spend $60-$80 on a game you'll play for less than 60 hours.","May 17, 2014","true","511.1"," 105 of 171 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","105","171","0","0"

I have previously been using another VTT to GM our Kingmaker campaign however I advised my players we would be migrating to FG at the beginning of chapter 2 to see how FG compares to the other VTT.\n\nSo - How did it go?\n\nAs a GM I have been impacted by the learning curve somewhat, but not to the point of giving up. The issues I have had learning FG were similar in scope to the learning curve for the previous VTT.\n\nI did not have the chance to test out combat before our session kicked off, so it was fairly slow to start. Again, the time taken for our first combat was comparable to our first combat in the old VTT.\n\nThere were a couple of hiccups at my end due to inexperience. At one point i selected monsters from the bestiary and dropped them on the map, but could not work out how to then get them to the combat tracker. Ended up deleting the tokens, adding the monsters to the combat tracker first, THEN dragging the icons from the combat tracker on to the map. This was for an encounter  I had not prepared earlier, so I am keen to see how the pre-loaded encounters I have input work in actual play.\n\nSpells work very differently to our old VTT. In the old VTT we did not trust the spell system at all and most of the spell stuff was handled manually. What a pleasure it was to have FG manage all the heavy lifting for us with regards to the spells and associated effects.\n\nSpeaking of effects - I think i need more help here. Perhaps I was doing it wrong, but things like Barkskin (Copy pasted from the FG forums here[www.fantasygrounds.com]) did not appear to affect the characters AC. Some of the included effects did appear to work as intended.\n\nMaps worked well except for 3 issues:\n\n1) Could not work out how to have FG measure player movement during combat (IE - manage how far characters are allowed to move each round). Not sure if there is a way to do this.\n\n2) At one point the map zoomed right in to one area for the PLAYERS only and they could not zoom out. Tried to sync view, re-share etc. In the end I closed the map and re-opened it and that seemed to fix the issue.\n\n3) Seemed that any player could move anyone else's tokens. Is there a way to restrict movement of tokens only to the player who 'owns' the character and the GM? (edit - apparently there is - according to the forums)\n\nLibraries took a few minutes to sync (the first time), but hopefully this wont happen every session.\n\nSo - the bottom line:\n(TL;DR)\n\nMy players LOVED IT. Absolutely no question we will be sticking with FG from now on. I took a big chance buying the ultimate licence, but after last night I have NO REGRETS.\n\nThankyou Smiteworks for this great product. Keep up the good work!","January 15","true","35.4"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

I absolutely love working with Fantasy Grounds.  Having looked at other competing products, nothing came close to packaging everything for the particular ruleset I was using all in one PLUS still allowed me full free form editing when needed.  Being able to add in library modules of rules, including spells and equipment, that you can simply drag onto your character sheet and have it automatically populate the stats is so convenient!  A player doesn't have to remember how things work or worry about making sure the right saves / resists are applied, etc.  It's all automatic!\n\nThere have been continual improvements to the product since I began using it which greater and greater features added each time.  Full table support for designing random search and loot tables or anything else you want to roll randomly is such a help.  One of the best things is the combat tracker which can link to your "map" image that you are using for moving tokens around.  It keeps track of current initiative order, heath and conditions affecting each entity, quick look at weapons being used or saving throw values, and can be used for quick targetting for players wanting to drag attack dice directly onto the monster entry.  You can show/hide entries on the combat tracker which when linked to their token on the "map" image lets the DM setup surprise encounters that players can't see until you spring it.\n\nThere are so many things that make using Fantasy Grounds the closest thing to being around the physical table in my mind that it makes gaming feel like "the old days" again.  With the official D&D license from WotC, it has allowed Smiteworks to enhance their product by releasing official 5E products for use directly within Fantasy Grounds.  While none of these are needed to play a 5E game, you are always free to add data in by hand from your hard cover books, it does help streamline game play by saving you the time of entry letting you just drag and drop and the products are very well done.\n\nThank you Smiteworks for letting me recapture the passion for fantasy gaming that I grew up with!","April 11, 2015","true","77.2"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","0"

As a DM you can spend quite a lot on this software so that your players, and you, have access to all the monsters, maps, and PHB in-game but for the DM on a budget: you can add in your own NPCs and such manually without having to make the purchases...it'll just cost you time.\n\nWhile it did take time to learn how to use all the tools at my disposal, with a positive group it doesn't make it too rough. I never really had a point where we had to stop the game (for an extended period) to figure out how to accomplish something mechanical, and adding new loot, encounters, and challenges works well on the grid overlay for your maps.

You got together with your friends, some pizza, soda, snacks, and a saturday night in a basement. Staying up all night, throwing dice, stepping on miniatures and arguing over rules of the game. As time goes on,  you grow apart from your friends and move to different parts of the world, still missing those Saturday nights rescueing the princess and slaying the dragon. But it's hard to get together. Miles might separate you and family tends to get in the way of such things. Also, where did your wife put the dice? There is a 5th edition now, what happened to 2nd?\n\nWith Fantasy Grounds, you can have all of your rules, even play the ones you are familiar with and once you find a few hours with your friends, play in the comfort of your own home. My friends and I could never get together to play, but with Fantasy Grounds, we set aside half a day everyother week and recapture our youth. And the program keeps everything so organized and user friendly, not to mention Smiteworks has some of the most efficient and nicest costumer service I have ever seen.\n\nI highly recommend this program, even if you have never played table top games before. This would get you playing right away, so if you are curious to how we did mmorpg in the 80's, this is the program for you.

The automation makes combat flow more quickly, modules can be created and shared, features for maps, pooled resources, movement, area of effect, etc., all work quite well.\n\nThere are free options such as the RPTools suite, but such tools are clumsy, kludgy, prone to breaking, and lack a lot of features. Fantasy Grounds has everything you need in one single application.\n\nThere's only a few drawbacks:\n1. The learning curve. You need to spend time with the software to understand how it works. For most people familiar with pen and paper RPGs, spending some time learning isn't a big deal.\n\n2. No automated fog of war or light sources. Areas of the map must be revealed manually by the game master. MapTool from RPTools does this, and it would be a great additional feature for FG in the future.\n\n3. The built-in rule sets (3.5, PathFinder, 4.0, etc.) work very well, but if you want to customize the rule set or, god forbid, build your own, expect to spend days and weeks mucking about undocumented blobs of XML and Lua. It's a MESS, and even trivial changes can be difficult to implement. I say this as a professional software developer! FG's documentation in this area is appalingly bad.\n\n4. Like ANY computer software for running RPGs, GMs with a spontaneous style may feel a bit stifled and limited by the tools.\n\nOverall though, Fantasy Grounds is the best of breed for this type of software. If your gaming group is spread far and wide you should definitely give this a try!\n\nA hint: Buy your licenses in bulk from the official website.

This is basically your tiles, dice, character sheets, table systems and more for whatever price that it has listed. Granted for the casual player it may seem like a lot, and for people on steam used to 40 prices only on big AAA games it will seem expensive. For those of us who have spent hundreds of dollars on dice, books, tables, tiles, compendium ect. This is very very cheap. It takes some getting used to and it I'm not saying they couldn't be nice and add some sort of tutorial game that adds popups every 5 seconds to tell you how to do things what I am saying is that this software will make your gaming experience much easier if you can't actually play in person. Nothing will every replace playing in person but this does come extremely close to doing just that. So I recommend buying it if you're seriously going to get a few friends together and try to play an adventure together. If you are looking for the free route that restricts you to what you can do Roll20 is for you I personally didn't like how it crashed every other hour but to each his or her own. IF you look and see that I haven't played this much thats because I was using it long before it came to steam and just recently found that it had come here. I'm looking forward to many years of fun and hopefully a steam workshop for people to use with this game\n","May 15, 2014","true","7.3"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","29","49","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/valarian-imk/recommended/252690/","valarian-imk","Valarian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/valarian-imk/","19 products in account","I have used Fantasy Grounds to run games for more than 7 years now. For me, this product is the best on the market. Why? Because it gives me my two most fundamental requirements in a Virtual Tabletop. It allows me to create a campaign quickly, and it concentrates on the character sheet. The focus on the story and the characters (PC & NPC) is what makes this such a great tool for roleplaying games. All too often, in the VTT market, the focus is on the map - to the detriment of everything else. If you're lucky, the tool will offer a few token attributes to put your most common skills in to. With Fantasy Grounds, a new blank character sheet awaits a couple of mouse clicks. I have tried most, if not all, of the competition but Ikeep coming back to Fantasy Grounds. Not one has beaten it yet.\n\nOther reviewers have commented in the UI experience. To me, this is one of the great things about Fantasy Grounds. The UI gives quick access to the features without being intrusive. It's not a standard windows interface, and there is therefore a learning curve. The combination of click to select and the right-click radial menu means that you have the funtionality at your fingertips, literally. No having to go to menus, toolbars or ribbons stuck on one edge of the screen. The UI works the same whether you are using a PC or a Mac - another rarity. To new players and GMs I say this, if in doubt right-click. The radial menu adjusts to the context of where you are clicking.\n\nOn the cost. The product is a mature commercial product, with one full time developer and one part time. They support and enhance the software with regular updates - not one of which have I been charged for in seven years. In that time, I've moved from their full license to an ultimate license. Not because I needed to, but because I wanted to support the developers and bring new people in to the games I was running - through demo games and also offering slots in my regular games. The cost is reasonable, $24 for a player license and $40 for a GM lcense. Compare these one-off costs to game books. The GM license is the cost to a single corebook, the player license the cost of a sourcebook.\n\nThere are free offerings, and those that seem free to start with but aren't. Some do the maps thing better. None do the campaign management and characters better - they don't even come close. If those free or subscription services offerings work for you, all well and good. For me, this is the product people have to beat for me to move. Give me everything Fantasy Grounds does and I might consider them as a product. Cover those two basic fundamentals of story and character before I will even consider that product as a rival.\n\nOn the community. The Fantasy Grounds community is the best online community I have had the pleasure to be a part of. They are friendly, supportive of new guys, and they offer advice freely. They have developed community rulesets to support a wide range of games. They have produced tutorials and videos to help new players and GMs get started. All in all, a bunch of really good people.","May 24, 2014","true","203.3"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","21","34","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Razzeyspace/recommended/252690/","Razzeyspace","Razzey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Razzeyspace/","94 products in account","Pros:\nFantasy Grounds contains the basic portion of everything you want this type of product to have.\n\nCons:\nThe core/basic version is very limited.  You get the core.  Just enough to make basic functions work\nThe system is extremely clunky and frustrating.  If I could make that any more bold, I would.  Simply navigating the maps is counter intuitive to how modern technology works.  It feels as if someone took a Windows 95 program and tried to polish it up to make it "Working."\nAny additional content upgrades are extremely expensive:\nThe "Ultimate" or "Ultimate Upgrade" (if you already have Core) starts at $115 for few additional features\nEach module is nearly, if not more expensive than the official product\n\nHonestly, if this was reasonably priced, I would probably recommend it, just because, in theory, it has everything right there.  But considering that there are online websites that provide almost all of these features for free, it's absurd.\n\nI sincerely want to like this product, but get angry every time I use it.  It just barely works.  Once you get started, it's usually alright, but again, navigating the maps, zooming, moving tokens, using tools, drawing, erasing,  all  of those features are clunky, at best.  I hate saying it, because I love supporting those who try to make a living doing what they love, stuff like this.  I just can't support this.  I use it, because I already purchased it, but I'd not recommend it to anyone else.\n\n\n\n@damned (since I can't make a post this long, and the information might be helpful to others, I'm posting it up here)\n\nHey there!  I'm sure there are a few tips or tricks to help a couple different things out, but honestly, I have two main complaints.  And maybe I should elaborate a little bit on them.\n\n1) The price gouging is extreme.  Why does this bother me so much?  Maybe these devs put their lives into this and this is how they make money, why should they be denied their income?  These are very valid questions.  I feel that for certain communities, such as D&D, Pathfinder, Tabletop games, board games, things like that, things that are centered around gathering your friends together and enjoying an experience that is completely unique, things that I hold dear, good publishing work, or good development material is rare.  I feel that it's extremely important to support these devs and publishers because without our support, how can they dedicate the time required to truly polish something that we're going to spend hours with our friends?  They can't, so we have to support them in some way or other.\n\nIf you look at Paizo's model, most of their stuff is flat out free.  Obviously, they have stuff that you can add on, but the game itself is absolutely free.  All the information is available on Paizo.com or on d20.  But, because of this, it draws people in, and they see it's (generally) a kind community, full of helpful people and devs.  This is the kind of people I will support, and frankly, enjoy supporting.\n\nFantasy Ground's model is price gouging.  They get you started on a "Core" version, which is exactly what it says it is.  It's the core.  Completely playable, but with few bonuses or perks.  $115 for an upgrade, or $149 for the ultimate without the core, is absurd.  Okay, so maybe it's not the worst thing in the world to have expensive pieces.  But, before I consede that, there's a caveat to this, which leads me to my second main complaint.\n\n2) It would be one thing if the game and all of it's addons were inexpensive.  Given they're not, I absolutely expect (if not demand?) a polished, complete, modern software system.  It is far from it.  Every time myself, or my wife go to play, we find something else annoying about this program.  Yes, there are "Tips and Tricks."  Good software does not require either of those.  It's free from it because it works extremely well from the start.  Take PCGen.  It's great software, it has a lot of minor issues.  It's also 100% free.  For everything.  Is the fact that it's built from Java annoying?  A tiny bit.  But I absolutely can't complain much because it's free. And, it offers quite a lot.\n\nTo elaborate on what I don't like about this software:\n\nIt has *almost everything* I actually want in this system.  But it's done so poorly, that time is taken from sessions just to get the stupid thing to work.  Want to move the map around?  You have a tiny piece in the bottom right corner, and holding that is the only way to move the visible map.  Want to zoom in and out?  Use the scroll wheel, at least until it starts moving the map for you, unwantedly.  Want to move a token?  Better hope that some of the tokens aren't overlapping, or you're going to have to move the top one out of the way, grab the second, then move the first back into place again.\n\nAlso frustrating is *how* the options for drawing, erasing, adding effects (cones and such), and removing those work.  It's just slow, painful and not for the faint of heart.  the program is full of stuff like this, where it just feels like, "Yes, this idea, pure brilliance.  Execution?  Absolutely terrible."\n\nI honestly feel like it's worse than a poorly done Square Enix port of a playstation game onto Windows.  They can brighten up the graphics, they can polish here and there (because fantasy grounds is by no means ugly at all.  It has quite a nice look to it).  But the *mechanics* are so terrible.\n\nA side complaint I personally experienced, but to know, I may have been going about it incorrectly, was a situation where I had two computers trying to connect to a third host inside my own house.  Not all modems have the capability of setting more than one Port Forwarding to the same IP address.  Now, I know most of you will just say, "That's your fault for having such a crappy modem!"  This is only partially true.  While I absolutely agree and often pay more for better internet and equipment (I'm in Networking, so I like this kind of stuff), if my ISP only has one option, and this ISP is the ONLY option in my current area, and is in a foreign country temporarily, there's just a limit to what one can do sometimes.  I tried adding a router, and setting it up.  I tried going through another computer, which distributed it's IP as the host, to no avail.  Could only get one to work, and not the other.  Like I said, I could have done something wrong, and probably was, but I only have so much time to research and troubleshoot before my guests have wasted a couple hours waiting for a session to start.  "You only had to do this and this!"  Yeah, I get it, but you know what?  I didn't know it, and I don't always have an hour or two to find that resource to tell me exactly what it is.\n\nAll in all,\n\nI really, *really* want to like this product.  Every time I go to use it, I'm conflicted.  It has great options, and great content, even in Core.  But, it's just done so poorly that I can barely stand it.","May 15","false","34.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Other reviewers are correct in that if you do not have a group of people to play games with online prior to purchasing this tool, buyer beware.  The learning curve seems to be pretty steep.  I say "seems to be" because I have yet to actually play the game that I bought the software for.  What the "promos" don't tell you is that you have to go on the fantasy grounds forums, game calendars, and schedules, and "sell" yourself as a player to the groups that may or may not have a spot for you in their group.  There is a lack of DMs, and hundreds of players looking to game.  If you can't get into a game, the official "response" on the forums is "have patience, keep trying, play another game besides 5E, or 'what's keeping you from being a DM yourself?'"  When a person has seen this response a number of times all over the forums it is highly discouraging.  I am new to 5E as well, and don't have the confidence to DM myself.\n\nA typical example of the "game calendar" would be a 5E group that has 4 players currently, looking for 2 more, with 20 or more "applicants" vying for position to play in this group.  Sounds like applying for a job to me, and this is what I dumped 2 "A-list" games worth of cash into to "not" play.","February 28","false","15.0"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","1"

I did get the program before it was offered on Steam and I can say that it's a solid program, filled with delightful surprises that do make running a game on the internet fairly easy.\n\nIt's also a fairly old program, and yes, Roll20 and others of it's kind that have come out since do, as of this writing, have a few features that this does not, as well as an obvious price advantage. However there are still many features in FG2 which are superior (it's vast cache of OGL content and manipulation of same are second to none), and more importantly, Smiteworks has a great reputation for continually updating this product and offering those updates free to charge to current owners.\nThere's also a community of fellow gamers eager to take you into the fold - how many other programs out there have a matchmaking system that can get you into new games and make you new friends?\n\nAnyway, my point is, this program is one of the staples of the online tabletop world, so I strongly recommend at least getting the demo and learning the basics with someone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callahan09/recommended/252690/","callahan09","callahan09","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callahan09/","657 products in account","Fantasy Grounds is a very high-learning curve virtual tabletop with a ton of versatility and the ability to really play just about any tabletop RPG you can think of with a little effort.  Some rulesets are built-in for free, such as D&D 3.5/Pathfinder, D&D 4th Edition, and of course D&D 5th Edition.  Other rulesets (such as Call of Cthulhu; Savage Worlds; or Castles & Crusades) are available for separate purchase.  Anything you can think of can really be created manually, if you don't want to spend the money or if it hasn't already been created & distributed for free on the community forums over at fantasygrounds.com.\n\nThe interface for the program is very friendly if you've got a mouse attached to your PC, not quite as intuitive if you are trying to use a touchpad or something.  So while I usually don't have a mouse attached to my laptop, I definitely go out of my way to attach one when using Fantasy Grounds.  There are lots of functions in the software that will take some tutorials to understand and get used to, but once you've devoted a couple of hours play-time to the software you'll be able to control it second-nature and it's all pretty intuitive once you get used to it.\n\nThe ability to buy official add-ons from publishers seems like a bad thing to some people, because they see the add-on content adds up to over $2000 worth of stuff if you buy it all, but don't be dismayed, it's really an illusion.  None of it is necessary!  If you buy just the base software, you get access to the full Pathfinder & D&D 5e rulesets, which are the two most commonly played roleplaying systems today.  Both include official SRD content so with no additional purchase you will have access to a decent variety of character race & class options with lots of spells available for the spellcasting classes, and tons of monsters available for you to build an encounter if you're a GM.  You can then build your campaign, your story, your encounters, etc. and import any maps you might download for free on the internet or even that you may have created yourself .  So you can really play a full campaign without buying a single add-on.\n\nAdd-on modules just take all the work out of it for the GM.  It basically eliminates prep-time.  You get encounters pre-built, non-SRD monsters & NPCs are included already, maps are included, treasure parcels, story-items, it's all built into the module and very easy and fast for the GM to run.  If you want to spend the money on this functionality, you can do so and save yourself some time & effort.  If you want to save the money and you already have that same module in PDF form or in printed form, you can still run it in Fantasy Grounds without buying the Fantasy Grounds module.  Of course this must be possible, because Fantasy Grounds is set up to allow you to play any homebrew campaign you can dream up, with any characters you can imagine, any NPCs, monsters, items, etc.  You can customize it completely to allow you to do things that no pre-built or sold package can accomodate!  It just takes a little knowledge of the system.  The Fantasy Grounds community forums are great for helping people learn how to do this stuff.  They are very helpful over there and respond quickly (usually).\n\nOther add-ons like the $50 Core Class Pack for D&D 5e are also no TRULY necessary.  If you have the PHB in print, you can create those characters in Fantasy Grounds without having the Core Class Pack, it just takes some extra effort, some extra typing on your part, and a little extra in-depth knowledge of how to set up spell effects &things like that, but it's a very powerful & versatile program that lets you do it if you just invest the time.  For those more interested in paying some money instead of time and effort, then you can buy the class pack to save time, letting you create non-SRD character options by dragging & dropping.\n\nThat's the key to Fantasy Grounds.  You can do anything with it with a little time and effort, or with a little cash to buy somebody else's efforts and import it into your game rather than you doing it all yourself.\n\nSo with Fantasy Grounds, you get a very robust, powerful, versatile virtual tabletop that is expandable and customizable depending on your time/effort/cash preferences.  It is stable and fast.  And it automates a great deal of running the game.  It's very easy for new players to learn to play with Fantasy Grounds.  The GM has a lot more to learn, but players can just basically follow the lead as they click through the mostly intuitive interface to play the game.  Depending on the rule system you're playing, there could be more or less automation and drag & drop ability for running the game and managing characters.  D&D 5e is currently, in my opinion and with my limited experience with other rulesets, by far the best ruleset to play in Fantasy Grounds, it is the most automated and has the most drag & droppability.  It's very easy for new players to learn Fantasy Grounds and to learn D&D 5e in general when using Fantasy Grounds with the 5e ruleset.\n\nThe best part is that you can use this software either to manage your in-person roleplaying sessions and keep track of campaign & characters.  Or you can use it to play with distant friends that you don't get to see in person enough to play.  Or if you don't even know anybody who wants to play RPGs, but you yourself are interested, well of course you can go over to the Fantasy Grounds forums and find a group to play with online!","May 16","true","84.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

When I commented to the developers about it, they offered a couple of work-arounds that I in my tech-ignorance, felt uncomfortable attempting on my own, but they assured me they were working on an update with an official fix and would get that up and running asap. This took only a few days, and I feel as though the developers were earnestly working to fix the problem my OS update broke in a program that was working fine previous to the update, and feel comfortable strongly recommending this excellent tool.\n\nOh, and did I mention they got the official 5e D&D liscence, and that the official campaigns are AMAZING? I didn't? Well they are, and extreamly easy to use once you have familiarized yourself with how to do everything. I strongly encourage new users to go to the official YouTube page and watch the videos on how to run it.\n\nThe official adventures and campaigns available at the Fantasy Grounds store are stunning in how easy they make DM'ing, as well as providing a wealth of background information on the people, monsters and places of the area involved, and additional races, equipment, spells, maps, tokens, pictures and on, and on, and on, and when if you run out of officiall adventures and campaigns, there are numerous 5e compatable, 3rd party adventures, and all of that is before you even touch the pleathora of fan made stuff!\n\nNot as impressed with 5e D&D as I am, but just got done reading the latest adventures of Harry Dresdin and dying to visit his Chicago office? Or perhaps you want to track down the cultists of the Aincient Ones and discover the things that man was never meant to know? Fantasy Grounds comes with the Fate Core rules...and Call of Cthulhu...and 3.5...and Pathfinder...and their own core RPG system...and so much more, and they just keep working to improve it!\n\nBut don't take my word for it, check out some of the videos at their official YouTube page, or watch any of the numerous videos of groups playing, using fantasy grounds and various voice/video chat programs.\n\nI give it 8 out of 10 stars, and might bump that up to a 9 of 10 if the interface were a bit more polished and the curser cleaned up to be a bit more accurate at clicking the items I'm trying to choose. I don't know if this is specific to the winskin wrapped mac version, or if this is cross platform, and after a bit of frustration getting used to it, this minor glitch is easily overlooked.\n\nIt works mac-to-pc and vice versa without a hitch, to boot!","January 28","true","260.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But if you spend a few hours tinkering and watching the tutorials available you overcome it quickly. Also, as with everything nowadays, check youtube, and watch some of the content and how-tos there. They're an excellent step by step resource. Also the developers on Steam are quick to respond and really take the time to answer every question and lend a hand. Probably best support team for a game I've run across.\n\nWhile I use it for playing Pathfinder it supports a variety of RPG's and allows for homebrew rules in all of them. I haven't decided if I like that the rulesets aren't binding. If a level 1 Fighter is only supposed to have 1D10 + con for hitpoints he can still write 50 in the block and the program allows for it. Really all that means is that the GM needs to look over every character to make sure there aren't any mistakes. Which is the same thing you have to do sitting around the table. Also, as far as I can tell there is no way for casters to memorize their spells. So they need to be tracked manually, which is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ for the GM, but also no different then if you were sitting around the table and started wondering why your level 5 wizard says he's going to cast his 4th fireball of the night.\n\nSomething I love from both a Player and GM standpoint is the language options. If you're characters speak Orc or Giant and they have to negotiate with these creatures the GM can set his language settings to the appropriate language and type in the game and it will come out in that language. The player(s) that speak that language will also see it in their program language (ie English, or French) finally making them useful. It adds a lot of depth to negoitations and allows the player to really feel the knowledge means something. It is interesting (and often amusing) to see how one player or another diseminates information to the rest of the party. OR in one case totally screws his companion, doing him a favour and haggling the price of a suit of amour from a Dwarven blacksmith my bard decided to pay back the fighter for a precieved slight buy not dropping the price as far as he could have.\n\nFantasy Grounds is an excellent resource for those looking for a virtual Table Top. Again, there is a very steep inital learning curve, but by watching the tutorials and (even more important) some of the youtube content and how-tos available you can overcome it fairly quickly. Once you get the feel for it everything really flows. I haven't found another program that does everything Fantasy Grounds does as well as it does. There are tons of things you can do once you figure out the nuances. Granted, that does take some time on the part of the user. But I don't know any GM's that do homebrew campaigns that aren't willing to put in the time.\n\nUltimately the the major drawback to Fantasy Grounds is the cost. While you can get your games created manually imputting everything this takes an exorbiant amount of time on the part of the GM. To have access to everything for your particular RPG it is very expensive. Granted it's not as expensive as buying the hardcopies, but it not cheap either. Especially when you consider that the content your given doesn't give you the same as what you'd see in the books. I don't see any reason why the program couldn't come with an assortment of tile sets already available in the program. There are ways around buying tilesets but like finding them and imputing them takes a lot of time.\n\nPros:\nOutstanding Support\nAmazing customization options\nImport all sorts of content, PDF's, JPEGs, Word Docs\nLanguage options\n\nCons:\nCost\nInterface\nNot particularly user friendly or intuitive","January 29","true","27.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Now if they can't make it to the locations they can always join in through Discord or Skype, and we can still run the game as if the person was here.\n\nI've been running some Call of Cthulhu (6th Edition) sessions, and while we've had some hiccups in the start - I'm fairly certain we've found the issues thanks to the FG forum. All in all it's been some rather enjoyable sessions for me as a GM, but also for the players. Sure the CoC ruleset might not be as fancy as the D&D one, but it works very well nevertheless.\n\nAll in all I couldn't be happier with it. It's a steep learning curve though, but it helps to visit their Wiki page and read up on some things. They've also made a lot of tutorial videos and such which are quite nice.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this to anyone interested in tabletop RPG.","April 14","true","150.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After 1.5 months, we got thru most of the Lost Mines of Phandelver. Every night the game would lag and stall and all of the players would have to refresh multliple times an hour. As the DM, I used two monitors and just alternating reloading them to try to keep the game going. I dont know how much of this was due to the API scripts that the Sub was using, but he assured me that it was typical. I tried all 3 major browsers (chrome and foxfire worked the "best"). This really put me off Roll20.\nSo I looked elsewhere and found Fantasy Grounds, we have used it several times now and it has worked very smoothly. Just like Roll20, the learning curve is the steep, but I highly recommended this software as a gaming platform. Once you enter your weapons it auto applys damage, keeps track of effects, and provides a stable platform to game on. You also have the option of spending a little cash and getting the entire module preentered and ready to go.\nThe one big drawback is it doesnt support dynamic lightning like Roll20. Personally, I dont like dynamic lightning. I think it makes the game feel claustrophobic. Others like it though so that might be a deal breaker for you.","January 3","true","50.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomties/recommended/252690/","doomties","Memnon the Mighty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomties/","930 products in account","Fantasy Grounds is not for everyone. If you are one of the pathetic flesh bags that require everything a game is capable of be handed to you on a silver platter, then do not acquire this game, or even Elder Scrolls (let's face it, Steam Workshop is nice, but if you want the good stuff, you have to go elsewhere).\n\nThe Good:\nIf you get this Virtual Table Top program (henceforth VTT), then be sure to use it with rules sets, as that is where you'll get the most photon blast for your buck. The built in character sheets, the rules sets with drag and drop features, one-click-and-you're-done functionality, it can turn a game session that might drag on in a normal VTT, into a rapid paced session with combats flying by faster than they might in a face to face game. Savage Worlds is an RPG system that banks on being Fast, Furious, and Fun, but in VTT it can drag on if you don't have a working knowlege of macros, or just don't have the time. With Fantasy Grounds, it can be all right there, and a little game prep goes a long way.\n\nThere are also a number of free rules sets. Do you play Pathfinder? Well, they weren't able to strike a deal to allow FG to sell paizo products through its store, but they were able to take advantage of the game license to provide the Pathfinder Rules Sets for free. If you dig around the forums, you can even find updates that include books beyond the core rules, such as Ultimate Combat, or Advanced Players Guide. What about AD&D fans out there? Well, OSRIC is free as well. There are a number of sets you can pick up that give you a fan made theme, as well as a character sheet and appropriate NPC/Vehicle sheets, which, while not an entire rules set, goes a long way in making FG work for you. So if you get it, do yourself a favor, look over the website and see what you can scavange.\n\nI currently use this program for Pathfinder, Mutants and Masterminds, and Savage Worlds. I would use no other if I had the choice. However, if you want to get the most out of it, a trip to their website to look at tutorials is almost required.\n\nThe Meh:\nConnecting to a game can be a pain in the power core. I've opened their magic port and had nothing work, more times than I care to, and there are few things more frustrating than finally having a session start on time, only to be stalled as two of your players cannot connect. If you have a head for networking on these primitive Earth systems, then I imagine it's less of a pain.\n\nWithout the use of rulessets, this program becomes little more than an over priced virtual dice roller with incredibly limited mapping capabilities, and some organizational elements. In short, you're better off with Map Tool or Roll20.\n\nThe Ugly:\nVirtal Tabletops are usually designed for their functions, not for their Intuitive UI, some things just don't make sense, thankfully, they have quite a few video tutorials on their website that can get you running a game fairly quickly.\n\nThe price counters a lot of the good qualities of this program. I paid for the ultimate license, which cost me the soul of my first born. Considering I didn't want the little brat growing up to challenge my power, it was fine for me, but those of you burdened and weakened by 'morals' might consider otherwise.\n\nMicro Transactions galore! If you hate that, you'll hate this program, as you'll purchase it and then realize you need to fork over more money for your favorite rules set. It's not required, sure, but if you want to use the program the way it is advertised, then it certainly is. I spent over $60 just so I could run Sundered Skies, despite owning all of their books in the first place.\n\nLike house rules? Well screw you! Adding or modifying rules is not for the feint of heart, or those who disdain working with the computational equivalent of simple machines.\n\nThe financial weight of this game is on the GM. Period. In my case, this is fine, I run the games, none of my players have to pay a dime to participate, and they get access to all of my rules sets when they join the game. However, unlike a face to face game, a player can't show up, hand the GM a rule book for a system he may not own yet, and have it applied to the game.\n\nConclusion: I recommend it, if you have the money for it, and if you plan on using it a lot. Otherwise, stick to the free or the cheaper VTT's. Though I will say, when you have the rules set for your favorite system, then there is no better VTT out there.","May 26, 2014","true","202.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","10","18","2","0"

I'd basically resigned myself to going without playing online.\n\nFantasy Grounds caught my attention since it was just uploaded to Steam here, and it has succeeded in turning things around for me.  Edge of the Empire support is enabled through a custom, user-created ruleset (free!) that continues to be updated and is rather well-organised.  Its creator is also in the process of making a video tutorial series for it.  Through a combination of his first tutorial video, a read-through of the ruleset's functions on its forum page, and an afternoon of playing around and experimenting by myself, I was able to learn the entire system & host a short session today (bought it yesterday night after learning on the demo version).\n\nOverall, it's VERY fun, very pretty, and the extensive amount of features designed to keep everything organised is exactly what I was looking for in a virtual tabletop for Star Wars.

(atleast to my knowledge)\n-You make the rules.\n-Trackers for so many things, like combat, HP, wounds, and loads of other stuff.\n-Very easy to get into (you might need some port forwarding)\n-Easy to join/leave lobbys.\n-After each session you type in \"/save\" in the chat, and it saves everything everytime.\n-Never experienced crashes of any kind.\n\nCons:\n- Fantasy Grounds simply does not work with the steam overlay. (Shift+Tab) and should be deactivated.\n- If you dont know your way around D&D or similar games, this might be tricky to get into.\n- Many features and ingame options seems to be somewhat difficult to actually get to, without digging.\n(by that i mean, some features are kinda hidden within other features and options. - Everything is in the game, you do not lose out on content, but some of the things, to me, was a bit weird to find.\n- Too expensive. The retail copy sells for €36.99, which is way more than this application is actually worth. Dont get me wrong, i absolutely love it, but no matter how awesome you make books look on a screen, its not worth €37.\n- As mentioned above, the port forwarding CAN be an issue. Not everyone is experiencing it. What this means, is that your router and/or internet provider does not support certain ports, in this case \"1802\" in Fantasy Grounds, and you need to manually make an exception for fantasy grounds. This can be done pretty easily. google it.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThis game is so much fun, and despite it having a few things here and there i\'d like changed, its easy to live with.\nI have grown to love this game, and using my imagination with this game is absolutely amazing.\nI would 100% 10/10 recommend this to ANYONE who have the slightest interest in D&D and the like.","June 1","true","112.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That was a tough choice to make. This program is a very mixed bag, some wonderful things in here that are blended together with some horrible design decisions.\n\nContext: I use this program as a face-to-face tool for my gaming group, no outside connections. So this review will ignore any feature dealing with that. Also, will not be comparing this to any competitors. My setup is a dual screen PC, with two instances of the program open. One (GM) on my monitor and the  second (Player) on a TV laying flat. Players are using miniatures and real dice, while I am using tokens and the program's dice.\n\nI'll start with the good. This program is POWERFUL! I can sit down and create almost everything I need with this. If I want to add a weapon type to my game, I can. If I want to change the way a spell works, I can. Edit text in a purchased adventure, create custom classes or races, add a grid to a random overhead map pulled off of google, build an adventure from scratch... all doable. It takes time, but from what I've experienced not much more time than if I were doing everything using a notebook and pencils. One thing I am especially grateful for, is that I can enter any dice roll manually, I don't have to use the program to do it.\n\nCombat is easy. As GM, I simply drag attack dice onto the player I wish to target and release. The program rolls the dice, checks the result against the appropriate defense (including saves), and calculates the result. Damage works the same way, including automatically changing to crit damage on a natural 20. As players, we do it the old fashioned way - they roll, I tell them if they hit or not. For their damage, I just add their damage to a "wound" field in the NPC's sheet, and the program adjusts the current HP for me. HP can be displayed in several ways, "xx/xx", colored circles, etc. There is a "Combat Tracker" that lets me do most of the work from just that one window. It handles attacks, iniative order,  HP, etc.\n\nI am using one of the prebuilt adventures, Lost Mine of Phandelver. We've only had a couple sessions, and are still very much in the "OK,  wait a moment while I figure out how to do this" stage of the game. There is a lot of clicking, and a lot of windows open at any one time. I haven't decided if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but mostly I think it will be good once I get used to it. The story is subdivided into very small parcels, which sometimes overlap. I've learned the reading several pages ahead is vital. Each page will contain any combination of description, shareable maps (both GM and Player), preloaded encounters (both roster and map placement), pictures, GM Text, and (likely) more that I haven't seen yet. The adventure appears to be word for word, picture for picture, exactly what is being sold for traditional gameplay. And so far, it works very well for taking an inexperienced group and immersing them into the adventure.\n\nNow, for the things that I don't like. Let's start with the very, VERY obvious issue. Price. This program is expensive, there is no way to sugar coat it. For starters, you need to pay $40 for the program. This gets you the basic license, and the core framework that makes the program run. For MY needs, the basic license is all I need - you can host, and connect a second instance using the same computer. For any groups where each player has their own computer, they also need to spend $40. Alternately, the GM can buy an ultimate license, for $150, and then other players can connect to his game for free. They cannot GM, only play. Now, this includes everything needed to play... technically. If you want to DO anything, like create a character, you have two options. You can spend hours at the kayboard doing data entry, copying everything from your Players Handbook into the program. Or, you can buy a players handbook addon... for another $50. Want the DM Guide? $50. Want the Monster Manual? $50. These will add themselves to your base install, but they do not come with a physical copy or a PDF. Physical copies, ironically, are about half this price on Amazon. Premade adventures cost $20-35, which is about the same as buying the physical book.\n\nThe next thing bad about this program is the support. If I have a question, I know I will need 20-60 minutes to search through forums posts (or write my own), an outdated / semi-broken wiki, or YouTube tutorials (MANY of which are made by their customers). By and large, that is what the community expects new customers to do. There is no handholding here. In fact, while many forum members welcome newcomers with open arms, many more view Fantasy Grounds as their only child... anyone saying anything less that praise will be immediately attacked.\n\nMissing features, bugs, quirks... Fantasy Grounds has them. This program was not developed with Industry Standards in mind. Fantastic examples: Alt F4 does not exit the program. There is no way to print a character sheet from the program. Adding a weapon to inventory automatically adds attack data, but adding armor does nothing for defense - must manually edit the AC data. Adding a character's background during creation will add everything associated with it, languages, proficiencies, etc --- but changing/removing the background doesn't remove anything it added. It is actually quicker to delete the character and start over than it is to manually search through and fix it.\n\nFinally, there is the talk of revamping the program to run on Unity. Talk that has been going on in the forums since at least September 2014. This has been used as a reason that features/bugs are not being addressed, since their focus is on the new system. As a new customer, I fear that this is like chasing after a Duke Nukem game or Guns'n'Roses album... where there is a very real chance that if it DOES happen, it'll happen far too late to be of any relevance to most of us.\n\nBottom line, this purchase is a gamble. This is not a single person game, you're relying on your group to be able to play it. At the bare minimum, you are shelling out $110 (base program, character classes, 1 premade adventure) or $40 plus days of programming the races, classes, monsters, equipment, etc into it. What makes it worse, is that you must research exactly what you do / do not need. The DLC total was well over $2,000 last time I looked, which is intimidating. The learning curve is very steep, with a lot of frustrations along the way.\n\nThat being said, I'm glad I bought it. I'm confident that in time, I'll become proficient enough with it that it will an amazing benefit to my gaming group. Remember, this thing is POWERFUL. Despite the very valid downsides I've pointed out, this program does 95% of what I want it to do, and it does that well. I don't regret buying it. On the flip side, your mileage will vary, so I cannot in good conscience recommend it blindly.","June 5","false","314.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is well worth your purchase price.  Automation for most things is built in, depending on the rule set you are using and SmiteWorks are always releasing new patches/improvements in core functionality and are very interactive with their community.  There is a significant amount of additional content available, but you don't need to buy them unless you want to; think of buying a pen & paper module or class book in the "good old days" by comparison - if you chose not to, your core game would still go ahead fine.\nThere are a lot of people looking to stir up trouble complaining this isn't free.  Ask yourself if you'd be willing to put hours and hours of your time into a project and not expect to make something back from it.  Also, be sure you know what "free" is... because it isn't "free" like you think.\nI've used FG to run D&D 3.5e, Pathfinder, Rolemaster Classic and Castles & Crusades campaigns.  All of these are well worth getting time into the software... you should not regret it if you take the plunge and join the FG community.  As a last point, anyone who likes Rolemaster but shudders at memories of flipping constantly through books and attack charts... take heart - FG makes your RM game a dream to run.","September 11, 2014","true","0.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I think the biggest problem is that each of the DLCs are exceptionally expensive on top of the price that you pay for the tool. There are a few free DLCs available but they're currently very limited, and the tool is improving all the time.\n\nIt also has a very high learning curve and doesn't lessen the preperation required before hosting a game.\n\nThe one thing that I'm hoping for is a ton of fun free DLCs (PS. It's a mission creating your own as there are currently licensing laws preventing you from publishing without royalties paid to the creators of the rulesets. Which really limits the community. Free DLCs will normally only be released by the creators of the ruleset.)\n\nWho is this really for? You can normally use the free (demo) version to connect to online games if the host has the full version. So you're not required to purchase this to partake in games. Purchasing this is only recommended for long time GMs who are commited to their games and are unable to host locally all the time. I promise you that currently pen and paper and/or a printer takes just as much time to use and prepare with and if you're organized you can achieve exactly the same.\n\nThe true value comes from the market. If I were the creators of this tool I would've rather taken royalties from each DLC purchase than charge this much for the tool. My group moved through my story in 3months and I gave up after that as I wasn't prepared to pay more for new DLCs.\n\nAnyway, so yes I would recommend this tool but only for long term GMs that have the cash to waste and the inability to host games locally (or technologically obsessed ones like myself that use their laptops for everything) go for it. And I have to stress this again, only for long time GMs.","June 4, 2014","true","0.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","2"

So far, I've had 6 hours of play just looking around and familiarizing myself with the mechanics. I was surprised to find out how user friendly creating content for your play style actually is. There are some free player-created content out there ( but I have not looked at that material yet). If you are familiar with other available tools online, there is some comparability; the table function is there, but I'm not aware of button-binding. The scrolling can be difficult, as is the movement of each row to the bottom of the list as you type. I have not seen or heard of any macro-making ability, but the mechanics of Fantasy Grounds doesn't need it to feel the satisfaction of preparing the gameplay.\nAll and all, it is an investment, and the prices are discouraging it's Steam community from growing faster than it is; but it already has it's own community from it's website.

I use a non-steam version and have used it for at least 8 hours every week  for the past 4 months.\n\nI have a RPG group that meets every Saturday at my place.  A few months ago I bought a projector to use for showing maps and whatnot.  I started out using Roll20 but found it to be annoying at times.  I finally said screw it and tried out Fantasy Grounds, and I haven't looked back since.\n\nThe only thing Roll20 had that FG doesn't have is the dynamic lighting, but that's still able to be done yourself with the masking in FG.\n\nThe campaign management in FG is awesome, I love it.  It has most of the game systems you could want.  I'm currently using it for 5th Edition D&D, but will be trying it out for Shadowrun pretty soon, just for keeping notes and displaying maps, as I'll just be playing, not GM'ing.\n\nWhile it is a bit pricey, it's worth the one time investment if you can swing it.  The monthly license are also quite affordable if you just want to check it out first.  I had the Ultimate license prior to buying the regular version while it was on sale during the Steam summer sale.\n\nUnfortunatley, I do not have the 5th Editon PHB or Monster Manual data sets yet.  But as a DM, I find it quite easy to just put monsters in as I need them, and I don't really need the player details on my end, just the important stuff.\n\nAll in all, I cannot recomment this product enough.  Doesn't matter if yo'ure using it to game online, or for live games, it's an amazing tool.

The price just seemed too out of my league. Then the Steam Sale happened and all was forgiven. I bought the big ultimate awesome deluxe version and a bunch of packs for it and I don't regret it. I love the intuitiveness and ease of operation.\n\nThere are some things I still can't figure out like how to get the spell ranges and that stuff to work properly on the map. It makes being a DM a cinch and I have plenty of time and utensils to make awesome campaigns. The premade campaigns are a great way to learn how the program works and buying the books for D&D or if you already own them, you just have to input JUST LIKE THE BOOK to get it to work seamlessly. I even added spells from other ED's just modified for the game we are playing.\n\nI got 5 of my friends together and they all play off of my pack which makes people more inclined to buy the full version for themselves. If the tutorials were a bit easier to navigate and I was able to find all of my issues without running to the forums, I would give this a 10/10, but until that happens.\n\nFor now a 9/D10","July 10, 2015","true","83.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In today's world, it is hard to get a group together on a regular basis, and Fantasy Grounds helps to make it so that those of us who love pen and paper/table RPGs can play them. The program is regularly updated and has a wide variety of user-made custom rulesets, extensions, and themes.\n\nThis year, Fantasy Grounds became the only officially supported platform for D&D 5th edition online play. There are regular "online conventions" that allow free play for everyone, and the license and DLC structure is set so that only the DM needs to pay (I personally take donations from my players to help buy the content, and they each pitched in $15 for the ultimate license - cheaper for them than buying a full version).","July 16, 2015","true","277.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

An unintuitive UI and connectivity problems are like deadly sins, but I never want to go back to tabletop gaming again! Fantasy Ground is sucha powerful tool that I prefer to use it even when I have my friends face-to-face in the living-room.\n\nAs a player it lets me automate my character sheet to a fair degree up against itself and against the virtual tabletop through a token representation of my character. In supported games FG also let me drag-and-drop both character-creation and level-ups. I still need to do some maintainance as the drag-drop is not complete. Especially spells and powers need to be set up in the action-tab on the sheet, and some of them needs to be macroed by the player to work properly.\n\nAs a GM it will make story-module usage super-easy, for their supported games. Even for their unsupported games the preparation it lets you do before session, and presentation it lets you serve during the session is superb!\n\nThere is in other words a steep learning-curve and some initial problems you'll feel was entirely unnessesary because of bad software achitecture, but once you get up to speed FG is fantastic.","January 9","true","144.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Provided YOU have every single manual and every single source book, you can create a 4th edtion game and build 4th edition characters.  If you don't have these now out of print and difficult to find books, none of the DLC for Fantasy Grounds will help you.  All of the D&D material is for 5th edition, because that is the only edition for which they have a license.\n\nNow, I would normally not be upset about this.  Wizards of the Coast is notorious for making their previous products obsolete to ensure their current ones are sold like hotcakes, just look at Magic the Gathering (5 months after a collection is completed a new one is released and a year after that neither are deemed "playable" by serious gamers), so I understand that the developers might not be able to get the license for a gaming system the creators want to fade into ancient history.\n\nMy problem is that NO WHERE on their Steam Store page or main website does it say that the DLC items are not compatible with older verson of the systems their program supports. I spent several hours searching and eventually found one after utilitizing Google Search and it was an archived post on their Forum Boards about others having a simliar issue with creating 3.5 games.  The Steam Store does, however,  celebrates the fact that the company received permission to create 5th Edition data packs, but does not clarify that the data packs are ONLY for 5th.\n\nI bought the game to help run my 4th Edition D&D game.

Most of my players had never truly engaged with tabletop, and I myself had never run D&D 5th edition. But FG has made enough of the math automatic so as to be both newbie-friendly and to allow us to focus on the story, and on the weight of individual decisions, rather than mental sim-grind. Highly recommended.","November 4, 2015","true","714.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Somehow I went right past the tutorial features in the program but finally getting more hooked into these features. The program is great and I'm really looking forward to the "Primeval Thule" content and other upcoming additional features. Big thumbs up here!","February 28","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","8"

And I will probably purchase all other DLCs. I am amazed, it's fantastic. It's all there: images, maps, stats, tokens, and all linked and automated. FantasyGrounds reached Epic level with this license deal. I am especially impressed with the adventure module. As a DM, this saves me many many hours of preparation. All I have to do now is simply to read it :D","April 9, 2015","true","107.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While there are plenty of free offerings like Roll20, Fantasy Grounds is a paid toolset that is (I think) the most expensive one. That means it has to do a lot of stuff to compete with its free bretheren...\n+: Fantasy Grounds is a beautiful product to just sit inside and is only missing a couple of features that its free competitors have (like SoundCloud integration on Roll20), but has a plethora of useful features that those products don't - including rulesets entirely built in with many more able to be purchased! (and only the DM needs to buy them) These built in rulesets are pretty much flawless and awesome if you're looking to run a specific campaign.\n+: Custom module support done through XML means if you want to add your own content or build your own ruleset, you can relatively simply. I am not a coder by any means but XML isn't difficult to pick up.\n+: Tons upon tons of plugins and custom content and artwork at your finger tips through the community so even if you're a DM who isn't very artsy you can make some decent looking stuff and integrate it into your campaign super easy.\n-: Since this is a very niche product to a specific niche community, it's hard to peg down negatives since if you're reading this you're probably interested in this kind of product anyways...the only negative I could think of really is the price. I think the product is worth the price mind you, but I think they would destroy their competitors if they released more rulesets and modules and content such as that for paid money and made the core product much cheaper. This is really the only main complaint I've ever found about Fantasy Grounds in general - the price. That said, if you are a heavy lover of PnP RPGs and can get a good core group of internet people going, you'll get so much value out of this product over time.","June 14, 2015","true","97.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
