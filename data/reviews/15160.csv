Don't be deceived by the joyful horse pictures, this is a hazardous game that should not be sold without severe warning. After countless days of raising horses, I was grazing on some nearby greens when my roommate dropped a dish on the ground. It broke and the noise of it spooked me, causing me to rear back and kick him in the head. Now he talks with a speech impediment and has a wonky eye. I haven't launched this game in 3 weeks because it will remind me of the incident. I can't face the reality of what I've done. My family won't speak to me, I have badly infected rug burn on both of my knees, and I'm malnourished from eating nothing but carrots, although my eye sight has never been better. Damn you Petz Horsez, you've ruined my life!!!!","November 29, 2013","true","0.8"," 309 of 370 people (84%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","84","309","370","79","7"

Gives me mixed feelings about my sexuality.\n\nBut enough of that. First, this game is definitely better than The Secret of the Magic Crystals (0/5 do not play). I thought that this geimu was about horses and riding but actually it is a mystery dating sim. With a slightly disturbing plot and characters. There is an autistic and mentally disabled boy who likes to count stars. And a woman who constantly tells you how aliens abducted her. Then there is this boring stuff about some stuff. You can also flirt with a man who has probably murdered someone. Also there is creepy npc who keep appearing and disappearing whenever they like. G'damn mate\n\nThe horse part of this game is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry. The showjumping part is insanely irritating and HARD. Dressage is slow and boring and I didn't enjoy it to the max. Cross country is ruined by invisible walls and it nearly ruined my day. The horses flex their legs like there's no tomorrow and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Nearly every part of this game is made poorly and nobody should enjoy this game. But I did. Why? I wish I could give you an answer for that. HÖHÖÖ\n\nIf you enjoy horse games this might be the ultimate game for you. Otherwise, this is pure s'hit and hhahahahshahsa oh boy i need to get some help. pls send an adult","June 8, 2014","true","22.1"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","33","42","8","0"

I dont know why i bothered putting 60 hours into fallout and 400 into Civ V when all that time was wasted not playing Petz Horses 2. This game really takes you on a fun joy ride adventure were you play some girl whose stuck in france, because the deer from the begining cutscene sabatoge your car off camera. Thats the only explanation to how it happens!\n\nThis game takes your horse riding fantasies and removes all the boring things. Like father figures, realistic responsibilities, and the putrid smell of horse ♥♥♥♥. Other than the poor resolution in the cut scenes, and the failure to let me strap a flux capasitor to my horse and ride 88 miles an hour through the French country side. This game is good, in fact its the best game ever. IN FACT! Its the best game Ubisoft has ever made! Why play as a boring native american assassin in the colonial era, when you can talk to characters who personalities resemble chalk, in Petz Horses 2.\n\nNot to mention all the people on the farm are idiots. I mean seriously how can you live on a horse farm for years, and not have a vet! Thats was a "Quest" in the begining of the game, at the end of that same "Quest" you have to walk into a barn and pet a horse with a sponge. Thats it. WAS THAT SERIOUSLY THAT HARD? I BARELY DID ANYTHING! But the horse was fine after that. The horses, now sponged foot, was magically ok and we did thousands of random jumps over strategicly placed wooden walls that were most likely left over peices of the Maginoe Line.

Don't let the title fool you, this game is legit. This is not your ordinary, boring af, 3-day event competition with no story horse game. This game has a real story with a cast of very interesting, well rounded characters, each with in-depth backstories you can discover. Yeah, you heard me. A horse game with actual characters that talk about actual things with an actual plot. This is the real deal. Real talk.\n\nThe plot has got some cool mystery elements, lots of scandal, social commentary, romance if you choose, and it adapts to how you play the game. There are multiple paths and multiple endings. Do you mostly care about eventing and breeding horses? You can choose not to concern yourself with solving the mystery and the focus of the plot will shift.  The interesting side character backstories? You only discover them if you chose to interact with them. Very adaptive. Yes. Good. Encourages the player to interact with the in-game world. Yes. Good!\n\nSince the the story is a mystery it can get a little intense at points and might get a little bit scary for some younger players.\n\nThis game is pretty gosh darn ugly, but fortunately, it is very easily modded. The textures, text, sounds, meshes/models, and animations are all there for you to fiddle around with. Unfortunately, if you can't mod the files yourself, you gotta deal with the ugliness because there are no mods out there for this game. It was 2007. A more innocent time. A simpler time. An uglier time. Much uglier. Very ugly. Bad. Mouths do not move, some people don't blink, the saddle clips through the horse, the girl clips through the saddle AND the horse, the chestnut horses are not chestnut and the cream horses are NOT cream. Currently trying to find a way to upload some of my mods to the steam workshop for other people that are bothered by these things.\n\nThere's lots of neat stuff in this game. You got all sorts of collectibles, sidequests, and secrets. It's got a stat system, a training system, a breeding system, a rider skill system,  an affection/morale system and each of these systems effects your game in tiny ways. Very fun. Yes. good.\n\nOn foot, the controls can feel very clunky. On horseback, things are easy-peasy. You can configure the keys to your taste, but not all of them. Gotta go to the config.ini to change them if you can't handle the good ol' 2007 clunk controls. They are very bad.\n\nLike most horse games, this has a ridiculously long grooming sequence. Unlike most horse games from the time, you can actually rotate the camera and brush the ENTIRE horse instead of just one side. The shower option was actually developed in hell itself by the devil. I have proof. I can confirm this. There is also a hoof-picking sequence in which you have to avoid hitting the frog or else the horse will scream VERY LOUDLY. AMAZING! REVOLUTIONARY! Yes. Good! Oh, and get this, GET THIS: you get emmerse yourself in an AMAZING FIRST PERSON STALL MUCKING EXPERIENCE! YES!\n\nThere is a training and trust bar you can fill up. The activities you need to do to fill them up are awful. The lunging minigame is very confusing and very difficult. Actually had to look up a tutorial. Very hard. You need a good mouse. The other minigame is just memorization based but there is a very loud buzzer noise that plays if you answer incorrectly. Very scary. Mute your volume for that. You will pee yourself. I know this.\n\nUgly yes, but a quality horse game with a lot of depth and character, which is saying a lot because horse games are notoriously bad. The stat system is well made, but simple and won't confuse younger players. More realistic than most horse games targeted at a younger audience, but realism fans will likely not rejoice. This game has something for every age group. Good enough that you can genuinely enjoy it, and bad enough that you can still make fun of it the whole time. Very poorly made, but that's part of what I like about it.","February 14","true","7.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","11","11","4","1"

This game has one of the worst user interfaces I have ever seen in my entire life. You are required to use the arrow keys AND the mouse, for example. Even if the game allowed complete key re-mapping, it would still be clunky, hard to navigate, confusing, and unintuitive. They do not remind you how to perform actions (coming back to the game after a while? I hope you have a good memory!), the clock/time of day system is insanely confusing, navigating the world is beyond ridiculous, and the horses look like weird mutants. Get the console version instead. It's a completely different game and way, way better.","March 2, 2013","false","3.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","1"

Horsez 2 is more of a murder-mystery adventure game than a horse game, though there are some required areas of horse gameplay and lots of optional horsing around if you're looking for more riding.\n\nThey've also stored most of the textures for the game in plain, easily editable, formats (.png if I recall - it has been a while) that totally allow you to make the game feel more like a cross between Silent Hill and Call of Cthulhu than a Petz game.","December 24, 2011","true","8.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Everything about this amazing adventure oozes quality. From the first moment you see the polygons flicker and distort across your screen during the many broken animations and watch the mouth movements fail to sync with the psychotic and inane spoken dialog badly translated from what was probably originally a French release, you'll be hooked on CoD:Black Ops. The best part is the tutorial that you are given early on, as your friend Oliver shows you around the place you'll be staying and working. After teaching you how to cure the infection in your starter horse's foot, you are shown where it can participate in challenges. Unfortunately, your horse's stats are not high enough to participate in that day's challenge, so instead of clicking Confirm you must select the Back option. Which doesn't work. At all.
