"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/220860/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Imagine a puzzle game where logic is thrown out fo the window, and absurdity is rewarded - that's McPixel.\n\nMcPixel, the 'hero', is faced with various different scenarios where he is tasked with saving the day, often from a bomb. There's only one way to save the day in each scenario, but it'll often take trial and error to discover it. It often won't make sense, but it will more often than not be absurd and strangely funny.\n\nThe McPixel website describes it best "You have 20 seconds to solve each riddle, regardless whether you lose or fail, you will be transported to next puzzle that you haven't solved yet."\n\nWhile it might take several attempts (and in some cases a lot of click and hope) to discover the correct way to solve the puzzle, the game rewards you, and in some ways encourages you to find all the different endings to each scenario. If you find them all you unlock the an extra round of scenarios in each level.\n\nThe game is entirely based around using the mouse, and clicking on the various objects within a scenario to trigger the outcome. There's little more to it than that, so in a stragne way it would make a great iOS game and I think I would have enjoyed it in a more casual pick up and play basis in 10 minute bursts.\nHaving said that I did stomach it enough to sit through it all and finish the game within 2 hours, and then attempt the 'Free DLC'.\nThere's plenty of pop culture references and humour to keep you engaged if you're something of a 'nerd' (I know I found them entertaining). However, the game becomes slightly derailed towards the end with just how unlogical and absurd the puzzles become. In some cases there's no real way of discovering how to save the world without a good old fashioned hopeless clicking everywhere on the screen frezy.\n\nI enjoyed it for the crazy nature of the game, however the soundtrack might just put some people off as there's only really one track that repeats throughout the game. In short, a crazy puzzle game that might not be for everyone depending on your absurdity threshold. I'll recommend it as I enjoyed it, but I can see why some people might not. Not for everyone.\n\nProbably best to check out the free demo available on the website: http://mcpixel.net/ or on Steam.","July 31, 2014","true","6.5"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","51","57","0","2"

Everything seems like a good idea.\n\nThe wild gameplay, that awards not only the correct solutions but also failed attempts, requires a great deal of creativity. Creativity - not just random clicking on every single pixel on your screeen, as many have pointed out in their reviews. After a time, the game begins to draw you towards its twisted logic. The bumpy run you had the first time playing McPixel, turns out to be very addictive, definately re-playable and captivating long ride.\n\nThe humour used by the creators is a little bit foul, sure. You will feel it pays tribute to your inner 14-year-old. It fits, however, the randomness and roughness of the game, making you smirk at the most obscure gags. (And is still better than American Pie.) What is even more exciting, the game has been provided with themed levels, for example paying tribute to other famous video games.\n\nAlso, lots of explosions.","February 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","20","22","10","0"

It is not at all a serious game and it’s very likely that 95% of the time you will blow something up on your first try. But it’s still fun none the less and the level comes back around faster than you can even think about it. It has a somewhat crude but hilarious sense of humour, with very bizarre gags in each stage.\nThere was quite a few times during my time playing that I just thought, “Who the hell would do that?” and had a little chuckle to myself.  But there you go, that is the magic and charm of McPixel.\nThe music is extremely repetitive, but strangely enough it isn’t annoying. It’s more catchy then annoying.\nThe main game is pretty short and there is a load of free DLC for you to play afterwards if you want to. (So there are a lot of days to save!)\nIf you were to play this nonstop the whole thing would probably take you a few hours, and it’s probably a good idea to take breaks due to its fast paced nature.\n\nGenerally I really enjoyed it; I thought it was pretty fun; there are a lot of references and things to have a laugh at in this game. So it’s something fun to throw on when you are bored.","November 27, 2013","true","3.8"," 40 of 61 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","40","61","0","0"

To break it down for you, its a point and click puzzle game set in brief different scenarios, such as in a falling elevator, you need to analyze how to save the day. You have  an emergency button, elevator buttons, an old man, a bell hop and an extinguisher. What do you do to save the day? These are wacky and weird situations, usually involving bombs or gasoline. None of which lasts no longer than 15 seconds. The game is broken up into 4 chapters, each chapter has 3 or so clusters of 6 scenarios / challenges. If you fail doing a challenge, you don't do it over and over until you get it right, you just go to the next uncompleted scenario.\n\nI completed the entire first chapter in about 15 minutes, which is 18 challenges? There is free DLC, which is a series of selectable clusters made by fans or whomever. There is a lot of content here, but the real catch is the challenges just don't last a long time. They're pretty easy to figure out.\n\nThe cherry on top of this is that there are some laugh out loud results. Maybe the results are so LOL because they're so unexpectedly random. Again, I expected nothing from this game and got a lot of entertainment from it. I'll be returning to the game to see the other quirky scenarios with crude graphics.","June 27, 2013","true","1.3"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","36","57","0","0"

A parody of MacGyver and other unrealistic action heroes, the game has you defuse the danger in various scenarios by, well, clicking on everything on screen in hopes to find the order that works. And that's where McPixel falls short, there is no gameplay, per se. There is no internal logic to decipher, nothing to understand. Click a character or set piece. If nothing happens (that's good), click another one. If ♥♥♥♥ blows up, start over with a new order of clicking-on-things.

The fact that this game is frankly too silly for even the immature likes of me seems to bear this out.  That, and the fact that while I was fine with all the post, and indeed post-post, and probably even post-post-post, and maybe, just maybe, even all the post-post-post-post-modernist humour that has emerged during my lifetime, all this post-post-post-post-post-modernist humour that seems all the rage these days is just a bit beyond me, I'm afraid.  Half the time, not only did I not find the "gags" of this game all that funny, but at least another quarter of the time I didn't even understand what had just transpired (though the insanely, even downright PERVERSELY pixelated nature of events may not have helped in these instances).  The other quarter of the time, okay, I got myself a cheap chuckle - my personal favourite was trying to work out who the virgin was to throw in the volcano, and ultimately (and successfully) deciding on MYSELF - but the laughs really are too few and far between to put up with the eye-bleedingly awful graphics and incredibly limited gameplay.  (Groovy music, though.)\n\nLook, I will recommend it, but only just, and only to those who need a brief break from watching allegedly "funny ♥♥♥♥" all day, every day on ♥♥♥♥ing YOUTUBE.

If you fail, you have to do the other levels in the chapter first. At the end of the chapter, the game lets you retry the failed levels, until you completed them all. Then you proceed to the next chapter. You have to memorize the things you have already tried, so you can try something different the next time you play that level. There are some silly and amusing jokes here and there but in the end I didn't really enjoy this game that much. I just got bored fast. At least on PC. I think this game is much more suitable for mobile platforms, to play in short bursts, to kill some time with. And guess what... McPixel is actually available on mobile platforms! You can buy the game for Android and iPhone. I wish Steam would offer an option to review a game with a sort of neutral verdict. Because as a mobile game, I would actually say yes. But this is Steam and we are reviewing Steam games here.

Well, you get McPixel, a game that isn’t afraid to throw logic out the window and give some straightforward jokes.\n\nMcPixel is a game that can be described as “WarioWare meets point and click adventure”. Each scene has a 20 second timer, with McPixel trying to save the day, often by disarming a bomb. Actions range from moving, picking up objects, and interacting with objects. Given the short time limit to solve the situation, players will tend to combine as many objects as possible. The game’s crazy logic behind the puzzles don’t tend to make sense and often the solutions are found by trial and error, though there are some more sane solutions that can be found. Solving each scene is simple, but the gameplay assists in something bigger, which is the game content itself.\n\nIn this game, McPixel must save the day. How he does so depends on the scene and the criteria for doing so is often stretched. Throughout the game, various gags are presented, often with random and crazy ideas. Often some gross out humor is applied, so be aware of the random jokes and occasional bodily functions. Along with these kinds of gags, many pop culture references are in the game, especially with TV and video games. These references I feel tend to work better at giving a good laugh, though the various random occurrences that don’t reference anything also are worth a laugh. Anyway, the bulk of the game is in its humor, and McPixel has no shortage of comedy to toss around and make you laugh.\n\nOn a short note, the game applies a retro style with its art and music. The game is pixelated like an old game, though McPixel does employ a consistent and certain character style. Scenery tends to be pixel art as well, or in some cases pixelated versions of photographs. Animations are crucial to delivering the game’s gags, and the crazy qualities of them work fine with the retro style. Music is the same way as well, using some chiptunes for some nice fat beats. There are not many songs and the tracks are quite short, but it does achieve the retro style with some neat chiptunes.\n\nMcPixel is a game for those looking to laugh at the absurd and crazy situations and interactions. Gameplay is kept simple to focus on delivering comedy, though the game’s crazy logic can make some puzzles confusing and require trial and error. Still, with some retro styling with the art and music mimicking old video games, McPixel makes for a game to laugh at some silly things.","March 14","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

For what I got it for, I'd say it was worth it.\n\nIt's a simple point and click adventure where the solution you're looking for is not always apparent.\n\nIt has some interesting humor, and can be fun if you just wanna sit down, zone out, and play something for a couple minutes without getting to into it. It does what it does well, and should be commended for that.\n\nIt has free DLC, and user created levels, you can even create a level yourself and share it with others! Aspects like this can keep the game interesting far after you have went through and beaten it, even after going through and getting everything that can happen in a scenario.\n\nWhile I got this dirt cheap, I'd definitly recommend you get this one on sale, or wait for it to go on sale. I don't quite think it's worth the initial asking price for what it is, since you can find games similar to it for free on various websites.\n\nWorth a buy if you can get it for next to nothing.

It's a parody of the '80s TV series "McGyver", which features a man who can basically disable any single bomb using the simpler things, like a rubber band or a paper clip.\n\nThis game carries the parody even further, mixing scenarios of many pop culture TV series, books, movies and games, with the most absurd solutions.\n\nThe game only needs you to click on something - up to three or four things, but mostly just one - to solve the scenario and save the day. If you clicked the correct thing then the bomb will be disabled; if not, then it will blow up and you'll lose the scenario.\n\nHowever, most of the scenarios have their own logic, and you have to think out of the hat to choose the correct answer.\n\nIt's a fun game, but really short. Anyway it will make you laugh in more than one way.\n\nIt's totally worth the $0.99 price tag that it has right now in the summer sale, so if you can spare a dollar you should consider this among your options.","July 19, 2013","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a point and click puzzle game where in each scene you have to figure out how to deactivate the bomb to save the day/scene, which does have its funny/random moments - but there are also sections where it just feels tedious to progess because of the way the game is setup and/or the logic behind the combination that solves the puzzle is something that feels less anti-climactic that I would have hoped for in a game that seems to shout "absurdity" as its core feature.\n\nTL;DR Seems like a game I would play for free online on some flash website if I stubled upon it, but knowing what I know now I probably wouldn't have paid $5 for it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rexnefx/recommended/220860/","rexnefx","rex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rexnefx/","233 products in account","This is a silly, silly point-and-click game where you try to figure out how to stop a bomb from exploding through trial and error.  The graphics are intentionally (I think?) super crude, and the interactions between you (McPixel) and world objects are surreal and unpredictable, which gives the game its charm and character.  The game wisely advises you to play it in short sittings and take breaks.  Indeed, I found if I played more than one set of levels at a time the humor would kind of wear off, and since this game relies entirely on its humor, it stopped being fun very quickly.  But then when I played it the next day it'd be fresh again.  Some drawbacks: The music is repetitive; the graphics are overly crude, so much so that you can't always tell a clickable object exists; there's no achievements (I'm a little OCD so I like achievements).  I think it's a little pricey at $5, but I bought it on sale so I think it was definitely worth whatever it was I paid.  All in all, it's a quirky, silly game that  changes the entire genre  will put a smile on your face.","February 3, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The strangest thing is that it works quite well either as a good bad game or just as a clever indie puzzle– with an excellent length/price ratio thanks to the continuous release of free new levels.\n\nLong version:McPixel is the kind of game that you can hardly place anywhere. On one hand it’s obviously a joke title, full of obscene and sometimes downright retarded gags, completely illogical puzzles and an utterly insane basic idea: you have to defuse bombs at unusual places (including a lot of video game or movie themed levels) using the most absurd ways.\n\nStill, despite the complete absence of logic, it works surprisingly well as a puzzle game, and the incentives to find all possible solutions can open up a few clever visual gags that really show how great imagination the creator has. It may not be a new Portal in terms of advancing puzzle games to the next level, but it offers a quick fun, and thanks to the many levels– including the free DLCs and community-created ones– it can last quite long, if you choose to stick with it.","February 2, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is basically a point and click game. The aim of the game is to locate and destroy/get rid of a bomb by clicking on objects on the screen. There are several stages which each has several levels.\n\nThe good points are that you get lots of levels (100) which you can happily sink alot of time in.\n\n\nNow for the bad points. First off, although the game tries to be humorous by having you embarass or do terrible things to the characters in the game, some of the actions that the main character does may be offend/disturb people (e.g. peeing on an alien). Second is that when you start the game there is literally no tutorial which was somewhat frustrating trying to figure out what to do. Third issue is that when you fail to locate the bomb, you will proceed to the next level. The game then goes through all five levels of the stage untill you have disarmed the bomb in each stage. This forces you to remember exactly which items not to click on, but the main problem is that it is somewhat difficult to find which items can be interacted with. Fourth issue is that the game is extremely repetitive. Once you finished the first level, all the other levels are exactly the same except with new scenery. Fifth issue is that the music is really annoying as it plays 1 track for the ENTIRE game.\n\nIf you like point and click games, avoid this game. If you like a fun and enjoyable games, avoid this game. It isn't even worth $1 let alone $5.","November 25, 2013","false","2.3"," 38 of 75 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","38","75","0","0"

For sh*t and giggles.\n\nAbove all, this is just supposed to be funny, but it totally misses me as a target demographic.

When you click something wrong, the game makes a lot of random and funny events, that can make you have a fun time while playing.\n\nThere is really no storry in the game, and you have no charecters to really follow, other then of couse McPixel, but it`s not like the charecter in any way progress or learn something, it`s just disarm a bomb move on to the next level.\n\nEventhough there is a lot of levels in the game, the game is rather short, and can be completed really really fast. To get a 100% in all levels, you have to activate every single event on a level, and therefore not disarm the bombs a lot of the time.\n\nThe levels are random at times, but some of them are themed after moveis and game, and it is funny to see, how this game, makes events out of the situations from moveis and games.\n\nLike DLC quest, I don`t think you should buy this, unless you can get it very very cheap. It`s not becouse the game isn`t fun, but becouse it is as short as it is.

Если он не успеет ткнуть в нужные вещи в необходимой последовательности, комнату разорвет, а игра включит следующую. Потом еще одну, еще, еще, еще, еще, потом опять первую (из-за повторов McPixel немножко напоминает 8-ми битную версию фильма "Исходный код").\nВсе упрощено до предела. Мир из гигантских пикселей. В каждой комнате всего три-четыре предмета. Например: змея, бомба, иллюминатор и дверь. Или: девственница, кость и корова. Большинство задач решается перебором и очень часто до того, как вы догадаетесь, что здесь происходит вообще. "Клик, клик, клик" – комната пройдена.\nИз-за графики часть предметов не различима. Серое пятно с дедушкой на мосту, зеленый квадратик на кладбище, я бы наверное улыбнулся, если бы знал, что кидаю в могилу. Почему мой герой только что нассал на пришельца?

That doesn't mean that it's any less fun.\n\nThe animations are a strong point in this game in my opinion, as well as the music (but is a bit repetitive).  And you're going to explode over and over, and over.  But then maybe you'll luck out and get it right the first time.\n\nThere are loads of levels to explore, and hilarious shenanigans to encounter.  It gets a bit boring after a while, but each time you encounter a different level, you find more hilariious ways to kill McPixel.\n\nIt's a nice little indie title.  3.5/5 asterisks.\n\n* the ability to change visual filters is also a fun bonus.","January 10, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you make the wrong choice, you fail that scenario.  But don't worry, you will fail many scenarios, as the correct path is hardly ever the most obvious.  And that's the charm of the game.  You essentially try these situations over and over, and you'll finally realize that you aren't supposed to pick up the dynamite you're supposed to kick the guy in his genitals (duh!)\n\nThis game reeks of potty humor, and slapstick comedy, and I find it hilarious!\n\nFor the steam sale price, it's definitely worth picking up.","January 2, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When you click something wrong, the game makes a lot of random and funny events, that can make you have a fun time while playing.\n\nThere is really no storry in the game, and you have no charecters to really follow, other then of couse McPixel, but it`s not like the charecter in any way progress or learn something, it`s just disarm a bomb move on to the next level.\n\nEventhough there is a lot of levels in the game, the game is rather short, and can be completed really really fast. To get a 100% in all levels, you have to activate every single event on a level, and therefore not disarm the bombs a lot of the time.\n\nThe levels are random at times, but some of them are themed after moveis and game, and it is funny to see, how this game, makes events out of the situations from moveis and games.\n\nLike DLC quest, I don`t think you should buy this, unless you can get it very very cheap. It`s not becouse the game isn`t fun, but becouse it is as short as it is. Whit that said I give this game a thumps up. 4 out of 10","April 25, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On the other hand, had it been any longer, it wouldn't have suffered through it till I beat it, as everything about it is sub-par.\n\n- The Graphics: I'm all for old-school big pixels. But this game demonstrates that even such a crude style needs a competent artist to be good. In McPixel, many times, it was impossible to see what object a big blot of pixels was supposed to represent. On average, everything that appeared on screen was ugly.\n\n- The Audio: There are no sound effects and the music is repetitive and irritative.\n\n- Mechanisms: McPixel is a string of short adventure game-style sections in which you need to solve "puzzles" within 20 seconds. A solution typically requires one to three clicks on the various objects in the scene, and follows no logic whatsoever. I'm not talking alternative logic, Antichamber-style. I'm talking 100% random sequences of clicks. yuk Should you try any other sequence than the right one, you lose.\n\n- Timing: The scenes come in groups of 6. You try scene 1 once, then, no matter if you won or lost, you try scene 2... After scene 6 you go back to the first scene that you haven't won yet. The cycle goes on until all six scenes are won. The problem is that such short sequences are separated by transition segments that last several seconds. You can skip them with a right-click, but it's tedious any way.\n\n- Humor: Almost all combinations of clicks in a scene, no matter how "right" or "wrong" they are, cause a little animation that tries to be funny. I think in the whole game, two or three of them made me smile. The rest was just complete, random nonsense. Not the funny nonsense you'd find in a Monty Python comedy or the poetic nonsense of Lewis Caroll. Just whatever dull and/or gross stuff crossed the developer's mind.\n\nI won't give it the lowest score possible because it was short enough and make me grin for at least 20 seconds, but this is not a game I would recommend to any sober individual. There is zero chance I'll try any of the bonus stuff like hidden gags or "free DLC" or whatever.\n\nRating: 3 out of 10","August 6, 2014","false","1.4"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","0"

If you die, then you go to the next area, and so on and so on until all bombs are defused. It's a tedious process to go through. The levels themselves are boring, the jokes lame, and if you're looking for a game that requires you to not lose brain cells, there's even a warning of sorts telling you that you will lose your brain cells (Which is the only funny thing about the game because it's true).

This was extremely frustrating at first, but after discovering I could skip the tediously long cut scenes at the start and end of each location, the game was no longer tedious, boring, and frustrating, but only tedious and boring!

Although enjoying very few point-and-click games, I was willing to give a chance to.  In the end, I did not find myself having a fun experience.\n\nThe game is meant to be a comedy of sorts, having both slapstick and crass humor.  Although some of the gags are good, the logic behind solving the puzzles is convoluted and confusing, sometimes having no logic at all.  This results in you usually having to just use trial and error over and over to figure out the right order of operations to solve a level.  This is made somewhat less annoying, however, as the load times between failed attempts is very quick.  In my opinion, the gameplay would better fit a more narrative driven game than a rapid-paced puzzle game.\n\nThe other problem I had with the game was the music.  Throughout the entire game, only one very repetitive music track is used.  At least as far as I got, there is no sound effects, ambient noises, voice acting, etc.  This means the one looping music track is the only thing you will hear throughout the entire session.\n\nAlthough I did not find the game fun, players who enjoy "rage games" would probably get a few good laughs out of the game.  I would recommend waiting for a sale however, as there is not much gameplay for a $5.00, compared to other games on Steam for the same (or lower) price.","August 12, 2015","false","1.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It might be that I just don't get it, but I think it's more that the game is just stupid. A bit humorous, but mostly just dumb. No real "gameplay" that I can discern. You just click on objects and the world blows up. Sometimes you want the world to blow up and sometimes you don't. Sometimes it needs to happen in the right way. I think. I don't know because the game doesn't give you any feedback other than big explosion at the end of every level, regardless of whether you were "successful" or not.","August 6, 2013","false","0.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's a game filled with mini-games where you're basically given several seconds to complete these mini-games.\n\n\nNow, I can't give you any proper examples because the scenes are just ridiculous(ly absurd) and the same thing goes for the solutions to these 'puzzles'. But in the end it all comes down to stopping a bomb from blowing up.\n\nPlaying a level will rotate 6 or so mini-games until you have solved them all.

Sometimes,you don't know exactly what to do so you just get desperate (usually) and you click all around the screen hoping that it's somehow the solution to that specific puzzle you're on.That's just dull and irritating.\n\nThe visuals. nothing special.Its pixels, what do you expect? And they're not even that detailed, they're like as if someone animated all this crap through mspaint and flash- well might as well be hm?\n\nThe music, VERY repititive-I'd rather hear my music instead of bearing to listen to this games.\n\nThe "humor" (dare I say it) is very unfunny,forced, and childish. It's not clever, it's not even really charming. It's just random and stupid.

Even if it's standing at one dollar, trust me- it won't pay itself back at the end of it all. I'ld literally chuck a buck just to get this out of my library.

The task is simple: keep the bomb from exploding in various sets of maps and situations.\nThere's not much more about it: every map contains a few characters and environmental elements (some hidden ones too) and you have a few clicks to get the right ones in the right order so your ethically-questionable hero McPixel can take action and throw the bomb away, or shield it, or defuse it and so on.\n\nThe extremely simple gameplay is weirdly balanced by the major unpredictability of the solution, so you end up frenetically repeating the same set of maps (six every stage) over and over again until you finally get it done.\nThere's also a bonus stage unlocked every time you get a streak of three wins together, but that happens so rarely (unless you're replaying it) that it can be considered a rare event.\n\nOf course it can be me: maybe there's actually a pattern by which you can solve all the maps without a doubt, but I couldn't last enough in the game to get it. One reason may be the fact that I couldn't bear gaming sessions longer than 5 or 10 minutes because of the confusion-to-rage inducing solutions and the constantly looping two seconds background 8-bit music (come on...)\n\nIt's difficult to me to imagine actually completing the entire game, so I can't really figure how one could possibly find the motivation to replay it afterwards.\n\nTo sum it up, for me it makes an ok game to play when you don't have much time (and something else to listen to), but nothing more.","April 8, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But after 10 minutes of just random clicking, it starts to get frustratingly confusing. There is no real incentive to keep on playing - since after completing the various levels, you can go back and "fully complete" levels, by discovering all of the gags. Which really just gets tiresome.\nThere is a "social" (I use that term loosely) aspect of the game, where a bunch of people under the name of the main character just talk to each other.\n\nI think the most entertaining part of this game was the "Fart-A-Long". Although even then, there isn't much variety for it as I have played the same 3 patterns (if I recall correctly) numerous times.\n\nIs this title worth $5? No. I recieved this game for free, and only played it to retrieve the trading cards from it.\nBut hey, if you're feeling generous and want to have a handfull of amusing moments, then godspeed.\n\n2 out of 10 teardrops.\n\nTL;DR\nNo enticement towards replayability, "Social" part of game is just a less-populated version of Omegle, and humor dies out quickly.\nThere are more worthwhile games out there with quite a good incentive for replayability (even under $5.00).","February 2, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To be honest I'm not too put out as it came as part of a humble bundle so wouldn't be something I'd look for in the first place but I couldn't really recommend anyone paying for this.\n\nIn the end the only reason I kept playing was for the steam cards, quite sad.","February 9, 2014","false","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It tries to be funny and random, but most often for me it just came off as rather, well, dumb.\n\nIt's not inherently BAD for what it is, per se, but I wouldn't dare pay full price for this.

One out of every fifteen or so puzzles actually has an answer that makes sense. This game tries so hard to be a "charming indie game," but just comes off monotonous , boring, and quite frankly, dumb. When you're making a game, the actual gameplay should trump filling your game with bad humor and obscure references. If dumb humor is your thing, maybe give this one a shot. Otherwise, stay away.

Not a real game just a good joke.\n\nEdit (to make it more helpful :)\nIt is something like point and click adventure, where you solve one screen puzzles. illogical puzzles. so You will click on everything interactive to see what will happen. Usually it will finish with huge explosion.\nTo make a progress (and see some new puzzles) you have to finish successfully some previous puzzles (well, I know its not a big surprise). So you will have to repeat puzzles and hunting for all interactive spots, what i found boring after few screens.\nI wanted to run through it like running though comic book at least, but it was not possible. i gave up.\nSome jokes are better some of them are worse. If you like jokes involving urinating or kicking someone's balls maybe you can find it funny.\nIf you are considering buying it you might rather watch some gameplay on internet,\nor try demo, you will see everything.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","December 22, 2014","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every level there is some sort of bomb you gotta stop exploding almost everything you click does something. (well done programmers!) The music is repetitive and annoying as f*ck.

Or perhaps there's a better way to describe it other than that, but doing so involves runes and scripts and languages not spoken or written by any human society on this planet. Well you get the idea. It's weird.\n\nWhile the puzzles take either an insane person or complete moon logic to solve, they still are a humorous and overall enjoyable experience, and you're not overly penalized for making what would rightfully sound like the right decision (which sometimes is actually the right one just to mess with you), you just sort of keep going through the set of 20-second stages in each level until you get them all "correct". And even if it takes you only about an hour or two to complete the 4 chapters (which is highly probable), there's other challenges that involve performing the wrong (but funny) solutions to all the puzzles, and some bonus content and level editors and whatnot.\n\nThe humour involves quite a lot of pop culture references but it pulls them off quite well unlike every single other thing that makes excessive pop culture references (though I guess in this one they aren't quite as excessive). It also has some so-called adult themes like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or whatever, so if you're a kid or easily offended, you should probably go to bed or something.\n\nThe soundtrack (yes I will talk about this in every game I review) is mostly okay, maybe above average or so, it's free on the game's website so you might as well check it out (it's done in an 8-bit style like the rest of the game though with noticeable 16-bit instruments included). Why not?\n\nIt's not the game for people who are expecting anything resembling a serious experience, but for those of us who aren't, it's a good way to blow off some steam or whatever.","February 15, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With plenty of in-game levels and tons of free extra "DLC" to play, you can spend hours with this game. Many of the levels contain a lot of jokes and references to other games or movies, and most of the bonus levels (which you unlock by not only saving the day by defusing the bombs in every level of that chapter, but also going through and discovering all the gags that involve not saving the day) are straight up homages to those things. The video game one was my personal favorite, where you have to save Cloud and Sephiroth by becoming Jenova, and saving Chell from Portal by opening a portal into her body and tossing the bomb in it, etc. I found myself laughing audibly with some of the ridiculous scenes, such as McPixel choosing to dry hump various objects instead of defusing the bomb.\nThe game menu itself was a delight, each option you pick containing a humorous outcome. The music, though simple was actually quite addicting, and can easily get stuck in your head as it plays in the background of every level that you're trying desperately to defuse a random bomb in less than 20 seconds. Some of the levels were pretty easy, but I don't think the game itself was actually going for a difficulty factor as much as it was a gag factor, and sometimes when the outcome was easy, I actually found myself looking for the funny alternatives instead of defusing the bomb right away. The 8-bit artstylem though simple, actually was very good at depicting the various emotions of the characters, such as McPixel screaming at a soldier to remove the bomb after putting said soldier's own hat on.\nI'd definitely recommend this game if you could find it on a sale. As great and amusing as it was, it still only contains about 2 hours of actual gameplay, the rest stemming from DLC both made by the actual developers, and by the community itself via the in-game World Creator. Though than again the game only markets itself as $5, so if you've got a fiver to spend, and have a twisted sense of humor, I think you'd enjoy this game.","February 8, 2014","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you fail, the next mini-level is loaded and you'll be given the chance to try again once the mini-levels cycle back around.\n\nThere are four "Acts" in the game with each Act containing four levels (3 open/1 locked) which are then broken down into five mini-levels.  With some basic arithmetic you can deduce how much playtime that'll get you.  There's also some free, downloadable content which is so-so, and they threw in a one-level rhythm game and some half-♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer chat room (it might be terrible on purpose...)\n\nSolutions in the game aren't as straight-forward as you'd expect and that's where most the fun derives.  Sometimes the solution can be as simple as clicking on the bomb and other times it involves a little more thought (or none at all).\n\nAt $5 it's probably not worth it, but I would reccommend getting it at a discount/bundle.","March 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saturdayinthefart/recommended/220860/","saturdayinthefart","Gut Lord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saturdayinthefart/","400 products in account","Think WarioWare meets most point-and-click adventure games.\n\nYou play as McPixel, a bomb-defusal "specialist", and you're given twenty seconds to disarm the bomb in each mini-level.  If you fail, the next mini-level is loaded and you'll be given the chance to try again once the mini-levels cycle back around.\n\nThere are four "Acts" in the game with each Act containing four levels (3 open/1 locked) which are then broken down into five mini-levels.  With some basic arithmetic you can deduce how much playtime that'll get you.  There's also some free, downloadable content which is so-so, and they threw in a one-level rhythm game and some half-♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer chat room (it might be terrible on purpose...)\n\nSolutions in the game aren't as straight-forward as you'd expect and that's where most the fun derives.  Sometimes the solution can be as simple as clicking on the bomb and other times it involves a little more thought (or none at all).\n\nAt $5 it's probably not worth it, but I would reccommend getting it at a discount/bundle.","March 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even though for $.99 you get what you paid for.  Has some decent challenging levels and has its fun moments.  That being said, does it really need to pop out the title every time you win or lose a level and that happens every 30 seconds.  Even someone with advanced alzehimers wouldn't forget which game he was playing.  McPixel!\n\nI love pixelness but I am still wishing the pixelness was slightly clearer and that the music would vary more.  Also some of the level solutions are just SO dumb..like oh i have to pee in the ground first.  And for kicks, you can always kick someone in the balls.  There will be alot of kicking people in the balls and sexually pleasing animals. McPixel!","January 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

You're not likely to enjoy this game for long.  I read the reviews ahead of time stating that it's more of a joke than a game.\n"That's okay!" I thought. "Jokes are worth paying for!"  But that's if the joke is good.  Or meatier.  This is one juvenile gag repeated ad nauseam.  Occasionally, the combinations of selecting/kicking result in a good laugh (usually just a chuckle).  The rest...?  Do I enjoy sophomoric humor?  Probably more than I should, but c'mon.  Is there ANYTHING else besides kicking people in the testes and having everything blow up?  The free DLC is all the same.\n\nEven if you buy it on sale, run it in the background to get card drops and sell all of them, you won't break even.\n\nIn short, if you're really interested in this game, see if a friend has it already and play it for 10 minutes on their account.\nAnd maybe get really high before playing.

The game seems to be mainly focused around humor and little logic to the puzzles that you have to think random. Sadly the humor hardly got to me... I did find myself stuck on a few levels as well, the Mortal Kombat stage and one of those stages at the end that have 2 parts to it.\n\nI'd wait till there's a sale for it at $1 (which is either Winter or Summer sale) as that's how it feels like to me... $5 is a bit much for me. I do wish there just wasn't one music being played throughout all the levels though... gets annoying quickly and sorta hurt my ears too after awhile. Also meant for replayability, but the humor is, as I said, rather dry for me.\n\nIt's still a good game and more for those that enjoy random moments that either make or don't make sense and get a kick out of it.","September 20, 2015","true","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Logically there might be a dozen ways to make a guard leave his post or to interact with a pump, but only one will be correct because of the artificial nature of the game.  A good point and click will keep this under control with reasonable puzzle solutions, while rewarding the player for their time and effort with humor, good music, an interesting story or other unique charm.  McPixel does none of this.  The music is short, repetitive, and not at all pleasing to listen to.  The puzzle solutions are arbitrary enough that all you can really do is click whatever is in the level until you manage to click the correct objects in the correct order.  It lacks a cohesive narrative.

Logically there might be a dozen ways to make a guard leave his post or to interact with a pump, but only one will be correct because of the artificial nature of the game.  A good point and click will keep this under control with reasonable puzzle solutions, while rewarding the player for their time and effort with humor, good music, an interesting story or other unique charm.  McPixel does none of this.  The music is short, repetitive, and not at all pleasing to listen to.  The puzzle solutions are arbitrary enough that all you can really do is click whatever is in the level until you manage to click the correct objects in the correct order.  It lacks a cohesive narrative.  There is humor, but it is crass and juvenile; even compared to other crass, juvenile humor, McPixel is in the back of the pack.\n\nThere is no reason to buy this game at any price.

I had fun for 30 minutes.\n\nMcPixel is a game that ultimately relies on you to understand the "Moon Logic" joke of older 90's point-and-click games, and turns that joke into its big running gag. I didn't have a problem with it. The game made me laugh quite a few times for the unusual, inappropriate things McPixel would do with specific objects.\n\nHowever, that's as far as the gameplay extends. Beyond the mission-by-mission sequence, there's really little else to the game. Click on stuff, find the gag, move on. It's little more than that. And it gets old once you've played these levels over and over, to the point where finding another nonsensical answer would release another groan I had inside me.\n\nIf you find this sort of humor funny, more power to you. If you find this gameplay as not monotonous, more power to you as well. For me, there's just very little to say about McPixel. It's short and funny, but not a very memorable or ultimately pleasant experience.","December 27, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Its main problem is also its core mechanic : the solution to its puzzle makes no sense. This is what makes the game funny from time to time thanks to some absurd cutscenes, but this also means there is absolutely no reflexion required.\n\nIn each of the 100 levels of the story mode (which doesn't have any scenario of course), you are asked to interact with all the items you can and combine them in all possible ways, until you find the "right" one (the one that doesn't make the stage explode). Discovering the intended combination doesn't feel particularly rewarding, because unlocking the "gold medal" in a stage (which unlocks bonus stages) requires to find ALL possible combinations. In the end, you will just find yourself clicking everywhere until the game congratulates you for completing the stage, and repeat the process until you reach the final cutscene.\n\nThe only way I think this could be interesting is racing against a friend trying to get all levels done before the other. But in solo, McPixel is terribly empty.\n\nThe game apparently comes with an editor to create your own stages and share them with the community. I must admit I didn't take the time to explore this mode, nor to test community-made stages, the game itself being so boring I doubt these stages can save it.\n\nTo sum up, McPixel is a joke, as it was meant to be. But this jokes repeats itself a lot, making it feel terribly long (although the story mode takes two hours to complete), and five dollars seems to be too much for a spoof like this. This is typically the game you would expect to play for free in your browser to kill some time, this doesn't deserve a spot in your Steam library.","October 24, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I enjoy stupid humor like YouTube Poop, and McPixel scratches that itch with extreme prejudice. In short form, McPixel is an incredibly random, immature game.\n\nIn McPixel, you play as the titular McPixel, a sendup of Macgyver whom must defuse a bomb in random scenarios. How do you defuse the bombs? By using everything on everything. It has that asinine point-and-click quality where you have to try every combination of objects to find the solution. You also get accolades for finding every combination in a scenario, but the real reward is just the randomness of the humor.\n\nMcPixel is an idiot. That's his whole character. He pees on things, he gets drunk easily, he chugs coffee and imitates Cornholio, he dry-humps PlayStation 3 consoles to Benny Hill Yakkety Sax music. McPixel greets people by kicking them in the groin. The whole point of the game is to have a laugh at how ridiculous the "solutions" are, and also the -many- failures you'll go through to find them.\n\nThis is literally a flash game - that's not a secret. It plays like one, but gripping gameplay isn't the point. For 5$, it helped me kill a few afternoons and I found it very entertaining. You can't go wrong and losing is half the fun in this game.","August 16, 2015","true","3.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Its a throw back game with clunky graphics and a repeating theme song that reminds me of Mario. Game play is simple point and click with limited choices.\n\nSo how is it so AWESOME! Might be my favorite game from the sale. The game is even better played with friends. Its not multiplayer. Have some friends gather around a pc or laptop, take turns guessing the actions, and then laugh out loud at each other.\n\nThis game will be a cult classic. Sooner or later some college kids will turn it into a drinking game and it will take off.\n\nI expected to not like the game, wanted to lurk for cards, and ended up LOVING IT!! It is not your typical game. I take it as a tongue in cheek game that does weird things. If you ever watched Perferct Hair Forever, and liked that show, you can love McPixel.\n\nBuy it. Expect nothing from it, Play it with other people.

I've tried playing this game a few times but I just can't take more than 5 minutes of it before getting frustrated and closing it. I want to like this game, I really do, It genuinely made me laugh once or twice and the humor is definitely something that I'm into. The only problem is the gameplay, of which there more or less isn't any. It consists of playing through different scenes, each which have a few different things you can click on. Most of the time some of those things will be impossible to differentiate from the background and you end up clicking on the same exect things over and over again as you look for other objects or try to click on objects that seem logical but just so happen to be incorrect because they are too close to something else.\n\nAs everyone else says, there is no logic. I thought they were joking around and that the solutions would make sense after you finish and I would be able to figure them out, but that's not how it works. Everything in this game is completely random with no logic whatsoever. You could click on any object and any concieveable thing could happen. There is no thinking in this game, there is no way to win other than through sheer blind luck and patience by clicking any object you can.\n\nAgain, I really wanted to like this game, but it just was too obnoxious for me to actually try to dedicate time to. Maybe I'll try playing it again in the future, but for now I just can't reccomend it.","February 4, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the puzzles make no sense at all, so the only option is to try everything until the level succeeds. The point of the game is that every interaction is completely unexpected and funny.\n\nThere are usually from 3 to 5 objects in one level and about one of them can be picked up and used for interacting with the rest of the objects. One or two interactions can take place on each level until you either win or lose it.\n\nA typical puzzle goes like this: you are in a plane with a nuclear bomb, a snake and a shovel. If you click the bomb, the snake tries to eat it but cannot, because it's too big. If you click the snake, it bites you and the bomb explodes meanwhile. The solution is to pick up the shovel and then click the bomb, at which point McPixel uses the shovel to shove the bomb down the snake's throat (if snakes can be said to have throats), and then the bomb safely explodes in the snake's belly.","July 23, 2013","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game is gloriously stupid, patently ridiculous, an absolutely hilarious. It's good enough to need three adverbs.\n\nYou play as McPixel, I think, who is a MacGuyver/MacGruber type protagonist who only has thirty seconds to stop things from exploding. The gameplay is very simple point and click adventure style, the graphics are old school pixel art, and the music is something you expect from an Atari 2600 title, but all of it works perfectly together.\n\nThe puzzles are simple, yet clever. It's worth getting them wrong just for the hilarity of the consequences. I've been slapped by Buddah, had a cow fall in love with me, fed a hot dog to a pot-smoking alien, and made a man poop dynamite in the span of five minutes.\n\nThis game is absolutely worth $1.99. I haven't played long enough to know if it's worth the full price, but considering I've already laughed more at this than I would at most modern comedy movies in a theater, I'm going to tentatively say that yes. Yes it is. The developer has been really great about getting the word out about this game by giving out at least a couple hundred copies, and I really hope it pays off. I would definitely play more of his/her stuff.\n\nFor a simple, funny, pick-up-an-go game, McPixel delivers. And then explodes. Often. I really can't overstate how many explosions you'll see in this game.","November 30, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the puzzles make no sense at all, so the only option is to try everything until the level succeeds. The point of the game is that every interaction is completely unexpected and funny.\n\nThere are usually from 3 to 5 objects in one level and about one of them can be picked up and used for interacting with the rest of the objects. One or two interactions can take place on each level until you either win or lose it.\n\nA typical puzzle goes like this: you are in a plane with a nuclear bomb, a snake and a shovel. If you click the bomb, the snake tries to eat it but cannot, because it's too big. If you click the snake, it bites you and the bomb explodes meanwhile. The solution is to pick up the shovel and then click the bomb, at which point McPixel uses the shovel to shove the bomb down the snake's throat (if snakes can be said to have throats), and then the bomb safely explodes in the snake's belly.","July 23, 2013","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game is gloriously stupid, patently ridiculous, an absolutely hilarious. It's good enough to need three adverbs.\n\nYou play as McPixel, I think, who is a MacGuyver/MacGruber type protagonist who only has thirty seconds to stop things from exploding. The gameplay is very simple point and click adventure style, the graphics are old school pixel art, and the music is something you expect from an Atari 2600 title, but all of it works perfectly together.\n\nThe puzzles are simple, yet clever. It's worth getting them wrong just for the hilarity of the consequences. I've been slapped by Buddah, had a cow fall in love with me, fed a hot dog to a pot-smoking alien, and made a man poop dynamite in the span of five minutes.\n\nThis game is absolutely worth $1.99. I haven't played long enough to know if it's worth the full price, but considering I've already laughed more at this than I would at most modern comedy movies in a theater, I'm going to tentatively say that yes. Yes it is. The developer has been really great about getting the word out about this game by giving out at least a couple hundred copies, and I really hope it pays off. I would definitely play more of his/her stuff.\n\nFor a simple, funny, pick-up-an-go game, McPixel delivers. And then explodes. Often. I really can't overstate how many explosions you'll see in this game.","November 30, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it's more a point-and-click game than an adventure. Actually there is no story. Although it has a story mode. You have to solve puzzles within 20 seconds. There is a queue of six puzzles where you circle around until you solve all of them. Then you go on to an other queue. So it's a more like a fast-paced casual game. The puzzles are often not very logical but funny. Unfortunately the jokes are sometimes very dull. The humour is a little bit like Monty Python.

While the actual gameplay may come off as "randomly pick the right choice," The real eye catcher with McPixel is just seeing how many wacky and unexpected scenarios that can unfold when you interact with items and characters. The graphics are depicted as sort of a crude 8-bit design, but that actually works to the game's comedic and random standpoint. And of course the ever present free DLC adds even more comedy and chaos to what is already an outrageous game.\n\nYou'll come in for the seemingly impossible challenges, but you'll stay for the laughs and hijynx.","December 21, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
