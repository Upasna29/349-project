There should be a way to play against NPCs but it relies too heavily on the community multi-player. Basically they took a niche audience (Kaiji lovers) and tried to make them a game that requires a much larger audience. I love Kaiji to death, but this game won't work like this. I'd rather play a table-top version with real cards.\nZawa~ Zawa~\n::review made while listening to the song Espoir::","August 26, 2015","false","0.8"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SphereCube/recommended/364960/","SphereCube","Dr. Whoop DSc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SphereCube/","246 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA very fun game only let down by the lack of players.\n\nI haven't watched the anime that the game is based on, which may have helped with the learning curve, but once you get passed that it's a nice and surprisingly deep game full of backroom deals, mind-games and tactics between players. The ‘rock paper scissors’ mechanic merely provides context to all the stuff happening around it and shouldn’t be confused as being the main part of the game.\n\nUnfortunately, because the game is so heavily based around player interaction, a single-player version of the game as it stands wouldn’t really be possible. This means that (currently) your only real options for playing are creating your own match with friends (who can use the free demo version to connect to your match) or waiting for the weekly organised matches.\n\nHopefully in the future this will be less of a problem and finding matches will be easier. If that happens it could really be something great. As an early access game I have not experienced any bugs and it seems fairly feature rich, just need more players and a nicer UI in some places.\n","September 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
