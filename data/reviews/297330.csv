I made it to 1987 with 30 games and $120K in funds. Then the game announces that I can play through 1987 but no new games will be available which basically means that you arcade has nowhere to go but down. The base gameplay is solid but is lacking details. During my play session, I did find a few things annoying and a few things I would add:\n\n1. There is a "clunk" sound that seems to be reused too much. It sounds like the same sound when your machine is full of money or some kid is bashing on it or the coin slot is jammed.  The problem is you have some kid running around breaking your games (that you have to pay to fix) but that sound could also be something else far less serious. It should be a unique sound like a kid yelling or something.\n\n2. The one employee you can hire is almost useless (but still costs you $800/mo). He will stand around while your machines are full of coins and unable to accept more. You will still have to run around 30 machines emptying the coin boxes over and over and over and over. The jerk won't even re-fill the soda machine. I should be able to pay an emlpoyee more money and have him do a better job. Where are the security guards? Repair techs? By the way, what does the guy at the counter actually do besides nothing?\n\n3. Time passes too fast. True in real life too I suppose.\n\n4. Not enough games or variety of games. There really is no reason this game should end in 1987. Arcades were still viable up through the mid-1990s. The game should start out in 1970 with pinballs then b&w paddle games then on through the 80s with videos and laser-disc games, and end in the 90s with fighting and gun games. It would be nice to see the evolution of the arcade over a 25-year arc. All games over 6-7 years old should be considered classics.\n\n5. There are no redemption-type machines.\n\n6. Why am I limited to 30 games? There is floor space for more as it is but you should the option to expand your space.\n\n7. Why can't I advertise? Even lemonade stand on the Apple II had this feature. Radio? TV? Flyers? I want to spend some of my scrilla to promote my arcade to make...more...scrilla. How about holding tournaments?\n\n8. There should be an option to set the games to free play or nickel play and maybe an option to charge an admission.\n\n9. When I saved my game (oh yeah.. why only 1 save game slot?) I had a 5-star arcade. When I loaded it back, I had a 3-star arcade. WTF? I am anxiously awaiting the day when a computer game can have multiple save slots. If only that technology existed. I tell ya, we can put a man on the moon...\n\n10. Where is the air hockey table? Seriously guys, there is no such thing as a respectible arcade without an air hockey table.\n\n11. Why so few pinball machines and cocktail games? Should not be hard to change the textures to make more. While on the subject, there should be several newly released  games to choose from each month including uprights, cocktails, cockpit, pinballs, etc. One measly new game option per month (or some months, none) is not compelling.\n\nAnyhow, this is a good game. It is fun but ultimately the lack of content and very limited flexibility (oh boy I can buy a pumpkin head and a christmas tree) does let it down. In my case, once I got to 1987 and had a successful arcade, there really is no compelling reason to play it again. Recommnded but just barely.","October 30, 2014","true","11.7"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"

Until about 3 hours go by, and you realize that there are no more upgrades for anything and you have to spend literally 100% of your time just holding the space bar to empty coins from machines. I kept playing, waiting for a larger space/arcade to unlock, something. I actually came to the forums to see what I was doing wrong because nothing was progressing- but then I found out that it's just how the game is.\n\nIt feels very incomplete. If the game simply progressed to unlock a bigger space (and therefore more machines, which you can only have 30 of) it would be a big thumbs up but still feel lacking. As is, this feels like about 1/4th of a game.

It is not, in fact, a simulation game.  It is very casual, and is more a button masher than a simluation.\n\nAs a kid who grew up in the 80's and the heyday of arcades, I always wanted to own an arcade.  Being able to pick the games you place, the atmosphere, decorum, ticket prizes, food/beer selection, advertising and promoting it, being able to throw private parties at one...these are all exciting and intruiging ideas to me.  I would quite enjoy the ability to make a custom arcade and to see how well it could actually do based on these choices.\n\nUnfortunately, this game only scratches the sruface of those ideas.  You do not serve food/drinks, you have an extremely limited number of games you can purchase, and the decoum is nice looking, but limited.  "Maintenance" on a machine involves picking the machine up and hammering the button several times until it starts to work again.   You do not build an arcade, you have a pre-defined space with limited choices on what you can do.  Want a huge two-story mega-arcade?  Can't happen.  The layout of the arcade is the same for every game, so the replay value is extremely low.\n\nOn top of the lack of building options, there isn't really much of a simulation happening here.  What you see on the screen is not what is occuring behind the scenes, and machines will generate money all day, even when no one is playing.  There seems to be little strategy involved other than "get the best machines in different genres" and you win.\n\nOverall I was pretty disappointed, and hope one day we can in fact get an arcade simulator.  Unfortunately, this is not it.","November 29, 2014","false","2.4"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","26","33","0","0"

PERFECT idea for a videogame. Unfortunately, Arcadecraft is much less exciting than I had hoped. From what I understand, this was originally an X360 downloadable game - and it shows. The entire game is so limited and there is hardly anything you can do. You buy cabinets (which are all based on actual titles), put them in your arcade and then you wait. If you got the extra cash you buy a vending machine and a jukebox and then you wait some more. Once you got those basics down, you can expand your powerbox to put up more cabs or add some style to your place and that is it. Occasionally a coinbox is full and needs to be emptied or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kid breaks a machine, you take care of that and wait some more. And once you got a good start in the early 80ies you are good to go til the end, repeating the same things until 1987 comes and the game tells you "yeah... uh, we didn't bother to make it any longer, so... uh... you win, I guess!?".\n\nIt all seems rather pointless. Once the arcade-nostalgia wears off, there is very little going for Arcadecraft - the limitations bring it down (only interaction with your customers is throwing them out, and adjust pricing and difficulty on the machines will make them play more or less) and the samey approach kills all replayability (buy new cabs (released in the same order every time), trash the old ones - rinse and repeat).\n\nI did get an hour worth of arcade-nostalgia from the game, the rest was tedium (somewhat clunky console-UI included). Don't bother with it.","July 13, 2015","false","5.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

There is no replay value what so ever other than\ntrying to obtain a better high score.\n2) There is a lot to be desiered. I had no struggle what so ever with the game. I just kept getting the newst game\nand it was fine. I even got board and bought all the custimizations you can.\n3) There is no indepth system. Now on this i dont blame them cause after i played "Game dev tycoon"\nI relized that they had the same flaw. You see to me making a simulation game needs to be indepth. A drag and\ndrop or a slide meter (in the case of game dev) does not really make it a simulation. Yah you can change how much the\ngames cost to play. However that leads me to 4\n4) no matter what happens if you rasie the price it seems like your doomed. I had 5 Star popularity from like year to\nand all i did was drop each game diff. to easy and made it a quarter thats it.\n\nIn counclusion. This game lacks what makes a sim game a sim game. Its more of a place your machine here and thats\nreally it. There is no indepth system for you @ all.  I would of like to see some of the following\nMarketing. Choosing your building (maybe certin areas have a preff. to certin genre). People accepting harder diff. games and not making it so your game becomes unprofitable if you do that. These are just a few things.\n\nOh by the way the guy you hire to collect your money Hes lazy. Had to do alot my self.\n\nHowever it is a fun game to play.

Figure it would be similar, but with running an arcade instead of a video game company. After about 12 hours of figuring things out and wasting so much of my time, i finally gave up. The game is nowhere near done, nor worth more then a dollar. There is barely a tutorial to help in the fine details of how the game works. Controls are either slippery or too heavy. I couldn't move anything to where i wanted it without either using the directional keys or practically flailing around with my mouse. Events in game overlap each other to the point where keys tend to freeze and when in the middle of a important action, having the game stop you and drop what you are doing. I have had so many games broken just because when i was taking the problem customer over to the door, the month ended and forced me to let go and the person destroyed it. Pausing is confusing, things still happen during events and menus. Not sure if really paused. Its basically a Facebook game. It’s the worst kind of time waster where I sit here tending to the machines without really interacting with them. Their stats (If they really are stats) have no meaning. They say if I put games in certain configurations, I can maximize popularity. Through all my tests and random ideas, never have I saw a difference in any configuration. It’s like RCT, you put the ride down, it gets popular for a while, then people get bored and you replace it. Except here, the money is so much tighter that after the first two months, your poor as ♥♥♥♥. It is almost impossible to come up positive at the end of the two months. You are going to sell 75% of your games and slowly watch helplessly as the game closes in on you. And even better, when I sold my last game, I just broke even and the game continued. I couldn’t do anything for a month, I had 0$, no games, no vending, and yet still no game over. If I was patient enough, I would have sat there waiting to see what happens. But no, its not worth my time. The best part of the game is the variations of arcade games you can buy… then they ruin that too. It’s the usual cabinets with different textures, no super special games like DDR or Gun games, No fighting games, Overly expensive pinball (only one) game, and a racing game that is also too expensive, but is the most interesting game to look at. I hate to ramble on, but there is so much more. The characters you choose are bland and boring. It’s so bland, why isn’t there a character creation? It would make it slightly better? And the pop machine is a joke. It makes the least amount of money and has to be maintenance every 2 months. It’s a waste. There is this huge space for games and such, but I have only ever been able to fill a small corner (barely) with games. By the time I can afford a new one, I sold like two. Also that god damn post in the middle of the screen drives me crazy. This might just be me, but that post makes movement around the screen harder than it already is and is a general design flaw in my eyes. There is probably more issues im forgetting but this is my biggest problems.\n\nTL;DR – Play a Facebook game, it’s the same but more stable than this. Still better built then Ride to hell.\n","May 23, 2014","false","14.6"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","33","55","0","0"

Ranging from games getting released on consoles to angry gamers taking it out on your machines, there are a number of factors that make this game hard but fun. One aspect I am sure is designed to keep you occupied while time passes is the collecting of quarters from your machines. I wish there was a way to automate that a bit as I feel like I spend most of my time shaking down my machines of their money and less time worrying about game placement, getting new games, or changing decorations around.\n\nTime passes by slowly enough to give you a chance to keep moving your games around and taking care of unruly gamers but I feel like I never have enough money to keep fresh games in stock. While older games can inherit a "classic" status that boosts popularity of your arcade, it does not feel like its enough. Little events that occur seem to happen randomly but not random enough to break the monotony of collecting quarters. Some of these events can vary from power failures (pick up every machine and set them back down) to a stuck coin slot (repeatedly pick and set down a game to eventually free the coin slot). Occasionally a hardcore gamer will come in and try for a record high score which boost a game's popularity but the catch is the game is tied for a long time while the gamer tries for their high score.\n\nI wish games you unlocked stayed unlocked through multiple playthroughs because seeing the same set of three games every time you restart your arcade gets tiresome. Restarting your game is expected as the tutorial does not explain everything and you are likely to overspend your money and find yourself hurting to get by every month. In the end, the game is fun but I am just not sure how long the fun will last. I feel as if more novelty is needed to really hook me. Also, I wish I could rotate my view of the arcade because certain games are hard to see when placed behind other games or pillars and it can be hard to target them for collecting money or fixing.\n\nThe game does a good job at keeping you informed at the little details of a game like graphics style, if it has become profitable, changing the games difficulty and cost. I think more positive events in the game and making money a bit easier to do would improve the game to more fun event and less like a chore to play. It definitely does a good job at capturing the feel of owning an arcade but includes the dangers of owning one all too well. After playing this, one could easily become disillusioned with owning their arcade.","May 27, 2014","true","1.6"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","0"

The idea of having your own arcade is probably a fun idea for a lot of us that enjoy playing video games and this is supposed to provide a good fun simulation of it.\n\nUnlike another similar store simluation game, Recettear, Arcadecraft unfortunatly suffers from almost all aspect of what you should NOT do in this type of game. The idea sounds simple, buy arcade cabinets, set a price and hope you will make a profit from it. But in this game, it seems none of what you do matter and all it is becomes a repetitive dread of hitting spacebar, tab, and enter.\n\nUnlike Recettear, there is no point in choosing which cabinet to buy or to find an optimum price or placement of the machine, despite what the game tells you that it does. All you need to do is to save up enough money to buy one of each cabinet, set it in the store, and start smashing spacebar to collect money. Any price/difficulty other than the default will result in an un-optimum pay rates and it seems like cabinet placement gives little incentive/consequence to how popular it will be.\n\nUnless you are aiming for a high score to compare to other people, there is really no point or incentive to keep on playing the game. If you can surive the first year with any profits, then you can't possibly lose the game if you just sell the old machine and replace them with new machines.

After getting frustrated trying to work the difficulty and quarter algorithms, I realized the way to play this game is to just leave it alone. Literally, leave it alone. This game begins as a semi-AFK arcade simulator where you drop machines, wait til they gather 400 coins, and then farm the machines. You panic somewhere in the middle when, for some stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason, the bank doesn't pull payments from you, and instead demands your loan in full upfront. This is not made known to the player until about 6 months before the loan is due, which still creates a crazy tough hardship in your arcade. I had to restart twice to be able to pay the loan.\n\nThe good news? Once you pay your stupid damn loan, now your arcade is too profitable. You'll hit 1983 and all of the sudden you have $60,000 in your bank at all times. This will undeniably happen because of how easy the game becomes during the 1982 "arcade boom". The game goes from 100 to 0 really quickly. It's just not fun once you have loads of money and the most successful arcade only halfway through the game.

First, the opportunity to manage a video arcade in the 80's is already an excellent idea. It's true the game gets a bit repetitive and lacks real goals once you refund your initial loan. I still love the game for itself, the atmosphere, the mechanic, the arcade games, and moreover, for the music that's not in it: play the game with some carefully chosen 80's music, and the whole becomes a tremendous experience. With the 80's arcade room background, you can find music that fits the game so well, that you'll end up launching the game just for the pair it forms with the music.\n\nThis music can easily be found: just launch Spotify and search playlists named "arcadecraft". You'll find 32 of them, going along the 8 years timeline of the game (1980-1987) each in 4 genres: beats, guitars, synths and voices.

Individual machines have popularity, which usually increases when the game is cheap/easy. However, increasing the games price per-play seems to make it's popularity take a nose dive, as well as increasing the games difficulty yields the same result (I have absolutely no idea what the direct benefit is to increasing a games difficulty anyways). This typically ends up having all of your machines being very cheap, and very easy, ensuring that you have people playing them all the time. Unfortunately, even keeping all machines occupied as much as possible for an entire month, never seems to yield you much of a profit. Couple this with the fact that moving or empyting the machine seems to force the current player off losing that one sale, and the random "events" like repairing a broken machine, makes it so you can only ever break even with your expenses.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad, but new machines unlock at the end of every month, giving you the idea that you should constantly be buying new games for your arcade. Instead it simply taunts you, showing you shiny new toys that are forever out of your pitiful financial grasp.\n\nI also feel like some sort of graph or chart to illustrate each games strengths and weaknesses would be nice. In its place you have to read a wall of text just to understand what it is you're purchasing exactly, which doens't seem to make any lick of difference what-so-ever in the games popularty.\n\nTL;DR - Don't buy this game, its just a glorified click fest that loses its luster very quickly","May 22, 2014","false","0.8"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

Keep looking.\n\nThe basica mechanics of this game works, but that's just it, the mechanics are very basic. You put down some machines and they'll start generating money based on the set difficulty and price, whether anyone is using them or not. Customers teleport (you'd think with fancy 3d graphics it might have some walking animations but nope) in to a machine, play a bit and then back out, occasionally one will hit a machine and you'll have to throw him out, that's as far as the customer interaction goes.\n\nSure, you can tweak the apperance of the arcade and some other stuff to make it more popular and thus increase the rate at which money is generated by your machines but still, mechanics are far too simple to be worth your time.\n\nCertainly wouldn't blame anyone for mistaking it for an early access title. I suspect what it really is though is a hasty job to put  a simplified management style game on a console, haven't bother looking it up but with the way the controls work I highly doubt putting it on PC was more than an afterthought.","July 14, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sounds like a great concept for a game, right? You name your arcade and need to buy some games for your customers to play. To make money, you need to keep your games popular, adjusting their prices and difficulty. You'll also need to keep them in working order and replace older machines with the latest popular games. But hold it - some old games can become classics, and they can give your popularity a bonus, as well as increase the popularity of that specific game. So what's wrong with this game?\n\nThis Game is Too Hard!\nThis game is challenging, but for all the wrong reasons. Many of the game's features are stacked against you and there's little you can do about it. For example - if you get a specific game to be really popular, the logical thing to do would be to raise its price or make it harder to increase your profits. But in game, it doesn't work at all - even daring to increase price or difficulty one notch will bring the game crashing down. Now let me ask the developers - if changing price or difficulty is useless to do, then WHY IS THIS FEATURE IN THE GAME?!\n\nThe games get a popularity bonus if they are placed next to their own sequels, and your arcade becomes more popular if you have a selection of genres available to play. But there is only minimal indication of this in-game. There is little warning that some games are sequels (Qualify Lap and Fuel Injection, despite both being racing games from the same company, and being the came cabinet with a pallet swap, are NOT related!) or if a game will have a sequel at all, and there is no way to view the overall genre makeup of your arcade (is a screen showing 3 platformer, 5 sports, 4 shooter, 2 racing too much to ask?). Unless you manually check every game you own, you're not going to know. Same thing with classics - some classics become big money earners, but others are a useless game with a fancy title. Oh, randomly some collector with offer you cash for a classic game. Can you view this game before deciding, so as to weigh the decision? Nope!\n\nBut once you learn how to play and what features to use (sequels, arcade customizing) and not use (pricing, difficulty) then you uncover a different problem...\n\nThis Game is Too Easy!\nI can hear you already: "You just said it's too hard! Now you say it's too easy?! Pick one, ♥♥♥♥♥!"\n\nBut really, this is one of those games that's "hard to learn, easy to master". Once you understand which games become classic money spinners, have sequels, etc.  then no challenge remains. The moment you pay off your debt, the game might as well stop and declare you the winner, because there is nothing to stop you after that. Oh, there IS stuff to do - make sure you move an arcade cabinet to an arbitrary spot, manually empty change boxes, and fix broken games. Seriously, what was the point of all these "features"? It's just tedious busywork stopping you from leaving the game running. Did we really need random power outages, which do nothing but make you click each cabinet twice?\n\nThis game could've been quite fun. This game should've been fun. But as it stands, it's a waste of $12.99.","June 29, 2014","false","7.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The popularity stars on the games seem to plummet before six months and well before they've even paid for themselves, and increasing the difficulty or charging more for new games is a death sentence. Even having high total arcade popularity dosen't seem to make a difference.\n\nThe fundamental elements of strategy games are non-existent here. There's no contol of time (not even pausing), no graphs (not that you'd have the time to view them anyway), and popularity is a joke. There's no control of lighting, placement (in reguards to machines near bathrooms or enterance) is meaningless, and besides the games themselves there's only a cola machine and a jukebox. When I first started playing I bought a vending machine thinking it would provide sugar for the kids and I could jack the price for convience. I decided to put it near the bathroom thinking that games wouldn't do well there, only to find once I placed the machine it was day 10 already. The vending didn't make a difference on the kids (sugar seems to have no value) and it's run just like any other machine. The kids don't seem to care if food is available, they don't care if they are near the bathroom, they don't notice machines near the entrance first, they just magically warp to the machines. Their feedback is minimal.\n\nInstead of strategy you get clicking busy work. Oh no, the power went out! You have to replug all the machines, which takes a whole day apparently. You're not making any money because you haven't been manually emptying every machine yourself, which makes that game unplayable for a bit too. Better look out, a kid is breaking the machines and you have to throw him out, if you've taken a moment to read something he can easily smash three machines before you get to him, goodbye $500 in repairs. All of these examples would be fine, with time control. Without the ability to pause you're franticly clicking and don't have time to check your options before you buy new equipment, or a moment to breath and organize the room. Occassionaly a star will appear on a tile for a short while, if you scramble to put a machine there before the star disappears the machine mystically becomes more popular till the end of the month. What great strategy.\n\nI scraped by month after month with $800 to spare when the game wanted $13,000 for a loan payment. Ugh. Again, that would be fine if I could take a moment to figure out what I did wrong, but business RTS is just not a good mix.\n\nI advise you take this game's own advice. When Arcadecraft is easier and going for $.25 it's popularity should go up, until then, don't touch it.","June 22, 2014","false","1.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Oddly enough, that's somehow fitting for an "arcade" experience.  (although I'm sure this may annoy someone looking for a more laid back experience)\n\n2) The in-game arcade cabinents are really good counterparts to ones in the real world.  I can name just about every single cabinent.\n\nThings that would make this game better:\n\n1) Interface adjustments to make sure icons are always visible, especially when the pillar or entrance is in the way.\n\n2) More interesting game game modes, so there isn't just a single difficulty hump.

I'm  not exactly sure what I expected here.  I've been a fan of both management style games and old school arcades for some tame.  This game barely delivered either.\n\nOn the first point, the management in this game is minimal making the entire game too easy by far.  Ultimately all you do is make sure you buy a new game or two every month, upgrade the few upgrades you can when you can, then spend the rest of the time clicking on machines as they fill with quarters/need a repair.  The scant challenges and decisions that don't involve your machines are either mundane or just a break in the flow of... well OK it's a welcome change from just draining quarters from stuffed machines.\n\nOn the second, unless you know the history of arcades there is very little to glean over your scant seven year run as an arcade owner.  It makes nods to the video game crash, gives a few details when certain games got popular and declined, and does little else to educate a younger crowd into the way things were.\n\nThis game is certainly something that would be better off staying  on a tablet or mobile phone.  If it expanded how you interacted with the arcade, let you manage more employees, expand your shop beyond the definitions of your initial arcade, let you run your arcade as long as you choose to the current day (And of course adding more examples of arcade history, through parody of course), then you'd have something for PC.

We're talking FTL hard!  I've only been able to survive 2 years (1980 & 1981), which in game time is not all that long.  I've tried numerous techniques, concentrating on just buying games, sprucing up the place more than buying games, buying vending machines along with games, and an amalgamation of all of the above.   The result is always the same.  You lose.\n\nAnd that's the problem.  The game doesn't seem to allow you to portray any semblance of a successful arcade of the time.  I have only ever been able to max the number of arcade machines owned at 6, and that my friend, doesn't remind me of a booming arcade of the era.\n\nI don't mind hard games like FTL if the experience feels rewarding as you play.  Unfortunately the balance between the amount of money you receive in Arcadecraft, and it's various pricing structures of things you need to buy, are highly unbalanced.  You're always poor.  In fact, this causes the game to feel unrewarding past the first 3 or 4 months in game time.  You boom for the first few months, but then every month after that you slowly watch your Arcade decay into nothingness.  I've seen arcades that have been successful for years and that's not the case in Arcadecraft.  [Quick Note:  Even when you run out of arcade machines, because you had to sell them all to pay off debt, and you have no other way to make any more money, you have to watch a lonely representation of yourself sit behind a counter watching the days roll by.  The game itself doesn't realize the endgame has come and lets you live a couple extra months with nothing to do before the inevitable end.  OK, you could also just restart the game.]\n\nAnd maybe that's the point of the game.  To let you know how futile it is to open an arcade.  Maybe the game is trying to show you historically how stupid the dream of owning an Arcade really was.  I on the other hand, want to remember Arcades as they were to me, a fun place to get my game on and to hang out with my buddies!  And being provided the tools to create my own Arcade, I want to provide my virtual people with that same kind of fun.  If this game took a queue from more successful sim titles like Sim City, or even Rockstar Ate My Hamster, this would be more fun.  Mainly because history doesn't have to repeat itself.\n\nAs it is, I can recommend Arcadecraft as a "pretty to look at" diversion, and a short enjoyable piece of nostalgia.

In that regard, it's difficult to build up a large amount of cash on hand, so you end up forced to sell off a bunch of games to pay off the loan, after which the games you have left aren't making enough money to allow you to build back up and you go bankrupt.  On top of that, the games break, or are broken, occasionally and need repairs, so the games aren't very profitable in the long run.\n\nI'm sure there's a way to figure it out and make it work, but i bought this for a casual game of mind-numbing fun, not a tedious game of intricate book-keeping.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun build-a-company style game, I prefer Game Dev Tycoon.  If you want a build-a-company style game with a little RPG adventure thrown in, get Racettear.","December 28, 2014","false","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What I liked about it was  being able to design your own arcade with a variety of games you can choose from. It's cool being able to set up the arcade to maximize profits. It reminds me a lot of those old sim games, like sim-hospital, where you kinda have to think ahead in design and utilization of space in order to succeed.\n\nAs I mentioned, the game can get very addictive. You constantly have to keep up a stream of cash flow to pay the rent and to keep your arcade up-to-date. It's not easy and games lose their appeal to customers quickly. You're often forced to resort to selling older, less popular games in order to keep up with the trends. As you progress, you can change the design of the arcade and even move into different locations.\n\nSurprisingly, there's more to do than to just place arcade cabinets and collect money. For example, you may have to eject an unruly customer, repair machines, keep vending machines stocked, clear coin jams, and constantly empty coin banks to keep the machines running.\n\nI didn't have a problem with the price considering that this was a finished, full game and I did not encounter any bugs or problems playing it.","May 22, 2014","true","5.8"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

By the time the 2 years is up on the loan, its virtually impossible to be in the black. I don't say this with a sense of bravado: after failing on multiple attempts, I looked up strategies online, and found that I am not the only one suffering from this problem. In the trainers that do describe strategy, they are describing strategies that work on the original platform, rather than the steam version. I followed these trainers to the letter... they say you can get $1500 / mo on soda if you charge $1. Yet I received $2600 on soda after TWO YEARS. Clearly the developers thought that this was an exploit, and "patched" it, only to make their game impossible to win.\n\nThe difficulty is definitely much higher on the Steam release than the original platform. I find that game cabinet placement almost never gives more than 1 star. So-called "Classic" games don't noticably offer more business or revenue  or even much of a popularity bonus to themselves, despite claims by the game hintboxes, that they do.\n\nSo in the end: unwinable game, negative review. Some of you might cry foul at this, or that I simply didn't find "the right way", but even if that were true (and I don't believe that it is), a simulation game with only one way to win, doesn't seem like a good simulation game to me. It should be as-if I owned and was running an arcade, not a test of my ability to read the minds of the developers.\n\nUnless you want a Sisyphus simulator of grind-tastic unwinableness, buy a different game. This one is a waste of time and money.","January 4, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I understand this is a way to keep the play active instead of just staring at the screen, but we should at least be able to collect money by holding space and quickly move from a machine to another.\n\n- When moving a game, you can move on a tile where there is already a game. Although i understand the fact that you don't want us to put two games on the same tile, i think it should just make the moved game red and transparent, instead of preventing you from going on that tile. Because of that, you are forced to navigate through the maze of your machines in order to place the one you are currently moving, and this is not intuitive nore pleasant.\n\n- In the same spirit, let us move the cursor through pillars and desk. If i put a row of games against the right wall for instance, everytime i want to collect moneay, i'm forced to go around the pillar instead of just going through it. Considering that you have to move this cursor a lot in order to get your money, i think that this king of tweak is quite important.\n\nNevertheless, this is a nice game but in its current state, i'd say it's worth 6€. I just hope devs love it enough to improve it and make it even better :)","March 9","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
