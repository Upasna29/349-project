"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gzalzi/recommended/23300/","Gzalzi","Tralan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gzalzi/","549 products in account","Yosumin! has a lot of things going for it, like the audio design, but it fails in the most important part of a puzzle game: gameplay.\n\nYosumin!'s gameplay is simple and repetitive. You simply have to make rectangles with a yosumin in each corner, regardless of what is in the middle of the shape (aside from some bonuses like extra level time or alternate objectives). The way the yosumin populate the board is completely random aside from a few unlockable modifier "treats" that don't affect the board that much. Such randomness isn't as much as a problem in games where you can "outskill" the board generation like Dungeon Hearts or Hexic, but Yosumin! doesn't have such tactical depth. The deepest the tactics go is removing all of a specific yosumin from the board to hope you can get all of the same type of yosumin in the corners to create an entire board clear (Yosumin!). Wingmen (pieces you can move anywhere) only become available after the first world and don't appear often enough to add any significant tactical depth to the game. The lack of depth causes the game to have a poor difficulty curve, shifting between laughably easy and annoyingly difficult as you eye your way through the board looking for matches.\n\nApart from the gameplay, though, Yosumin! hits all the right buttons. The menus are responsive and easy to navigate, the control in game is smooth and fluid, offering different styles of selecting yosumin to fit multiple gameplay styles, and the aesthetic is great.\n\nThe art is simple and clean, with no problems, but where the game really shines is its sound design. All the sound effects are satisfying and aid in enjoyment of the game. The yosumin themselves are cute and make cute sound effects that made me find myself smiling while playing. The best part in the game is the soundtrack though; the music is wonderful, reminding me of classic games like Katamari Damacy,  and while it doesn't seem to have that many tracks, I found myself playing just to listen to the music.\n\n\nOverall Yosumin! isn't that bad of a game, but I can't give it my recommendation to anyone looking for an interesting puzzle game. The gameplay is just too simple and Yosumin! ends up being more of an occasional time waster suited more to mobile devices than a puzzle game you want to sit down and play for more than ten minutes. If just an easy game to have open and occasionally mess around with is what you're looking for, Yosumin! might be for you, but for the puzzle game fan who wants to think and be challenged, look somewhere else.\n\nPS: There is no support for this game from Square anymore. The leaderboards do not function and don't expect to have any achievements or cards any time soon. It also commits the cardinal sins of Japanese-made games by having Escape instantly close the game and lacking any support for resolutions above 800x600 without stretching.","December 28, 2015","false","5.0"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/23300/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:Yosumin is a cute-styled casual puzzler made by Square Enix. Big name in game development would deserve a way better game but Yosumin just feels like a casual Popcap game, where all their fun and entertainment disappeared into cute budget. You will hear "Yay!" "Woo!" but you won't feel like that. You will just make another rectangle, then another and then another.\n\nIt's not fun. It's not motivating enough to keep you playing, level objectives are just varieties of tasks like: make a green rectangle, make a red rectangle, make a small rectangle, etc...\n\nSeriously, if that's supposed to be the "Square Enix's puzzle masterpiece" (as mentioned in game description), I think they should improve a lot in this genre to truly bring a puzzle masterpiece.\n\nPros:- Cute. Yosumins are cute. Yosumins have cute sounds and cute graphics. You might like it but you might start to hate it even after few minutes of playing.\n- Adventure mode.\n- Many levels.\n\nCons:- Repetitive gameplay. That's the main thing that kills all the fun in Yosumin. You'll get bored in few minutes.\n- It's made for low resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio. You'll want to play it on windowed mode if you don't want everything looking poor.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","December 30, 2015","false","1.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/23300/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Another variant on the block puzzler genre, Yosumin! sees you play on a 9x9 grid of blocks where you have to click on four blocks of the same shape/colour to describe the corners of a square or rectangle, which transforms all blocks within that space into the same colour as the selected corner blocks before removing all those blocks then replacing them with another mix of blocks. BLOCKS!\n\nEach stage sets you objectives, ranging from the simplistic, like removing a quota of specific coloured blocks, to the more challenging, such as clearing an entire board with one move (this move being where the game gets its name, in the same way Tetris is the name given to clearing the maximum of four lines in a single drop), with each stage being cleared by completing all of these objectives.\n\nThe whole things starts off at a very basic, and even mundane degree of difficulty as you breeze through the majority of the opening stages in the space of a couple of minutes, but by the final quarter or so of the game this is turned on its head as the ever strangling time limit can soon grind you down unless you have very sharp eyes or a lot of luck finding the right blocks to match. This deceptively high difficulty spike of the final stages seems very at odds with the Ã¼ber casual, child-friendly presentation of every aspect of the title and may see many quit before reaching the end, even with the extra added help of bonus unlocks which act as perks to aid in varying elements of play.\n\nBut even if you do quit by then, ultimately you're not really going to miss out on all that much. The opening few hours play much the same as the final hours save for some minor added elements and complications added to proceedings that actually change things very little of the game beyond its initial premise. So a pretty throwaway, repetitive, yet inoffensive title (except for maybe the audio, which you might want to mute) that might not stick with you too long after you play it, but which still holds some fun for those looking for their quick puzzle fix to dip in and out of. Pick it up when it's cheap, play it, enjoy it a little, forget about it, move on with your life.

Collect X amount of coloured blocks in zone 1, make 4 squares in zone 2, collect X amount of stained glass peices, etc.....  It's pretty well the same each level, except another colour is introduced.\n\nYou are also given different powers to help each level, but those powers are very weak and don't see to improve much on what they say they are suppose to improve (not to a noticable level anyways).\n\nThere are things that pop up in the puzzle to make it more difficult.  Theres a character that shuffles all the blocks (actually surprisingly helpful instead of a problem).  As well there can be bigger blocks of various sizes that can be difficult to remove.\n\nAgain this game is incredibly simple.  However if thats the type of puzzle game your looking for, you may want to give this a try.","February 18, 2015","false","12.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

When Square-Enix steps out of their RPG comfort zone, I'm usually impressed.\n\nThere's not much story: a stained glass window of importance to the oddly-shaped creatures shatters, and it's up to Yellowmin and his friends to recover the fragments. To win puzzles, you must create squares using the same shape for all four corners of a square. Each level demands certain parameters for the square, ranging from squares made up of a particular color to Yosumins (using the entire board as a square).\n\nThe graphics are bright, colorful, and clear. There were no issues with how the game presented itself, and the tone stayed relatively consistent throughout the story mode. Music was... meh. There is one level with an atrocious fake rap, but the majority of background music was just that: background.\n\nI would recommend this to puzzle gamers looking for a decent challenge.

There's enough variety in objectives for each level (like matching a certain amount of certain colored pieces, making square matches, making small, standard, or large sets), but the objectives repeat a bit too much and start to feel samey.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melodyhikari/recommended/23300/","melodyhikari","Fluffy Bunny Protag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melodyhikari/","259 products in account","A cute puzzle game, yet it lacks the addicting nature that most matching games tend to. There's barely a semblance of story [though not most puzzle games have such], and it only progresses after you've played about... oh, 40 matches for each stage. Each stage has about 8 levels or so, and each level has 5 rounds to it. Because of this lack of progress being felt, it gets more tedious than other matching puzzle games do. It does have a bit of uniqueness to it, in that the matching gimmick is based off square or rectangular shapes; rather than moving pieces around to make a match nearby, you have to search for four corners in order to make a match. The music, while adding to the cute theme of the game, doesn't really have any memorable traits to it, and the music for when time is running out is kind of annoying more than adding to the rush factor. Transition between rounds is slow, for a matching game that includes a time limit. This adds to the feeling of slow progress, as well as the 40 rounds one must go through in order to see the next piece of the "story" that is meant to tie the game together. Since it's a puzzle game, I won't go on about the little bit of story that I've played through, other than that it's just there for show and doesn't add to the game experience.\nThere's just something missing from this game that makes it as addicting as other matching games. Perhaps the lack of a falling chain/combo, like other matching games have. Where more traditional matching puzzle games have new pieces fall in from above, this one just has them reappear. And since you have to click on the corners in order to make a match, there's some fun missing in having matches just suddenly cascade into a nice combo that completes the level.\n\nOverall, if you don't care much about puzzle games and you find it on sale or in a Humble Bundle, I'd say go for it. But if you like the addicting nature of matching puzzle games, then I would pass on buying it unless you absolutely run out of other games to play or try.","January 7","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gave the game 40 minutes, and it didn't hook me. Puzzle games are supposed to be fun and/or rewarding, but Yosumin just felt like work.\nIn the game, you match blocks (Yosumin) into squares and rectangles from a grid. It involves scanning each line one by one to see if you can find a shape. What sounds simple becomes frustrating as there is a lot of luck as to whether or not you will find enough patterns to reach the target before the timer runs out. Some levels only took 20 seconds to beat as I found them quickly, others, sometimes the same one!, took a few attempts as I scanned the wrong lines and couldn't find matches in time.\nI enjoyed Peggle, Bejeweled had it's charm, and even Zuma's Revenge hooked me for longer, but Yosumin grew tiresome and frustrating too quickly for me to invest any more time into it.
