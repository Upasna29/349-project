"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/375010/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","I would describe this game as a cross between sudoku and crosswords. If this sounds interesting to you, read on!\n_________________________\n\nEnergy Balance takes the standard minimalistic approach as other recent puzzle games do - light on explanations, yet simple in mechanics. The basic levels are also part of a vague story, which I found helped to break up the gameplay and give it a bit of a setting. Your spaceship is in trouble and you've got to fix all the components (engine, cloaking device, etc).\n\nLevels consist of rows and columns of numbers - all linked together. The numbers in each row and column have to add up to the value specified at the end of the line of numbers. The object of the game is to select a number in a row (or column) that doesn't tally correctly, then switch it with a number that will help bring the tally closer to what is required. While this is all you can do, there is actually a lot to it at later levels, often requiring a great deal of thinking on your part.\n\nNormal levels consist of single digits in the +8 to -8 range, but hardcore levels could possibly ask for rows/columns to tally +/-100. (Hardcore #2 was exceptionally hard for me, taking around 2 weeks before I finally got it.)\n\nVarious strategies can be employed to make number swaps work for you. A row that adds correctly, linked to a column that doesn't, may benefit from a swap of the number in the shared square with another from the row, effectively only altering the sum of numbers in the column... whereas a row out by -2 and another row out by +2 might better benefit from a direct swap from one to the other. You might find yourself more likely to be out by +1 though, and in only one spot, making swaps entirely useless.\n\nPerhaps the most fun feature I discovered is that it is impossible to go online hoping to find a solution. Why? Because every time you quit without finishing a level, the numbers will randomise into a new puzzle when you go to try again.\n\nSo when you see someone has 100% achievements for this game, you can be pretty confident they earned it.\n\nI digress though. I have mentioned normal and even hardcore levels, but while they are relatively few in number, they will take time to complete, and there are still further puzzles that are perhaps a bit less taxing and a bit more fun - a kind of reward for getting through hardcore. There is no story accompanying the hardcore or bonus puzzles, but they can still take time to complete, and fill out the game to make it worth its cost.\n\nThe accompanying puzzle music is surprisingly good - I found myself leaving it on more often than not. It has an outer-space feel to it that is enhanced by the background behind the puzzles - a moving, travelling-through-space backdrop that consists of stars passing you by, and a nebula in the distance. It is easy on the eye and doesn't detract from you trying to concentrate on your sums.\n\nIn short, it's a good game for anyone that likes puzzle games, the achievements aren't too difficult and it makes a nice break between larger games such as rpgs. It could benefit from additional puzzles, and perhaps an artwork gallery. 8/10","August 4, 2015","true","33.5"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","5"

You don't beat a Sudoku or a Kakuro with blind guessing, you have to eliminate the alternate possibilities until only one logical conclusion can be drawn...\n\nThis game doesn't do that.  At least, there's no logic underlying it that I've been able to find.  You really can't do anything but put together things that add up to possible answers, with no idea of whether you're screwing yourself over down the road. In short, it's blind guessing-and-checking until eventually you win, which defeats the purpose of a logic puzzle, since there's no real logic to it.\n\nReading the other reviews, even the people who were giving this positive reviews said it was easier to just keep quitting and retrying the puzzles (the numbers are rerandomized each time you start a level) until you get numbers that tend towards extremes to make the possible permutations easier.  Thanks to that, the game largely revolves around "brute force tactics" of just rerolling until you get good numbers, then trying every permutation until one fits.  It makes the game feel frustrating; Rather than like some puzzle you feel clever for solving, it's just something you beat your head against until the puzzle broke first.","September 20, 2015","false","13.3"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","3"

Especially in later levels you really need to think every move through or you'll get stuck pretty fast.\n\nAs everytime you close a level it will be reset to a new configuration you will not be able to copy the puzzle and think about it during your commute or the like, but this also means that once you do get stuck you can simply try again and maybe get something that's easier for you.\n\nThere's some story to this, though I must confess that after the first slow text scrawl I started skipping it altogether, so I can't comment on the quality of the plot.\n\nAltogether I quite enjoy the game :)","February 14","true","41.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

However if you want to complete the hardcore levels, be prepared to whip out some note-taking materials and do some number crunching (and DON'T CLOSE THE MAP). The one walkthrough for this game is basically "how to take notes and use a calculator".\n\nOn the upside, if you DO like to math, the numbers on the puzzles are randomized, and so each map is technically infinitely replayable. This can be frustrating if you have to leave and come back, as the numbers will be reset upon reopening the selected level.\n\nOtherwise, basically sudoku crosswords.\n\nEdit: I would like this a lot more if it had some more inbuilt tools for notes/number/combination tracking like Everyday Genius: SquareLogic (which I loved).","September 19, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are twenty puzzles in all with the first six and last four being pretty easily, the 13-16th set can be difficult or not so bad depending on what the target values are (extreme positive and negatives tend to make it easier). The second row of puzzles can be pretty difficult and I often resorted to leaving it and coming back to get a new set of random numbers/puzzles to see if I got an easier set.\n\nGenerally the interface is limited but functional, but somewhat annoyingly it forgets if you turn the sound off the next time you play, the graphics are not great but they do the job, the storyline was forgettable, although a couple of times the cat's reaction did get a slight chuckle, and there isn't really any variety in the gameplay/puzzles. If you like these sorts of puzzles and given the low price tag it is probably just barely a recommendation.","September 11, 2015","true","10.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You have to balance the energy in order to get them running again and to get home safely.\n\nEnergy Balance is a number puzzle. You have to swap power units in such a way that their sums form correct chains both vertically and horizontally. The game is easy to learn, but very hard to master. So, are you ready to peep under the hood of an alien spaceship?\n\nThe game is pretty much worth and yes it does give you a ton's of fun.\nThe game consists of Trading Cards in which you would be able to craft badges and get amazing background images.\n\nAs for me i would recommand this game to all the "Puzzle" loving gamer's out there.\n\nThank you for reading.","July 23, 2015","true","4.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

You do this by switching numbers around on correct lines so that the crosslines start to add up; sometimes you can switch out numbers with extra spots that aren't used in any sum; and sometimes you need to carefully switch out equal pairs so that you can free up numbers you need elsewhere. The learning curve for this is ultra steep. Each level is randomly generated numbers on a pre-configured grid - if you leave a level, you'll get new random numbers the next time you play it.\n\nSince the audio is a synthetic space background music track, the feedback is purely visual; and that is only in terms of animation, correct squares, lines or results don't change color, they just spawn some fireworks (in addition to some general blinking going on, so don't play this if you're sensitive). It works somewhat because the fireworks along the lines is fairly discernible.\n\nNote that when playing this game, you first have to click through a bunch of dialogue that is you talking to your space cat (press space and a "skip" icon appears), which you will do as you enter each level, each time, before you get to the numbers grid. Your reward for finishing a level is the ability to access the next level and see more space cat dialogue.\n\nThe game is realized with Unity, and it scales up nicely to 1080p fullscreen, or you can play it windowed (albeit non-resizable).\n\nThe problems I see with this game are poor visual feedback, and no audio feedback; a steep learning curve because there are no handcrafted levels that would slowly add difficulty, leaving the player to flounder with trial and error; and I don't like the graphical style and background music much.\n\nRecommended if you like doing simple sums for fun.","July 8, 2015","false","2.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

Restarting to generate another set of random numbers in hopes of getting a better set seems to be the way to win. When you finally get one that doesn't take 20 minutes to solve 1 part after completing all other parts you'll praise RNGesus. I'm serious, this game requires so much backtracking it's not even funny. RNG and blind guessing at it's finest. Don't bother buying it at full price, it's not even worth $1.99 let alone a dollar more.\n\nConculsion: If you want to waste time, it would be better wasted on something else.
