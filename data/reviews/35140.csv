"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/35140/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","Still the best Batman game in the Arkham series and probably the best Batman game ever made. The story involves Batman catching Joker easily after a recent robbery and, coincidentally, Joker's gang moved to the Asylum because of an issue at the Blackgate Prison - once inside the Asylum, the Joker escapes and taskes control of the Asylum and prepares to unearth something far worse than what you initially suspect. You play as Batman trying to unearth this plot and once again stop the Joker.\n\nTo this day, this game still has amazing visuals, Batman himself covering around half the screen, looks the part and stands strong and confident as the character should as well as the texture work on his suit are top notch - the rest of the game fairs the same, since the game has been given an outstanding amount of care and work into every area you go through. Not one area in the game feels exactly the same as another even if they look similar. Very stellar work of textures all around overall.\n\nI don't say this is the best Batman game out there for no reason - gameplay is pretty basic "Brawler" style with very minor puzzle solving, but what makes this game different, from, say a game like Assassin's Creed - is the "Free Flow combat system" the game has. The combat is slightly similar to the first Assassin's Creed, except - the flow combat system allows Batman to basically jump from one foe to another in a very fast manner, almost rythmically, to get a combo counter to go as high as you can while still making it challenging by giving the foes still standing a fighting chance and implementing counters.\n\nYou can also explore the entirety of the Arkham Asylum as you unlock areas and you can do a variety of things while exploring, you can face groups of enemies scattered around, you can do Riddler Challenges - whom are a bunch of mini puzzles scattered around the Asylum that involves the use of Batman's Detective Mode, these range from finding a specific item found in the area or marks that require the Detective Mode to find and a "Complete the Mark" type of game that involves you scanning the area from specific places to complete a full mark, etc - Riddler trophies, and a bunch of case files to find out more background information on Batman characters and villains (as well as the history behind Arkahm Asylum) that are often very well realized and fun to hear.\n\nThe Detective Mode & Gadgets: You'll be using these a LOT on your trudge through Arkham Asylum. Ranging from the standard Batarangs and Grappling hook (used for mundane objectives such as getting to and pulling out vents from hard to reach places, etc), the Explosive Gel (Used a lot to surprise enemies, to find weak walls to find trophies and secrets and to progress in the story as well!) and a bunch more. The Detecive Mode helps you analyze weak walls to use your Explosive Gel on and other gadgets as well as analyze enemy/allies conditions and, more important later on in the game, to find out which enemies carry weapons or are special enemies.).\n\nSo in general, if you ever wanted to know and feel what a life in the day of Batman is, this is definately your game, more so than the sequels (imo). From the excellent assets and sound to follow it up with, and the pitch perfect gameplay to go along with it, this sits as one of my favourite video game experiences and currently my best experience playing as the legendary Dark Knight.\n\nA++","November 25, 2013","true","9.5"," 261 of 297 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","261","297","0","24"

Combat, story (characters, voice acting, etc), atmosphere, sound design and even graphical fidelity.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=331161841\nThis game captures what it is to be batman and my god its DAMN FUN. The developers going into making Arkham Asylum said "What can we do to make you feel like batman right away, as soon as we give the player control we want them to feel like a bad ♥♥♥. You feel like batman, the way your character is animated and moves, the freeflow combat system has you jumping around bruising bad people until the cows come home with some of the most satisfying combat I have played to date.\n\nHere is a huge thing for me, and for all Batman fans. I watched the cartoon as a kid. Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamil all brought the cartoon and that world to vivid life. Well guess what guys, they got just about everyone from the cartoon to revoice their characters in Arkham Asylum, Harley, Gordon, Batman, Joker, Scarcrow etc.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=332956143\nIt is an incredible cast and it immerses you so fully in the world you almost never want to leave. The world that Rocksteady has recreated is fantastic, with dark colors and almost a noirish feel to the game that sucks you deeper and deeper into the world. You truly ARE batman in this game. It reminds me of a mixture of the cartoon and Tim Burtons dark seedy take on Batman. It is truly a game to be experianced.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? Abso♥♥♥♥inglutely. If you enjoy 3rd person fighting games with smooth combat systems that just make you want to sing while you are playing them. THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. If you are a fan of the Batman universe, cartoon, or comics YOU OWE it to yourself to pick up and play this game. It is absolutely fantastic.\nI would recommend this game to just about anyone who enjoys a solid, FUN game in every aspect.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=331088258","April 19, 2015","true","45.9"," 171 of 184 people (93%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","93","171","184","15","0"

As licensed games go some are generally just a cut above mediocre cashing in most of their chips on a well loved source material in the hopes of getting the fans the world over to part with their cash. Generally most are hobbled, half-♥♥♥♥♥ affairs that do very little to win over any new fans and wind up disappointing those that are. We see it countless times with game products used to prop up big summer blockbusters and most of us have been burned once already to know well and truly that they should be avoided like the plague...well at least until they hit the bargain bin. This is one of those instances where the trend is bucked because Batman: Arkham Asylum is a resounding success and as far as Batman adventures go is still the ultimate Batman experience in my books so much so that it was in fact my favorite game of 2010.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=471535908\nHaving recently replayed the Batman: Arkham Asylum in preparation for the release of Arkham Knight I am still amazed at how impressive the game stands up five years down the line. The games visuals are never more than impressive bringing Gotham's notorious prison to vivid life while putting you into the shoes of one of the worlds most famous detectives. It's an entirely thrilling experience that even non-comic book fans should be easily able to relate too and enjoy. While some of us may remember previous Batman games from Konami and SEGA on the NES and SEGA Megadrive fondly; the truth of the matter was they were never particularly good games. Rocksteady, a studio I had never heard of until the release of this game, uses the old 2D platform beat' em ups those earlier Batman incarnations were presented in as a starting point for some of the gameplay except that twenty years down the line - thanks to the awesome Unreal engine and other technology advancements -  we are now able to experience thug bashing in full 3D with gorgeous graphics and its never been more satisfying.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474802390\nUsing a similar but more refined combat system that was introduced in the first Assassin's Creed game, combat boils down to mostly timing and flow since hit points are racked up provided you can keep up the continuous flow. Miss an incoming hit or doge which is then not countered correctly or simply press your attack button too fast you will end up breaking the combat flow which results in your hit points being reset. The more hit points you rack up the more points become available at your disposal to use on upgrading your items. It's not a complex system but it works and when surrounded by enemies on either side and you are able to execute your timings perfectly Batman will glide across the screen taking out enemies like a hot knife slicing through butter and it is very satisfying to watch. What good would it be being placed in the shoes of a world famous detective while not actually allowing you to do any detective work? Thankfully Rocksteady did not overlook this and most of the game you will actually be in detective mode searching for clues, clues that will tell you where to go next or what to do next. Batman: Arkham Asylum ends up being a perfect marriage of these two genres (beat em up and hidden object) never overly relying on either so that it gets stuck in a rut. Batman: Arkam Asylum also introduces stealth game mechanics into the gameplay at various points and surprisingly it works just as well. In most cases where a game tries to do too much it often ends up being master of neither but here all the different gameplay styles come together perfectly that it becomes incredibly difficult to nit-pick. As an added bonus for you puzzle enthusiasts out there the game world is also littered with trophies hidden by the nefarious and devilishly clever Riddler and will have you scratching your head and giving your grey matter a good workout as you attempt to solve all of them in order to gain a Riddler trophy for your collection.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=471535082\nAll of this would be for naught if there wasn't a strong story to prop it up and thankfully Rocksteady brought on Paul Dini, co-creator of Batman: The Animated series who brings along the voice talents of Kevin Controy and Mark Hamil who reprise their animated roles. Mark Hamil as Joker really ends up stealing the show here. It's incredibly hard to believe that this was once the same man who famously played Luke Skywalker in the earlier Star Wars films. Hamil brings so much life and narcotic energy to his role as the Joker that he literally steals every scene he is in. Batman: Arkam Asylum is also the perfect length introducing just the right amount of nemesis's into the mix without going totally overboard and bogging down the story-line. If I have to nit-pick - the boss fights in the game are the only thing that come off less than stellar since most employ exactly the same tactic in order to take them down so it never feels like you are facing a unique foe but rather the same foe with just a different skin (thankfully Arkham City addressed this short coming with its creative boss battles). The game was also originally hobbled with the terrible Games for Windows Live DRM but that has now been replaced with Steamworks integration - and thankfully so because it now comes with Steam achievements for those achievement hunters out there.\n\nFor Batman fans this game has been a long time coming and is as near perfect and flawless as any game I have ever encountered. It is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the previous generation of games to come out on PC and console and it still looks incredible, plays well and is an all-round smashing success. If you are one of the last few who have not given the game a go yet I highly urge you to do so - I promise you won't be disappointed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 4, 2015","true","31.2"," 215 of 241 people (89%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","89","215","241","20","59"

See CONCLUSION\nNOTE: Since this is the first game in the franchise, I will review it as if the sequels did not exist.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Batman Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game and the first title on the critically acclaimed Arkham franchise. The game was released in 2009, developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment. Arkham Asylum currently (as of the writing of this review 2014), holds the Guinness World Record for “Most critically acclaimed superhero videogame” as well as several Game of the Year awards. The Story was written by Paul Dini who's notable work include Batman: Animated Series and Batman Beyond.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):In this game Batman, after just having apprehended the Joker,  takes him to the now infamous Arkham Asylum. Unfortunately, Batman soon realizes that it was all part of Joker's plan in an elaborate scheme to stage a major prison riot and take over the Asylum. Now trapped, Batman has to stop the Joker and at the same time, discover whatever sinister plot the Joker has started which seems to involve a new drug called Titan.\n\nPROS:+ Graphically beautiful with amazing locations, well textured characters and environment\n+ Excellent Voice acting from the cast, specially on Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker)\n+ Combat Mechanic (Free Flow Combat) that goes well with...\n+ Fluid Animation quality where Batman can chain attacks with absolute grace\n+ Lots of cool gadgets and upgrades that can aid you in several situations\n+ Perfect blend of Action and Stealth without sacrificing either one\n+ Scarecrow Segments and Riddler Challenges\n+ Great use of the Batman Lore with cameo appearances or references to other characters and locations in the Batman Universe\n+ Excellent Story that really draws you in\n+ Re-playability due to unlockable Challenges and a New Game Plus\n+ Easy to learn controls and game mechanic\n+ Relatively medium sized map that rewards exploration\n+ Excessive amount of bone breaking physical violence\n\nCONS:- Detective mode can be abused by perpetually leaving it active since it has no real drawback\n- Underwhelming Mini bosses who can be defeated in more or less the same manner\n- VERY disappointing Boss (Super Villain) battles which is perhaps the game's greatest flaw\n- Combat mechanic can potentially become repetitive\n- Games For Windows Live\n- Game does not include a Shark Repellent\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and a GOOD BUY. Arkham Asylum provides you with tons of enjoyable hours playing as the Dark Knight because of its excellent story and game mechanics.\n\nWORTH IT?:Highly recommended to Batman, Martial arts or Stealth fans out there. At $20 for its full price this game is worth every penny and it should be a no-brainer when you see it on a sale.\n\nFINAL NOTES:The game is a great comicbook / cartoon to video game adaptation of Batman. Easy to learn and use of the freeflow combat mechanic coupled with a well implemented stealth system makes the gameplay fun. The story is true to the formula that made most Batman cartoons and animated movies great with some added violence and mature content. Engaging and lovely atmosphere that is amplified by the excellent voice acting quality from the cast. Although the bosses in this game does not live up to the build up of the story, it still nonetheless wraps up each story arc pretty neatly.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/35140/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","In 2009, Rocksteady Studios, a video game studio with virtually no history restored gamers' hopes all around world with Batman Arkham Asylum. The UK based studio revived a genre long forgotten and delivered a superhero action game which is worth every cent you spend on it.\n\nYes, yes, there hasn't been a shortage of superhero games in the 21st century, but none of them really delivered on its potential. And there is a bunch like the Iromnan or Superman games that aren't even worth talking about. Batman always had the better track record when it comes to games, but Arkham Asylum fires on all cylinders. Great graphics, incredible sound effects, a mad story and the little details will engage gamers and not only Batman and superhero fans.\n\nThe game takes place on the famous Arkham Island where an Asylum has been build many-many years ago for the worst criminals Gotham can offer. It happens that The Joker has been captured by the Bats and taken in, but the Dark Knight suspects there is something going on in the background and takes his nemesis in himself. Shortly after a riot is started and The Joker gets loose. Now it's clear that the clown has something on his mind and Batman has to stop him. The story is intense and interesting as Bruce Wayne slowly puts together the pieces of Joker's grand plan. As you progress several of Batman's greatest foes will try to stop you, most notably Killer Croc, Poison Ivy or Bane, but others are introduced too. Some of them get bigger space others are bit players, but the point is that they are in the game and by their presence they make it richer.\n\nThe graphics are decent, but there are flaws here and there. Batman and The Joker look superb, but detail of minor characters aren't on that level and some even look ugly. Other than that, the island is looks beautiful and from the distance you can see Gotham, the city of sins. The game is very well optimized on the PC so gamers with older rigs won't have problem running it.\n\nEven tough the island isn't overwhelmingly large, there is a lot to do. The main campaign will take around 8 hours to finish plus you can solve the puzzles and collect the question marks The Riddler left for you. By doing those you unlock character profiles, concept arts and more, so it's far from time wasting. Also by specific scanning stone tables on the island you can unlock recordings that tell you about the story of Arkham Asylum narrated by Amadeus Arkham himself. Probably the most interesting collectibles are the patient interview tapes that are scattered around the island. Some of the villains were interviewed in the facility and you can listen to these well composed dialogues. If you want to complete the main story with all the collectibles you will spend around 14+ hours on the island. When this is done you can try challenge missions where you have to beat scores by beating thugs. Sounds interesting and it adds to the game. This is the place where you can perfect you combat skills as the challenges get more and more difficult. The other half of them puts you in rooms where you have to complete 3, mostly skill-based tasks.\n\nWith the near perfect free flow combat Arkham City is a near perfect game that finally delivers not only to fans of the genre but also to Batman and superhero fans. In fact, those who are not really in comic books should consider this game for first. It's a joy to play every second of this game. Arkham Asylum set the bar for every single superhero game that comes after 2009. It's a benchmark and an example to follow for every publisher and developer.\n\nRating: 90/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 8 hours (main campaign), 14 hours (campaign with collectibles); Played on: normal.","November 24, 2013","true","14.3"," 76 of 83 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","76","83","0","0"

What amazes me the most about this game is how well the story flows with the large number of antagonists and how it does a magnificent job of progression and pacing to keep things interesting without losing focus.

Arkham Asylum is the first of the 4 currently available mainstream Batman video game titles. For a long time most gamers considered movie tie-in or superhero games to be....well, sub-par and not very impressive or satisfying. Just look at Superman 64. Wait....don't. Let's take a look at Batman and see how he fares.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nThe Joker has hatched yet another plan; a plan to bring Batman to Arkham to have him face all the criminals he’s put away there. Yes, the inmates are running the asylum, and Batman aficionados are going to get a full dose of Jim Gordon, Oracle, The Riddler, Bane, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Scarecrow, Victor Zsasz, Poison Ivy, The Joker, and others. Themed similarly to the graphic novel of the same title, it is nonetheless a completely original adventure as Batman fights his way from one side of Arkham Island to the other rescuing Gordon and guards, doctors and nurses and others, while putting a stop to The Joker’s nefarious scheme.\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum does one thing extremely well: It puts you in the shoes of the Dark Knight. It makes you feel like you ARE Batman. You have all of the signature gadgets available to you (not all at the start, of course) and using them to solve puzzles and beat down baddies is a complete joy. The combat system that started in this game has since been emulated many times by other game franchises (Shadow of Mordor, as an example), but none of those are anywhere near as good as the Batman titles. I can only describe combat in this game with one single word: fluid. Batman’s motions are fluid, continuous, and definitely not a set of disconnected moves. He looks like a martial artist (as he should), not the sort of jerky puppet that so often happens in these games. The way Batman moves across the screen, punching and kicking foes in a storm of punishment is simply breathtaking. You have a lot of different combos and actions you can take, depending on your unlocked upgrades which are bought using EXP you earn for doing nearly everything. Enemies have a symbol that appears over their heads when they are abotu to attack, in reaction to this you can hit a button to instantly counter that attack and keep going. There are several types of enemies, each you have to approach and deal with using different tactics. Enemies carrying riot shield will shrug off your punches, while enemies with knives will slice you up if dealt with head-on.\n\nAs said before, Batman has all his gadgets available to him throughout the course of the game. His batclaw (grappling hook), Batarangs, smoke bombs/pellets, explosive gel, and even a decrypter. Most of these gadgets can interact with the environment, and you will be using them in this manner very frequently...which further adds to the feeling of you being in the Dark Knight's shoes. Most of the gadgets can also be used in combat to disorient or stun foes. My only complaint is that every encounter is a picnic. You can easily take down 10-12 foes in a small, confined space without any of them laying a finger on you.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThis game is simply stunning, graphics-wise. Even today it still stands up next to newer games being released. The amount of detail that went into just about everything you see on screen is amazingly sharp, very well-rendered, and crisp. Arkham isn’t just dreary, but classic gothic horror dreary. Batman glides with the ease of an athlete, with his the cape swaying with his paces. You can see characters breathing, which is always a nice touch in my opinion. As the game progresses, Batman's suit actually begins to look more and more beatup/tattered after so many battles. Every character, whether hero, villian, or supporting role, has a very defined look. The best one by far is the Joker, and why not? He is literally the star of this game.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nOne of the best things about Arkham Asylum (and most of the subsequent titles) is that almost every character is voiced by their Batman: The Animated Series voice actors. This means that Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker!) is reprising his role as the Joker, and my god does he nail it! I cannot picture anyone else ever voicing the part of the Joker as well as Mark Hamill does. Batman is voiced by Kevin Conroy, who has played this role/voice since 1993, in nearly every animated feature and video game with Batman in it thereafter. This includes the Justice League and Batman: The Animated Series. Their inclusion makes this game feel authentic, and lends to it a nice atmosphere.\n\nThe accompanying music to every scene in this game is very dark and fitting. You definitely feel like you are in Batman's world. It's the usual dramatic Batman fare, which sets the tone of each area and encounter.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nInitially, the game ran beautifully. Not a problem whatsoever. But the longer I played, the more I started noticing a short 0.5 - 1 second stutter that only occured every 20-30 minutes. It did not affect my enjoyment of the game, nor did it hinder me at any point, but it was noticeable. Aside from that small irk....there were no other issues with this game during my 31 logged hours. It ran at a near perfect 59-60 FPS at all times.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is very nearly the perfect game. This game is as close to 100% as I’ve ever seen. It's damn close to a masterpiece. It's a game everyone should play at least once, especially if you are a fan of the Dark Knight. Your collection would just not be complete without it. Likely an entire generation will go by and never find a better gaming dollar spent.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/dM7SeDhNt84\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nA Must Play\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","July 23, 2015","true","31.6"," 54 of 61 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","54","61","6","4"

Unlockable character bios which include character interviews that you can listen to and character trophies, all of which are rewarded to you for your play time or geekness for searching and finding the Riddler's trophies. Very nice. Worth mentioning is that the game features a "Game +" which can extend the game's play value and play time by a lot more. (for those who are daring enough to endure the harder combat and lots of deaths that will follow)\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nExcept from the eventual low res textures, which are hidden very well that in some cases are not even noticeable, the game looks amazing even to this day when maxed out. And this is a console port, which shows that the developers gave the time and effort to make it look as good as it could on a powerful enough machine.\n\nAesthetics: 10/10\nThis game catches the nitty gritty and dark enviroment, in which the Dark Knight fights villains for the good of Gotham. The Arkham Asylum really feels like a psychiatric prison that went wrong!  Not much more can be said.\n\nSound: 9/10\n- Sound Quality: It is excelent, crisp and clean as it should be in any game.\n- Soundtrack: Be it on scenes, menus, combat or non-combat it fits the spirit of the game and that's what matters. It is great, it feel like soundtrack for a Batman licenced product.\n- Lip synching: While it is really good it feels like it could be better. One of the better lip synching i have seen in a game though.\n\nPC Port: 9/10\n- Display Settings: From Anti-Aliasing, Dynamic Shadows and Distortion to Harmonic Lighting, Ambient Occlusion and PhysX, this game has a lot of settings that will satisfy the PC enthusiants just fine. (Although the FOV slider is missing. I know, its not a FPS game but still, its not there. you can mess with the files though and set it to your liking)\n- Controls: This game supports controllers and rebindable keys which is a god send! Only 2 problems, 1 minor, 1 big. 1) You cannot rebind your keys while in-game, you have to do it before you launch the game via the game launcher and, 2) As many console to PC ported games tend to do, there are actions, many of them in fact, that are binded to a single key and that can cause some problems and a lot of frustration. Be aware.\n- Optimization: This game has been tested and completed using an Nvidia GeForce GTX 570 Sonic Edition. With Motion blur being turned off (cause my eyes hate it) and Bloom being turned off (cause apparently my card hates it), this game was being maxed out on 1080p 60 fps (with V-Sync turned on). Greatly optimized in my opinion.\n\nStory: 10/10\nYou are Batman, escorting the Joker, an unpredictable and very dangerous villain to a psychiatric high security hospital-prison called the "Arkham Asylum", where he escapes, and its up to you to stop him, the prison break he just caused and the other "super-villains" that are lurking free in the asylum.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nWhile simplistic in its design, Batman: Arkham Asylum's gameplay is so good and successful that it already has spawned a mechanical clone (namely the Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor game) and probably many more will follow.\n- Combat: The combat in theory is an action beat-them-up with counter moves and special moves that can be executed when you have reached a big enough combo on the press of a button, but it is so much more in praticality, making the game the opposite of a chore. Satisfaction is the word that can describe it. And of course you can make Batman learn new moves and combos while leveling up, making the combat even better while you progress through the game.\n- Non-Combat: When there are no enemies to fight, the game includes a lot of puzzles to solve (the Riddler's trophies) but most of them are no big deal (key word being "most" of them). Use the batclaw to traverse through the island or just use your feet!\n- Present in both combat and non-combat is the dedective mode, which helps you solve riddles or progress the storyline in some cases in non-combat and helps you indentify the weakness of special enemies or super-villain encounters/bosses in combat. Also, the Bat-gadgets, like for example the iconic Batarang or the Batclaw, these tools are there to help you battle enemies, traverse through the island or solve Riddler's puzzles. You unlock new gadgets while progressing through the game.\nAlthough i will mention that combat has its hic-ups. There are times that Batman wont counter when you press the button or wont target the correct enemy or even wont hit an enemy because he isnt close enough when that isnt the case. There is room for improvement here.\n\n\nTo conclude, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a shining example of how a Batman game or generally a superhero game is ought to be. Full of great content, amazing story and satisfying gameplay, this is a game that you are doing yourself a disservice if you actually havent purchased and played it yet. Full price or on a Steam Sale this game is worth your buck.\n\n\nMy rating:\n- Must Buy\n- Strongly Recommended <<<\n- Recommended\n- Not Recommended\n- Definitely Not Recommended\n- Must Avoid","December 16, 2014","true","23.7"," 28 of 28 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","28","28","0","1"

The game has very nice and well-balanced mix of combat, puzzle solving and platforming. Lots of effort was put into all mechanics and as a result the player never gets bored with one part or another due to constant variation.  Mechanically the game is very solid and it does give you a variety of things to learn in order to be able to progress without getting too overwhelming. All new tricks are introduced at a reasonable pace and most are explained well enough (also thanks to the fact that you are immediately forced to use the new unlocked gadgets in order to progress forward). The game is not entirely open-world and gives you a number of "hubs" or areas to explore and act in while unlocking them one after another. This makes the experience a bit more linear than some might like. Although, once again, the level design is really good and it will make your exploration enjoyable throughout the whole title.\nThe voice-acting is very well done and so are the cutscenes. The lore obviously adds a lot of charm to the game with lots of nice little details like interviews (voiced dialogues telling about the characters' past) and biographies to unlock and collect. The in-game graphics still look pretty good although some textures and objects do look at little bit outdated (i.e. low-resolution). Some tweaking with the usage of Steam forums might also be required in order to make the not-entirely-optimal port run at maximum resolution and with maximized visual effects even on reasonably modern systems.\nThe story is reasonably entertaining and holds the game together well to make it interesting for the player. The main questions the game asks (as its name states) are those of sanity and madness and how one can slide from the former into the latter while also asking the player whether the criminals can be considered as "ill" and/or "uncurable". Obviously, the aesthetics of the game is somewhat grim although not without some jokes inbetween (if you like the gags Joker produces).\nOne (non-crucial) problem consists in the fact that one can not access all in-game secrets that one detects immediately (special gadgets that unlock later are required for this). Thus I have spent some time in vain wondering whether I could not find the right approach to the secret before I gave in and Internet told me those secrets can only be accessed later on in the game.\nThe DLCs barely add anything to the main game as they do the same thing as other in-game stealth and arena combat pieces only in new locations. So if you are dying to do more combat/stealth, they can serve as some additional fun, but otherwise they are nothing really interesting. Same goes for the challenges, which basically repeat the in-game locations for arena combat and stealth missions with slight variations (enemy composition and/or additional environmental restrictions). While all of them can serve to improve your in-game stealth and combat skills, the main game learning cruve is so nicely adjusted that it is quite enough to just play the "Normal" difficulty mode continuously to gradually learn and use everything that might be necessary to beat the game.\nOverall, if you want to start off with the first Batman game that made the whole series so famous, you will not be disappointed and enjoy your time. I heartily recommend this title.\n","August 22, 2014","true","37.6"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

This is a 3rd person beat-em up, Metroid-vania-ish adventure with a lot of diversity. You'll go through sewers, brick buildings, a clock tower, libraries, ruins, caves, an outdoor courtyard and even the madness of the Caped Crusader's Mind. Since there is backtracking, the game will introduce new elements and paths to the backtracking, so it doesn't seem like a backtrack. New tricks, traps, situations, plant infestations and enemies will stand in your way. You never have a sense of being lost, but there is a lot of ground (and height) to explore.\n\nAs you work your way all over Arkham Island, you'll be taunted by the Joker who is voiced by Luke Skywalker for those that remember the old Batman: The Animated Series. Kevin Conroy reprises his role from the series as Batman, and they're both excellent.\n\nAs Batman, you've got a lot of controls here, left stick to move, right stick to control the camera, attack button, counter button, stun attack button, duck / stealth button, detective mode button, quick batterang, quick hookshot, grappling hook to climb, quick tool change, aim button, tool attack button, and finally a universal button to not only run, but holding the same button will also jump when you come to the edge, glide and its just batman auto-pilot really. You can double tap the action button to dive roll out of the way, but the times to use it are few and far between. There are more controls than buttons on the X-Box controller.\n\nYou unlock several tools / weapons for Batman to use, such as batterangs, grappling hooks, explosive gel and so on. The tools for the most part can be used on the fly against enemies by double tapping the left (batterang) or right (grappler) trigger.  You can use explosive gel to set a trap for enemies or blow up walls. Its pretty nice, but its just too slow to set up, so for the most part, you'll just be punching bad guys, dive kicking from gargoyles and grapple hooking up to safety.\n\nIts fun to attack spam enemies and wipe out a dozen enemies. However, enemies with guns will murder you quickly, which is good, because then you need to rely and stealth and tactics instead of button mashing. The enemies will telegraph their attacks, so you can counter them or attack them before they do. Knife wielders will need to be stunned. The system feels good, but again its sometimes just mash 1 button as if Batman were dancing between a dozen partners. The final enemy in a group always has a slow motion knock out where you'll get to see ragdoll glitches and poor hit detection. Is it a game breaker no. Does it happen a lot? Yes and when it happens with every battle, it shouldn't have been accentuated.\n\nWhile there is little enemy diversity, the big appeal comes from the game's characters and situations. You'll fight against some of Batman's biggest villains that are in Arkham. The situations, you'll have to use Batman's tools and some parts the game will spoon feed you what you need to do and other parts, you're free to figure it out on your own. The map will show you where you need to go, but its up to you to get there. You'll have to go through air ducts, go high, go low and every so often go through a door like a normal person. There is a lot of traversal in this game, you're able to swoop down on enemies, glide from place to place, grappling hook up to ledges, hang from ledges, shimmy around ledges. Everything that's been done in Just Cause 2, but now its slower.\n\nAs mentioned before, there is a detective mode that basically a hints mode. It will highlight air vents to crawl through, you'll be able to see through walls to enemy skeletons. You will have to use detective mode to track trails of scents and fingerprints. Detective mode will help you to find all of the Riddler trophies, which are usually in high vents. They're not hidden very well and it doesn't feel like a real reward for exploration, more like poor padding for the game.\n\nThe real problem here is the canned animations, which normally I have no problem with, but in this game, I really felt the animations. Batman grapple hooking up to a gargoyle, batman pulling a vent off an air duct, batman kicking a vent out of an air duct, Batman pulling an object with the grappling hook, Batman crawling out of a pit. You'll feel it all and some of the animations, you'll need to rapidly press the action button.\n\nOn top of all of that, you're unlocking a lot of extras as you progress through the game. Challenge rooms, character art and so on. There is a lot of extra content here.\n\nWhen you die, you're taken to an animated scene of the Joker or whatever boss you die on to hear a one liner, then sent back to the last checkpoint. That just wasn't needed and wastes time like a lot of the animation. If only there was a setting to turn it off.\n\nWith all of that being said, this is still a good, fun game that compels you to play through it. The characters are bright and vibrant.

I found myself becoming immersed into the Asylum world as I used my grappling hook and glide to fly around the place and did some sightseeing. At times the objects in the distance did not seem believable and realistic, but it's pretty good for a game that doesn't need a big budget. Most of the time I really enjoyed the characters faces, especially Joker. He scared the hell out of me. For some reason Harley Quinn's face and voice did not fit; maybe I know very little about who she is. Overall, graphics were solid and excellent.StoryThe story was very good in regards to its characters and plotlines. It had me engaged throughout the entire thing and I could not wait on how it unfolded cutscene after cutscene. Even though you backtrack several times through the same areas,--and it's necessary for collectibles--it did not make me feel tired of playing the game. The last boss in the end was very good too, and although it was a bit of a cliffhanger ending I believe it had a solid conclusion.GameplayThe gameplay was where the entire game shined in its harmonious glory; ranging from its movement throughout the environment; destroying walls that lead to collectibles and secret areas; solid effective combat when fighting goons, brawlers and bosses is hell of fun; and the good ridiculous amount of collectibles to gather ranging from riddles, trophies, joker teeth, and interview tapes scattered all over the map. I usually do not play fighting games and sometimes combat and counterattacks can feel awkward at times, even grappling up to a ledge that I did not want to can be awkward, but I enjoyed all of it.OverallFor those who are huge fans of the DC universe--comics, TV shows, movies--and for those who are comfortable with third-person fighting games, investigating crime scenes, backtracking through environments to find collectibles, tolerate challenging mechanics in combat, and exploring the world of Batman then this game is for you.","June 28, 2015","true","33.6"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","25","26","3","2"

The game has great visuals, great combat, and a good narrative. You get a good sum of boss battles, but they're a bit too easy (In my opinion) but the thing that makes this game truly fun is the Joker. The Joker is more relatable to the comics than Christopher Nolan's version of the Joker, but the Joker is still a great villain, and it could be one of the best villains in a video game. A good thing the game does is that the game has a ton of villains, but it does not use the most popular ones (Probably to save for sequels). The villains you will see in the game are Joker, Bane, Ivy, Harley Quinn, Mr. Zsasz, Killer Croc and Scarecrow. I spent 12 hours playing this game, and it is a good length for a game like this, plus there is a reasonable amount of replay value. There are also collectables as well, Ridler trophy's, tapes from patients (villains), and unlock bios for different characters. Also there are challenges as well.

Batman: Arkham Asylum, reminds me of games like, Knights of the Republic meets Metal Gear 4, meets a Kick ♥♥♥ Batman. It had all the qualities I like in games, an array of weaponry and gadgets, puzzles, a compelling story and interesting characters, all brought to us from the Batman Universe.

You control Batman and follow the bound Joker and his armed escorts to the detention unit. Something goes wrong and Joker is free and you need to hunt him down and foil his plot, whatever that may be.\nThe combat is awesome. There are many ways to take down enemies. If you decide to attack them directly, you will start off with punches and kicks to build your combo count. As your combo count goes up, you are able to pull off takedowns, throws, ground and pound moves and more. If youwant a more subtle approach, there are still plenty of tactics. You can hang from a gargoyle and snatch up baddies as they pass below you, hand from a ledge and pull them over, blow up structures so it falls on their head, or simply sneak up behind them and take them out silently.\nThere will be alot of areas that will be cut off to you at first. As you progress through the story, you will gradually gain equipment that will unlock more and more of the previously inaccessible areas.\nEarly on in the game the Riddler will contact you and send you on a mission to hunt down trophies. These will unlock character bios, models and challenge mode missions.\nThe game looks absolutely beautiful. The environment is incredibly rich and dark. All of the villians have been redesigned to give them a grimier and more menacing look with bulging veins and dirty scuff marks on their attire. Batman's own appearance changes as you progress through the single player campaign. He receives tears and cuts and even bleeds a little by the end.\nThe vocie actors also did an excellent job.\nBatman Arkham Asylum is without a doubt, one of the greatest Batman video games ever produced. The main single player story itself is a bit short, but it offers plenty of replay value through its unlockable contents and challenge modes. Batman Arkham Asylum is a must have, not only for fans of the dark knight.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","June 28, 2014","true","25.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

His popularity is immense, with people shelling over hundreds of millions of dollars in order to catch his latest movie, not to mention the related merchandise. Yet somehow despite all this, Batman has never had much success in the gaming world, with few good games in his name amidst a sea of mediocre and sub-par creations.

This has to be one of the greatest licenced games and if you love Batman like me, you'll instantly have fun playing this. It really feels like you're playing a live action comic book. There have been many people that have played the Joker in the Batman movies and shows, but none of them have done it right. But Mark Hamill has to be the perfect voice actor for joker and I'd hate it if they replaced him. This game is visually stunning with very colorful and non linear level design. I think that one of my favorite times in the game are the hallucinations that you get from scarecrow. A great feature to this are the gadgets and you have to use your tools to get to certain places and advance to a higher area using your gadgets.\n\nAlthough it's not as big of an open world as Arkham City, you'll get over that very quickly. There is something in this game that many people will not like, is the constant running back and fourth through the areas of Arkham Island. Personally, I don't care but I could understand why some people would find it to get tedious. But the buildings change, for example is the Arkham Mansion. At first, the building looks normal, but when you come back there again. The whole building is full with plants and this pink air. The story is also very good but the boss fights might be a little too similar to eachother. The reason why is because the main enemy is always standing very up high looking down at you, ridiculing you while they send in inmates which you have to fight. And that is where I get to the combat. The combat in this game is very satisfying and you'll find yourself having a good time fighting. So if you look at this review thinking to yourself if you should buy Arkham City or this game, just buy both because they're both a must buy. Batman fan or not, you'll love this masterpiece from Rocksteady!","July 25, 2015","true","10.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

If your a Steam user you can find the game on sale from time to time for $7.50, its worth every penny.\n\nAs one of the best Batman games that have ever been made I have enjoyed every part of the game. The visuals are amazing and it really shows the Unreal Engines capabilities. The PhysX also really bring it all to life with the dynamic fog, steam, cloth and distributable environments, Also the absolute best part is how Batman is voiced by non other then Kevin Conroy and The Joker is voiced my Mark Hamill! That's right, the ones who did the voices for the characters in the animated series and for DC Universe Online also did the voices for the Arkham series.\n\nThe game doesn't have coop play but does offer a challenge mode that you can compare your score with others and try for first place, if your into that kinda thing. As for me I don't care for multiplayer modes in any games unless it offers coop play or team based challenges.\n\nThe campaign (or single player mode) starts off with you taking Joker into Arkham Asylum as part of the opening cinematic. The look and feel of that is incredible and being made with the Unreal engine has allowed the developers to really bring the mood of the Batman universe alive. Throughout the game you will come across other iconic characters from the Batman universe like the Scarecrow.\n\nThrough out the game there are Riddler trophies to collect and although some are easy to find, others require the use of special equipment to get to. There is a total of eight pieces of equipment that you will get as the game progresses and you will want to back track and hunt down where you can use them. I like the detective mode myself and with it you will find Riddler's questions marks around (only viewable in detective mode) and you can take a picture of them to solve the secret.\n\nIf you acquire all the Riddler's trophies and question marks, destroy all of Jokers chatter teeth and solve the spirit of Arkham asylum by finding all of the Amadeus tables, then beat the game you will complete 80% of the game.\n\nThe fighting in the game is excellent. Lots of various moves and combos that aren't hard to master. Your final hit on an enemy results in a slow motion cam for the it and a rag doll effect as he drops to the ground. All the fighting is non lethal as is Batman's style so no blood and gore here. However there are lots of Batman's gadgets to use and that is just super cool!\n\nWeather or not your going to wait for this game to go on sale to pick it up, its worth the price paid for it.\nBatman: Arkham Asylum, is worth a play!\n\nPro's\nAwesome visuals\nIconic characters\nCharacters voices\nLots to discover in the game\nLots of secrets\nCon's\nBoss battles have a recognizable pattern\n\nCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9fSkcAYyZ8","October 6, 2014","true","21.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Everything works well in this game from the story, to the voices, and the gameplay. The story keeps all the characters constant with their comic counterparts . Getting the same voice actors from the Batman: The Animated Series was an act of genius. Mark Hamill as the Joker is one the major selling points of this game. This game plays like a 3D metroidvania game and in my oppinon is a prime example on how 3D metroidvania games should stride to be like.

Fight the escapees from arkham such as Poison Ivy, Harvey Quinn, Killer Croc, Bane, Scarecrow, and the Joker to free Commissioner Gordon and restore sanity to Arkham Asylum.\n\nThere is also a side challenge of solving the Riddler's riddles and finding the clues to understand what happened with Amadeus Arkham.

The Joker is loose and has gained control over Arkham Asylum, turns out the right guy is there to save the day 'The Dark Knight' Batman.\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is a story driven stealth action game, and a very good one at that. There are three main gameplay mechanics that make up the core of the game:\nFighting, you will take on groups of enemies in a tight combo based attack/counter system, with fluid animations and lots of different moves to use on Joker's thugs. Each attack has real weight behind it too and doesn't feel floaty either. During the game there is also a number of boss fights to partake in, they are all fun but sadly are fairly basic and don't take much thought. The game has one of the best fighting systems I have ever played and is extremely fun.\nStealth, as Batman you are a master of gadgets and can glide, swing and creep around rooms full of armed enemies taking each one out silently in a plethora of fun ways. This system isn't half ♥♥♥♥♥ either, it can be tasking at times and you will have to think who to take out in what order because enemies can kill you quick. There is also a great sense of satisfaction when an enemy is slowly reduced to pure fear as all of his friends are dispatched and he jumps at the site of paper blowing in the wind\nPuzzles/Roaming, the game has the odd jumping puzzle or batarang puzzle, they are a nice break in the pace however they can get a bit tedious at times. Another feature of the puzzles are the riddler trophies and riddles, which are fun to do if you are going for 100% completion. The riddler trophies require you to jump around and use gadgets to access because some are not unlocked until much later in the game, you are required to backtrack to grab certain trophies. The riddles are the most fun collectibles, you enter an area and a riddle will pop show up and you must scan the correct area/item to complete it. They are fun brain teasers and progress from easy to "YouTube search the ♥♥♥♥ is this riddle!?!?!"The game also features a great cast of familiar and new Batman characters with favourites such as: Joker, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Commissioner Gordon, Killer Croc and many more. The voice acting is also top notch with strong performances especially from Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the beautifully twisted Joker.\nAnother point to make is I am reviewing this in 2015 and even though the game was released back in 2009, it still holds up fairly well apart from the odd blargh texture  so it is still pleasing to look at and the games environments are brilliant whether it be the dark sewers or the cold steel cell blocks.\nTo summarise Batman: Arkham Asylum holds up as solid title in the failing genre of comic book games, with tight fighting and stealth mechanics and fun-to-navigate environments the game is a solid title in the Arkham Universe.\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is a strong 9/10","August 28, 2015","true","25.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/35140/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","Story (9/10):\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is one of the best games I have ever played. You play, as the title suggests, as *dramatic pause* Batman! Armed with many iconic gadgets like the batarang, grapple, smoke bombs, and many more, it is your mission to put a stop to the Joker's plans within the Asylum.\n\nThe story is exciting, and unique. As you progress, you must adapt and master new skills as objectives become more difficult to complete. Iconic characters will make appearances as you progress. Most will try to kill you, some will try to pull a fast one and try to backstab you, still one in particular will even try to eat you. You will be in danger from start to finish, captivated by the eerie environment and developing story.\n\nVisuals (10/10):\n\nArkham Asylum is a bit dated now, so the graphics are not considered as stunning as they once were. However, maxed out, it still looks very good. The asylum is true to its comic book origins, meaning it is dark, depressing, and gives off the feeling that something more sinister is lurking behind the walls than just the criminally insane.\n\nGameplay (10/10):\n\nThe world of Arkham Asylum is free exploration, but to stay interested and invested in the game, you can't really deviate from the story because the story is linear and without side missions to distract you. Personally, I am not bothered by this because there is quite a bit of problem solving and each area you enter presents a new challenge that require different approaches, so you aren't doing the same thing over and over.\n\nThe main story is fairly long probably about 15 to 20 hours depending on the difficulty. On top of that, you have a couple of miscellaneous “missions” like doing all of the Riddler Challenges and examing the artifacts found in the Asylum. While many find these boring, I personally enjoyed going back and doing these because they offered sereral easter eggs by referencing events and characters from the comics that I enjoyed. If this isn't your kind of thing, it is easily skipped.\n\nThis game is in third person, so it relies on a very effective free-flow combat system based on combos. It mixes classic fighting with silent takedowns and special combo moves that create the classic Batman that can take anyone in a fight. Included in the fighting system are the gadgets. The gadgets create a whole new host of ways to creatively finish off opponets in both direct and indirect combat.\n\nMany complain about the fact that the Batmobile and Batwing are not present in the game except for short stints, and are not even player operated. While this is unfortunate, the nature of the game taking place inside a small, finite area really defeats the use of either one.\n\nSound (8/10):\n\nIn terms of music and sound effects, Arkham Ayslum employs them to great effect. While the soundtrack isn’t really memorable, the small things like dripping water, metal clanking against metal, and other small things add to the immersion. The environmental and combat sounds are actually quite good. Unfortunately the dialogs are hit or miss, which sometimes hurts the characters.\n\nReplay value (9/10):\n\nWhile the plot is linear and there aren't any choices which would change the story in any way, the game provides countless hours of fun as probably the best batman simulator on the market. If the story mode gets boring, there are always the numerous challenge missions that are not part of the story that are fun to play.\n\nConclusion (9.2/10):\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is a very good game, with an unforgettable setting, an engaging plot, and a loose ends that set up future games. Overall, it is definitely one of those games which you have to play at least once and I highly recommend it.","March 25, 2015","true","132.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","3"

Batman: Arkham Asylum takes place as you would expect at Arkham Asylum, everything seems to be going as planned but the Joker always has a trick up his sleeve. I would say the game is semi-open world, yes you explore Arkham but the game does a great job at reusing previous locations to the story. It develops clever ways of ramping up the difficulty. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill do a great job at being the Batman and Joker duo. Another little thing I liked was that the Joker talks(taunts) you throughout the game, it’s quite funny. The Story is great and I won’t spoil anything in this review.\n\nThe gameplay is great and the free flowing combat is very satisfying to pull off. Batman has an arsenal of gadgets to assist him in combat and being the world’s greatest detective. The game has basic stealth and the AI is really not smart but it does the job. The easter eggs are awesome. If you do end up playing this game I encourage you to collect everything, its very interesting to learn about the history of Arkham Asylum and the DC characters in general.\n","November 11, 2014","true","15.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalnaur/recommended/35140/","Kalnaur","Kalnaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalnaur/","490 products in account","There have been many superhero games throughout the years.  Most of them have been sidescrolling "beat 'em ups" in the  vein of the Final Fight series.  Others were horrible adaptations like the Superman game for the N64.  Arkham Asylum has been, with few minor exceptions, one of the most on-point adaptations of a superhero property into a game that I have ever played.\n\nFirst, the format, a 3-D "metroidvania/Legend of Zelda" type deal where new tools open new areas and items to get, plays nicely into the feel of the game.   That same format also helps with the "lone hero" feeling that is in many ways the essence of Batman.  You feel like yes, you are alone, but you aren't out of your depth.  Also, the classic animated series voices help set the tone of the game; dark with just a bit of humor here and there.\n\nThe game world is lush and well rendered, created in that gritty style also befiting a game about The Bat.  Ruined sewers, secret tunnels, and crawling through airways and up walls all give this sense of being secretive, careful, and thought out.  The world you have been given to play in is tailor made to adhere to the common action/stealth tropes that exist in other Batman works.\n\nThe combat and movement can be . . . halting at times.  In particular the "hold button to run" command, something that I thought I had seen the end of when analog sticks came to prominent use, feels forced and unintuitive.  When the combat flows, slighlty pauses on a big hit, and Batman is leaping to and fro kicking, punching and generally kicking ♥♥♥, it looks good, and it feels good to be doing it, but there aren't any ways to "do" the one move you like, really.  And the combat system is at its best when you have maxed out all your available attack options.\n\nThe fightable enemies are simple and never waver from the basic human stock of "Joker goon fight"; they are either unarmed, armed with a melee weapon, armed with a firearm, a stun baton, or they are giant mutant freaks.  This includes the "boss fights", making the gameplay and world far more engaging than the actual combat.  That said, most of the combat is short and simple.  I think the longest normal skirmish took maybe a minute.  And the best parts of combat aren't specifically the combat so much as the setpieces where you have high perches to disappear to.  You can swoop down, take out a goon, and then grapple up into the shadows, listening and watching as the other goons start to freak out as you take them down one by one.\n\nAnd finally the story, which at least matches the quality of the old animated Batman series movies for plots.  Joker has a crazy plan, and Batman has to stop him.  The winding way Bruce has to do this is what makes up the bulk of the game.  Some of the story points feel contrived, but overall, the story flows from point to point in a logical way.  What helps in this is that Batman himself often tells the player (and Oracle over his headset) the next step.  And when Batman tells you something in this game, a combination of the voicework and the writing just seems to make the next plotpoint make sense.\n\nWith solid voicework, a lonely, beautifully crafted world, and a combat and stealth system that is only sometimes marred by its own trappings, this is a solid, wonderfully made title that anyone who counts themselves as a superhero fan in general or a Batman fan in particular should own.","November 23, 2014","true","21.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

You have two buttons for combat that also handle gadgets like your spider-man web sling and your ninja stars. Also, you're a ninja.

These gadgets include: Batarangs, explosives, grappling hook, goblin darts, cancer vision, a car that you can't drive, action blanket, and his power frown.\n\nOh yeah, and there's stealth, which is also cool.

It's pretty freaking cool. You've got some of your favourite villains running amock on Arkham Island. Yay! Plus Luke Skywalker plays the Joker.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay. The combat system is so awesome. I played Arkham City before this and i always enjoyed the combat. IT'S SO BRUTAL! Plus you really feel like Batman. The stealth sections are really cool and allow you to feel like Batman even more, taking out neighbours from every angle without them even seeing you, soooo awesome!\n\nTHE ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS SO PERFECT. I was never much of a screenshotting person, but this game has got me saving over 200 screenshots, some of simply batmans costume and others of me in the middle in a boss fight (judge me, I don't care, jks i probs will).\n\nThis game does not have you constantly playing combat and stealth sections. Nononono. There are changes in gameplay. The scarecrow sections are so cool, and slightly psychological and creepy. I was never a collectible person, but I've been finding the riddler trophies around the map. Once you finish the game, you will have more gadgets to find lots of them. Plus the riddler puzzles are cool, but they can be hard.\n\nI never cared about attention to detail, but this game has got me to see video games in a new light. The story is pretty long and there are challenge modes if you finish the game.

I've played through this many times on PS3, which explains my low playtime as I already know what happens. Do I get bored of doing everything all over again? Nope. An interesting story, the best melee combat system in gaming, a stealth system with high variety, backtracking that dosen't feel boring and tons of lore and easter eggs are just some reasons why this game is amazing.\n\nThis is the game that began the "Freeflow" combat trend in many recent releases, but none of them have matched up to the original. It's smooth, requires skill and not button mashing, and rewards people who can get into those high hit streaks.\n\nThe stealth is great too. Multiple ways to take down and lure your enemies with some smart A.I to back it up. It may not seem hard at first, but it does get pretty challenging later on.\n\nThere are also challenge maps that require you to get a certain amount of points with the freeflow system or perform certain takedowns with the stealth system. Extreme versions of these maps offer an even harder challenge with some unique takedown requisites.\n\nHowever, while the PC port is great, it is missing the Joker Challenge Maps which are exclusive to the PS3 and Mac versions of the game. If you have either of these, pick that version up instead as he is a very fun character to play as.\n\nThe original freeflow game that began one of the best franchises in gaming still holds up to this day.

I was fascinated by character bios (especially Harley Quinn :D) and tapes from interviews between doctors and Gotham's most dangerous villains. I was also interested in the plot and story during the play, how Joker takes control over Asylum and unleashes human beasts one by one. Playablity is another thing, I hated boss fights, because of terrible controling of the main character, that's only thing I would criticize, but it's not that bad when you get used to it.\n\n8,5 / 10","February 5, 2014","true","20.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

This game has no real weaknesses and is highly recommended to all action-adventure fans, especially to the fans of Batman!\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is a serious action-adventure game based on DC comics, it’s very atmospheric and story rich. Top-notch quality.\nGraphics are amazing. Nice design, superb models, great animation, it’s simply awesome and looks fantastic. Music is very good. It certainly helps to remain motivated while under pressure in certain combat and predator challenges. Voice acting is phenomenal – world class.\nAs far as the 3 difficulty levels are concerned, this game is rather easily beatable even on Hard. The only significant difference is that you don’t see a counter warning. Needless to say, enemies deal more damage and your health replenishes less than in easier difficulties.\nOnly few achievements are really hard, probably getting the 24 medals in combat challenges will be the most challenging for most people. Everything else is just a matter of time and proper preparation. Completing everything is rewarding, because you discover more details about characters and get to see highly detailed models of them in the main menu.","March 10","true","59.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

It's the definitive Batman game and possibly one of the best comic book games ever made.\n\nThe writing is top-notch, and the fact they got a lot of the VAs and writers from TAS (largely considered one of the best adaptions of Batman ever made, animated or otherwise) really makes it feel like what TAS would've been if it had the freedom of a PG-13 rating instead of being limited to a hard G-Rating (or PG in the case of movies like Mask of the Phantasm.). The background stuff like the interview tapes and hidden messages from The Ghost of Arkham we're also great. This is one of the few games I felt compelled to gather all the other stuff in.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid and really captures the badass feeling playing Batman should entitle and gives you room to either be stealthy or go in swinging and fight everyone head-on with combat that feels satisfying and meaty due to the way the enemies react to hits and accompanying sounds of blows connecting and bones cracking.\n\nThe graphics and art-design are great and it runs at a near flawless and consistant 1080p/60FPS on my 750ti. I say near-flawless because there's one huge problem:\n\nThe implentmation of PhysX is horrid and the few areas that make heavy use of it suffer from severe FPS drops if you have it turned on.\n\nThe only two flaws I can really list aside from that tech failure (which is minor since there's only like three short levels it effects) are the somewhat lack-luster boss fights and the weird save-system that only really triggers when you go through a door seperating areas.","May 30, 2015","true","21.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Everything in this game - gameplay, story, character and level design can be described with a single word - genius.

But soon he falls into his trap, and the whole island is being under siege, as Batman has to uncover its secrets and mysterious reasons of Joker's (willing) return to the Asylum. Open world gameplay, and various characters to deal with, as more and more sections of the Asylum unlocks with your progress (including gadgets).\n\nAfter epic campaign you can play challenge maps which you unlock by solving Riddler's secrets in the campaign. From beating miscreants and breaking their bones, and doing the same in a bit different manner in predator maps.

Its a third person action/adventure where you're tasked with stopping one of the\nJoker's nefarious new plans involving Arkham Asylum. It features a much darker story than saturday morning fare, more akin to the Christopher Nolan films and the comics.\nIf you're a fan of batman already this game has everything you want: gritty story and visuals, all kinds of bat-gadgets, and satisfying hand-to-hand combat. The presentation is grim and sets a fantastic backdrop for everything that takes place. The voice acting is superb featuring many classic voice actors including Mark Hamil reprising his legendary role as the Joker. Arkham Asylum is a lengthy game looking at 12+ hours at the minimum, with lots to explore and secrets to collect. Despite all the content already available dont expect to see too many famous villains crammed into one game as the developers obviously had sequels in mind, but the villians it did give us fit into the story perfectly.\n\n>PROS\nFaithful to the franchise\nDark and gritty visuals and presentation\nCombat and Puzzles are fun and hardly get boring\nBoss battles are varied and interesting\nFantastic Voice Acting\nGreat graphics with attention to detail\nHarley Quinn & Poison Ivy\n\n>CONS\nMinor bugs in the V1.1 Release\nSometimes feels slightly repetitive\nEnding could have been better\n\nBottom line: A ruby the size of a tangerine.\nIf you like batman, or if you like gritty dark superhero games, this is your game.

First Off, Batman: Arkham Asylum. Arkham Asylum is a very fun game with a very interesting story. This game follows Batman, who has just taken Joker to the infamous Arkham Asylum compound. The Joker takes control of the Asylum when he has killed the guards with him. Batman must face iconic Batman villains such as Harley Quinn, Bane, Scarecrow, Riddler, and more. The freeflow combat that everyone loves is in this game, but isnt as fleshed out as I wanted it to be. Many more things needed to be added to make the Arkham Experience the best it could be from the get-go. The predator rooms are very fun and challenging. And of course, The boss battles. Some of the boss battles are't that great like Joker and Bane, but some of them are some of the most creative boss battles out there like Killer Croc and Scarecrow. Overall, Batman: Arkham Asylum was a pleasant suprise in 2009 (a time when superhero games sucked). I very much recommend this game, Batman fan or not.","July 25, 2015","true","20.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Rocksteady's game is certainly the new standard for understanding how produce games under license, adapting for gaming the very spirit of this historic character.It's far from perfect, but still a damn good rollick through DC's well carved territory.If the combat has been a bit more sophisticated in the latter stages of the game, it'd have been a nailed-on Classic.","March 30, 2014","true","44.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Rather than the skillfull, open-ended fighting which is present in most of the genre nowadays, Arkham Asylum's combat system is outdated and reminiscient of arcade-style fighters where you just have to enter a combination of buttons rather than utilizing controls with more freedom.","December 4, 2013","true","1.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'm not that much of an expert in Graphical fidelity, but I know when something looks good, and Arkham Asylum definitely looks good.\n\nStory : Perhaps the weakest part of the game. Don't get me wrong, the story isn't bad. There weren't very many layers to the story in my opinion, and I couldn't get into the story that much. However, the voice acting that went along with the story was just amazing.\n\nGameplay : The strongest part of the game, the freeflow combat system is symply amazing and really makes you feel like a badass, you just can't get tired of beating up on thugs and similar. However, all the greatest parts of gameplay are completely lost in the boss fights. Where as the gameplay is amazing whenever your fighting thugs, the boss fights limit you greatly.\n\nOverall, the game is amazing. Definitely worth a buy.","December 21, 2013","true","10.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm not a huge Batman fan, but this game was so polished that I could see myself getting into the Batman world.As the titles says you take control of batman in arkham asylum fighting againts the evil…of course I mean Joker.The story reels out with an impressive way fighting different bosses which are villains from comic books.Also our character may solve various puzzles which are Riddle’s puzzle and we can learn various things about arkham location,friends and foes.Despite that, in-game we don’t fight with all famous villains that batman has instead of that, we can learn many things for them, by solving riddles puzzles.I hope some of them appeared on arkham city.\nCombat system is just awesome.Attacks,heavy attacks,counter attacks and combo attacks are the base ingredients of the combat system.Trying to hit all the enemies flawlessly is a bit of challenging which is the best part of the combat.As you continue, our character unlocks new finishing moves which can instant kill an enemy we choose and after that we continue our combo in order to not get hit.The last kill is in slow motion!\nWhen you are not in combat, basically you are what really batman is….a detective searching for clues for murders and other things.In order to follow the clues, you must use some of the gadgets you have from the start or either unlocked later like the spray which explodes etc.One amazing thing is that you can press a button and instantly the camera changes and go to ‘detective mode’ in order to see clues,vents and other things which keep in secret.Batman is stealth so many times in game, we can kill secretly one by one all the villains on a location where many enemies patrolling with the right sequence.\nSounds are awesome, from grapple up to the opening of cape and voice acting.Graphics the same.UE3 did a VERY good job here.\nAfter you finish the main game, either you can walk around on arkham asylum either you can solve Riddle’s puzzles.\nSummarizing either you are a batman fan or not you will love this game.\n","January 12, 2014","true","14.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game looks great to this day, and is very well optimized.  The combat is fun and flows so well, and with different types of enemies thrown in together it's always keeping you on your toes, making you change strategy mid fight.  There is always a surprise thrown in to keep it fun and engaging.\n\nBut that's not all this game is about, there is also Riddler Challenges.  Whether it is a characters Hat you must seek out in a room, a trophy, or a hidden question mark you can only see in detective vision.  There are over 70 of these challenges, it keeps the game fresh and add's a puzzle element to the game.\n\nLast but not least, if you were ever a fan of Metroid, or Castlevania, then you will love this game.  The level design reminds me so much of those two games.  Seeing a cracked wall with a Riddler Trophy on the other side but not having the right tool to get to it.  Basically a "come back later when you have this item".  The game is linear, but they do such a great job at streaming together the Asylum, and taking you to places you never thought existed.  You will be doing alot of back tracking, so if you miss an item don't worry, you are able to go back to anywhere in the Asylum.  The game is not short at all, and has you interacting with all of your favorite villians from Batman's universe.\n\nThe game is a blast and if you haven't played it yet, then there is something wrong with you!","November 27, 2013","true","71.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Obviously the game looks great graphically, but you'd expect that from such a title. I'm more interested in gameplay dynamics and having fun, and this game delivers.\n\nThe best thing about the game is probably the combat system and the gadgets, which are well designed and thought out for game progression. There's also a lot to unlock and lots of hidden things to search for. They implemented it into the game the proper way also, at a dose that is comparable to going through the plot, rather than just dumping a load of crap all over the place, like most games do with hidden collectables.\n\nI'm really enjoying this game, and I'd imagine most people would enjoy it, as it seems to cover a lot of enjoyable aspects: sneaking, hand to hand combat, detective sections, decent characters and plot and cohesive level design.\n\nMy rating : 87","December 22, 2013","true","8.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Still it was a fun game, the gadgets were impressive, the scenery seemed to fit and have that gritty feel. I was also pleasantly suprised how this single location could provide a good variety even returning to areas you have been to before. The story, voice acting, gameplay were all on target for me. Its one of those games that screams unreal engine when i see it and overall was a good game. The GOTY version has various challenges and dlc challenges that didn't particularly interest me but i can see it giving alot more longevity to the game as well as collecting the various riddler trophys etc. Overall a good experience and can see why it was awarded a game of the year edition.

A game started as by Batman fans, for Batman fans as a love letter. The one that started it all. The first Arkham game has aged rather well, and is still fun to play to this day. The story in my opinion is a bit better than City, (Due to the fact that this one I didn't figure out the plot by looking at the voice actors)\n\nThe story starts like this: Batman has recently captured the Joker, who set off a large fire in Blackgate Prison, causing the Blackgate prisoners to be moved to Arkham Asylum. Batman escorts Joker personally to Arkham. While delivering him to his cell under heavy security, Joker manages to escape while Harley Quinn, has taken control over Arkham. Batman has to go after them for the first (Maybe) long night of things he could have never expected.\n\nCombat options are very limited and not as refined compared to Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, but still has the Arkham feel to it which City and Knight just made better.\n\nThe Predator options are also much less fun compared to City due to how little gadgets there are, and no grate, vent, or quick takedowns. But, the fan favourite, the Inverted takedown is in this game.\n\nAll in all a great Batman game, and one people will remember as one of the better ones.

I played using an Xbox controller and the controls and targeting system were so intuitive that there was no learning curve; I just went into Arkham and did some stealthy stuff, beat up a bunch of bad guys and propelled myself into the darkness with some crazy gadget. Job done, and I felt awesome.\n\nThe best thing I could say about this game is that while everything feels so effortless, it's also quite difficult. I don't entirely understand how they managed to do that, but keeping that balance certainly isn't easy. Arkham Asylum does this so well that you just come out of the game feeling like a hero.\n\nI only have one bad thing to say about this game, and that is that I wanted to hang every bad guy from a gargoyle, but it's just not possible. The game even actively tried to stop me from doing so at one point, like I was a child being scolded for eating too much candy.\n\n10/10 would have myself commited again.","May 11, 2015","true","29.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

At first, I am not a huge fan of Batman or pretty much I am not a fan of comic books. Surprisingly, this is the Batman game that met its expectations for fans and comic book alike. The game sets in Arkham Asylum, playing as Bruce Wayne or Batman (state the obvious). The story starts where Batman is taking and apprehending Joker to the Asylum, causing it was a setup and controlling the asylum by Joker. I am not going to tell you much about the story, it's better to play the game to know about the story. Trust me, it's such a great Batman game to start with. The combat system is based on combo, score multipliers, dodges and counter attacks. There are gadgets to tackle obstacles throughout the story. You can upgrade your abilities by leveling up. Collectables all over the map (Riddler's Trophy, scarab wall and searching the answer for Riddler's challenge), like the backstory of Arkham Asylum, the interview tapes, the concept art and character bios to learn about their orginality.\n\n+ Pros+ Rich storyline\n+ Characters are obviously likeable\n+ Voice acting and musical score\n+ Freedom Open World (Kind of)\n+ Atmosphere and graphics of the game\n+ Combat system\n+ Extras or Collectables\n\n- Cons- Controls for Keyboard and Mouse are confusingly tricky\n\nThe verdict for this game's honest review is a must buy, like come on buy this game and you will love it every second, even if you are not a fan of Batman like myself. The story, the atmosphere, the voice acting, combat system and unlockables. You can find all of the extras after you finished the game and play some challenges.

I wouldn't have guessed that it came out in 2009. One of my biggest pet peeves is when games that look great have cutscenes that have been rendered in 720p (I'm looking at you, Mass Effect series) but the only difference I could see in Asylum was that the cutscenes were not in 3D.\n\nI'm not a huge Batman fan, so I don't know who most of the villains are; I only learned about Two Face when I watched The Dark Knight. Arkham Asylum does a very good job of introducing the characters and giving their backgrounds. They even have a little bio section for each major character with both in-universe and real life facts about them. I could tell that most of the character designs were new takes on those characters, and I definitely think that they were done well. I found it a little odd that almost every single person in the game was ripped, but this is Batman after all.\n\nMark Hamill did a phenomenal job voicing the Joker. He was easily the most interesting character tho listen to, and I intentionally died a couple of times so I could listen to him taunt me.\n\nEach main villain had a couple of levels devoted to them. My personal favorite were the Scarecrow levels because I got to relive some of the defining moments in Batman's life. By that I mean I got to see his parents die.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty basic: left-click to hit people, and right-click to counter when they try to hit you. Some enemy types switch this up a little by making you stun them first or dodging behind them before you can hit them, but ultimately it only adds one extra button that you have to hit before taking them down.\n\nMy favorite parts of the game were the rooms where there were a bunch of armed thugs in a large area, and I had to figure out how to take them down without being seen. It reminded me of the scenes in Batman Begins down by the docks where Batman did just that. Unfortunately I wasn't quite as good at it as the real Batman.\n\nThe detective "puzzles" were fairly interesting, but usually very straightforward. I felt like I was doing less detective work and more just following a trail that the developers would only let me see if I turned on the special goggles.\n\nMy least favorite parts by far were the boss battles. They were clearly constructed exactly the same way that boss battles were made back in the 90's. I was usually stuck on a platform below the much larger boss, performing the same actions multiple times while looking for patterns in their attacks so I knew when they were vulnerable.\n\nIt took me a little over 10 hours to complete the story. It seemed like I wasn't missing much by not exploring heavily; the main missions took me all over the island. It would have been nice to have gotten more of the audio logs, which were pretty amusing, and I only found a fraction of the Riddler trophies. I'm definitely not a completionist.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the game a lot, and I would recommend that anyone who thinks Batman is the coolest play it. It's currently $20, which is a pretty reasonable price.","October 12, 2013","true","11.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game had a moderate amount of hype at the time (everyone was scarred this would be a failure) however upon release it gained mass appeal.

It is the first "real" Batman game: you actually feel like The Bat, have his gadgets, and have a small world to explore. The plot is good, with villains popping up every hour but Joker staying the mastermind of them all. The graphics and gameplay are excellent. Sleeping Dogs has the exact same combat system (I like that one better, but this is the original). Arkham Asylum's combat system has a great free-flow feel, where you hit and block, and then you do a backflip and hit someone else, etc., but my main concern was that when I pressed the right mouse button when an enemy was attacking, Batman sometimes would not block. This got annoying and frustrating in the later missions, especially when Batman's decision not to block made you have to replay a section. Arkham Asylum has both stealth and action: stealth where you hide on top of gargoyles (almost every time) and take out the inmates one by one, and action where you take down five, ten, or even twenty of them. The map is big(Arkham City's map is much better though), but after you beat the campaign the world gets boring. Boss fights were often fun, but also often tedious and frustrating. Some of them are hard to understand if you do not read the hints- so do. The stun and knife inmates are pains in the butt just like in Arkham City, but with luck you can defeat them. The music is good, and there are unlockable challenges and trophies that look like statues. If you have time, play Arkham City and Asylum. If you don't, just play Arkham City because it's a much better game.","July 26, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/georgeclooneyisbatman/recommended/35140/","georgeclooneyisbatman","Rowsdower","http://steamcommunity.com/id/georgeclooneyisbatman/","137 products in account","In this game you play as the one and only Batman as he takes on the Joker and his minions in Arkham Asylum. Arkham Asylum has lots of detail for a prison and you will be able to explore it as you look for the Riddler's Challenge trophies, interview tapes, and solve environmental puzzles (mostly just puns). Only complaint is that it only has 2 bosses practically. All the boss fights except for the Ivy one have you against tough Bane like inmates. But if you like Batman you will enjoy playing through anyways. A small complaint is that if you use xbox360e for your non 360 controllers it will disable achievements. I had to use it cause with my Wii controller pro because it inverted the right stick on both the X and Y axis.\n\nThe combat is really fun too and requires more timing than how it looks on video. You also get to play with toys that are sort of like Zelda items since they open up new areas. And if you like the Batman franchise you will be rewarded with your favorite villains in audio interview and the spirit of Armaedus Arkham.","October 27, 2014","true","49.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've never seen a developer do such an awesome superhero game since Spider-Man 2. It's a game where you play as Batman as he tries to stop the criminals within Arkham Asylum of succeeding in their plans of killing countless people.\n\nWhy is this game so great? Well, there are a lot of reasons really. The gameplay. It's so good. Whenever I play fire this game up on my laptop and play on a challenge map, I enjoy just fighting enemies.\n\nThe combat freeflow system is amazing, you fight seamlessly from goon to goon punching them, kicking them, breaking their arm, throwing them, the combat flows so smoothly. It feels so satisfying to fight enemies with the freeflow system that Rocksteady implented. Everything connects together so well. Other than the freeflow system, the stealth is pretty satisfying when you pull it off well. The gadgets Batman uses are pretty awesome, you can set traps for enemies while you lure them in. The gameplay in Arkham Asylum is awesome, Arkham City improves on it though.\n\nThe story revolves around Batman and his usual foes as he tries to stop them from killing guards and tons of innocents. You get to fight iconic batman villains such as Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Joker, Poison Ivy and Bane.\n\nJoker is awesome in the game, laughing maniacally as he cracks his jokes. Mark Hamill does Joker justice, his voice is perfect. Kevin Conroy also did a great job as Batman.\n\nGet it even if you're not a Batman fan, it's amazing.\n\nCharacters: 9/10\nStory: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSound: 8/10\n\nOverall: 9/10\n","May 22, 2015","true","33.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Combat, story (characters, voice acting, etc), atmosphere, sound design and even graphical fidelity. This game captures what it is to be batman and my god its DAMN FUN. The developers going into making Arkham Asylum said "What can we do to make you feel like batman right away, as soon as we give the player control we want them to feel like a bad(t)♥♥♥ (pardon the pun). You feel like batman, the way your character is animated and moves, the freeflow combat system has you jumping around bruising bad people until the cows come home with some of the most satisfying combat I have played to date.\n\nHere is a huge thing for me, and for all Batman fans. I watched the cartoon as a kid. Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamil all brought the cartoon and that world to vivid life. Well guess what guys, they got just about everyone from the cartoon to revoice their characters in Arkham Asylum, Harley, Gordon, Batman, Joker, Scarcrow etc. It is an incredible cast and it immerses you so fully in the world you almost never want to leave. The world that Rocksteady has recreated is fantastic, with dark colors and almost a noirish feel to the game that sucks you deeper and deeper into the world. You truly ARE batman in this game. It reminds me of a mixture of the cartoon and Tim Burtons dark seedy take on Batman. It is truly a game to be experianced.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? Abso♥♥♥♥inglutely. If you enjoy 3rd person fighting games with smooth combat systems that just make you want to sing while you are playing them. THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. If you are a fan of the Batman universe, cartoon, or comics YOU OWE it to yourself to pick up and play this game. It is absolutely fantastic.\nI would recommend this game to just about anyone who enjoys a solid, FUN game in every aspect.\n\nI would honestly give this game a 9 out of 10. Top 20 in my list of favorite games of all time.\nSee you in Arkham City Batfans.\n_Rog","March 4, 2015","true","16.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As for the game, the intro is nice and the visuals are impressive, but I found that the game really assumes that you know what you're doing and where you're going. The map system is terrible, and I found myself doubling back down corridors over and over to figure where the heck I was supposed to be.\n\nHalf the items you see as you play the game you can't collect until after you've unlocked certain upgrades, which is frustrating, and frankly a poor way to convince a completionist to go back through all the levels he's gotten lost in and ask him to go find more trophies. Nevertheless, I did it all.\n\nThe main campaign has a solid story and - as a person who is not intimately familiar with every villian - I enjoyed reading the back stories on the characters I unlocked. The immersion level is very good, and the controls are intuitive.\n\nChallenge mode gets a little frustrating, but it's worth it to see the achievements pop at the end.\n\nOverall: It's a solid Batman game with some flaws, and while it doesn't stack up for me with the top games, it's still a worthy endeavor.","November 25, 2013","true","38.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

All the action takes place on the island-bound asylum known as Arkham. Environments range from run-down morgues to a crumbling neo-gothic mansion, all of which look lush. Assisting the Joker is his army of convict henchmen who can be dispatched using vicious hand-to-hand combat moves. With no real special powers , Batman relies only on his training and gagdets.

Now that I finally have a gaming PC I decided to download and try this Dark Knight Simulator.\nNow I had only ever played bits of this game on console in the past and I never really understood the hype. But after throwing all the settings on max and jumping into this game I finally saw the light (or the Dark, I guess).\nArkham Asylum comes complete with a combo/counter/beat 'em up combat system which has you throwing punches left, right and centre with the finese of a Bat. Get your combo building and the Bat becomes quicker and more powerful. But the fun doesn't end at the combat. The Joker has a night of fun in plan for the Batman and it goes from bad (by bad I mean really, really good) to worse (It starts to get really exciting towards the end.) and seeing all the familiar villians locked away in Arkham suddenly freed and hungry for the blood of the Bat leads to some utterly awesome encounters.\nThe Riddler also has you covered if you are looking for a game with an insane amount of collectables, the only dissapointment with this game was the lack of a New Game Plus function, although this did get rectified in the later sequels!\n\nFancy becoming the Bat for a night in the Joker's Funhouse?

This game does just about everything right. The atmosphere, music, story and acting are all top notch. The controls feel fluid and responsive. All I can really say to sum it all up is this game makes you feel like the Batman. There were times while swinging above my enemies, slowly dispatching them one after another I found myself giggling with a psychotic glee. "Good luck finding me you brain-dead thugs! I'm  Batman!"\n\nArkham Asylum is a 3rd person Metroidvania styled action game. You play as Batman (of course) and explore an insane asylum that has been taken over by The Joker. You're free to explore the asylum (which is a huge island complex) at your leisure, but you are forced along the correct order of places by slowly unlocking new abilities.\n\nEach room in Arkham plays out like one of a few minigames depending on what's going on. Sometimes the room will be filled with armed thugs hunting you, and the game becomes a stealth game. You swing from the rafters slowly dispatching enemies that wander too far into the shadows. It is very fun. As more of the thug's friends vanish, they become more and more fearful for their own hide. By the time you're down to the last thug, they're often crying in a corner or shooting randomly all about the room screaming in absolute terror.\n\nThe game has some rooms that are filled with packs of unarmed enemies you have to beat down with your bat fists. The hand to hand combat is wildly satisfying, and soon you'll be blocking, counter attacking and vaulting everything in a huge blur of bat punches.\n\nThere are still other sections that become platformers. These require you to navigate all sorts of crazy structures by jumping, swinging and roping all over. These aren't as strong as platforming in say, Prince of Persia, but they are decent and get the job done.\n\nThere's all sorts of other ways the game changes itself up for you as you progress, but I don't want to spoil the surprise. Just do yourself a favor and go become the Batman.\n","August 11, 2014","true","22.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/battleprincesss/recommended/35140/","battleprincesss","battleprincesss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/battleprincesss/","124 products in account","Two years ago, I watched a playthrough of this game on Youtube -- I was overseas at the time, and couldn't play the game myself. When I bought it a few months ago on Steam, I thought of maybe skipping over it and moving on to games I hadn't already seen. Damn, am I glad I didn't do that.\n\nThere's pretty much nothing I can say about Arkham Asylum that hasn't been said already. I mean, ♥♥♥♥, it came out in 2009 -- in game development terms, it's halfway to a FOSSIL. It is in the ground with sediments, you know what I mean? So let's make this quick:\n\nThings you'll find annoying: as I've said before the Uncanny Valley is strong with this game. Although the graphics SING from most camera angles, close-ups pretty much always incite second-hand embarrassment. It feels like you're watching action figures trying to emote, and it's kind of unnerving from time to time.\n\nThe UI design is also a point of irritation. The button mapping is ♥♥♥♥ing WEIRD in this game, and totally shrugs off the industry standard for reasons that are hard to understand. Batman's utility belt is really hard to navigate, which is kind of negligible most of the time but ♥♥♥♥ing INFURIATING when you're in the heat of battle and need to switch quickly to one of your tools. Ivy ♥♥♥♥ing owned me several times thanks to this ♥♥♥♥ and definitely not because I am kind of a button-mashy litttle ♥♥♥♥ who gets really freaked out when the going gets stressful, yes, HARDY HAR HAR.\n\nThe battle system doesn't seem to know WHAT the ♥♥♥♥ it's doing. There's this huge emphasis on chaining your attacks, but the system to do so is super unintuitive, and to be honest it generally just doesn't work. Combo streaks are ruined by even a two second pause in your momentum, and it takes so long to incapacitate an enemy that's down that you're pretty much better off just staying up and wailing on them until they fall.\n\nAlso, if you're a lady, or if you're into ladies not having to deal with hypersexualization and objectification all the time... Well, let's just say this game isn't hugely progressive on that point.\n\nThings you'll love: Pretty much everything else. Yeah, no, I'm serious. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing GREAT, it's awesome. DCAU Batman is my ♥♥♥♥ing jam, dude. Seriously, here is a list of everything Arkham Asylum does SO RIGHT:\n\n*  The voice acting. Kevin Conroy as Batman? Mark Hamill as Joker?? Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn??? Jesus take the wheel.\n*  The narrative. Utilizing the freeroam features as well as certain linear segments, Arkham Asylum feels rich and multidimensional, and successfully brings you fully along with its main character. Being Bruce feels good, it feels powerful and awesome, and your compulsion as a player to pursue his nemesis to the end of the game is very organic and real. The story is interesting and fun to play, and very well-paced.\n*  The fan service. The amount of available fan service -- from hidden easter eggs to second-long cameos -- makes this game highly accessible both to longtime Batman fans, and to brand new ones. Even though I've been a big fan of Batman for a long time, I found myself learning things I'd never known before about some of my favorite Batman characters.\n*  The gameplay. Although the combat and UI are set up in a way that sort of annoys me, the gameplay is KILLER nonetheless. The stealth sections allow for a high level of creativity and invention; the combat-heavy sections allow you to feel like a completely, heavy metal bad ♥♥♥; the bosses each demand your creativity and engagement in a different way, and all of them are REALLY cool.\n\nThis game is ROCKIN and you will enjoy playing it if you enjoy fun. Period.\n\n(But... c'mon. You knew that.)","July 13, 2014","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't even begin to describe it, just play it already. The gameplay is also really well made to. There are essentially three aspects to the game. The first is the combat. At first it just seems like you could just mash the attack button but as the game goes on it introduces so many features. Mainly there is a combo system where you have to only hit the button once between hits to keep it going. You want to keep it going so you can use the really good moves that you unlock. Also there are enemies that have to be hit in certain ways or you get hurt. The other aspect is stealth. It's pretty straight forward and that is what works about it. You don't have much to worry about other than staying out of line of sight while picking off the guards one by one. There are also gadgets to use that can let you do some pretty cool things. The third aspect is exploring the island. While the game is pretty much linear there is a bit of a puzzle for how to get to the next area or actual puzzle like sections and even some hidden goodies. Definitely one of the games where it is worth getting all the collectibles in.\n\nI give the game 5 batarangs out of 5.","May 22, 2014","true","33.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","6"

The game still looks great, is very expansive with lots of secrets to discover and challenges to conquer, and a story that involves a good amount of Batman's Rogue Gallery without them feeling tacked on. Although the combat forces you to be more tactical due to it demanding more precise button presses, and thus, making the gameplay a little slower, it still holds up to this day. Surprising, as it's still more responsive and precise than Origins. No Batman fan should go without playing this game.","March 4, 2014","true","29.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quikblend/recommended/35140/","quikblend","quikblend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quikblend/","545 products in account","Here is my review for Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition\n\nIntro:   The story places after Batman has finally captured Joker and is transporting him to Arkham Asylum. He senses something bigger is happening, but isn't sure what it is. After entering Arkham Asylum, Batman becomes just another inmate and must battle his enemies and restore order the Asylum.\n\nGameplay / Sound:   Batman AA plays like a super advanced version of crackdown. Don't know crackdown? Well its a action adventure game where you use buttons to chain together attacks and combine with Batman's arsenal. It involves kicks, batarangs, batman's cape, explosive gel and many other items. While in combat you can chain these weapons along with dodge and counter button to quickly wipe out the enemy. The second part is part stealth action game, where you can take down enemies without alerting anyone, in classic Batman fashion. There is great satisifaction from taking on 6-10 enemies and just picking them all off, one by one. The only issue I have with this is that you have to watch "slow mo" kills on the last enemy. Granted you can skip it, it almost doesnt feel really necessary to also cut to that. All the inmates are like mini hulks and just look like the can bash your skull in, luckily Batman is a master of combat.  After about the first couple of hours the combat begins to grow stale and repetitive. If you complete 100 % everything like I do, than it almost becomes a grind. Other than that a normal playthrough will be enough for most players. The sound effects whether you are solving riddler challenges or destroying Joker's toy teeth, each sound is unique that you'll always remember what each sound indicates. The voices of fan favorites shows up in Batman AA and makes the game very nostalgic.\n\nStory :   The story of Arkham Asylum revolves around Batman trying to escape from AA and stop the Joker from unleashing a weapon upon Gotham. The story is fleshed out between common knowledge, background audio tapes dubbed "patient reports" and through dialogue. In terms of complete story Batman AA has it all. A clear Beginning, Middle and End. You never are lost and are always free to continue the main story whenever. This means going on "side quests" to collect all the goodies hidden in the asylum. The story mainly focuses on Joker and Batman, but many other villains show up to help move the plot along. The story is almost purely confinded to the island, whether it is above or below, you grow to love the asylum, no matter how many enemies reside within its walls.\n\nReplayability:   Batman AA has tons of replayability for players who are looking to collect all the achievements, records, and solve the riddlers questions. Outside of all those things, there isn't any main story to complete after you run through it. Extra modes like the fighting, stealth and reward challenges will keep you busy, but after that the replay value decreases. Batman AA is meant for a story playthrough and includes all these extras to keep you interested. Most people will just complete the story and will be satisfied with their time on Arkham Asylum.\n\nControls:  The controls are fluid and really smooth. Rocksteady worked hard on this and makes it very easy for anyone to pick and a play. There is no big learning curve which makes this a very attractive game to new users and veteran players.\n\nConclusion: If you are looking into buying Arkham Asylum or a Batman fan, this is the game for you. It has tons of juicy story content, great characters and voice acting, and a great open world system. The combat can get reptitive and some tasks might repeat themselves, but overall Batman Arkham Asylum is a great addition to everyone's collection.\n\nFinal Score: 9 out of 10","March 23, 2015","true","24.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Investigating things in the game is explained once at the very start, then used for optional collectibles and backstory, then suddenly, well past the halfway point, makes its return critical to the game's progress.\nI'd by then completely forgotten how to trigger this and the game doesn't re-explain the mechanic or even list it in the controls or help functions. I eventually had to dig through guides and walkthroughs for a refresher on how this core game mechanic worked.\n\nThe rest of the game is totally fine though.\nBatman and its universe will always be a bit silly in a totally straight-faced way, but this outing definitely showed that it can be presented in a way enjoyable to non-fans as well.","July 9, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played Batman; Arhkam City nearly two years after its release, and needless to say I was hooked. I wasn't willing to buy a PS3 or Xbox 360 for one game, and I didn't have a PC capable of handling the game, so I had to wait for a while before I got around to this title.\n\nAs the title may suggest, Batman; Arkham Asylum (BAA) is a fascinating romp through Gotham's infamous Arkham Asylum. The battle interface used throughout the series makes a very strong debut as you fight hordes of crazed criminals while attempting to regain control of the facility from the Joker. There are several memorable encounters with other well-known characters from the Batman universe along the way. The game very successfully gives the player an opportunity to be the Batman in a variety of situations. One moment you will need to stealthily overtake an area by sneaking through vents and hanging from gargoyles to secure a room full of armed baddies. The next you may be in an all-out brawl with a grundle of thugs. At other times you will use your investigative skills to locate evidence to help you along the way. It is all well done and such a blast! I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys a well made game.\n\n10/10","October 22, 2015","true","57.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But Arkham Asylum changed that. It made people say, ‘Finally! A superhero game that doesn’t suck!’ Batman Arkham Asylum is about Batman (duh) getting trapped in Arkham Asylum (also duh). Unfortunately he is trapped with some of the most dangerous criminals in all of Gotham, including the Joker, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy and Scarecrow.\nThe game controls aren’t too hard to figure out. You use the mouse to look around and to attack and block. Space to run, and ctrl to crouch. Every time you knock down a thug you get experience points. Get enough of them and you can level up. Levelling up allows you to pick an upgrade, such as armour improvements and new abilities. Obviously you can’t have a Batman game without gadgets, so throughout the game you will unlock many, including batarangs, grapple gun, and oh, did I mention explosives?\nThe Boss fights/Areas are quite varied, from overcoming Scarecrows fear gas, to sneaking through the sewers trying not to be eaten by Killer Croc. Although one problem I had with the game was the fact that Bane wasn’t smart. Instead all he does is through things at you and ram you.

But Arkham Asylum changed that. It made people say, ‘Finally! A superhero game that doesn’t suck!’ Batman Arkham Asylum is about Batman (duh) getting trapped in Arkham Asylum (also duh). Unfortunately he is trapped with some of the most dangerous criminals in all of Gotham, including the Joker, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy and Scarecrow.\nThe game controls aren’t too hard to figure out. You use the mouse to look around and to attack and block. Space to run, and ctrl to crouch. Every time you knock down a thug you get experience points. Get enough of them and you can level up. Levelling up allows you to pick an upgrade, such as armour improvements and new abilities. Obviously you can’t have a Batman game without gadgets, so throughout the game you will unlock many, including batarangs, grapple gun, and oh, did I mention explosives?\nThe Boss fights/Areas are quite varied, from overcoming Scarecrows fear gas, to sneaking through the sewers trying not to be eaten by Killer Croc. Although one problem I had with the game was the fact that Bane wasn’t smart. Instead all he does is through things at you and ram you.

I played Batman; Arhkam City nearly two years after its release, and needless to say I was hooked. I wasn't willing to buy a PS3 or Xbox 360 for one game, and I didn't have a PC capable of handling the game, so I had to wait for a while before I got around to this title.\n\nAs the title may suggest, Batman; Arkham Asylum (BAA) is a fascinating romp through Gotham's infamous Arkham Asylum. The battle interface used throughout the series makes a very strong debut as you fight hordes of crazed criminals while attempting to regain control of the facility from the Joker. There are several memorable encounters with other well-known characters from the Batman universe along the way. The game very successfully gives the player an opportunity to be the Batman in a variety of situations. One moment you will need to stealthily overtake an area by sneaking through vents and hanging from gargoyles to secure a room full of armed baddies. The next you may be in an all-out brawl with a grundle of thugs. At other times you will use your investigative skills to locate evidence to help you along the way. It is all well done and such a blast! I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys a well made game.\n\n10/10","October 22, 2015","true","57.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where do I begin?\n\nThe atmosphere just gets you right in the gut from the beginning of the game. Filling you inside this disturbed and twisted asylum filled with the beloved Batman characters we all know today. It's pretty damn good for just the beginning of the game. It starts already with you capturing Joker, which is a change in pace of the typical Batman stuff we know. However it has, dare I say, realism aspects in the game. This changes the overall mood and pace; this game wants you to take it seriously and they convey a good job of that.\n\nThe controls are tight and compact. I rarely have issues with them other than some hiccups here and there, but it's rare. It feels very comfortable and smooth, where even the most basic of games like Left 4 Dead have some problems with gamepad support, dispite the limitations. I was playing with a gamepad this run, so the keyboard and mouse may have more polished controls than the standard, though I digress.\n\nThe characters have, duh, character. The basic batman shows and comics have the same idea, though this game makes it all well and good. I was wondering what character would act like what, and it just left me guessing over and over.\n\nMy favorite part was the scarecrow sequences. It was just plain brilliant. It had some scare factor, and a level of difficulty to the game. It breaks the action from the typical game and throws you for a loop each sequence: even going as far to break the 4th wall entirely.\n\nThe ending, however wasn't very polished. For the sake of people wanting to know themselves, I won't spoil this. Though I admit it could be done a little better.\n\nOverall, give this game your money. I mean it. It deserves it. And it deserved Game of the Year. Get it. Now.","March 15, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I eventually had to dig through guides and walkthroughs for a refresher on how this core game mechanic worked.\n\nThe rest of the game is totally fine though.\nBatman and its universe will always be a bit silly in a totally straight-faced way, but this outing definitely showed that it can be presented in a way enjoyable to non-fans as well.","July 9, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Joker pulls all the strings and you must fight the odds. It starts off with Joke being escorted to his asylum under Batman and Arkham Asylum's watchful eyes but Joker manages to escape and turns the asylum into his playground. You must save the people in the asylum and stop this madness that Joker had planned all along. The voice acting is top-notch. One can listen to Joker or the Riddler talk all day. The Scarecrow bit in the game is one of the best gaming moments ever. I loved the tone of many super-villians in an asylum with Batman. This game changed the whole landscape for the superhero games.\n\nYou will feel like Batman as you will owerpower most of the thugs. Different gadgets are used to solve puzzles and move ahead in the story. The sleath mechanics are well done too and one of the best parts about stealth is how after you take out one of the enemies the fear slowly grips other enemies as they become aggressive but as soon as the numbers start dwindlling they start to panic, this machenic is one of the best in the gaming history. Boss fights on the other hand were a bit too easy and lackluster. Also there is some odd detective work which was nice. Of course, there is the good old fashioned brawling there too.\n\nGraphics and atmosphere are good as they capture the tone of the dark and gritty world. Art-style is also very good. Environmental design is brilliant and there a twisted sense of character in every area you’ll discover. This claustrophobic cove of madness oozing terror has to be one of the best settings in video-games.\n\nIt has everything you would like from an immersive world, great storyline, sleath, detective work and old fashioned brawling. What else do you want? So, are you a Batman fan? buy this game, even if you are not one you will still love this game and is inarguably one of the best superhero games ever.","November 25, 2015","true","27.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A few minor puzzles and collectables in the form of Riddler riddles, some of which require you to grapple, climb or just scan areas in far off corners. Excellent story as mentioned before as Batman battles an array of villains as well as a nice steady progress as the henchmen themselves get harder to defeat.\n\nCons; Personally the only thing that slightly annoyed me was the Scarecrow sections as the game seemed to switch from 3D to a strange 2D style, this also occurred in a few fights towards the end. Not a big issue but did confuse me as the normal game view and ability to move the camera were just fine.\n\nOverall and excellent game that holds up to many even to this date well worth is asking price even more so if on sale, thumbs up!","February 1","true","24.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a solid action/adventure game that is very successful in making the player feel like they are Batman.  This is something just about every Batman game released before Arkham Asylum failed to do.  It manages to achieve this through a perfect combat system that allows you to utilise gadgets while throwing enemies around.  I couldn't find any faults in the control system or combat mechanics.\n\nThe game offers fantastic voice acting, great graphics, enjoyable story, an upgrade system that flows well with the story, the combination of puzzle and stealth elements.  Then when you are finished with the story, you can spend time collecting trophies within the game.  Collecting these trophies never even felt like a chore.  You can then test your combat skills in the challenge section, as well as your stealth instincts in the predator challenge section.\n\nYou have plenty to discover in the game, with many villains making appearances, full bios, hidden recordings, riddler trophies and many hidden areas within the map.  If you combine everything I have mentioned, you have an unforgettable experience and a game that is quite possible (at the time of writing) the best comic game ever made.","September 8, 2014","true","12.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PavilionGT/recommended/35140/","PavilionGT","PavilionGT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PavilionGT/","189 products in account","If you haven't picked up Batman: Arkham Asylum, you're a crazy person. The game came out about a year ago and I declared that it was the best comic book game of all time. What's your deal? Get it. However, if you ignored me, Batman: Arkham Asylum (Game of the Year Edition) has come along and it's a worthy addition to your videogame collection.\n\nBatman GOTY is the original game I loved along with four additional challenge maps and the newfound ability to play in 3D. Basically, it's more bang for your buck.\n\nNow, before visions of Avatar-like 3D go running through your head, it's important to point out that the 3D in Batman GOTY is super-basic. You turn on the 3D filter from the main menu, pop on a pair of paper glasses with pink and green lenses, and play. It works – the HUD is at the forefront and there's definitely a depth of field effect – but it's not amazing and the glasses wash the color out of the game. That sucks seeing as how the environments and action look so good in Arkham Asylum.\nThe challenge maps are cool. Crime Alley is a fist-fighting challenge where you need to beat four waves of the Joker's men, and it's set in the very alley where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. Nocturnal Hunter is a silent challenge where you need to take out a bunch of guards and complete some objectives. Meanwhile, Totally Insane and Scarecrow Nightmare throw enemies at you until you fall. All are fun and welcome additions to the regular game's challenges.\n\nIf you haven't picked up this game, you should have no qualms about grabbing Batman: Arkham Asylum (Game of the Year). If you already own Batman, the 3D and challenge maps (a few of which you can just download) really don't warrant you plunking down your pocket change to buy this one again.\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is a third-person action game casting you as -- you guessed it, chum -- the Dark Knight himself. The title opens with Batman racing back to Arkham, Gotham's home for the criminally insane, with the Joker in tow. Seems the Clown Prince of Crime broke out a few weeks ago, but Batman was able to track him down and re-apprehend the baddie. However, things are never what they seem with the Joker, so after getting the wiry maniac back into the building -- a building stocked with hundreds of the Joker's goons after a "mysterious" fire at their prison -- Mr. J breaks free with the help of Harley Quinn, takes control of the penitentiary, and releases all the inmates.\n\nHoly plot twist, Batman!\n\nFrom there, you're off on an adventure that ranks right below The Dark Knight movie in terms of awesome Batman experiences. The actual Arkham campus is a loony bin spread across multiple buildings on one massive rock. With the Joker in charge you're going to have to swing over rooms filled with gas, save doctors, rip vent covers off the walls so you can make a path around locked doors, and move as fast as Batman can to stop the Joker from releasing an army of monsters on the people of Gotham City.\n\nNow, that might sound like your typical Batman story -- and it kind of is -- but it's important to point out that this is a fairly adult title. Yeah, some of the folks from Batman: The Animated Series are back to reprise their roles (Mark Hamill is the Joker, Kevin Conroy is Batman, and Arleen Sorkin is Harley Quinn), but this isn't the cartoon. Harley's wearing a fairly skimpy outfit that shows off her lady parts, Poison Ivy's in some painted-on panties, colorful language like "♥♥♥" and "♥♥♥♥♥" is peppered in, and there are people getting murdered left and right. Arkham itself is a dark and dingy place that just had every psychopath housed there run through the halls tearing the building apart. Dead guards are laid out on the floor, papers are strewn about, and the facilities have seen better days.\nThese adult themes tied in with a very, very Batman-looking world really drive home your connection to the story. I don't think I'm ever going to forget Mr. Zsasz holding a knife to a female doctor, her screaming for me to save her, the Joker screaming at Zsasz to kill her, and Zsasz screaming at me to stay back. After years of the Riddler being goofy, I realized Arkham's version of the character was on a different level when he told a Riddle that ended in dismembering a baby. Plus, the segments where you're under the Scarecrow's influence and Batman's worst fears are realized are some of the coolest, most cerebral parts of the game. These are the moments that wrapped me up in the experience and made me feel like Batman on the longest night of his life.\n\nGameplay in this dark, creepy world breaks down into three main portions -- fist fighting, attacking from the shadows, and exploration. As you move from room to room chasing Harley or Commissioner Gordon's kidnapper, you're going to run into bad guys. Lots of times, you'll find a crew milling about or the Joker will spring a trap with handfuls of guys who are ready to kill you. This is when you'll make use of your straight hand-to-hand moves.\n\nFist fighting in Arkham Asylum is pretty much the definition of an easy to learn/hard to master combat system. The game allows Batman to move faster than his enemies (He's a trained ninja, people!) and engage them in 360 degrees. You just point your left stick towards whatever enemy you want to attack and Batman follows suit. Through four buttons -- strike, reverse, jump, and stun -- you'll unleash Mr. Wayne's fury on the scum of the Earth. Obviously, you can just mash the strike button and take down the bad guys with a healthy set of animations -- dropkicks, elbows, punches, and more are peppered in -- and reverse when you see the spider-sense icon pop-up above a bad guy's head, but there's a sweet science to this madness.","September 10, 2014","true","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Just shut up and get it.\n\nJust Kidding, Okay where do I start. Firstly, the graphics, just stunning. I know it came out few years back, but it is still stunning. The best part about this game is the gameplay and the story. It gives us the freedom to be a HERO, nono SUPERHERO. The combat style, the weapon(I know this "Mr Good Guy" doesn't use gun but he still have tons of cool tool which I see it as weapons), the freedom to take down an enemy the way you want, and just all of it, just just its like all of your childhood dreams in one game.\n\nGameplay- 10/10 You will fall in love with the gameplay (But some may say playing with controller is better where it allows them more flexibility for getting higher combo, but that's more to peoples preference)\n\nStory- 10/10 It will explains the story of Batman and few other Vilians from how to who they are now. The plots are amazing.\n\nGraphics- 9.5/10 I admit its been years, but if you play the game it is still a beauty and you wont even believe that this game came out few years ago.\n\nOverall-9.5/10 The best Superhero game ever.","November 29, 2013","true","16.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As you see it´s simple but full of shades among the different corridors of the Asylum. During the game you´ll find some of the most famous villains, and every boss fight hides messages as references for their comic-story.\n\n\nAs for the gameplay. Actually its fun, it has some fails of course but you can still enjoy the combat. You can counter, attack or stun your enemy with the Freeflow combat, this system also allows Batman to move fast between your targets, chaining different combos with your gadgets in order to get over with.\nIf you don´t want to fight all day you can use predatory tactics. The predator combat is based on the stealth, silent knockbacks, takedowns, drops or even using your gadgets (like explosives) to destroy walls or roofs in order to tilt the odds in your favor.\nAfter this you´ll be rewarded with XP, which are used to:\n\n-Improve your physicall armor.\n-Unlock combat moves & Gadgets.\n-Get Health upgrades.\n\nWhat about the enemies? Well, they react to your own acts as Batman. If they find inconcious allies their "fear" will raise, altering their behavior. And this means that they´ll change their patterns. They can shoot on sight, disable your predator points (gargoyles for instance), move to another part of the scenario, stay together with their allies forcing you to change your tactics.\n\nThe design is hilarious and was complete in 2 years, one of the developers spent these years just designing Batmans Cape, just for make it move realistically. It´s not about the cape, it´s about the work, effort and love that this developers made to make this game shine. Even the writing, they though that more characters (like Freeze) will not fit into this game, due to discrepancies with Joker and because he doesnt have personal grudges against Batman. They though this with nearly every antagonist and they only use the ones who makes sense with their plot.\nTalking about characters...the developers WANTED the voices of the Animated Series made by Paul Dini. In fact Dini was helping with the writing of it. So they took Mark Hamill as Joker and Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn respectively...and Kevin Conroy for Batman. Nothing more to say guys 10/10 in dubbing.\n\n\nFinally, the game also has a lot of content even when you finish it. A lot of riddles, Joker Teeth, Riddler Trophies, Chronicles of Arkham, Patient Interviews (audios talking about the different stories of the villains) and combat Challenges.\n\nMust Buy Guys.\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBueno, ha pasado un tiempo desde que disfrutásemos de un buen Batman OST HARDLY RELATED pero este juego es algo interesante...\n\n\nRocksteady Studios nos trajo este juego en 2009, es decir 3 años después de su primer juego Urban Chaos (decentillo IMO), así que estuve esperando un tiempo hasta pillar el formato GOTY y es hora de hablar.\n\nSu motor gráfico es el Unreal Engine 3, usado por el aclamado estudio Epic Games, y usa muy bien sus características como el LCPP (Lightning Calculations Per Pixel) y el HDRR (High Dynamic Range Renderer) permitiendote contemplar toda la escenografía y efectos creados para el juego.\n\n\nLa trama es increíble, un Joker retorcido que instiga un elaborado plan para hacerse con el control del sanatorio mental de Arkham, atrapando a Batman dentro con los maníacos y todos los enemigos que ha ido encerrando estos años. Sinceramente es una trama simple, pero creada para que de juego con todos los matices que quieren ofrecerte en el juego. A lo largo del juego encontrarás a algunos de los villanos más famosos de Batman, y todos esconden historias más allá de sus peleas referentes al cómic.\n\n\nHablando del modo de juego. Es muy divertido, aunque con fallos de respuesta en contadas ocasiones que ciertamente no te evitarán disfrutar del juego. Puedes contraatacar, atacar o usar stuns en un modo desarrollado por Rocksteady llamado Freeflow combat. Este sistema permite moverte a gran velocidad entre los enemigos, encadenando diferentes combos con tus artilugios para superar los encuentros.\nSi no quieres estar luchando todo el día, te entiendo, puedes usar otra variante del combate conocida como depredador. El modo depredador se basa en el sigilo, ataques sigilosos y derribos sin alertar a los enemigos, usar puntos altos para agarrar a tus enemigos o usar los utensilios para destruir paredes, techos, etc... para inclinar la balanza a tu favor.\nDespués del combate, serás recompensado con puntos de experiencia, que son usados para:\n\n-Mejorar tu armadura física.\n-Desbloquear movimientos y utensilios.\n-Desbloquear mejoras de salud.\n\n\nAcerca de los enemigos. Reaccionan a los actos de Batman. Si encuentran a un compañero inconsciente o son alertados por un superior su nivel de "miedo" aumentará haciendo que adopten diferentes patrones y alterando su comportamiento. Podrán disparar a discreción, destruir puntos altos (como gárgolas), moverse en grupos, explorar el escenario, etc...\n\nEl diseño tampoco se queda atrás, fue completado en tan solo 2 años. Para que entendáis el empeño del estudio. Uno de los programadores pasó estos 21 meses de desarrollo programando solo la capa, porque necesitaban un movimiento realista y que quedase resaltado por el UE3. Incluso el guión fue cuidado hasta el punto de no incluir más villanos de los necesarios, porque muchos de ellos desentonarían en el ámbito que se desarrolla en Arkham Asylum o por discrepancias con Joker(como Freeze). Y hablando de personajes, los desarrolladores QUISIERON las voces de la serie animada de Batman, si aquella de los 90 que tanto molaba, que hizo Paul Dini. De hecho el mismo Dini acabó ayudando en más de un aspecto del desarrollo. Así que debido a esto tomaron a Mark Hamill y Arleen Sorkin como Joker y Harley Quinn respectivamente y a Kevin Conroy como Batman. Un 10/10 en doblaje.\n\nPara finalizar, el juego tiene además una gran cantidad de contenido cuando lo superas. Acertijos, trofeos, mandíbulas de joker, diarios de audio para aprender más de los personajes, etc...\n\nEste juego es uno de los que deben jugarse.","October 9, 2014","true","18.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You can only think of the answer... There was a level aka. story stage which i couldn't finish but that is something you don't need to know here. But the game itself is really good the subtitles accully followed the game (we all know there are some games in which subtitles don't follow) and the graphics are okay (for some bad as i said my opinion). So the next Batman game that is Batman:Arkham Knight is suppose to be amazing and ofcourse as a huge Batman lover i agree with all the people who think that the game will be amazing. But again i went away from the accual point.

It was developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Eidos Interactive in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on August 25, 2009, with a Microsoft Windows version following on September 15.\n\nWritten by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini, Arkham Asylum is based on the long-running comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman's archenemy, the Joker, instigates an elaborate plot to seize control of Arkham Asylum and trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes. With Joker threatening to detonate hidden bombs around fictional Gotham City, Batman is forced to fight his way through the asylum's inmates and put an end to the Joker's plans. Most of the game's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe; Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman, the Joker, and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively. The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in combat and exploration.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim—particularly for its narrative—and won several awards, including Best Action Adventure game, Best Game, and Game of the Year from different media outlets. It held the Guinness World Record for "Most Critically Acclaimed Superhero Game Ever". A Game of the Year edition was released on March 26, 2010, and an OS X version was released in November 2011. Arkham Asylum '​s success launched a series of Batman: Arkham sequels, beginning in October 2011 with Batman: Arkham City.","January 8","true","8.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

But this game feels VERY new, and very wicked amazing...it's a "hey, we're in a new age of gaming" game. Everything's polished and built really well in this game. I think what draws me the most is #1: The freeflow feeling combat. FREAKING AWESOME and very fun and no strings attached. I could do challenge modes in the extras section for hours and totally love it. #2: The story is AMZING cool, i LOVE the gothic-yet-heroic feel of it. It made me want to watch Dark Knight. But it also made me want to go buy all the comics ever made because they really give you the opprotunity to immerse you into the Batman&Friends&Enemies story by giving you fun data things all about them when you collect trophies, etc. The music and killer voice acting also MAKE it.","February 14, 2011","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaobreaker/recommended/35140/","chaobreaker","fhqwhgads","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaobreaker/","386 products in account","So I always heard good things about the Batman Arkham games, but never got to play them. Last week I installed and played the copy of Batman: Arkham Asylum I had lying on my endlessly growing Steam backlog for the first time. After 30 hours of gametime, which included beating the campaign on both normal and hard difficulty, collecting all of the Riddler challenges, getting 3 stars on all the extra challenge mode games, and acquiring all of the achievements, I can confidently say that B: AA is one of the best games I ever played in a long time.\n\nI just want to preface the upcoming gushing I'm about to lay down by saying I love metroidvanias, am not very proficient in high execution gameplay, enjoy a good collect-a-thon, and think Batman is the ♥♥♥♥. This game pushed so many of the right buttons for me as a result.\n\nThe best description I can give for the gameplay is that it’s the perfect Batman experience. You can do most of the typical kind of platforming tricks you see in modern 3D action adventure games like in the Assassin Creed games but as Batman you have a variety of tools like a grappling hook that clings on almost all climbable ledges and a cape that helps you glide over larges distances. I found going around the titular asylum a very enjoyable experience, especially the occasional pure platforming and Scarecrow sections you’re encounter throughout the campaign.\n\nThe combat is probably the best part of the game. It really feels like you’re playing out a fight scene in a Batman cartoon or movie. It’s very simple to jump around the area pummeling your foes but you need proper timing and twitchy fingers to avoid getting hit and keeping your combo score up. You get a lot of tools and techniques that make the combat a breeze later on but I found myself being tested in some hard mode gauntlets and the dedicated challenge modes you unlock later in the game. Climbing on the larger titan enemies and forcing them to smack around the smaller goons is always a satisfying experience.\n\nThe predator sections where you have to stealthily take out a bunch of armed enemies in a huge room is fun. Pure fun. There are so many ways to dispatch them that they made a dedicated game mode for it. And the way the goons start getting freaked out after you pick them off is hilarious as ♥♥♥♥. Like I said, a very Batman-like experience.\n\nWhile the campaign is pretty linear, there are a ton of collectables sprinkled throughout the island. In a way this game is pretty metroidvana-like in that aspect, as you can backtrack to older areas and use the new items you acquire as you progress through the game to find even more secrets.  While the trophy collecting was pretty basic, the riddles sprinkled throughout the world are brilliant. I got a kick out of finding all of the solutions. You’ll also find these little perspective puzzles that require you to find 2 parts of a question mark hidden on the architecture and align them with your camera so they look whole. It’s hard to explain but they were cool.\n\nThe game is a visual and audible treat. The game looks very good, especially for an early-to-mid last gen game. I love all the minute detail for the world, like how Batman gets more visually damaged and grows a stubble as the campaign goes on. All the classic Batman characters get a gritty look that makes them look pretty badass (even though Batman still is wearing his underwear on the outside).  Getting some of the voices from the old animated series was pretty cool. Can’t say no to Steve Blum either.\n\n/gush\n\nNow, I do have some gripes with the game, though. You more and less fight the same kinds of goons throughout the game. The boss fights aren’t very good either, especially the final boss fight. Spoiler: I don’t like that you’re basically have a generic video game-like fight with a huge monster version of the Joker instead of an elaborate battle of wits that you see in other Batman works. It just felt out of place is all.\n\nAnyway, I love this game and I am so looking forward to playing Batman Arkham games in the future.","June 19, 2014","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's not as big or as long as the Arkham City or the Origins, but it feels complete, which its successors failed to accomplish - at least in my opinion.\n\nThe game is very loyal to the comic books and anyone familiar with Frank Miller's Batman stories - Batman: Year One and Dark Knight Returns - should find themselves right at home with this game. The voice actors have done a superb job with their roles and I can't praise Mark Hamill enough for his role as the Joker; the man is simply amazing - hard to believe the same voice belongs to Luke Skywalker. Graphically the game has aged well, and I still find myself impressed with what they've done with the environments and the characters themselves, and let us not forget the music - it has a very Tim Burton's Batman type of sound and enhances the experience even further.\n\nSo yes, I'd say this is a must buy to anyone who considers themselves a Batman fan.","December 31, 2013","true","31.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely one of the most fun thrid person story based games I have ever played. The storyline is fantastic, the characters are taken straight out of the comic universe so of course that is fantastic, and most importantly, the gameplay is fantastic. Even though it feels like the combat would get repetitive, it just doesn't because there is a perfect blend of environment variety and equiptment pacing. Almost every little thing you can think of feels like it was placed there for a specific game design reason, whether it be the guards standing position, or a little cupboard to hide behind. You generally cycle through different types of gameplay, from brawling, to stealth, to platforming, to pure epic boss fights.\n\nI particularly love the encounters with the scarecrow because it really shakes up the gameplay with a completely different camera perspective, and a branched off story about bruce wayne's past. While I usually have too much anxiety to play games with dark settings (like bioshock or deadspace), the game really makes me feel like I am batman and am the hunter not the hunted.

Although there's been plenty of Batman games in the past, I think this one perfectly captures the essence of the Dark Knight. Set in Gotham's famous asylum, you'll find yourself fighting against Batman's greatest rival: the Joker himself, as he attempts to pull out one of his greatest plans.\n\nThe fact that this takes place in the asylum, means that the Joker will not be the only member of Batman's rogues gallery you'll be encountering. Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, to name a few. Not to mention that the asylum is filled not only with Joker's henchment, but you'll also run into a few of the crazier inmates as well. Finally, the place itself really makes you feel that you're in Arkham, and it adds a sense of isolation.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, you're the Dark Knight. You'll spend a lot of time either beating up several thugs at once, or scaring the heck out of them as you take them out one by one in the predator rooms without being noticed. All of this can be accomplished with the help of Batman's arsenal of gadgets, from the classic Batarangs, to explosive gel. Then there's also Detective Mode, which allows you to scout the area to detect enemies and possible ways to take them down.\n\nIt's a really good game; I recommend it.","January 7, 2015","true","58.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I originally played this game on Xbox 360, but revisited the PC version and enjoyed it again even more with crisper graphics.  While the game does have some beat 'em up elements to it, it won't tire you out on them.  Though, if you do enjoy them, like I did, the game offers a challenge mode that lets you enjoy the wonderful contextual combo system.\n\nMuch of the appeal is the puzzle-like approach to clearing a room, or getting to your next objective by sticking to the shadows and using the fear tactics that Batman is known for.  The story is compelling, and the gameplay offers just enough variety to keep it from feeling bland.  There is a pleasant mixture of brawling, stealth action, story sequences, and detective work to keep your attention.\n\nIf you haven't yet played Batman: Arkham Asylum, I would highly recommend the PC version using either mouse/keyboard or a 360 game controller, especially before the sequel arrives!","July 3, 2011","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being said, Batman: Arkham Asylum is kinda far off.\n\nLet's not get anything wrong here.  Playing as Batman is simply amazing.  You really get that feel of Batman as you glide from gargoyle to gargoyle, and dangle people from a rope that's attached to the gargoyle.  However, Arkham Asylum's controls and game mechanics are far off than City's.  Gliding is practically non-existant, and when there is enough space to glide, you can't grapple onto anything mid-flight.  This is rather frustrating, because you often can't get the drop on a baddie unless you flop on the floor first, then grapple.  The fighting is almost identicle.  You can land hits from 20 feet away, and just punch those baddies until they drop.  The biggest con I found however, was the story.  I had a hard time following the story, and there hardly was one.  The ending felt empty and un-rewarding, unlike City's ending which made you feel like crying into your pillow.\n\nThis is a nice addition to the other two, and it's where the series started.  I highly recammend this title, except not for the $30 price range.  Wait until it's on sale, around $10.  You will get all the thrills of being The Batman, however not as much as you would playing the other two additions to the series.","September 27, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I really was interested to keep going just to know\nhow the whole thing pans out.\nDetective mode is great and sets you up to be the world's greatest detective.\n\nTalking about combat again, this uses a free flow combat system where you need to gain momentum and\nbuild combos to score high. Its easy to learn but takes time and patience to master.\nLeft click and right click are your attack and block respectively. That, in conjuction with the shift key and along with\nnumber keys for gadgets, you can make Batman a very agressive figther.\n\nOverall an excellent game, and worth playing especially if you are an avid Batman fan.","April 5, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Harley Quinn also makes an appearance in an outfit you won't soon forget, as well as a number of other key Batman villains with varying purposes and roles.\n\nThe combat system is immensely satisfying, as you level your character up, you gain more techniques to use against enemies (whom you can fight upwards of 8-13 in some instances) and they are all quite useful once you get them into your routine.\n\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough, what an amazing Batman game this turned out to be!","April 19, 2011","true","46.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is immersive; if you ever played Spiderman, the combat mimicks that of Spidey and counter measuring your enemies is very satisfying. Nothing beats dodging and throwing Mike Tyson punches and spin kicks to thugs. Majority of buildings and structures are mountable with your Batlaw to scout areas for enemies or to strategize how to pick them off one-by-one. The latter will apply to situations when there are enemies with machine guns as bullets take a good chunk of Batman's health. Yet this is where it gets fun; you as The Dark Knight can use the Batclaw to mount on a gargoyle and press Y button to hang an unsuspecting thug onto the gargoyle while he screams "Let me down!" Others nearby will hear their comrade and rush to him. What do you do? Grapple to the next gargoyle and repeat. You can also take them out silently by sneaking behind them or using certain gadgets. For enemies with only fists and melee weapons, you can just zerg in and counter when necessary.\n\nGraphics are amazing as are the movie-like cutscenes. The voice acting is superb. I recommend playing with Physics on. I played with the GTX 295 with Physics set to High and it was outstanding. The game is very fun. Only part what I viewed as tedious was Croc and his lair. Scarecrow was literally creepy and disturbing. Poison Ivy was, well, hot! The final battle to the game's conclusion was a great experience. Simple but challenging.\n\nI'm now playing Arkham City.

Anything you read online about this game being one of the best is true. But, I strongly recommend you play this installment of the Arkham series before any other, because the games only get better.\n\nCombat: Depending on the hardware you are running, it can be anywhere from erratic and choppy to fluid. If you can hold a steady 30 frames, then you can really appreciate the combat. Upgrades give you more options in how you take down thugs, and boss fights are challenging and rewarding.\n\nStealth: Stealth missions really require you to stop and think about how you want to handle a room. Be wary of line of sight as well, because if you can see them, they can see you. Note: Not as refined as the next titles in the Arkham series.\n\nEnvironment: Everything looks and feels like a true Batman story. The environment is dirty and gritty, and you know you're Arkham just by looking around.

I played this game on normal difficulty and finished it in 12 hours. However that was just the main story, if i went back and found all of riddlers trophies it would take considerably longer, normal difficulty was certainly very challenging, dying many times and getting very frustrated. I played the game with the mouse and keyboard, but would advise on the gamepad if you have access to one, as it can get a bit fiddly when facing multiple enemies.\nOverall this game was very fun, i got it on humble bundle with Arkham City which i will start playing straight away.\nThere is a free roaming element to this game, however it's mostly indoors, with one outdoor area, that isn't entirely massive.","November 26, 2013","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/35140/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Arkham Asylum presents a fun experience based off the comic book series. As a whole, this game is comparable to The Dark Knight in terms of quality story, art, and cinematics. The storyline is a series of twists and turns as Batman has to stop Joker while facing off against other supervillains in order to reach Joker. The game is set on Arkham Island both inside the asylum and on the outside grounds. Batman has to fight, sneak, solve, and explore his way using various different actions in the game. As a result, there's a bunch of action and solving gameplay rolled into one. Graphically, the game looks realistic and dark while retaining the comic book quality of each character. Some characters look noticably huge while others have a slimmer trim. The music matches the serious tone well by applying the tenseness of the situation. Batman: Arkham Asylum provides a good blend of comic book storytelling with the multiple playstyles and enveloping graphics and music to the feel of the comics.","June 26, 2012","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

After what it seems that the Joker well be sent to his place, Joker escaped killing the guards in his way and somehow controlling all the asylum in a blink of an eye. Now it up to batman to stop Joker and find out what was Joker's planning all this time.\n\nGameplay : the combat is great and fluid almost perfect, it combines stealth approach, puzzles and riddles and of course brute force.\nThis is the first game that will make you feel that you are the batman\nthat you are in cotrol of your gadgets, fighting style and detective's skills.\nI can rest assure you that Batman Arkham Asylum gameplay is one of the best\nthere is to offer.\n\nStory : its been a long time since I was so interested in a game's storyline,\nthe cutscenes\dialog\twists are just great.\nYou will be suprised and thrilled by what will come next, also lets not forget about the characters which all of them are amazingly done.\n\nGraphics : What can I say ? beautiful,amazing,outstanding and perfectly fit to the batman's art style. One of the best I have seen in 2009 and even today its just plain impressive.\n\nAI + difficulty : this is where I think that Batman Arkham Asylum could be better,\nwhile the game has diffrent enemies and every boss fight is unique, still the game\nis too damn easy even on the hard difficulty, only the challenges gives the feeling that I might actually lose.\n\nMusic + Sound : I can't say too much cause the only thing that comes in my mind is the word "Perfection"\n\nSummary : Batman Arkham Asylum trully deserves the "Game of the year" title of 2009, one of the most suprising,impressive and outstanding games there is to offer and God help those who didn't play the game yet. The only thing that bothers me was the difficulty which was too easy for me, but overall I'll give this game\na 9.5\10","August 2, 2013","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/recommended/35140/","totalwargamer","Sleep deprived shift worker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/","88 products in account","Batman Arkham Asylum: Game of the Year Edition\n\nPositives:\n\n+ The game has an interesting selection of gadgets to use. There's the batclaw, which is used to pull vent grates off walls, explosive gel to destroy structurally weak areas and the cryptographic sequencer, which allows Batman to overload security terminals and gain access to restricted areas. There's also batarangs and the line launcher, which is a portable device that fires a zip line for Batman.\n+ The characters are good, they all have personality except for Batman himself, who seems to be very straightforward and lacking in emotion. Joker is a particular standout and the audio tapes found around the Aslyum shed light on various inmates who are Batman's foes.\n+ Decent graphics.\n+Game length is anywhere between 20-30 hours or so, depending on how many riddles you solve and your desire to play beat em' up challenge mode.\n\nMixed:\n\n~ The combat can be fun, but also borderline infuriating at times. Using unlockable Waynetech upgrades, Batman can perform takedown moves, throw enemies and do more critical damage. However, the combat is very unresponsive with regards to countering and in this respect Sleeping Dogs did a far better third person combat system. The fact Batman: Arkham Asylum doesn't detect your counter effectively really lets it down.\n~ The Riddler's hidden mini puzzles and items add a nice distraction and diversion to the main story, but at the same time they can be a bit boring if you want to complete them all, even if you discover a Riddler secrets map. It was a nice idea and it does add an element of exploration to the game, but 240 Riddler challenges is a bit excessive. My main gripe is that Batman's detective mode is required to find a lot of these trophies and it's quite annoying to be running around all over the map in black and white vision.\n\n~ The story is not bad, it's just not fantastic either. It's a bit difficult to follow, despite its simplicity. I know that sounds like a contradiction, but it's true. It just seems that at some point I lost focus on the big picture, there were a couple of confusing parts regarding the titan formula which weren't clarified. There is no in-game journal which explains the story.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- The boss fights are more or less the same, using evading dives and batarangs to stun. This pattern is repeated throughout many of the boss encounters, nothing really exciting.\n- Downloadable content is a joke, it doesn't add anything extra to the story or any new levels. It merely adds more beat em' up challenges..\n\nOverall Score: 7.5/10\n\nBatman: Arkham Aslyum is definitely not a 9/10 game as Metacritic would claim. But it's still good and it's still fun (plus a little irritating too lol). As the first game in the series I'd say it's well worth playing this, be sure to pick it up on sale where it regularly goes down to $5.","March 26, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anything you read online about this game being one of the best is true. But, I strongly recommend you play this installment of the Arkham series before any other, because the games only get better.\n\nCombat: Depending on the hardware you are running, it can be anywhere from erratic and choppy to fluid. If you can hold a steady 30 frames, then you can really appreciate the combat. Upgrades give you more options in how you take down thugs, and boss fights are challenging and rewarding.\n\nStealth: Stealth missions really require you to stop and think about how you want to handle a room. Be wary of line of sight as well, because if you can see them, they can see you. Note: Not as refined as the next titles in the Arkham series.\n\nEnvironment: Everything looks and feels like a true Batman story. The environment is dirty and gritty, and you know you're Arkham just by looking around. It's a nice mix of high-security technology and Gothic architecture.\n\nDo recommend, 10/10","August 1, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First off let me say I'm no comic book fan, or a fan of the super-hero genre in general.  I could honestly give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about "Batman".  That being said, the game itself is very good.  I would recomend playing it with a controller, I used an xbox one.  The controls are tight, and the fighting really stands out.  At times there are a bit too many controls and gadgets to deal with that you end up just not using them. There's a crap load of hidden "secrets" and for the achiever this is great.  The not so great part is a lot of them you come across very obviously with no way to get them, not knowing that you'll have the ability later and having the feeling you're always missing something if you are not running around in "detecive mode".  Ran into a few crashes and a couple of points where I had to validate the games files in order to continue on, but overall pretty stable.  GOTY? No, Good game?

I fully expected a game in which you went in all guns blazing and just killed everything, but what i got was a game where you had to sit up high above everyone, and think about how to tackle a situation. I played this game on normal difficulty and finished it in 12 hours. However that was just the main story, if i went back and found all of riddlers trophies it would take considerably longer, normal difficulty was certainly very challenging, dying many times and getting very frustrated. I played the game with the mouse and keyboard, but would advise on the gamepad if you have access to one, as it can get a bit fiddly when facing multiple enemies.\nOverall this game was very fun, i got it on humble bundle with Arkham City which i will start playing straight away.\nThere is a free roaming element to this game, however it's mostly indoors, with one outdoor area, that isn't entirely massive.","November 26, 2013","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I picked it up in a recent humble bundle and I was pleasantly surprised. The voice acting is great (ofc) and the storyline is passable. You have the freedom to roam all over Arkham's island exploring the various parts of the asylum. The combat is very well done and you often have the option to sneak up and take things out if you prefer stealth over brute force although it has to be said once you have the hang of thumping people you may not want to give it up.\n\nIt shifts into a fixed perspective for some areas and bosses which caused my other half huge problems when he played. It seemed to play well regardless of whether you chose keyboard and mouse or controller as an input device although it was annoying not being able to redefine keys without exiting the game. There are a ton of collectible items scattered throughout that unlock backstory and extra information and a large quantity of fighting and steath challenges that are unlocked as you progress through the game.\n\nAll in all it's a well fleshed out game with plenty to keep you hooked regardless of what aspects you enjoy.","November 26, 2013","true","50.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gametime is nice, not too long, not too short, medium difficulty is appropriate for the average gamer and who wants to do EVERYTHING and master the game will have plenty to do. Since I played it long after it came out and after I tried Arkham City, it was a bit difficult to adapt, but still a great game.

It's got all the qualities we've come to know and love the Dark Knight's ongoing mythology for, with a decent roster of Gotham's criminally insane lining up to take their shot at the Bat.  The story is beefed up with an excellent script and voice acting fit for the ages.  Mark Hamill's out-of-the-box psychotic Joker brings a wry smile to your face with every one-liner.\n\nArkham Asylum's gameplay is semi-immersed in stealth.  Enemies who are armed with guns are dangerous if faced directly, so the game teaches you how to move around and take out foes one by one.  Difficulty is scaled up with the acquisition of more gadgets, so adaptation of new techniques becomes paramount to Batman's survival - as it should be.\n\nA special mention is deserved for the game's audio and visual presentation which pump a gritty, suspenseful atmosphere into  the experience.  Arkham Asylum could have easily faultered on these qualities, but it doesn't.\n\nThere is really no excuse for you not to have played Arkham Asylum.  Nobody expected it to do what it does with such grace and respect for its source material.  Just buy the bloody thing and play it if you haven't already; you'll soon realise what all the fuss is about.","November 26, 2013","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend.\n\nThe story line is nothing spectacular but is entertaining for Batman fans. Even if your not familiarized with the comic book's universe, as you play, the game provides a huge set of informations about chracters that may or may not appear during the game.\n\nOn one hand, the combat features are incredible. There is a large amount of moves you can do while in a fight, specially if you make big combos. I don't quite know what it is but there is something about the sound it makes when you hit a thug or break his leg that brings that feeling of accomplishment towards the game and makes you play more.\n\nOn the other hand, the stealth/predator mode lacks the silence and discretion I expected. The takedowns, except for the silent one are very noisy and attract almost all the prisoners to the location where it happened. There are also a lot of features that in the end make the game to easy in that area. The fact that the sonic batarang always attracts one and only one thug so you can take him down is kind of a buzz kill. In addition to that, if you want, you can easily take down three guys at the same time by using the multiple batarang and the ground pound once they are down, what makes the stealth unchallenging.\n\nThe challenges are a great feature of the game and are nice to play even after you finished the campaing.\n\nTo sum up, really good game even with small flaws in some areas.","December 27, 2013","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigbillybeef/recommended/35140/","bigbillybeef","Sentient","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigbillybeef/","361 products in account","The original and still the best in the series.\n\nIt's more focused environment leads to a more tightly crafted game that just begs to be explored. While the later games in the series offer a more open ended approach with arguably more things to see and do, in practice they seem to offer little more than filler between heavily scripted events. While collectibles, secrets and side missions often feel like chores in the later games, they feel like meaningful reasons to fully explore the asylum with appropriate rewards on offer. Each area is filled with unique assets and small, rememberable details. The riddlers side missions task you with photographing scenes that are unique to various characters from the Dark Knight universe which helps to direct the player toward these specially crafted, and unique in-game assets.\n\nThe combat system, while arguably too simplistic, is a delight to control as you see Batman stringing insane combo's together effortlessly disarming, and countering incoming attacks. Every kick, punch, grapple and counter is animated well making fights seem appropriately realistic and violent. The combat is assisted by some excellent audio leading to some satisfying crunches, cracks, and smacks as bones break and fists collide with faces.\n\nThe metroid-vania aspects of the game are implemented well, with each upgrade offering the oppertunity to revisit locations throughout the game.\n\nThe story is well told and the voice acting is excellent throughout, although I felt the final parts of the story were anticlimactic with the final boss fight in particular being tedius and frankly, rather silly. Seeing the Joker turn into a roid-raged meathead seemed rather out of character, and a little far-fetched - even for a comic book super villain.\n\nOn a technical level, the game still looks great to this day and runs exceptionally well. A mid-range pc should be able to run this game on maximum settings with a solid 60fps.\n\nAll-in-all it's a ground breaking game and in my opinion one of the best games of it's generation. A true masterpiece.","November 25, 2013","true","29.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The combat is superb as are the stealth sections: it makes you feel like you are actually playing as a badass fighter/detective like Batman without it being too easy. Negatives are the boss fights, which are highly simplistic and quite uncreative, and the writing which isn't so much bad as it just doesn't match up with the high quality of the rest of the game.

The beggining to a fantastic series, and the greatest Batman videogame series of all time. Simply a masterpiece.\n\nWhere do I start?\n\nArkham Asylum is unique compared to the other 3 games (I include Origins, no hate), because it's not open world. So you don't have a huge playground to play around with. It also has the most difficult stealth and combat, and other things, due to lacking double counters, double takedowns, knockout smashes, quickfire gadgets, the dive bomb, and most importantly, quick escapes with the Grapnel Boost/Accelerator or the Smoke Pellet.\n\nHere, armed men actually pose a challenge. That makes you think more tactically and plan ahead, more than the other games.\n\n\nDefinitely recommended.\n\n\nI recommend to play the whole series in this order : Asylum, then City, then Origins, and finally, Arkham Knight.

So let me sum up a few pros and cons of this game.\nunder these pros and cons I will explain them a little.\n\n+nice storyline\n+decent controlls\n+third person view\n+character bios\n+nice graphics\n+variation of opponenents\n+amazing joker\n+second batcave?\n+riddles\n+decent voiceacting\n+after-death-cutscenes\n\n-stable internet connection required\n-last bossfight\n\nHere the more in-depth explaination:\nThe pros:\nThe reason why I like the storyline is because you can see that the developers thought about it. the Joker pretty much creates some fun in the game while you're busy fighting his little ♥♥♥♥♥es.\nWhen I first saw the controlls, I thought they were somewhat odd, but after half an hour of playing I understood why they were made this way, and they actually feel really nice once used to it.\nI usually prefer to play games in first person view, but the third person view really fits this game. That way you can anticipate on attacks of henchmen and you will be able to counter them. It's also just nice to see the movements of Batman's cape.\nAnother nice feature of this game is the character bios. The developers wrote a small background of pretty much every important character in the game. It also shows some facts of the characters, like when they first appeared and what their real names are (if known). But most of all I like the character bios because of the interview tapes you can collect in the game. They are quite funny and give you a little more information.\nEven though I played this game on a laptop with an intel pentium 4 processor and an on-board videocard, the game looked really great. Better than I expected.\nAnother cool thing is that the Joker is not your only oppononent. You will also come across Harley Quinn, Scarecrow, The Croc, Poison Ivy, Bane, and Victor Zsasz. All of those have to be fought in another way, which brings some variation in the game. They also have different types of henchmen. The unarmed will have to be fought directly and with brute force, while the armed will have to be approached sneaky. There is also a difference between unarmed henchmen. Some will be really unarmed, while others use knives or kind of tasers.\nI also really love this Joker. They created him like a combination of Heath Ledger and the guy who played the Joker before him.\nSome may like it, some may not, but since this game is not in Gotham, Batman will not have it's batcave in this game. To give the feeling of a batcave, the developers made a secret second batcave on Arkham Island.\nTo make it a little harder to complete this game, they created some riddles. Some are easy to solve, but since there are more than 200 riddles, you might take a while to actually solve all of them, mainly because most of them are actually not easy to solve.\nI'm a guy who loves to hear things and does a lot with his ears, so I hate it when there are crappy voiceactors in a game. Batman: Arkham Asylum actually uses decent actors, which makes it a lot more nice to play for people like me.\nIn a lot of games you die, and you just resurrect, but in Batman: Arkham Asylum you die, and you get a little cutscene from an opponent, who's captured you and acts like he's about to kill you, which makes it less boring to die.Now the cons:\nWhen you play this game with an unstable connection, the game will suddenly stop once the connection is lost, and it will bring you back to the main menu. This caused me to start over a few times. It's really annoying when this happens mid-bossfight, because you will have to do everything from the bossfight once again. A serious problem which shouldn't be necessary since this is not an online game.\nThe last bossfight against the Joker is pretty dull in my opinion. you pretty much have to do the same thing 3 times which is not really something the Joker would let you do.I overall rate this game 9.3/10","July 18, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

This is brilliant. Batman as he always should have been. The game plays out like a 3D Metroidvania, rewarding exploration with tons of secrets to find, most of which you won't be able to get until Batman gets new abilities. The fighting system is fun and fairly intuitive, but the stealth mechanics are my favorite - the experience of being Batman has never come more alive than when I stalked my enemies from the shadows. The music never really spoke to me, but the art and presentation is excellent. The acting is exceptional on all sides, but Mark Hamill's Joker steals the show - as he should.\n\nBEST PART - Picking off a group of thugs one by one while they have no idea where I am, and the baddies left standing get more and more terrified.","January 31, 2014","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not a fan of fighting games, and while I think Batman is both on of the best superheroes and one of the most interesting ones, I didn't really think a game like this--developed originally for the Xbox 360 and ported to PC--would do well. Boy was I wrong. Not only are the graphics surprisingly good, the audio (voice acting, fighting sounds, etc.) makes me feel like Batman. In particular, the voice acting is definitely some of the best I've heard in a video game. The fighting, though rather redundant, is still incredibly fun, though I did notice that countering enemy attacks was difficult. I may have been bad at it, but since I'm fine with it in the sequel to this game, Batman: Arkham CIty, I think it may have just been a minor issue in this game. The boss fights, while redundant, are quite fun and actually quite challenging. Furthermore, the story of this game is remarkably good. I never felt like I was playing through a fighting game with a story tacked on; it felt like a fighting game built around the story, in a good way. The atmosphere was top-notch and made me feel like Batman.\n\nTo summarize:\nPros-great atmosphere, solid gameplay, good graphics and audio, surprisngly good story, delivers an authentic Batman experience\nCons-Issues with countering, boss fights can be redundant, hard to get used to\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this game.","January 31, 2014","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Particularly graphic intensive for its time, but it does not skimp out on content by any means. The game has plenty of lore, encounters from many classic villains, and relatively fluid controls and combat options. The game lends itself more toward stealth combat, which fits Batman's persona entirely well.\n\nVery much a worthy purchase.","June 13, 2011","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I was surprised when I first played it really hooked me up. The combat was probably the thing that got me most excited, it felt so satisfying to just punch guys in the face and do all those crazy moves. Another thing I really liked is that despite Arkham Asylum having a linear story they do give you the feel that you are allowed to go anywhere you want in Arkham Island and explore, I really appreciate when they do that and as you unlocked more gadgets backtracking came into place in case I wanted to get all the trophies and solve all the riddles which I actually didn't. The graphics are pretty good looking and I really like the grim atmosphere of the Asylum. Ocasionally there are some "puzzle" and stealth sections which I think they are important because they bring someone of a variety to the gameplay. Despite the enemies kept being the same over and over I feel like the boss battles made up for it. That said I really enjoyed my time with Batman Arkham Asylum but I really couldn't be bothered with getting all the collectibles and playing each challenge but overall I do think it is a great game.","November 10, 2013","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot revolves around Batman trapped in Arkham Asylum, run by the Joker. Along the way Batman fights to survive, and questions his sanity. He questions if he should be in the Asylum himself. Along the way he meets members of his great rouges gallery. The voice actors are brilliant. Kevin Conroy is great reprising his role as Batman from BTAS or Batman the Animated Series. In my mind, he is the one true Batman. Mark Hamill is hilariously dark as the Joker also reprising his BTAS role. You can see the fun these men are having playing their roles, and you can totally buy there long infamous history. The character designs are spectacular, the best being the Scarecrow.  As far as gameplay goes its top notch.  In the story there are some difficult parts, but I being a casual gamer, dont think  many gamers will have much trouble. I'd give the game a 10/10, but the thing that does not make it reach that is the sheer formulelic boss battles. I'm not a huge gamer, but when you add one small differnce to every boss battle, I was never suprised. the final boss battle is  the worst part of the game, in the sense that the game throws everything at you, which makes it seem really far from the brilliance of the first part of the game.\n\n\nAn great expirence. 9 out of 10","February 4, 2014","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markomkd21/recommended/35140/","markomkd21","Fuhrer Marko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markomkd21/","103 products in account","Still the best Batman game in the Arkham series and probably the best Batman game ever made. The story involves Batman catching Joker easily after a recent robbery and, coincidentally, Joker's gang moved to the Asylum because of an issue at the Blackgate Prison - once inside the Asylum, the Joker escapes and taskes control of the Asylum and prepares to unearth something far worse than what you initially suspect. You play as Batman trying to unearth this plot and once again stop the Joker.\n\nTo this day, this game still has amazing visuals, Batman himself covering around half the screen, looks the part and stands strong and confident as the character should as well as the texture work on his suit are top notch - the rest of the game fairs the same, since the game has been given an outstanding amount of care and work into every area you go through. Not one area in the game feels exactly the same as another even if they look similar. Very stellar work of textures all around overall.\n\nI don't say this is the best Batman game out there for no reason - gameplay is pretty basic "Brawler" style with very minor puzzle solving, but what makes this game different, from, say a game like Assassin's Creed - is the "Free Flow combat system" the game has. The combat is slightly similar to the first Assassin's Creed, except - the flow combat system allows Batman to basically jump from one foe to another in a very fast manner, almost rythmically, to get a combo counter to go as high as you can while still making it challenging by giving the foes still standing a fighting chance and implementing counters.\n\nYou can also explore the entirety of the Arkham Asylum as you unlock areas and you can do a variety of things while exploring, you can face groups of enemies scattered around, you can do Riddler Challenges - whom are a bunch of mini puzzles scattered around the Asylum that involves the use of Batman's Detective Mode, these range from finding a specific item found in the area or marks that require the Detective Mode to find and a "Complete the Mark" type of game that involves you scanning the area from specific places to complete a full mark, etc - Riddler trophies, and a bunch of case files to find out more background information on Batman characters and villains (as well as the history behind Arkahm Asylum) that are often very well realized and fun to hear.\n\nThe Detective Mode & Gadgets: You'll be using these a LOT on your trudge through Arkham Asylum. Ranging from the standard Batarangs and Grappling hook (used for mundane objectives such as getting to and pulling out vents from hard to reach places, etc), the Explosive Gel (Used a lot to surprise enemies, to find weak walls to find trophies and secrets and to progress in the story as well!) and a bunch more. The Detecive Mode helps you analyze weak walls to use your Explosive Gel on and other gadgets as well as analyze enemy/allies conditions and, more important later on in the game, to find out which enemies carry weapons or are special enemies.).\n\nSo in general, if you ever wanted to know and feel what a life in the day of Batman is, this is definately your game, more so than the sequels (imo). From the excellent assets and sound to follow it up with, and the pitch perfect gameplay to go along with it, this sits as one of my favourite video game experiences and currently my best experience playing as the legendary Dark Knight.","January 27, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reason being that is that you play as the Dark Knight himself and using his gadgets. The synopsis of the game is Batman captures The Joker and brings him to Arkham Asylum to be kept there, but all along it was a trap as Joker wants to takeover the Asylum for himself. The Joker escapes from his captivity and is on the loose. Now the Greatest Detective has solve this problem by trying to find the Joker within Arkham Asylum and ask him what he really want to do.\nThe gameplay is amazing with features like Detective Mode which makes you see everything in X-Ray vision but it useful to see if there is any of Joker's Thugs is in the room. The abillty to use the batarang is amazing and to use the Batclaw which can bring down walls.\nOverall I think that this game is worth a buy if you are a Batman fan or if you like stealth and beat'em up genres.","March 30, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is fluent but can be repititive but still manages to stay satisfying, especially when using the batclaw for finishers and extended combos. Graphics are great for the time it was released and showed very little graphical errors (though some pixelation during the final cutscene). The riddler adds a lot of exploration and keeps your eyes open for anything and everything, not to mention spending a hell of a lot of time circling your camera around rooms in detective mode to find riddler trophies. The main plot had little depth but the riddler and the colectibles you gather than tell individual character stories are very promising for anyone who enjoys a thourough story.

You play, as the title suggests, as *dramatic pause* Batman!  Armed with many iconic gadgets like the batarang, grapple, smoke bombs, and many more, it is your mission to put a stop to the Joker's plans within the Asylum.\n\nThe story is exciting, and unique.  As you progress, you must adapt and master new skills as objectives become more difficult to complete.  Iconic characters will make appearances as you progress.  Most will try to kill you, some will try to pull a fast one and try to backstab you, still one in particular will even try to eat you.  You will be in danger from start to finish, captivated by the eerie environment and developing story.\n\nVisuals (10/10):\n\nArkham Asylum is a bit dated now, so the graphics are not considered as stunning as they once were.  However, maxed out, it still looks very good.  The asylum is true to its comic book origins, meaning it is dark, depressing, and gives off the feeling that something more sinister is lurking behind the walls than just the criminally insane.\n\nGameplay (10/10):\n\nThe world of Arkham Asylum is free exploration, but to stay interested and invested in the game, you can't really deviate from the story because the story is linear and without side missions to distract you.  Personally, I am not bothered by this because there is quite a bit of problem solving and each area you enter presents a new challenge that require different approaches, so you aren't doing the same thing over and over.\n\nThe main story is fairly long probably about 15 to 20 hours depending on the difficulty.  On top of that, you have a couple of miscellaneous “missions” like doing all of the Riddler Challenges and examing the artifacts found in the Asylum.  While many find these boring, I personally enjoyed going back and doing these because they offered sereral easter eggs by referencing events and characters from the comics that I enjoyed.  If this isn't your kind of thing, it is easily skipped.\n\nThis game is in third person, so it relies on a very effective free-flow combat system based on combos.  It mixes classic fighting with silent takedowns and special combo moves that create the classic Batman that can take anyone in a fight.  Included in the fighting system are the gadgets.  The gadgets create a whole new host of ways to creatively finish off opponets in both direct and indirect combat.\n\nMany complain about the fact that the Batmobile and Batwing are not present in the game except for short stints, and are not even player operated.  While this is unfortunate, the nature of the game taking place inside a small, finite area really defeats the use of either one.\n\nSound (8/10):\n\nIn terms of music and sound effects, Arkham Ayslum employs them to great effect.  While the soundtrack isn’t really memorable, the small things like dripping water, metal clanking against metal, and other small things add to the immersion.  The environmental and combat sounds are actually quite good.  Unfortunately the dialogs are hit or miss, which sometimes hurts the characters.\n\nReplay value (9/10):\n\nWhile the plot is linear and there aren't any choices which would change the story in any way, the game provides countless hours of fun as probably the best batman simulator on the market.  If the story mode gets boring, there are always the numerous challenge missions that are not part of the story that are fun to play.\n\nConclusion (9.2/10):\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is a very good game, with an unforgettable setting, an engaging plot, and a loose ends that set up future games.  Overall, it is definitely one of those games which you have to play at least once and I highly recommend it.","November 21, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Arkham City and Arkham Origins are both great games in their own right, and I think Arkham City is my absolute favorite so far, but Arkham Asylum has a unique combination of unexpected pace changes and foreboding atmosphere that make it a very special game.  I only recently started my second playthrough and am enjoying it all over again, after having spent a lot of time playing the sequels.  I think it's the best entry to the franchise - wait for a sale if you're unsure about whether you'll like it, but I recommend you give it a try.","December 12, 2014","true","122.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its rather linear layout has the player      wanting to continue playing the story with its action, suspence and thrills\n\nAtmosphere and graphics\n- Although this GOTY edition with improved graphics came out over 5 years ago this game still looks brilliant. A dark lighting, similar colors throughout, and being one of the first games with full 3D models will have you in awe\n\nVoice acting\n- Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker) take the lead as the best voice actors to ever assume their famous roles. Conroy will make you think Batman is real and talking right to you and Hamill will make you question his sanity\n\nTools (Also a con)\n- Part of being Batman is having the tools for the job. The gadgets are not given right away, in fact you start off with only the batarang, they are given at a nice pace when the story calls for them\n\nCombat\n- This games combat is original and amzing in its simplicity, effectiveness, and near flawlessness (pun inteneded)\n\n\nCons:\nTools (Detective Mode)\n- This option that lets you view all enemies, and enviorments that can be used or altered is very overpowered with no hiderances besides stopping you from viewing the games amazing graphics\n\n\n\nThis game was an instant classic and set the foundations for future titles and showed the world how to make make a Batman game after 20 years of horrible failure. Worth it at the base $20 and even more so on sale, I got it at $10 and it is still one of the best purchaes out of the 100+ others I have made on steam.","April 12, 2015","true","48.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combat is smooth, though the limited combo list can make the constant fight sequences seem a bit tedious.

As a Dark Knight, you will be forced to fight your way througout the mass of enemies and DC supervilllians. Combat is really enjoyable and game itself is pretty much fluent - there is always something going on and you just dont stuck at one place...not even for a while. I recommend this game especially for Batman fans, since you will encounter many villians you are familiar with. In addition with a great dark and intense atmosphere of the Arkham Island, you really gonna believe that you are Dark Knight himself, totally consumed by the great story and characters. As a fresh addition to game, you are able to scout the island and explore all dark corners of it - finding more content like Riddler´s mazes and messages related to history of Arkham City and also background of mentioned Supervillians. In summary, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a natural choice for every fan of action games and keen admirers of a Dark Knight. What else to say? Maybe just...Riddle me this, riddle me that. Who s afraid of big black bat?\n\nPluses\n+ Great atmosphere and fluent story\n+ Enjoyable combat and option to improve your Dark Knight (gadgets, armor, battle technics)\n+ Decent graphics\n+ Nice music, soundtracks and audio in general\n\nMinuses\n- You are practically locked up in one place all the time. Although the island itself is kinda interesting and offers a several places to go, the world could be a little bigger.\n- Bosses battles (fight strategy and flow of the battle) are kinda repeatable.\n\nOverall: 9/10","February 14, 2015","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is brilliant. Batman as he always should have been. The game plays out like a 3D Metroidvania, rewarding exploration with tons of secrets to find, most of which you won't be able to get until Batman gets new abilities. The fighting system is fun and fairly intuitive, but the stealth mechanics are my favorite - the experience of being Batman has never come more alive than when I stalked my enemies from the shadows. The music never really spoke to me, but the art and presentation is excellent. The acting is exceptional on all sides, but Mark Hamill's Joker steals the show - as he should.\n\nBEST PART - Picking off a group of thugs one by one while they have no idea where I am, and the baddies left standing get more and more terrified.","January 31, 2014","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not a fan of fighting games, and while I think Batman is both on of the best superheroes and one of the most interesting ones, I didn't really think a game like this--developed originally for the Xbox 360 and ported to PC--would do well. Boy was I wrong. Not only are the graphics surprisingly good, the audio (voice acting, fighting sounds, etc.) makes me feel like Batman. In particular, the voice acting is definitely some of the best I've heard in a video game. The fighting, though rather redundant, is still incredibly fun, though I did notice that countering enemy attacks was difficult. I may have been bad at it, but since I'm fine with it in the sequel to this game, Batman: Arkham CIty, I think it may have just been a minor issue in this game. The boss fights, while redundant, are quite fun and actually quite challenging. Furthermore, the story of this game is remarkably good. I never felt like I was playing through a fighting game with a story tacked on; it felt like a fighting game built around the story, in a good way. The atmosphere was top-notch and made me feel like Batman.\n\nTo summarize:\nPros-great atmosphere, solid gameplay, good graphics and audio, surprisngly good story, delivers an authentic Batman experience\nCons-Issues with countering, boss fights can be redundant, hard to get used to\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this game.","January 31, 2014","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rocksteady първоначално се приближи този проект с акцент върху качеството, с особено внимание и грижа, като се вземат предвид всички малки детайли и подробности Девет години история на комикси и адаптации на Батман, и по този начин се създаде ново ниво на качество в областта на компютърните игри. В Arkham Asylum ние сме свидетели на един доста брутален Батман, тактичен, разумно хищен и наистина мрачна ситуация. Тъй като това допринася за доброто съвпадение звуков компонент. В играта има отлична система за борба, има елементи на стелт, изкуствени опоненти и разузнаване в режим на хищник е доста добър. Решавам пъзели на Гатанката, много забавна игра. В играта има своя собствена индивидуалност, целостта на сюжета и неговата доставка. Игра на 2009 г., която ще надмине много съвременни занаяти.\nRocksteady поставила за цел, да направи най-добрата игра на всички видео игри на Батман и те успяха.\nШедьовър! 10 от 10.","June 16, 2014","true","31.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this game feels VERY new, and very wicked amazing...it's a "hey, we're in a new age of gaming" game. Everything's polished and built really well in this game. I think what draws me the most is #1: The freeflow feeling combat. FREAKING AWESOME and very fun and no strings attached. I could do challenge modes in the extras section for hours and totally love it. #2: The story is AMZING cool, i LOVE the gothic-yet-heroic feel of it. It made me want to watch Dark Knight. But it also made me want to go buy all the comics ever made because they really give you the opprotunity to immerse you into the Batman&Friends&Enemies story by giving you fun data things all about them when you collect trophies, etc. The music and killer voice acting also MAKE it.","February 14, 2011","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaobreaker/recommended/35140/","chaobreaker","fhqwhgads","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaobreaker/","386 products in account","So I always heard good things about the Batman Arkham games, but never got to play them. Last week I installed and played the copy of Batman: Arkham Asylum I had lying on my endlessly growing Steam backlog for the first time. After 30 hours of gametime, which included beating the campaign on both normal and hard difficulty, collecting all of the Riddler challenges, getting 3 stars on all the extra challenge mode games, and acquiring all of the achievements, I can confidently say that B: AA is one of the best games I ever played in a long time.\n\nI just want to preface the upcoming gushing I'm about to lay down by saying I love metroidvanias, am not very proficient in high execution gameplay, enjoy a good collect-a-thon, and think Batman is the ♥♥♥♥. This game pushed so many of the right buttons for me as a result.\n\nThe best description I can give for the gameplay is that it’s the perfect Batman experience. You can do most of the typical kind of platforming tricks you see in modern 3D action adventure games like in the Assassin Creed games but as Batman you have a variety of tools like a grappling hook that clings on almost all climbable ledges and a cape that helps you glide over larges distances. I found going around the titular asylum a very enjoyable experience, especially the occasional pure platforming and Scarecrow sections you’re encounter throughout the campaign.\n\nThe combat is probably the best part of the game. It really feels like you’re playing out a fight scene in a Batman cartoon or movie. It’s very simple to jump around the area pummeling your foes but you need proper timing and twitchy fingers to avoid getting hit and keeping your combo score up. You get a lot of tools and techniques that make the combat a breeze later on but I found myself being tested in some hard mode gauntlets and the dedicated challenge modes you unlock later in the game. Climbing on the larger titan enemies and forcing them to smack around the smaller goons is always a satisfying experience.\n\nThe predator sections where you have to stealthily take out a bunch of armed enemies in a huge room is fun. Pure fun. There are so many ways to dispatch them that they made a dedicated game mode for it. And the way the goons start getting freaked out after you pick them off is hilarious as ♥♥♥♥. Like I said, a very Batman-like experience.\n\nWhile the campaign is pretty linear, there are a ton of collectables sprinkled throughout the island. In a way this game is pretty metroidvana-like in that aspect, as you can backtrack to older areas and use the new items you acquire as you progress through the game to find even more secrets.  While the trophy collecting was pretty basic, the riddles sprinkled throughout the world are brilliant. I got a kick out of finding all of the solutions. You’ll also find these little perspective puzzles that require you to find 2 parts of a question mark hidden on the architecture and align them with your camera so they look whole. It’s hard to explain but they were cool.\n\nThe game is a visual and audible treat. The game looks very good, especially for an early-to-mid last gen game. I love all the minute detail for the world, like how Batman gets more visually damaged and grows a stubble as the campaign goes on. All the classic Batman characters get a gritty look that makes them look pretty badass (even though Batman still is wearing his underwear on the outside).  Getting some of the voices from the old animated series was pretty cool. Can’t say no to Steve Blum either.\n\n/gush\n\nNow, I do have some gripes with the game, though. You more and less fight the same kinds of goons throughout the game. The boss fights aren’t very good either, especially the final boss fight. Spoiler: I don’t like that you’re basically have a generic video game-like fight with a huge monster version of the Joker instead of an elaborate battle of wits that you see in other Batman works. It just felt out of place is all.\n\nAnyway, I love this game and I am so looking forward to playing Batman Arkham games in the future.","June 19, 2014","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I just love how Rocksteady portrayed Batman as the one true dark hero he was supposed to be. And yes, I said "supposed" because no other Batman game every gave him the dark essence that surrounds him as seen in various comic books.  Also, the Game of the Year Edition (GOTY) comes with all the DLC this game has to offer, and all for just $19.99.\n\nSo to end my recommendation, here is a riddle....\n\nQ: What is worth all your coin, and has a hero who crushes loin?\n\nA: BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/recommended/35140/","totalwargamer","Sleep deprived shift worker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/","88 products in account","Batman Arkham Asylum: Game of the Year Edition\n\nPositives:\n\n+ The game has an interesting selection of gadgets to use. There's the batclaw, which is used to pull vent grates off walls, explosive gel to destroy structurally weak areas and the cryptographic sequencer, which allows Batman to overload security terminals and gain access to restricted areas. There's also batarangs and the line launcher, which is a portable device that fires a zip line for Batman.\n+ The characters are good, they all have personality except for Batman himself, who seems to be very straightforward and lacking in emotion. Joker is a particular standout and the audio tapes found around the Aslyum shed light on various inmates who are Batman's foes.\n+ Decent graphics.\n+Game length is anywhere between 20-30 hours or so, depending on how many riddles you solve and your desire to play beat em' up challenge mode.\n\nMixed:\n\n~ The combat can be fun, but also borderline infuriating at times. Using unlockable Waynetech upgrades, Batman can perform takedown moves, throw enemies and do more critical damage. However, the combat is very unresponsive with regards to countering and in this respect Sleeping Dogs did a far better third person combat system. The fact Batman: Arkham Asylum doesn't detect your counter effectively really lets it down.\n~ The Riddler's hidden mini puzzles and items add a nice distraction and diversion to the main story, but at the same time they can be a bit boring if you want to complete them all, even if you discover a Riddler secrets map. It was a nice idea and it does add an element of exploration to the game, but 240 Riddler challenges is a bit excessive. My main gripe is that Batman's detective mode is required to find a lot of these trophies and it's quite annoying to be running around all over the map in black and white vision.\n\n~ The story is not bad, it's just not fantastic either. It's a bit difficult to follow, despite its simplicity. I know that sounds like a contradiction, but it's true. It just seems that at some point I lost focus on the big picture, there were a couple of confusing parts regarding the titan formula which weren't clarified. There is no in-game journal which explains the story.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- The boss fights are more or less the same, using evading dives and batarangs to stun. This pattern is repeated throughout many of the boss encounters, nothing really exciting.\n- Downloadable content is a joke, it doesn't add anything extra to the story or any new levels. It merely adds more beat em' up challenges..\n\nOverall Score: 7.5/10\n\nBatman: Arkham Aslyum is definitely not a 9/10 game as Metacritic would claim. But it's still good and it's still fun (plus a little irritating too lol). As the first game in the series I'd say it's well worth playing this, be sure to pick it up on sale where it regularly goes down to $5.","March 26, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd give it about a 65/100. I'm going to post a lot of criticism, because the flaws stand out pretty boldly, but overall it was OK\n\nThe controls are wonky at best... IT's a fairly clumsy console port. A lot of quicktime-style events, and lots of stupid things where, for example, if you always had to hit D to move left, all of a sudden you have to hit S to move left. Perhaps it works with the D-pad on consoles, but in this it was clunky\n\nThe fighting is just button mashing. If you fail, try again but mash your buttons a little faster.All of the moves after that are script punches, kicks and flips. THere are some "power moves" too but since they keep your character busy in an animation for a while, it just gives your enemies time to take you out.\n\nIn combat there's supposedly a 'counter' option so you can counter a move, but I would jam on the button for it and nothing would happen. Doesn't matter though, I played through the game on normal difficulty without it.\n\nAlmost all of the boss fights are exactly the same thing... you fight a couple muscle men who charge at you and swing your arms.\n\nThere's a ton of fan service but it's terribly forced. The voice acting is b-grade at best and the characters are unconvincing\n\nIf you want a similar game, with an open world where you pick up upgraded ♥♥♥♥ as you go, play Tomb Raider instead. Better everything. If you've played that and you're looking for something more, play this.\n\n","March 26, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was wary when purchasing this game  because I heard it was not as good Arkham City and that it can be very repeditive and buggy but I am over all very happy that I bought this game. Although it may be a bit repeditive I still had a blast playing it! The campaign is brilliant. It is about a 20 hour campaign that I enjoyed thoroughly. The graphics are pretty good too. (Especially for a game that came out in 2009.)

The plot revolves around Batman trapped in Arkham Asylum, run by the Joker. Along the way Batman fights to survive, and questions his sanity. He questions if he should be in the Asylum himself. Along the way he meets members of his great rouges gallery. The voice actors are brilliant. Kevin Conroy is great reprising his role as Batman from BTAS or Batman the Animated Series. In my mind, he is the one true Batman. Mark Hamill is hilariously dark as the Joker also reprising his BTAS role. You can see the fun these men are having playing their roles, and you can totally buy there long infamous history. The character designs are spectacular, the best being the Scarecrow.  As far as gameplay goes its top notch.  In the story there are some difficult parts, but I being a casual gamer, dont think  many gamers will have much trouble. I'd give the game a 10/10, but the thing that does not make it reach that is the sheer formulelic boss battles. I'm not a huge gamer, but when you add one small differnce to every boss battle, I was never suprised. the final boss battle is  the worst part of the game, in the sense that the game throws everything at you, which makes it seem really far from the brilliance of the first part of the game.\n\n\nAn great expirence. 9 out of 10","February 4, 2014","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markomkd21/recommended/35140/","markomkd21","Fuhrer Marko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markomkd21/","103 products in account","Still the best Batman game in the Arkham series and probably the best Batman game ever made. The story involves Batman catching Joker easily after a recent robbery and, coincidentally, Joker's gang moved to the Asylum because of an issue at the Blackgate Prison - once inside the Asylum, the Joker escapes and taskes control of the Asylum and prepares to unearth something far worse than what you initially suspect. You play as Batman trying to unearth this plot and once again stop the Joker.\n\nTo this day, this game still has amazing visuals, Batman himself covering around half the screen, looks the part and stands strong and confident as the character should as well as the texture work on his suit are top notch - the rest of the game fairs the same, since the game has been given an outstanding amount of care and work into every area you go through. Not one area in the game feels exactly the same as another even if they look similar. Very stellar work of textures all around overall.\n\nI don't say this is the best Batman game out there for no reason - gameplay is pretty basic "Brawler" style with very minor puzzle solving, but what makes this game different, from, say a game like Assassin's Creed - is the "Free Flow combat system" the game has. The combat is slightly similar to the first Assassin's Creed, except - the flow combat system allows Batman to basically jump from one foe to another in a very fast manner, almost rythmically, to get a combo counter to go as high as you can while still making it challenging by giving the foes still standing a fighting chance and implementing counters.\n\nYou can also explore the entirety of the Arkham Asylum as you unlock areas and you can do a variety of things while exploring, you can face groups of enemies scattered around, you can do Riddler Challenges - whom are a bunch of mini puzzles scattered around the Asylum that involves the use of Batman's Detective Mode, these range from finding a specific item found in the area or marks that require the Detective Mode to find and a "Complete the Mark" type of game that involves you scanning the area from specific places to complete a full mark, etc - Riddler trophies, and a bunch of case files to find out more background information on Batman characters and villains (as well as the history behind Arkahm Asylum) that are often very well realized and fun to hear.\n\nThe Detective Mode & Gadgets: You'll be using these a LOT on your trudge through Arkham Asylum. Ranging from the standard Batarangs and Grappling hook (used for mundane objectives such as getting to and pulling out vents from hard to reach places, etc), the Explosive Gel (Used a lot to surprise enemies, to find weak walls to find trophies and secrets and to progress in the story as well!) and a bunch more. The Detecive Mode helps you analyze weak walls to use your Explosive Gel on and other gadgets as well as analyze enemy/allies conditions and, more important later on in the game, to find out which enemies carry weapons or are special enemies.).\n\nSo in general, if you ever wanted to know and feel what a life in the day of Batman is, this is definately your game, more so than the sequels (imo). From the excellent assets and sound to follow it up with, and the pitch perfect gameplay to go along with it, this sits as one of my favourite video game experiences and currently my best experience playing as the legendary Dark Knight.","January 27, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved the way everything was setup from the fighting to the story, it just felt great. You don't have to know jack ♥♥♥♥ about Batman for this game to be awesome and now that I finished this one I have high hopes for the sequel. The Joker character was amazing, and the bosses in the game felt challenging and I actually just didn't feel like the bosses were there just as a filler for parts in the game. They weren't just extended regular enemies either, they were actually bosses. This game did a really good job with everything it tried to do. Even the riddles that they had around the island and the Riddler constantly mocking you and such for not finding a riddle or finding one. I grew a hate for the guy without even seeing him once in the entire game. This game is a must have for people looking for a arcade style beat em' up with a great story. 10/10.","March 18","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So let me sum up a few pros and cons of this game.\nunder these pros and cons I will explain them a little.\n\n+nice storyline\n+decent controlls\n+third person view\n+character bios\n+nice graphics\n+variation of opponenents\n+amazing joker\n+second batcave?\n+riddles\n+decent voiceacting\n+after-death-cutscenes\n\n-stable internet connection required\n-last bossfight\n\nHere the more in-depth explaination:\nThe pros:\nThe reason why I like the storyline is because you can see that the developers thought about it. the Joker pretty much creates some fun in the game while you're busy fighting his little ♥♥♥♥♥es.\nWhen I first saw the controlls, I thought they were somewhat odd, but after half an hour of playing I understood why they were made this way, and they actually feel really nice once used to it.\nI usually prefer to play games in first person view, but the third person view really fits this game. That way you can anticipate on attacks of henchmen and you will be able to counter them. It's also just nice to see the movements of Batman's cape.\nAnother nice feature of this game is the character bios. The developers wrote a small background of pretty much every important character in the game. It also shows some facts of the characters, like when they first appeared and what their real names are (if known). But most of all I like the character bios because of the interview tapes you can collect in the game. They are quite funny and give you a little more information.\nEven though I played this game on a laptop with an intel pentium 4 processor and an on-board videocard, the game looked really great. Better than I expected.\nAnother cool thing is that the Joker is not your only oppononent. You will also come across Harley Quinn, Scarecrow, The Croc, Poison Ivy, Bane, and Victor Zsasz. All of those have to be fought in another way, which brings some variation in the game. They also have different types of henchmen. The unarmed will have to be fought directly and with brute force, while the armed will have to be approached sneaky. There is also a difference between unarmed henchmen. Some will be really unarmed, while others use knives or kind of tasers.\nI also really love this Joker. They created him like a combination of Heath Ledger and the guy who played the Joker before him.\nSome may like it, some may not, but since this game is not in Gotham, Batman will not have it's batcave in this game. To give the feeling of a batcave, the developers made a secret second batcave on Arkham Island.\nTo make it a little harder to complete this game, they created some riddles. Some are easy to solve, but since there are more than 200 riddles, you might take a while to actually solve all of them, mainly because most of them are actually not easy to solve.\nI'm a guy who loves to hear things and does a lot with his ears, so I hate it when there are crappy voiceactors in a game. Batman: Arkham Asylum actually uses decent actors, which makes it a lot more nice to play for people like me.\nIn a lot of games you die, and you just resurrect, but in Batman: Arkham Asylum you die, and you get a little cutscene from an opponent, who's captured you and acts like he's about to kill you, which makes it less boring to die.Now the cons:\nWhen you play this game with an unstable connection, the game will suddenly stop once the connection is lost, and it will bring you back to the main menu. This caused me to start over a few times. It's really annoying when this happens mid-bossfight, because you will have to do everything from the bossfight once again. A serious problem which shouldn't be necessary since this is not an online game.\nThe last bossfight against the Joker is pretty dull in my opinion. you pretty much have to do the same thing 3 times which is not really something the Joker would let you do.I overall rate this game 9.3/10","July 18, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

Finding it cheap in a store was great, as it meant that I could finally give it a go. But would I find it any good?\n\nIn Batman: Arkham Asylum, Batman has caught the Joker (again), but, suspicious at the ease at which the Clown Prince of Crime allowed himself to be captured, Batman decides to escort the Joker to his cell. Unfortunately, the Joker was counting on this. Not only was he planning on being caught and returned to Arkham Asylum, but he planned on Batman being there as well. Batman must fight his way through the asylum, confronting some of his most persistent adversaries, from Bane to Poison Ivy. But what is the Joker after? What is Titan? And can Batman stop the Joker’s plans?\n\nWhile I’m not that big a fan of the Batman comics in particular, I have read many of the graphic novels, including one that seems to be an inspiration for this game: Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth. That was an intelligent but harrowing mind-screw of a book that clearly inspired more than a few elements. The story, while not at complex epic levels, is good for what it is: a comic book story transferred to a computer game. I’m surprised that, given how Paul Dini (of the serious but still kid-oriented animated series) wrote it, how adult the game seems. Which goes to show my ignorance.\n\nGraphics-wise, the game is beautiful. I am sure that there are more games out there that look better (including Arkham Asylum’s direct sequel, Arkham City, which I am currently playing), but I am not a person who wants their game’s graphics to be ultra-realistic, as long as the graphical style is enjoyable, and that it is. The character design, for the most part, is actually quite excellent, though I am a little bemused at the rather fetishized appearances of Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, even compared to their comic book versions.\n\nSound-wise, it is quite immersive and atmospheric. The voice acting is enjoyable, with particular, if predictable, praise going to Mark Hamill as the Joker. I know him more as Luke Skywalker, so to hear him play the Joker is a revelation. The sound effects all work, and the music helps give an edge of dread, without it missing the Elfman/Zimmer edge of the Batman atmosphere.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is somewhat mixed, although this is partly because this game was developed first and foremost as a console game rather than a PC game. I played on easy simply because of an apprehension I had about the control scheme, and I still found the game challenging, partly because I used a keyboard and mouse as opposed to a controller. That being said, the combat is enjoyable, if a little repetitive, and the Predator Sequences (sequences where one must attack stealthily) are challenging, but in a mostly good way. The gadgets all lend not only to the gameplay, but to the feeling that one is actually Batman. There’s even a few sequences where the World’s Greatest Detective (as Batman is hyped as) actually does some detecting. The sidequests of the Riddler Challenges are actually quite enjoyable and taxing, and nothing beats that little thrill of satisfaction when you beat one of them, and while Riddler accuses you of looking them up on the internet, you actually just found almost all the solutions on your own. My only real complaint, other than the control scheme, is that, even with the Riddler Challenges, the game was over rather swiftly.\n\nOverall, Batman: Arkham Asylum is an enjoyable game that is really how Batman should be played. Flawed, but still enjoyable and highly recommended.\n\nRATING: ****","October 11, 2014","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You play, as the title suggests, as *dramatic pause* Batman!  Armed with many iconic gadgets like the batarang, grapple, smoke bombs, and many more, it is your mission to put a stop to the Joker's plans within the Asylum.\n\nThe story is exciting, and unique.  As you progress, you must adapt and master new skills as objectives become more difficult to complete.  Iconic characters will make appearances as you progress.  Most will try to kill you, some will try to pull a fast one and try to backstab you, still one in particular will even try to eat you.  You will be in danger from start to finish, captivated by the eerie environment and developing story.\n\nVisuals (10/10):\n\nArkham Asylum is a bit dated now, so the graphics are not considered as stunning as they once were.  However, maxed out, it still looks very good.  The asylum is true to its comic book origins, meaning it is dark, depressing, and gives off the feeling that something more sinister is lurking behind the walls than just the criminally insane.\n\nGameplay (10/10):\n\nThe world of Arkham Asylum is free exploration, but to stay interested and invested in the game, you can't really deviate from the story because the story is linear and without side missions to distract you.  Personally, I am not bothered by this because there is quite a bit of problem solving and each area you enter presents a new challenge that require different approaches, so you aren't doing the same thing over and over.\n\nThe main story is fairly long probably about 15 to 20 hours depending on the difficulty.  On top of that, you have a couple of miscellaneous “missions” like doing all of the Riddler Challenges and examing the artifacts found in the Asylum.  While many find these boring, I personally enjoyed going back and doing these because they offered sereral easter eggs by referencing events and characters from the comics that I enjoyed.  If this isn't your kind of thing, it is easily skipped.\n\nThis game is in third person, so it relies on a very effective free-flow combat system based on combos.  It mixes classic fighting with silent takedowns and special combo moves that create the classic Batman that can take anyone in a fight.  Included in the fighting system are the gadgets.  The gadgets create a whole new host of ways to creatively finish off opponets in both direct and indirect combat.\n\nMany complain about the fact that the Batmobile and Batwing are not present in the game except for short stints, and are not even player operated.  While this is unfortunate, the nature of the game taking place inside a small, finite area really defeats the use of either one.\n\nSound (8/10):\n\nIn terms of music and sound effects, Arkham Ayslum employs them to great effect.  While the soundtrack isn’t really memorable, the small things like dripping water, metal clanking against metal, and other small things add to the immersion.  The environmental and combat sounds are actually quite good.  Unfortunately the dialogs are hit or miss, which sometimes hurts the characters.\n\nReplay value (9/10):\n\nWhile the plot is linear and there aren't any choices which would change the story in any way, the game provides countless hours of fun as probably the best batman simulator on the market.  If the story mode gets boring, there are always the numerous challenge missions that are not part of the story that are fun to play.\n\nConclusion (9.2/10):\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is a very good game, with an unforgettable setting, an engaging plot, and a loose ends that set up future games.  Overall, it is definitely one of those games which you have to play at least once and I highly recommend it.","November 21, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uknownuffin/recommended/35140/","uknownuffin","Johannes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uknownuffin/","493 products in account","Great game. Played it on hard and it took me roughly 25 hours to beat it. Once you're done with the story, you still have a bunch of special challenges to beat (both combat and stealth related) and it doesn't even end there. Then, if you can, you still have a ton of hidden riddles around the asylum that are a lot of fun to find.\n\nAs I could not beat the challenges (I warn you, they ARE hard)I uninstalled the game after beating it to the end for the first time, and just a few days ago I decided to install it again (for which I blame Marvel’s Daredevil TV series, which made me want to punch thugs and feel like a superhero once again) and well, I 100%’ed the game this time and can only recommend playing it.  I easily just put another 25 hours in the game, and had a lot of fun along the way. This game *gets it*. You really feel like Batman, the combat flows, the animations are well done, there are no loading screens to speak of, the game looks beautiful and the story and the appearances of the enemies are kind of justified. And, if you want to want to learn more about the characters, you have a bunch of entries about most of them. The gadgets are fun to play with, but I admit that it’s kind of annoying how convenient everything is for Batman. “Oh, I’m stuck in this island… never mind, I have several batcaves in every corner of Gotham, mwahaha!” The game is perfectly adapted to the PC, almost no FPS drops, and if you are Spanish or if you are learning Spanish, I recommend playing it in that language, as the quality of the dubbing and of the translation is extremely well done. I think this is one of the very, very rare occasions in which I prefer a dubbed product rather than the original. But yeah, that’s just my opinion. Anyway, congrats to everyone who participated in the Spanish localization of the game.\n\nAnd among the best moments of the game, I loved the parts with Scarecrow in them. Extremely interesting and engaging, and trying not to spoil too much, there’s this particular part that resembles the now classic  fight against Psycho Mantis in MGS1. That was genius and I loved it. We need more mind-blowing, scary stuff like that in video games.\n\nI still haven't played Arkham City or Origins, so I really cannot compare them yet with Asylum. However, I must say that I bought them both as soon as I could after finishing this one, so I guess that means asylum is probably worth it…. In fact, it is! If you enjoyed the movies/series/comics, you'll definitely like this game.\n\nSo yeah, if you still haven't played any arkham games, you should definitely give this one a go. It's your chance to be Batman, should I really say anything else? *vanishes*","May 18, 2015","true","50.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tylerjbrown/recommended/35140/","tylerjbrown","Aceindahole","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tylerjbrown/","764 products in account","Played through on Hard first try, got about 80% of all of the collectables and secrets (there are hundreds). Very well made game, and rife with awesome Batman info/lore.\n\nThe ONLY complaint I have with this game is the combat system. The combat isn't very complicated because there are many parts where you need to neutralize enemies in stealth, as any good Batman should. The problem here is that, because the combat is stretched so thin between straight up fighting and stealth, it does neither perfectly.\n\nSTEALTH - Stealth is a very wishy-washy thing in this game, and because everything in a room is illuminated the same, you don't know if you are in hiding or if a gargoyle you've perched on is not actually putting you in the shadows. You can't fight enemies with guns straight up, so you are frequently forced into the stealth role.\n\nHAND-TO-HAND - Much of the straight up combat in this game is luck-based. Not all of it, but enough to be minorly frustrating in Hard mode. There is a 'counter' button while you're fighting that can counter an enemy's basic attack, but the prompt to counter shows up only 50% of the time, and even at that rate, it is very unlikely that you hitting the correct button will actually counter the enemy's attack because you're already in full swing of your own attack.\n\nAnd here inlies the main problem with this game - the 'difficulty'. Because of these certain flaws in the combat, the way the developers ramped up the difficulty was by not making certain enemies harder, but just simply putting more enemes in the combat with you. That isn't very good game design, in my opinion. Because not all attacks are properly counter-able, the more enemies you're fighting, the more you're at the whim of the randomness of the game and how the enemies approach you. I have often found myself having to replay some battles where I play noticeably worse, but win the overall battle becaue of the random way certain enemes approach or attack you.\n\nYes, this is a fantastic game, but it's minor flaws turn into glaring ones during certain parts of the game. I would still highly reccomend it, but maybe not for a scaling challenge, but more for batman and adventure / collect-em-all fans.","January 12, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything is just right: Batman uses his brains, stealth, and gadgets as much as his brawn; he never kills; the villains all act according to their various demented personalities; and Arkham Asylum is full of little nods to many, many characters from the comics.\n\nThe gamish aspects are just as polished. The controls (I used a gamepad) are smooth, the graphics are nice, the action (especially the many boss fights) is often challenging but rarely frustrating.\n\nIf you like Batman and are looking for an action game, then you can't go wrong with this one.","March 14, 2014","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Besides this, some enemies wield guns, and that forces one to take enemies out with stealth too.\nHowever, the fighting style in this game gets repetitive really fast, and so do the gadgets (I kept wishing that I would be able to use the batmobile or the batplane, but no :(  ).\nMy personal favourite parts of the game were definitely the nightmares from Scarecrow.","February 7, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thankfully though, this game isn't one of them.\nYou've probably already heard all of the praises being sung over the Batman: Arkham series, so I'll keep this short: This game is amazing.\n\nWonderful gameplay, fast-flowing action, a bunch of wacky characters to match wits against and enough challenges to keep you busy for quite a while. Oh, and you get to play as Batman of course.\nThe game consists of Joker taking over Arkham Asylum and Batman having to stop him, battling inmates, rescuing guards and sneaking around taking down thugs in the most Batman ways possible.\n\nJust as the Dark Knight Trilogy defined Batman on film, the Arkham series defined Batman in games, setting a standard to which all future superhero games should aspire to.\n\nBE THE BATMAN ;)","June 30, 2015","true","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Use his gadgets.\n- Learn more Batman lore than you knew existed\n- Engaging and new plot\n- Dynamic Dialogue\n- Appealing art style and graphics\n\nCons:\n- Controls on Mac were a little hard to get used to, but you can change your keyboard bindings, and I believe you also have the option of playing with a gamepad.\n\nBreezy's full review:\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is hands down the best video game based on a comic that I've ever played and one of the best games overall in my collection. I remember playing the demo at my local GameStop and being sort of skeptical as it just seemed like another beat-em-up. Flash forward to about 5 years later and I'm so glad that I was wrong.\nThe story is refreshing and encapsulating. The dialogue is great (a lot of times humorous, a lot of times epic, only sometimes corny). Like everyone else says, the combat system is the most fluid I've seen in a video game, though I much prefer the "Predator" style of combat (taking out enemies stealthily) in the game. Being the Batman and getting to use all his gadgets (Batclaw, Detective Mode, explosive gel, batarang (in the form of the normal, multiple, explosive, and remote controlled)), and appearances by both the Batmobile and the Batwing were definitely a treat.\nI honestly have to say that the Riddler trophies were my favorite part of the game. When the trophies were first introduced in the game I really had no intention of collecting all 240 of them. But the developers did something very clever and linked character backgrounds to most of the trophies. Some of the trophies take the form of interview tapes with Arkham inmates, Chronicles of Arkham (cryptic messages left by Amadeus Arkham to be found and deciphered), or simply scanning the environment as a visual answer to one of the Riddler's riddles. Of course, there are actual trophies you can find, but I much prefered the ones that would provide some background on the characters. Before this game, I had minimal knowledge of the Batman universe. When I discovered that the trophies could actually unlock character bios (and some nice viewable character trophies), I became obsessed with finding them. Through the character bios and other various forms of the trophies, I became educated on more of the Batman universe than I thought I would want to know. But don't get me wrong, every detail about a character or asset in the Batman world interested more than the last.\nActual gameplay wise, I probably beat it in about 12-13 hours. However, as you can see from my hours played, I spent a lot more time in the game than that. What was I doing? Collecting trophies, of course. Also, I spent several hours in the challenge maps where you rack up points by seeing how long of a combo you can get on enemies or you complete predator challenges, where you must knock out enemies in a specific way (i.e. break through a glass ceiling to take out an enemy). The GOTY Edition DLC  offers you the choice of playing as the Joker in these challenge maps, and it's pretty awesome and a nice change of pace from playing as Batman.\n\nEnd note:\nMy only real prior knowledge of Batman came after Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy and that was about the extent of it (besides watching a few episodes of the animated series growing up). The movies were great, expecially the Dark Knight, but they didn't really expand on the Batman universe, but instead focused on dark realism. This game, however, seemed to capture the wonder and atmosphere of the Batman comics and various animated series. I guess you could say that Batman has gained a Batfan.

The plot and way by whom is told are excellent. Moreover, many character bios, audios and awesome riddles makes that I wanted to get them all and spend a lot more time playing it. I admit of being fallen in love with its combat system. It looks awesome and doesn't need to use lots of buttons. Visualy it still keeps very well. Developers have done a great job with the Unreal Engine 3. Music is characteristic to Warner Bros productions. It seems to be taken out from a movie. It matches perfectly to the world of the game and entire plot. The only thing I didn't like is Batman's attitude to gadgets. I don't understand why he couldn't get all of them (except those from upgrades) at one time. Even so, it's one of the best games of the last years and a little of other titles can be placed equally with this Batman.","January 1, 2015","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/35140/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Batman: Arkham Asylum is an hybrid between an action and a stealth game taking place in the Batman universe. The plot revolves around Batman capturing the Joker one more time and bringing him to the titular Arkham Asylum, only for him to escape and take control of the facility. Batman must then uncover Joker's real plan and stop him, his henchmen and the super villains he will send against the Dark Knight.\nThe main gameplay is generally splitted in direct combat and stealth or predator sequences. Hand-to-hand combat revolves around the so called "freeflow system": in order to bring down a lot of enemies without losing health Batman must hit one enemy after another using his moves and gadgets (and countering enemies' blows when necessary) in the longest combo possible. Later combat sequences are made harder by enemies carrying special equipment that requires you to deploy special countermoves and very though mini-bosses. The predator sequences are instead classical stealth-based encounters: since Batman can't resist agains severe gunfire, you are forced to navigate several maps carefully, picking up enemies one by one without being discovered. You can use your gadgets and vantage points to plan your moves more carefully.\nDefeating enemies allows you to gain experience that can be used to gain "levels": each level unlocks an upgrade point which can be spent in either better equipment or new moves.\nArkham Asylum allows the player to choose from three levels of difficulty: easy, normal and hard. The latter offers the greatest jump of difficulty, since it makes enemies more aggressive and resiliant in combat, counterattack icons disappear and gunfire more damaging to Batman.\nThe whole game takes place on the Arkham Island near Gotham: aside from three main hub zones, the majority of the action takes place inside the facilities of the asylum, like the gardends or the medical bay.\nThe only side quest featured in the game revolves around the challenges the Riddler set up for Batman: these can either be about finding Riddler's trophies hidden in more or less plain sight around the island or scan specific points of the scenary and solve Batman universe-related riddles.\nAside from the main campaign, Arkham Asylum offers a challenge mode too, which is about playing through different combat or predator maps and try to achieve the best possible score and unlocks medals.\nNot only Batman: Arkham Asylum is considered one of the best licensed and superhero game around: it's also a great piece of story from the Batman universe and a very damn fine example of the action genre, and a long time favorite of mine","August 13, 2013","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
