I think that Heller's animations are a small variety in such a 'copy-pasted' world.\n\nSound & Music\n\nThe voice acting and other sounds in this game were not really impressive but neither that bad at all.\n\nStory\nThe story of a your character, James Heller, the war veteran who's been intentionally made into the one of the evolved by Alex Mercer, seemed not that good at all. Actually there were some missions that had some kind of cleverness and some elements that looked promising, but sadly just for a short period of time, because they just sank in the sea of other unimaginative and boring missions with just one goal - to clear all of the Mercer's companions and Mercer himself. End of story.\nMaybe the memory cut-scenes with which you kind of progress in understading of the story and other side tasks and missions are the better part and enjoyment of the whole game, not just the story.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay beside the graphics thankfully isn't the weakest part of the game and seemed improved since the first game. Running, jumping and gliding trough the map which is divided into three sectors never gets old. There are plenty upgrades to unlock, side missions to complete and other bonuses to finish, which really extends the time of finishing the game.\nMaybe the main problem is the fact, that you are overpowered to the most of the enemies, that's why deaths seem to happen only by an accident and not because of the difficulty of the game.\nThere isn't really much to do in the so called 'open world', beside completing the tasks that you are  given. Using your abilities to beat or  'punish' other NPC's in a free roam mode gets quickly boring, because of their dull personality and poor mechanics.\n\nConslusion\nPrototype 2 could be so much more of what it is, beacuse it inherited such a promising name and some in-game elements that showed the possibilities that could turned this game into a one of a kind gaming experience. But, unfortunately, because of so many unimaginative and (rather) bad shortcuts the overall feeling of this game just falls apart.\nMaybe there are 'reasons' why is that and why we just can't give this game a score above mediocrity and put it alongside other great and impressive titles.\nReplay value: NOT really.\n\nRecommended: Yes, but ONLY ON SALE!","November 8, 2015","true","44.5"," 196 of 224 people (88%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","88","196","224","24","0"

NO. With a change of protagonist and a complete revamp of the abilities, upgrade system, and fighting mechanics, Prototype 1 and PRototype 2 are two very different (and both incredible) experiences.\n\nThe Abilities.\nInstead of one ability equipped at a time, with a multitide of combos and attacks, P2 features 2 abilities assigned to Mouse Button 1 and 2. This makes combat simpler than P1, but not nessecarily better. P1 contains thousands of combinations to simply desecrate your enemies. P2 has much gorier attacks, special moves, and kill sequences, but P1 simply goes more in depth. If you wanna know more, play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nUpgrade System.\nPrototype 1 had a currency based upgrade system in which you would collect EP (Evolution Points) in ludicrous amounts and spend them on upgrades, of which there were, I believe, over 100. Prototype 2 features a leveling system, in which the EP (still present) acts as experience points. Upon leveling, the player chooses a single upgrade. Whether either one is better, I can't say, because I didn't have a problem with either of them. They were acceptable mechanics that did what they were meant to. Can you really ask for more?\n\nFighting Mechanics.\nIncredible. Please just play it. It's Incredible.\n\nStory.\nIn my opinion, P2's story was FAR better than P1. The original Prototype has more of a focus on the hack and slash, kill everything, be a total badass through ACTIONS. P2, on the other hand, has more of an emotional story, in which the character (still badass, still ♥♥♥♥s ♥♥♥♥ up) is less cold, and is more emotional. I felt more immersed with Heller than with Mercer.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you can spare the funds, ♥♥♥♥ING BUY IT. If you can't, you better start a damn trust fund, because both Prototype 1 and Prototype 2 are excellent, amazing games that give 2 amazing experiences.\n\nSPOILER ALERT\nThe protagonist is black. Not once did I hear any sort of mention that he was black, nor did I hear a racial slur at any point. Nice. That's the way to go.\n\nRating\n\nSure ok m8 i r8 8/8","November 20, 2014","true","68.3"," 187 of 222 people (84%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","84","187","222","28","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zes493/recommended/115320/","zes493","{WOG}Shirako","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zes493/","295 products in account","I strongly suggest not purchasing Prototype 2. Yes, it was fun. Yes, it was marginally well-designed. But over-all, the first one was much, much better. I'll explain why, and you can decide for yourself if my issues are overriding factors for you:\n\n1. Graphics\n\nPrototype 2 wins. I'll give it that. It's gorgeous. Poorly optimised, so you're gonna get a crap framerate, but it's gorgeous.\n\n2. Control scheme\n\nPrototype 1 takes the gold there. P1's controls are well-mapped by default and make sense once you become aquainted with them. P2 changes some core controls for no reason, and because of the way they're set up, rebinding them will not help.\n\n3. Movement and parkour systems\n\nP1 wins, but mostly because of the control setup. It just flows better, not only because it's been designed better, but also because the controls don't appear to have been designed for a race of crab people.\n\n4. Gameplay\n\nP1 and P2 are actually somewhat tied gameplay-wise. P1's open-world is far more enjoyable and feels more "alive." Things do NOT despawn. I don't mean like they don't despawn for a long time, I mean they DO NOT. I once, to test it, hijacked a helicopter and left it on a roof down on the south end of the map. I then spent an hour or so screwing around in the north end of the map. I then returned and found my chopper in the exact state I had left it, ready for me to board.\nNPCs react semi-realistically. Civillians will run in fear and panic if they see you changing state, military personell can be fooled enjoyably with shape-shifting, and overall the NPC life feels "alive."\n\nP2 wins in events and missions. P1 ultimately has the story missions and that's it. There are side-missions but they're boring as hell and are repetitive, with no real incentive to play them. Granted, it makes up for it by having an enjoyable open-world to explore, but it fails to encourage playing the events. P2, however, has better mission design, even if it does get a little repetitive, and incentive is given in the form of power upgrades to play through the side-missions.\nThings despawn BADLY. I found two NPCs sitting on some chairs and rotated the camera. When it was turned back, they were completely different races and genders. Vehicles left lying around will disappear as soon as your field of view is broken by buildings.\nNPCs have slightly better animations but don't react well. Fooling military personell feels like I'm playing hide-and-seek with a babysitter. "Where's the horrifying shapeshifting abominaattiooooonn? I can't fiiiiind hiiiim. Is he heeeere? How about in heeeere?" It just gets old quickly.\n\n5. Story\n\nP1's story is far, far superior, and not just because P2 suffers from sequelitis. P1's story is about a man put in confusing circumstances finding out his horrifying past and learning to live with it while being targetted by a shadow mega-corporation that has accidentally caused the destruction of New York. P2's story is about a man finding out his just-for-heart-string-tugging family has been murdered going up against a Saturday morning cartoon villain. To make it worse, P2's main villain is the protagonist of P1, the man you've come to be attached to, and ultimately see as a hero, despite the horrors he's been forced to commit. It feels like a cheap twist placed in for no particular reason other than the writers needing a way to not make you the P1 protagonist again.\n\n6. Overall experience\n\nI enjoyed Prototype 2 but only in a very brief sense, about as long as the story lasted, and not for the story, for the missions. While both games offer new-game+ experiences, I just couldn't bring myself to do it with P2. It felt like funding had been cut after the missions had been basically designed, leaving a programmer to write the story and a modeller to design the open-world. Compared to Prototype 1, where I'm currently on new-game+ number four, I just can't recommend Prototype 2. It's fun for a day and that's the end of it, versus fun for as long as you're creative.","May 5, 2014","false","34.1"," 226 of 291 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","226","291","0","13"

It had its fair share of flaws, but few games let me feel as gosh-darn powerful. I could leap tall buildings in a single bound, bash a tank to pieces, run through a crowd of zombies leaving bloody chunks in my wake... what's not to love? So despite the mediocre reviews the sequel received, it was a no-brainer that game would end up in my library as well. And you know what? I'm glad it did. Like the original, it's not perfect but it's a fun - if gory - superhero fantasy adventure (or maybe super-villain).\n\nThe developers went with a more traditional method of storytelling (although they did go a bit heavy on the cut-scenes. but fortunately they are all skippable) and by the last third of the game the adventure does become somewhat repetitive. But the powers are still great and the controls have been streamlined since the original iteration, so it's even easier to become a weapon of mass devastation.","November 25, 2013","true","41.5"," 159 of 199 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","159","199","0","0"

What have you done, Activision? Prototype was one of the best sandbox games I've ever played. The controls are awesome, the protagonist was interesting and Alex Mercer was one hell of a killing machine. Never had I experienced such freedom to wreak havoc and the leveling system was enjoyable.\n\nNow, Prototype 2 is...  largely inferior to its predecessor, to say the very least. The protagonist is not charismatic at all and dumber than a box of nails. He's a much stereotypical videogame generic badass like only Activision knows how to do.\n\nVery bad QTEs and a stupid and extremely invasive tutorial marks the first part of the game. I generally enjoy a quick in-game tutorial, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen. This gets especially ridiculous when the game stops the gameplay to show you something you had to figure out for yourself earlier to advance. I'm not five year old, mind you.\n\nThe great freedom you had in Prototype is now gone! The map is way smaller, and there is so much less to do. You can't choose your upgrades at will anymore! You have to wait until predetermined ''evolutions'' to add a point to one of a few attributes. And its not a new move, it's just statistics, like adding 10% sprint speed or 20% more damage. It's boring as hell.\n\nAlso, the character asset design took one hell of a hit. The texture quality of Heller and other NPC/PC is just dreadful, especially when you compare it to the otherwise well textured and lighted environment. I believe it's even worst than the first game.\n\nThe animation, to my surprise, is not very good either. The animation of vehicles during in-engine cutscenes is robotic, in a way similar to early 2000 games. I don't understand why the developper could not fix this.\n\nNow, the technical problems... This will be a deal breaker for many people. This game is just terribly optimized. There is a HUGE memory leak problem that was never (and will never without a doubt) be fixed. This appear to be related to ATI graphics cards. I have a rather solid rig which can run pretty much anything right now at max settings and at a 1680x1050 resolution. I possess 8Gb of RAM + 2GB GRAM. The game can run for approx 30 minutes before the leak occupies all the allocated RAM and starts to lag horribly. This time interval may be smaller if you have a smaller amount of RAM or your system is less powerful. The solution is to alt-tab out of the game when this happen and then go back. The leak will still continue and therefore, you are stuck doing this every 30 minutes or so.\n\nThis is not a good game. It have many fragments of awesome, but the problems are just so many and so hard to get around that it just outweights its qualities. It's still Prototype though and you'll still have fun wreaking havoc around NYC (NYZ), but if that's all you wanted, go play the first. It got more moves and is funnier overall to play, while the graphics are sufficient to appreciate gameplay at this day.\n\nI don't know what you did to Radical during development, Activision, but you killed them, and you killed Prototype.\n\nI hate you for what you are doing to the gaming industry.\nThat's all I have to say.","May 5, 2014","false","10.5"," 332 of 458 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","332","458","0","11"

There's a terrible memory leak problem that can cause every machine besides the most beastly of them (think more than 8 gigs of RAM) to have framerates in the 30s or lower from 60+ in a matter of minutes, and if you check your task manager, you can see the game is skyrocketing with RAM use as compared to most games. Now, you can make it go away by doing all sorts of PC gaming tricks, but mostly you will have to minimize and then re-open the game every few minutes. This is unacceptable for any game. Activision also does not support this game, if you try to get help from them then tell them that your desktop is custom built, they will simply tell you they do not support custom builds or laptops and hang up the phone. If you lie and say you have a pre-built machine (like Alienware) then they will tell you they're going to escalate the issue, but never get back to you.\n\nHonestly, unless you have a TON of RAM or don't mind constantly minimizing/re-opening the game or changing the graphics options every few minutes, then I say buy it, it's one of the best sequels I've ever played in my life that improves upon the original in every way I can think of. If not for its bad PC port status, I would give this game a glowing review, but as it stands, I can't stand to play any more of it on PC with these glaring issues that will never be fixed because Activision only cares about their money-printing games.\n\nEDIT: Works fine on my Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 laptop\nSpecs:\nMSI GT70\nCore i7 4700MQ\nNvidia GeForce GTX 770m 3gb\n12 gb RAM\nRunning on a 7200 RPM HDD\n40+ FPS on max settings 1920x1080 with low anti-aliasing","December 29, 2013","false","13.2"," 214 of 291 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","214","291","0","12"

Playing on intel/nvidia, have had absolutely zero problems.\n\nAs to the gameplay itself, it kind of feels like I'm playing an amoral amalgamation of a bunch of the Marvel superheroes.  I've got the claws of Wolverine, the ability to knock people around like Magneto, the ability to shapeshift like Mystique, plus a variety of other things.\n\nJust running around the city is a freaking joy, to be honest.  You run straight up buildings, glide through the air, jump crazy distances, pounce on enemies or poor random citizens as you please, etc.  It feels like Spiderman without any sort of web-swinging restrictions, or Batman without any sort of grappling restrictions.\n\nTo be clear, it's not a superhero game -- but it sure does feel more like one than any game I've played that actually features superheroes.  Then again, I'd classify the main character as "mostly a villain, despite doing things that help the greater good."  My guy isn't concerned with saving random citizens from battles that break out; he actually freaking EATS them to regain health.  Or to shapeshift into their form and escape detection.\n\nBasically nobody in this game is a good person at all, and I don't particularly have a problem with that.  Even the random citizens seem to be rude at best.\n\nUltimately this boils down to a power-trip sort of game, with a good amount of challenge despite always making you feel incredibly badass.

His team had an operation in ''NYZ'' but got killed when they encountered the main antagonist of the game: 'Alex Mercer'. -\nUnlike his goal in Prototype 1 he now wants to take over the City and kind of re-populate with evolved made by him with similar abilities . As the only survivor of his attack.. he infectes you with the "Mercer Virus" and now the game begins.\nWe discover that it was Mercer killing his wife and daughter with his "second outbreak" of the mercer virus (first outbreak would be the one of 'Prototype 1') and now crave for revenge and make him suffer as we did.\nDuring all this yet again alot of twists will come up and in the end you find yourself chasing after something way more important than 'Alex Mercer' himself..\n\nThats it from me about the story since I dont like revealing too much for potential buyers.\nThe gameplay stays more or less the same as in one with further improvements and a combat system to die for.\nIts too much fun running, flying, slashing ,beating or body surfing your way through the City with an endless amout of ways to kill people, new monsters and tons of side missions that can keep you busy for a good while. I even recommend buying the DLC "RADNET Access Pack" if it's on sale since it adds new activities and a ranking system for you and your friends that unlocks rewards and Skins for 'Heller' if you complete them.\n\nThe achievments are again just fun to attempt with good challenges and references to movies or other games.\nThe graphics though are a mixed bag to me...some of the textures just look like they are from 2002 while animations and especially 'Hellers' different forms look very detailed and cool. But overall they are perfect fitting for a game like that and I am sure it won't stand in your way.\n\nAgain I was using an Nvidia Graphics Card and haven't encountered any technical issues with that game on highest settings but I am aware that 'AMD' cards are horribly optimized in this game so I'd recommend to get it on console ('AMD' users) if you have one.\n\nOn sale both (Game + DLC) cost me ~ 10 bucks and I dare to say that its a good invenstment since you can spend a good amount of hours in this game trying to complete it 100%. If you just care about the Story (wich may not be the most interesting for everyone) you can leave the DLC behind and finish the main Story in about 10 hours then quit and have another game on your "Story-Completed-List".\n\nOverall I can say that if you loved the first one you will cheat on it with PROTOTYPE 2.\nGameplay feels more satisfying than in any other third person game (with hack 'n slay elements ofc) and the over the top gore is just great.\n\nI highly recommend yet another game of my list that I used to love back in 2012 / 2013 and now got it again on steam.\nAs always I hope that my review was good / helpful and you might have found something interesting for yourself.\nHave a good day! :D","July 12, 2015","true","11.4"," 57 of 72 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","57","72","9","0"

More times than not, you'll have a blast doing all of it.Prototype 2 is a decent open-world action game, that does not invent the wheel, but it does manage to offer solid amounts of entertainment, splattered with generous servings of blood and mayhem.My only real concern is that this PC version is very conservative in comparison with the console version, with minimal graphical improvements and imprecise mouse+keyboard controls.The three month delay could have been used to make the most of the PC capabilities in my opinion.

You play as James Heller, a soldier in the military, freshly made infected by the main character of the last game, Alex Mercer. He has given you the power to get revenge for your wife and daughter, who died because of what is known as the Mercer Virus, supposedly released by Blackwatch (the acting military force in the New York (or what's left of it). As the game progresses, while the missions you do may change, revenge remains your motive, and anything that stands in your way will be killed, blown up, or consumed.\n\nI love the gameplay of Prototype 2. While it can get repetitive after too long, the effect of your attacks is oh so satisfying. Smash, cut, slice, dice, tear apart, and consume anyone that gets in your way, civilians and soldiers alike. Later in the game you can even drive tanks and fly in helicopters. There are 3 parts of the map that you unlock progressively through out the game, but I felt they did a good job with how long it takes you to unlock them. The story line isn't the greatest, until you get 2/3 into the game. The voice acting of the guy who played James Heller is amazing, and definitely gets you immersed in his character.\nThis is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. It's the definition of "a bloody good time".\n\n9/10 for me.","November 3, 2015","true","139.4"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","47","58","9","1"

You can destroy everything with mashing a button and even destroy trees cuz we all know that trees in games are usually gods.

While it maintains much of the same gameplay of the original everything has been cut down in size and scope. Smaller world, less enemies, less powers, less weapons, less vehicles, less moves, shorter storyline. Even the graphics are not as impressive. You could switch the numbers at the end of the two Prototype games and it would be more logical.\n\nThe combat is still great fun but with less enemies and less types of enemies fighting them becomes very predictable very quickly and with less powers, weapons and moves at your disposal you have very little option for mixing it up.\n\nThe movement scheme with the parkour and infected powers is still one of the greatest open world movement systems around but because New York City has been downsized quite severely and now exists in small zones you can't really take advantage of the movement the same way you could in the original.\n\nPerhaps the biggest clue that this wasn't going to be an equal to the original comes in the form of the storyline and the character development. Instead of the mysterious and morally conflicted protagonist of the original Prototype 2 casts you as a random jar-head out for revenge but quickly goes on a mission to save the world in an all too predictable way. The storyline of Prototype was obviously concocted by someone that have never bothered to play the original, almost all of the major plot-points and revelations of the original are either ignored or contradicted directly. All the shades of morality have been sucked out of the game and instead of the morally ambiguous characters and grey story of the original we get a predictable story about a angelically inclined hero versus a bunch of bad guys that are portrayed like Joseph Mengeler's meaner older brother.\n\nDon't bother with this game, the original was a great play and I still heartily recommend it but the sequel is simply not worth the bother.","January 4, 2013","false","82.3"," 56 of 82 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","56","82","0","2"

It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that great. Some new additions, skills and abilities from the first game, but not much change other then the advancement of story line.\n\nThe story line takes place after Alex Mercer has released the virus and begun infecting New York City. He has become corrupt with power and seeks destruction. It almost seems generic as the first game, but still quite playable. I did enjoy it, as much as I could, but probably not as much as I did with the first Prototype. The story line did play out pretty well, but they could have done a much better job with this epidemic.\n\nThe combat system was alright as well. It had some new additions and skills to go with it, but like I mentioned before, not many. The combat is very gory. Much to be expected from a game of infection. The input of the combat didn't differ much from the first Prototype. I also think they could've done more with this as well. It's always from to drop from 1000ft to Ground Zero and devour someone for their health and identity. Always useful when trying to escape from the armed forces.\n\nA lot of work and changes should have been made before release. I would recommend getting this on special if you are at all interested in this game. It's still a good game, just not a great game.

The only thing I slightly enjoy about this game is running down the streets desimating everything in my path. Even then, it doesnt take long for me to get bored.

There are some technical problems with it now and it is a shame that the PC port isn't better.\n\nI read today that there is a Biohazard collection available on PS4 and Xbone with both this, the first game and the DLC included. GameSpot reviewed it and just criticised how it's a bad port on those systems as well. They didn't mention any of the games strenghts which is normal actualy when it comes to the Prototype series but a big shame in my opinion.\n\nWith a few tweaks here on PC the game is running pretty good for me. However there are still some frame drops and some stuttering but this decreases in the later areas. It's a shame that I can't experience it with better performance but it's still an amazing game.

The combat and movement mechanics were fantastic, while the world felt full of life. It had an uncanny sense of complete chaos, like as it was hard to see the difference between civilians and zombies in the crowds. The second game builds on the world design from the first game and creates an even more believable sense of bewildering chaos. It’s so much that it’s hard to take in if you just stand and look at it all. Any ideas you might have of avoiding collateral damage quickly go out the window. You just can’t help killing crowds of innocents when dealing with the military or monsters in the city. The city is just too dense for combat.\n\nPrototype 2 is a wasted opportunity. The world design is the perfect stage for any post-apocalyptic game. It’s teeming with details and history. The art department really went all out in creating a believable world. Even the sound design is impressive. It’s subtle, and has a carefully designed wide dynamic range. It’s full of details, like car tires squealing when an NPC slams the brakes to avoid hitting you. It’s a competent studio pulling out some of the best work of the generation. And it’s all ruined by the story.\n\nI don’t know what they were thinking when they signed off on the script. Did someone high up decide that this was fine, because “it’s just a game”? The story and characters are about as shallow as they get. Nobody has anything resembling a personality or a story arc through the game. They all look different, but the way they speak, their motivations and their roles in the story is all devoid of texture or depth. It’s just flat and boring, and as a result you can’t get engaged in anything going on. The mechanics are all great, and the mission designs are acceptably good. But there’s no excitement to see what happens next.\n\nDespite the abysmal story and characters I still had a good time playing the game, thanks to everything else being good. But make no mistake, this game is instantly forgettable. You barely know what’s going on even as it’s happening, because it’s all flat and monotone. It’s like going on a nice sightseeing trip through a nightmare vision of New York. But we’ve already seen plenty of those, so that might not have much novelty value. I wanted to play the game after playing Saints Row 4, because SR4 basically copy-pasted the game mechanics of Prototype. For the €5 I paid Prototype 2 was worth it, but I can’t get over what a wasted opportunity this was. Every other component is here for a phenomenal game, but they decided that players don’t care about story and that this level of ambition is fine. And it just isn’t.","February 6, 2014","true","11.1"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

It does have a couple of problems however.\n\nFirstly it is quite graphicly intensive, i have a decent PC that can play games like battlefield 4 on high/ultra settings and get 70-80 fps; however on this game with medium settings i only get around 60-70 fps 'SO BE AWARE'\n\nSecondly it has a very bad issue with memory usage. For me, after about an hour playing, it starts to get really laggy & unplayable; which normally results in me having to restart the game (which is annoying if your in the middle of a mission)\n\nThirdly the game sometimes randomly CTD's without any warning, normally for me after around 2-4 hours playing.\n\nFinally for me everytime I use the 'pack leader ability' my screen freezes, the game is still playing in the background as you can hear the audio and still target things, however you can't see your character just the frozen moment when you used the ability (this hinders the game as a couple of times during the story as you have to use the ability to complete missions)\n\nApart from these things, I have noticed a couple of glitches with wall running, stealth consumes and AI; but overall i would highly recommend this game.\n\nIF IT IS ON OFFER GRAB IT!\n\nEDIT: Since I upgraded some of my hardware the game either refuses to boot, or runs at around 3 FPS even with everything on low.

This game is absolutly sick , if you love destruction and just wrecking everything ,then this game is definitly for you !\n\nYou play as a Soldier and get infected after that ..... Everything becomes different.You become an absolutly bloody , amazing killer with so many destruction options.If you got Radnet Dlc You can fire Laser and blow up tanks and more.You like to play with tanks ? Go ahead !Hijack one and blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of them !You want to fly with a helicopter ? Do it ! And terrorize the town or wreck the infection.\n\nYour abilities are also pretty sick.Tendrils,Claws,Sword,Whipe and Hammerfist.Also you can consume and copy everyones look.So no one will ever know , who you are.Sometimes it's required for some missions or just to start a pretty sick ambush attack or making hijacking a bit easier ,if you prefer it like that.Radnet Dlc add some more options like Laser beams shooted by your eyes or destroy stuff ,while you push yourself off from the ground and creating shockwaves or smashing down on the ground and more sick stuff.\n\nYou will notice you are pretty overpowered and this games makes you feel like a badass."Nothing can stop you!",thats what the Devs did pretty well in this game,even if you play it on insane .You are still overpowered as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAlso its kinda interesting just to walk around as a soldier or as a civil person and take a look ,how peoples react on you.It's cool and really sick.Or look and listen to the peoples reactions or what they talk about.For me its a feeling , that i rarely get in some other games.Also the feeling you get in some Zones is kinda amazing.\n\nWhat i really like is how they created those "Zones" .I'm talking about the "Red Zone","Yellow Zone" And "Green Zone".The Red zone is overrunned by infected and is a war between Soldiers and Infected,while some Survivors try to stay alive,which you see sometimes flee from the Infected.\nThe Yellow zone is a military zone ,where peoples are may infected or not.Also there are alot of Scanners and Scandrones seeking for infected.It`s really nice and well made to see those "Villages" build by metals and seeing the Soldier patrolling around.I really like it.\nThe Green zone is the "Non infected zone".Here are n Infected or well almost.It`s pretty sick to see the peoples how they enjoy their life and feeling in safety , until you send them to hell...\n\nOf course there is a downside in this game.\n\nFirst: is that the Zones feels kinda small .Well they are not soo tiny , but they could be more\nbigger.\n\nSecond: some Players have some issues with starting or playing the game sadly.\n\nThird: you will notice some glitches like peoples looking up to the sky ,while running away.It`s hiliarous and some more bugs,but no bugs , that i think is "gamebreaking"\n\nFourth: It lacks a bit "Variations" , if you played Prototype 1 , then you know what i mean.There could be more abilities and more destruction stuff.\n\n\nThis game and those Devs is/made such an amazing game , if you seek for destruction and explosion,then go buy it!Seriously!I wish there would be another Prototype 3 , but sadly the Company got all fired -____-.Atleast it's a rumor.\n\nStill the game is amazing and still in my eyes one of the best games ,which got ever created.Those Devs today should try to create a game similiar to this.It's amazing and sick !Also the feeling in all those Zones or the Sound .It's stunning for me.\n\nAnd of course the Radnet Dlc offers you some Skin varations + some mods aswell.\n\nI highly recommend this game and hope that there will be a Prototype 3 , a mix between Prototype 1 and 2 !","March 25","true","253.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Also, the verticality provided by the tall buildings is only enjoyable in parkour, with only 1 attack per weapon that targets airborne enemies or structures, the other ones just sending you like a comet towards the ground.\n\nThe graphics are okay for 2015, some of the ground / wall textures being low quality. Also, props like AC units, cars or other things you can throw are simple and look decent.\n\nThe pacing of the game tends to be fast, although the player can approach enemies in multiple ways, even with ranged attacks and military weapons. If you are playing close-range melee, chances are you won't even notice the low-quality textures or the dumb civilian AI...\n\nThe story is...compelling at most. I've completed the main story + all //BLACKNET sidequests (each one has 2-3 missions) in about 20 hours.\n\nThe soundtrack is nothing special, SFX being fair and the  voice acting being on the bright side.\n\nAs conclusion, here are my ratings for the game:\n\n\n7.5 / 10  Graphics\n7 / 10     Animations\n7 / 10     Audio (OST + SFX)\n7 / 10     Story\n8 / 10     Gameplay\n\nOverall: 7.3 / 10\n","December 12, 2015","true","24.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

It's worth getting if you're a fan of single player campaign missions or a fan of mauling any being you come into contact with. The cutscene styles are amazing, giving you access to limited colours that mainly consist of red, and the occasional blue from a computer screen (not blue screen of death). These cutscenes are very well animated and great to watch. It isn't only those scenes that are greatly satisfying though, when you 'consume' a specific target in the game, you are able to access their memories and previous thoughts or just be able to access the correct information you are looking for. These scenes are also well animated and well thought through, they don't give you a lot of easily noticeable imagery as it skips between images and people and small clips very quickly, but, that also makes it all the better to watch as it is mainly the talking that allows you to breifly understand what is going on in the fast paced images. Furthermore, the gameplay is relatively smooth, but it moves around and sends you of course more often than I had hoped, I have played the console version of this game and I would have to say that it was not much different to this one really, just, the controls are a lot easier to understand as there are a lot less buttons to press and hold. So, I would encourage you to use a controller rather than the keyboard. Overall, the rating of this game would be 7/10. If you found this helpful.

Not many games give you a killing machine , where you can destroy all who will fall on the eyes . Many side missions that do not celebrate diversity , but not one-to- one with each other.

I love the true sandbox feel of this game although its not up to calliber to grand theft auto it is still a very great game. There is two major bugs that i couldnt seem to fix through the game...one was the dioalouge and most sound was completely absent when i played on my headphones but if i set the volume to go through my tv it was fine... i tried all those techniques of changing the Hz to 44000 and 16 bit and all that and it still refused to work...another bug was that after about 20 minutes of gameplay the game would exponentially lag  and stutter around unil finally it got into single digit fps and i couldnt take it anymore and saved and quit but once i restarted the game it would go back to 60 fps fine until about another 20 min... one thing i found out a little bit later was that if i would hit the windows key and get out of the game for a second then go back in that it would be less likely to lag but i would have to do this periodically about every 5 minutes or so which is quite a nuisence. Besides those two major bugs i can still say that i had a great time playing prototype and i will continue to play just for the sandox part of it :D","May 24, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I thought the first game was good for the time and was hoping for a second one to be released. When I saw the advertisement for the Prototype2  I just had no reaction to it and decided to add this title to my maybe pile for the future. So when it came up on steam deals I toke a chance and got it. The game is very similar to the original in both good and bad ways, The combat feels the same which if you didn't like the first game then you won't like this. The story is mediocre at best (compared to modern standards) with no real connection with the main character, which could leave most people possibly disinterested on following the game till the end. However James Heller is a badass character himself and they could of created a much better back story for him. This may seem like I'm ripping on the game but, it falls down at most of the points it needs to hit. There are some features of the game which are original and with work (possibly in a Third Prototype game) they would have chance to shine. All in all if you liked the first one then pick this up (on a deal of course).","January 15, 2014","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I feel like Steam should do something about this, something like putting a warning on the game's store page about it so an amazing game that has issues running with certain types of hardware doesn't get pushed down to "Mixed" reviews.\n\nAnyway, if you can run this game, you'll see from the vast majority of the reviews that you should play it. You play as an overpowered antihero and you go around slicing and crushing anyone from innocent civilians to military. The story is pretty interesting, but overall I'd say that the main character is really the only one they got right.\n\nSo if you like to jump and glide around an infected New York at ridiculous speeds to massacre anyone you want in a variety of ways, buy this game.

Less challenge missions, and harder to fail them. Pretty much ez-mode all the way through on Normal difficulty (with only a couple of speedbumps along the way) but I honestly wouldn't recommend you play it any other way. It's a power fantasy, through and through, and that's how it plays best.\n\nControls on keyboard & mouse are fine. A bit wonky at times, but you'll get used to them. It's a console port, so a controller is probably better if you got one. No dealbreaker though. I played through it without one easily.\n\nThere's a few bugs the developers never fixed, but since it's a 4 years old title at this point random folks on the internet has already solved them for you. AMD users (allegedly) needs a registry fix to play, and there's a point in the second mission where you have to alt-tab out and set CPU affinity to just CPU 0 for a few minutes to get past a glitchy trigger-event (the Pounce Claw Attack tutorial). Other than that, I experienced no technical problems at all throughout the rest of the game (running Nvidia and Core I7).\n\nBottom line: It's a non-stop action fest of gore and destruction for 12-14 hours.\nIf you like action games and it's on a sale, it's absolutely worth it.","April 17","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some of it is fundamental to the game's overall outlook.\n- Some of the textures and modelling from the main game are too low-res for the in-game cutscenes. In those cases, they look awful.\n- Not as sandbox-y as the first game.\n- Character skills/customization is fairly broad and doesn't really let you specialize too much. So by late game, your character will play pretty much the same as any other playthrough.\n- As a result of the above two points: not much replayability.\n\nRating: 8/10","December 6, 2013","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

AMD graphics cards aren't consistent, so any good graphics games (not just Prototype 2) will run like crap.\n\nAnyways on to the actual review -\n\n\nPresentation: The storyline is interesting, but Heller's constant anger causes a lack of character development. The cutscenes are very unique and finding locations in the map is fairly easy.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are pretty good, but they seem kind of old style. I think of Assassins creed 3/AC Brotherhood when i see the graphics.\n\nSound: A lot of commotion goes on and honestly some of the stuff gets annoying to hear, but nothing beats hearing the sound of your enemy getting ripped in half.\n\nGameplay: Your character is a badass which is what makes me addicted to this game. It's extremely entertaining to blow up helicopters and just kill everything. The only complaint is that you need the DLC to get 100% on the storyline.\n\nLasting Appeal: The campaign isn't too long, but you'll stay busy with all the side missions and collectibes scattered everywhere.","November 2, 2014","true","51.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have the game installed on an SSD but once in a while it'll randomly jump into a loading screen for a minute glitching things like muting all sound for the rest of the cutscenes (it goes into a loading screen in the middle of a cutscene or in the middle of a checkpoint "race" mission, etc). Combat can be a bit sloppy and annoying too because when you're trying to target and attack 1 thing, it can randomly decide to go after something else, or you're trying to consume something but instead, you pick up a weapon or a heavy object blowing your cover. Stuff like that.\n\nAside from the annoying stuff, the game is actually pretty good. I especially like how the game is pre-loaded at all times (aside from the glitched out stuff). Like, when you first load up the game into the main menu, the campaign is already loaded and playing in the background, the second you click Continue, the background rotates a bit to your location and you start playing.\n\nI was able to complete the entire story as well as all the side story related missions (I didn't do any of the DLC stuff though as they were just challenge missions completely unrelated to the story). I do think this game is much better than the first one. And this game runs at a very solid 60+ fps on my GTX 660 at maximum graphics settings.","May 2","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an open world game in the spirit of the classic 'Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction' on the original Xbox. Set in the aftermath of the first game, yet again NYC becomes the victim of a biological apocalpyse set off by Alex Mercer dragging in Gentek and Blackwatch. Mercer infects a soldier, Heller, who develops the powers of his protege as he goes on a rampage killing anything and everything from both sides of the conflict in a quest for revenge for his daughter.\n\nThe free roam mechanics in this game are without question the best out of any game I've played. It is simply satisfying to run at superhuman through the war torn streets of New York, leaping up the sides of skycrapers and cruising along them then jumping and gliding high above the conflict. The sense of weight and power you carry without feeling cumbersome or bulky is just nailed, you look and feel like a lithe, dealdly human predator. Story and side missions along with the usual collectilbes are scattered around the map, which is split into 3 seperate parts. While I lost the sense of a large city I got from the first, it let all the elements of the map have personality, which is a tradeoff I'm willing to take.\n\nThe weapons and upgrades are disappointedly almost the same as number one with only a few differences. They are all still visually impressive and satisfying, but I held expectations for a more substantial roster of weapon options. The combat and movements mechanics are likewise similar with a familiar set of enemies, with just enough changes to justify its existence as a new game. The Evolved are quite cool though, plus it provides an enemy that plays and operates similar to yourself. The difficulty level is quite easy once you have a few upgrades, the tools at your disposal allow you to ignore or avoid almost all incoming damage sources. My first playthough on hard was very straightforward.\n\nPrototype 2 is not the best game ever. I haven't even bothered to review the story, because there's really nothing to say. It's passable if that, but it does its job in giving you a reason to tear though a collapsing city under siege. There isn't the greatest expansion in concepts from the first game, but enough to add some mild spice. Despite this, Prototype 2 is fun. It's simply fun, the core gameplay is nailed down so very well, fun is all a game needs to be.","December 3, 2014","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are literally thousands of soldiers and scientists that are in on it, which makes the conspiracy about as unbelieveable as is humanly possible.\n\nThe main character is a "badass" in a sort of "we made a 10 year-old the lead writer" kind of way.\n\nDespite all of that, this game is lots of fun. I didn't have memory leak problems, but also have 16 GB RAM, so I can't comment on people with frequent slowdown. I think the game looks like any other last-generation-to-pc-port. Higher resolutions, much better draw distance, more shadows, etc, but in reality an engine that doesn't try to do too much.\n\nI'm having a great time 4-5 hours in, and it feels like i'm about halfway done the main story. If you like the game, get the "Radnet" DLC. It adds a bunch of fun challenges to the map - should really be included in the main game, but has no plot and is really just a bunch of superhero sports to try out.","June 24, 2014","true","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Graphics as well as sound are at least decent. And now the most important part: Gameplay.\n\nThe devs did a great job here in my opinion. The missions are motivating and fun. Sadly, they are a bit repetitive as well. A good thing as well is the fact that you are being rewarded for doing the whole collectible stuff. This should be mandatory in every game including those.\n\ntl;dr: A great Open World game.

Heller isn't "homicidal madman" like Carnage, though, but it's still super fun to play with the mutation powers. If you've played the first, you'll basically ease right in to the second - it's honestly been years since I played the original, but I felt more or less right at home (after a little bit of keybind switching, it's basically just as I remember it).\n\nMechanically, bases are only infiltrated within the context of missions (story and side), and lairs are one-and-done deals, unlike in the first game where both enemy building types could manifest at predetermined sites throughout the world. The Web of Intrigue is done away with, but you still consume named individuals and view their memories. This time around, though, individuals are tied to //BLACKWATCH missions most of the time, and you get an ability to hunt down these individuals (versus mostly running around the city and praying for the target to spawn), making things FAR less of a hassle in that department.\n\nAs I recall, Musclemass isn't a thing in this installment as it was in the first one, but you do get the Tendril power which is plenty of fun on its own (though it kind of makes me think of using Lanky Kong's melee attacks in DK64). Every other power feels very satisfying to use and pretty viable the entire game through.\n\nOverall, pretty good when on sale - turn your brain off, though, because it's not necessarily top-notch in terms of writing, character development, or voice acting. But then again, that can make it feel like a cheesy horror-ish actiony B-movie, so that can work in its favour.

Fine, whatever. I have to use my xbox 360 pad which is fine I do not mind that at all. But the big issue which is why I've never finished the game is because it is one of the worst console ports I have ever seen in terms of performance. I have a nice rig where on any games that are not poorly optimized or bad ports, I get a smooth 60fps at max settings @ 1920x1080. This game, no. I get 60fps in it yea but also stuttering from bad optimization/coding. It is still playable and enjoyable for sure, just is distracting where almost all of my other games are not because they perform flawlessly.\n\nBesides that crap, this is a very entertaining game. You get super powers and using them to fk people up is awesome and never gets old. You can tear people in half and flatten heads and all kinds of cool ways to kill dudes. It's a big improvement over the first game in terms of quality. Better sound, controls, gameplay, etc. Although just like the first game it's a bad console port job. You can send out a pulse and find guys to consume that give you side missions but it seems like they do not become an option until you finish a certain amount of the story.\n\nPort job 4/10.

Prototype 2 is the sequel to Prototype (1). On my opinion its good game. Brutal, action adventure where you can upgrade your character and his incredible skills. Open world in destroyed New York..Arhhh..YES..It is actually good environment for myself. Lot of people say that have boring campain. Yes, for begginer this can be "nothing much". I am fan of this series, but it has some "errors". P2 giving new and new abilities and ways how kill someone with STYLE, but lot of these just lost. I liked in P1 feeling, i was an original. In P2 developers made lot of mistakes and P2 is story about "stupid superhumans" with "SAME" (always easy to kill them) skills. Yes, P2 has very easy difficulty, something is happening on HARD or INSANE diff....But i still LOVE this game and this little "errors" don't make me to hate this game.. I really recommending this game. <3\n\n+ grafic\n+ gameplay\n+ quite creative\n+ environment and size of map\n+ character\n\n- enemies\n- difficulty\n- some missions ( just hunt and then consume or kill your target)\n- length of story, you can finish story in 4-5 hours (without bonus missions)\n\nMY REVIEW - 8/10","May 6, 2015","true","21.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It will occasionally drop from 70 fps to 5, and remain there for way too long. The graphical options are completely useless, they pretty much do nothing.\nOn top of that, this game not running well seems like a joke, since the textures and effects reminded me of Doom.\n\nGraphics and performance aside, it was almost painful to transition from Prototype 1 to this game. Everything just feels 100 times clunkier. Also, this game is a lot more strict about hiding your powers from the guards. This means that the fun, carefree superpowered parkour that you could do in Prototype 1 you will now have to be overly cautious with, or else so begin the mini game of running aimlessly until the game tells you you're safe.\n\nIf you're considering getting this game, get the first one instead.

That said, that's my main grudge against P2 -- you can't really choose what your character looks like, what his backstory is, etc. etc., and the fact that like in P1, it isn't really anyone too likeable doesn't help.\n\nThe control scheme now lets you choose two active powers versus Prototype 1's one, and while that sounds nice (especially the option to assign a slow move and a fast move, or a close range one and a long-range / area one), I didn't really find it all that useful in the game (I would assign one fast, close range attack as primary power and use it 95 % of the time, and have something like tendrils -- or later whip fist -- as a secondary for the rare cases where I needed to attack a helicopter or needed an area effect. Using each roughly 50 % for great synergy? Not so much. But maybe, that was just me.).\nThe downside is that while you get twice as many active skills, you have to handle them with the same number of buttons on the controller, and the controls feel less precise than in P1. Ironically, the most annoying issue wasn't even attack related; if you don't get quite the right attack, but still an attack, it's usually non-catastrophic. What I did get often enough for it to be a nuisance however was being on a stealth mission, pressing (B) to interact with some hapless soldier (usually to consume them and gain their memories; sometimes just to stop him keeping an eye on the person you came for), and instead prying lose some feature of the landscape that also happened to be close (but didn't even necessarily look like you could interact with it). And well, prying lose random ACs or oiltanks or whatever automatically raises an alert and ruins the stealth part of your mission. (This can also be an issue during melee, where you get a prompt to press (B) to consume an enemy who's been weakened enough, but who may die soon, and where in crowded locations (B) will then often select bystanders seemingly at random, all while your actual target is bleeding out.\n\nI liked the skill system in P1 better (get XP for everything, then once you have enough XP to improve whatever skill you're interested in (i.e. buy many minor things quickly, or save up for big improvements)) vs P2's "you'll level up again at so-and-so many XP, and every time you do, you can improve exactly one skill", but in the end, it wasn't a huge factor.\n(That said, the thing where you can get a skill buy eating the brain of someone who has it still exists.)\n\nPRO\n\nUnsurprisingly, the city looks much better than in P1; the player character looks much better, the voice acting is decent this time, and most of all, while there are certainly repetitive elements (mostly the Blacknet assassinations, which often don't have much in the way of plot -- this is even lampshaded one time: "So this guy is an APC driver? Doesn't really sound like a big bad mover and shaker ... ah, whatever, I'll kill him anyway."), the game, especially the main quest, feels much more like a story than the first game did at the best of times, and a sense of urgency is upheld at (almost) all times. Like a soap opera or Baking Bread, it isn't necessarily the cleverest plot on earth, but each mission creates enough of a cliffhanger to make you wonder what will happen next, and it's tremendously easy to get sucked into "just one more mission before bed."\n\nAs a bonus, much of the optional "color" of the setting is now told through audio logs you can find (and listen to while you move along), rather than flickering memories with corny visuals that don't really blend with the rest of the game and that interrupt your flow like in P1. Small change, surprisingly big effect. (Technically I guess they're a cross between the landmark orbs and the "color" memories of P1, but I played P1 and P2 in the same week, so it's becoming a bit of a blur.)\n\nThere are challenges and mini-games and somewhat repetitive kill zones, but unlike in Saints Row IV, they're not mandatory -- you can do one once in a while for variety or XP, or do them after the main quest for something to do with your then near maxed-out powers. Or, you can ignore them completely, and just do the main quest. Your choice.\n\nThe gliding, especially once upgraded, still won't carry you as far as SR IV's, but it feels world's away from P1's, which never felt much better than plain old falling.\n\nA big plus: Starting maybe 2/3 in, P1 would just try to overwhelm you -- gliding was practically useless, perhaps in an attempt to keep you at street level, and at street level, there'd be a constant barrage -- even if for once, zombies weren't attacking you and soldiers weren't detecting you, you'd frequently ragdoll all over the place simply for getting caught in random crossfire of the marines or blackwatch using tanks and rockets at street level. Yes, it sounds good on paper -- getting swarmed is obviously very much a zombie trope, and the careless use of artillery demonstrated desperation / casual disregard for any survivors, but in reality, it just makes for a really unfun game mechanic when the true challenge of a misison isn't Doing The Thing, but getting there to do the thing. Meh. (This was exacerbated by the fact that using any speed powers could get a strike team called on you.)  In P2, you get caught in the cross fire much less easily, you don't get swarmed by the zombies as much, strike teams aren't called in as easily, take longer to arrive, are easier to shake off, and are easier to kill. Heck, it's almost too easy in P2, but I'll take that over P1's traversing the city being a chore any day. P2 has "joy of movement!" :)\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nIf you can stomach playing a character that they picked, rather than one that you picked, give it a go, especially if you've played part one, but get it while it's on sale. (It seems pretty much too late to vote with your dollar anyway, now that they've already downsized Radical -- which is actually a shame, I would've been interested in seeing how a Prototype 3 would've come out.)","January 23, 2015","true","74.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","2"

The animation during in-game cutscenes are very robotic in the sense that they feel very Playstation 2 like.\n\nDespite all this, the game is still really enjoyable. Being able to cause havoc in any area you wish is all ways fun, and being able to run around the whole map at nice speeds to where-ever you wish whilst carrying most cars, bins or people to the top of a tall skyscrapper. The story in most games I never really pay attention to but this one I did and I think the story isn't that bad. Without any spoilers, the main character gets the Alex Mercer virus and discovers that the people he thought were trying to help every-one were the people causing the outbreak. So you go and take down main people in both GenTek and Blackwatch to discover more.\n\nSo, in MY opinion this game is extremly fun but prehaps not worth the £20 or whatever it is in the US. Do pick this game up if it ever gets a discount. It's definetaly worth it.","July 20, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/115320/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","Prototype 2 at first was hard to really give an opinion on. You play as a marine named James Heller who's basic focus is to kill his family's murderer: Alex Mercer. Heller through 3/4's of the game is a cliche 'I'm just the perfect badass' character. And it's very irritating. No, he is not very emotional past flat out angry. While the anger is understandable, it isn't acceptable to me that a character only really acts on one feeling. You will see Heller in other emotions so don't get me wrong, he isn't the same throughout the whole story (thank God). But it's only about 3 times. Other than that, he's a cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that can't go a minute without swearing.\n\nAs for gameplay, that's where it took me a while. The combat at first is meteocre since you have no abilities. You just mash one button. Once you get a couple abilities that's when it starts to get fun as you can use two abilities at once rather than having to switch so much in the first title. The side missions are rinsed and repeated, but you become more powerful this way and honestly, it never really gets old being able to sneak in and destroy things by morphing into another human you just "ate". They also added a timed side mission where you need to get all the intel canisters before Blackwatch gets their corrupt little hands on them. You only get two mass abilities unfortunately. The first is just the recycled devastator Mercer used. The second I don't want to spoil.\n\nI actually like that it takes longer to unlock things in this one. You can't hijack tanks or helicopters nearly as soon as you could in the first, so it makes for more of a challenge. Overall, the gameplay is definitely better than the first, but I do miss the ability to body surf. And I also miss how you dig in and tear up the streets in the first one too. You don't really do that in this one. And if you're curious about the graphics....no they definitely are not better than the first. I run this on maximum settings and it still looks bad compared to the first. But I'm not a person to care as long as the game is solid.\n\nAs for the story, some say it's deeper than the first. Yeah I can agree with that to a point. The story is very predictable but done decent. Half of the story is told through the important people you steal memories from. I always liked that about Prototype. The end was a cliffhanger and left me wanting more. I hope at some point in the future they decide to make a Prototype 3 to either continue the story or add closure to it.\n\nI'd say this game is worth a max of $15 to $20. Better than the first and definitely recommended. But I always feel Prototype could do so much better with the story and immersion. Lets hope they make a Prototype 3 someday and really blow our minds with it.","May 4, 2015","true","20.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Sure, the graphics are prettier and the the gameplay is "refined", but it suffers the burden of being not only a poor port, but something of a shoe-in title.\n\nThe story is less than great and won't keep you invested in the game. While the game itself is fun, it has the potential to be extremely tedious and sometimes purely boring. The "side missions" are a rinse and repeat formula and strikingly exhausting. Sure, the first few are fun, maybe - but soon they become a real pain.\n\nIf you're playing the game with an AMD card, you'll have to deal with constant memory leakage, gradually cranking the game's performance down and leaving you with a sad twitching pile of polygons and laggy blur effects. I had to end up downloading a third party application to have the game run smooth and actually have a chance at finishing it without losing my mind.\n\nIf you're interested in an "open world" superhero game, (the open world is actually not "open" - it's split into districts of fairly small sizes that require fast travel between them; invisible walls, ahoy!) where you're free to run wild and destroy things and throw people, this game is exactly what you're looking for.

The open world is the same, exploring is the same, except there's a little more but somehow feels more bland though...\n\nSummary:\nI really like this series and I really liked this game, I wanted to play it, never felt forced too and had a great deal of fun in the process, the storyline was a bit bland but the combat made up for it. It's a great Hack'n'Slash beat 'em up style game, with fun fights, keeps you on your toes about how you're going to kill a certain enemy (Some enemies can be killed more efficient with different attack styles) and overall I had a great deal of fun from this game - like I did with the first.\nIf you're looking for a game that is a Hack'n'Slash beat 'em style game with cool monsters to kill, a great movement system, fleshed out, and that flows really well then this game is for you - like it was the game for me.\nDon't be fooled by it's low rating, it is by far better than any of the ♥♥♥♥ that gets 90%-95%, like ♥♥♥♥ing Goat Simulator? Give me a ♥♥♥♥ing break.\n\nGameplay:\nIt's basically a hack'n'slash beat 'em up game, very responsive and you feel powerful, it's just fun, really, I can't put it any other way because you are powerful, essentially a god in the game, but a single slip up can kill you I found - well in hard mode at least - sometimes you'll find that you're running away to eat some guys. It's still fun.\nThe weapons are fun, but I found myself using only 2 - the claws and the tendrils - probably because they were my most upgraded but each had their own thing, and towards the end I did switch them out. Oddly enough, there's less choice about mutations than in the first, you get 5 different powers, some have had minor changes from the first one, specials being applied to other powers and so on.\nI'm not sure if it's because I haven't played the first for ages, but I felt that there were less enemies attacking, the boss fights were much smaller for sure, in this game, they did the thing where the first time you meet them they are a boss, then as you get stronger they become a regular enemy kind of thing. I kind of felt this ruined the vibe a little, made it all feel a bit... Worthless to be honest. In addition, there was no real unique boss fight like in the first game like when you fight Greene and so on.

But I'll put it bluntly; not much has changed since the original but you won't be focusing on that because you'll spend all your concentration on killing the enemy. I felt it didn't need better graphics because I didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about them as I was too preoccupied about that monster trying to kill me.\n\nAudio:\nNot really much to talk about here, you get audio options and the audio is of the typical Triple-A standard that you'll expect.

It didn't outstay it's welcome and it didn't bug me for bed & breakfast. Overall, not much re-playability but it doesn't really need any as for a story game 15 hours is pretty damn long by today's standards.\n\nOverall, 8/10 - they could have done quite a few things better but it doesn't prevent it from being a good game, it just prevents it from being an excellent. It's a shame that they have basically abandoned this series and I really hope for the original spark in the first game to reign chaos once again and make a third that takes all the criticism both games got to make an excellent sequel.

Yes I have to admit it is "dumbed downed" from the last game, the mainquest and sidequests are easier than the last game and most of your powers and moves dont have a negative trade-off, but the overall fun of game over shadows the weaknesses it has. The graphics are beautiful, everything is sharp and very detailed. The game's focus is on powers and they are just super fun to use. The map is three times bigger than the last game because it includes two other islands to explore. The boss battles are the best part of this game because of their intensity and that compared to the last game instead of upgrading to get powers you get powers by killed a boss. I really recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed the last game and just general sandbox, destruction, powers, mutants type of game.\nThere seemed to be a memory glitch thing going around but i didn't expeirence it.\nI used a nvidia geforce gtx 670 to play this game.\nRecommended++++","July 8, 2014","true","27.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Prototype 2 took the lessons learned in Prorotype and distilled all of the most intensely fun parts into a new game. Heller is a superb protagonist, and I found myself chuckling at his snide remarks more than a few times. The powers and unlocking were all streamlined from the original. Mercer transitioned perfectly from protagonist to antagonist, and it's beautiful how in-your-face he is right off the start. It really makes the climax that much more intense.\n\nOnly criticism was that the difficulty felt a bit low. The only time I really felt any pushback was on the final Mercer fight. The rest of the game makes you feel like some kind of symbiote-deity. And that's totally all right.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a fitting sequel which surpasses the original.

The open world is the same, exploring is the same, except there's a little more but somehow feels more bland though...\n\nSummary:\nI really like this series and I really liked this game, I wanted to play it, never felt forced too and had a great deal of fun in the process, the storyline was a bit bland but the combat made up for it. It's a great Hack'n'Slash beat 'em up style game, with fun fights, keeps you on your toes about how you're going to kill a certain enemy (Some enemies can be killed more efficient with different attack styles) and overall I had a great deal of fun from this game - like I did with the first.\nIf you're looking for a game that is a Hack'n'Slash beat 'em style game with cool monsters to kill, a great movement system, fleshed out, and that flows really well then this game is for you - like it was the game for me.\nDon't be fooled by it's low rating, it is by far better than any of the ♥♥♥♥ that gets 90%-95%, like ♥♥♥♥ing Goat Simulator? Give me a ♥♥♥♥ing break.\n\nGameplay:\nIt's basically a hack'n'slash beat 'em up game, very responsive and you feel powerful, it's just fun, really, I can't put it any other way because you are powerful, essentially a god in the game, but a single slip up can kill you I found - well in hard mode at least - sometimes you'll find that you're running away to eat some guys. It's still fun.\nThe weapons are fun, but I found myself using only 2 - the claws and the tendrils - probably because they were my most upgraded but each had their own thing, and towards the end I did switch them out. Oddly enough, there's less choice about mutations than in the first, you get 5 different powers, some have had minor changes from the first one, specials being applied to other powers and so on.\nI'm not sure if it's because I haven't played the first for ages, but I felt that there were less enemies attacking, the boss fights were much smaller for sure, in this game, they did the thing where the first time you meet them they are a boss, then as you get stronger they become a regular enemy kind of thing. I kind of felt this ruined the vibe a little, made it all feel a bit... Worthless to be honest. In addition, there was no real unique boss fight like in the first game like when you fight Greene and so on. It's a shame really as it could have easily added them in and made the game much better.\nOverall, the combat is very fleshed out, very responsive, makes you feel powerful and like a god. Gives the player good feedback with the health bars taking chunks of damage off and so on, generally really fun combat, great feel to the game and I never got bored of it.\n\nStory:\nI'll say this now, the first 20% of the storyline is pretty crappy, but after that it starts to get good, I felt less involved than I did in the first one though, the story felt a tad spread out and seemed to fit the game rather than the game fitting the story - unlike the first one where I felt it did the opposite.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/115320/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","Prototype 2 at first was hard to really give an opinion on. You play as a marine named James Heller who's basic focus is to kill his family's murderer: Alex Mercer. Heller through 3/4's of the game is a cliche 'I'm just the perfect badass' character. And it's very irritating. No, he is not very emotional past flat out angry. While the anger is understandable, it isn't acceptable to me that a character only really acts on one feeling. You will see Heller in other emotions so don't get me wrong, he isn't the same throughout the whole story (thank God). But it's only about 3 times. Other than that, he's a cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that can't go a minute without swearing.\n\nAs for gameplay, that's where it took me a while. The combat at first is meteocre since you have no abilities. You just mash one button. Once you get a couple abilities that's when it starts to get fun as you can use two abilities at once rather than having to switch so much in the first title. The side missions are rinsed and repeated, but you become more powerful this way and honestly, it never really gets old being able to sneak in and destroy things by morphing into another human you just "ate". They also added a timed side mission where you need to get all the intel canisters before Blackwatch gets their corrupt little hands on them. You only get two mass abilities unfortunately. The first is just the recycled devastator Mercer used. The second I don't want to spoil.\n\nI actually like that it takes longer to unlock things in this one. You can't hijack tanks or helicopters nearly as soon as you could in the first, so it makes for more of a challenge. Overall, the gameplay is definitely better than the first, but I do miss the ability to body surf. And I also miss how you dig in and tear up the streets in the first one too. You don't really do that in this one. And if you're curious about the graphics....no they definitely are not better than the first. I run this on maximum settings and it still looks bad compared to the first. But I'm not a person to care as long as the game is solid.\n\nAs for the story, some say it's deeper than the first. Yeah I can agree with that to a point. The story is very predictable but done decent. Half of the story is told through the important people you steal memories from. I always liked that about Prototype. The end was a cliffhanger and left me wanting more. I hope at some point in the future they decide to make a Prototype 3 to either continue the story or add closure to it.\n\nI'd say this game is worth a max of $15 to $20. Better than the first and definitely recommended. But I always feel Prototype could do so much better with the story and immersion. Lets hope they make a Prototype 3 someday and really blow our minds with it.","May 4, 2015","true","20.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kodiak-Rush/recommended/115320/","Kodiak-Rush","Kodiak-Rush","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kodiak-Rush/","242 products in account","New York has been devastated by hideous mutative virus and the only hope for at least a somewhat happy outcome is a soldier wracked with PTSD, visions of his lost family and on a quest for vengeance… Oh and he is literally an indestructible super mutant. Sound fun? Then you should get this game.\n\nNow where to start, this game is more fun than a barrel full of radioactive plague monkeys hopped up on Vicodin. This game takes place a few years after the events of the first title, knowledge of which is not needed as you get a history lesson almost immediately before getting infected with the super virus that turns you into a freaking super hero… of death I guess.\n\nThe game offers you three large open worlds to explore, each representing a portion of New York city and each very different in their own way. If you’ve seen NY then you will know your way around. Yellow zone is a huge slum where the oppressive totalitarian Government crushes all under boot, the green zone is… well much the same as NY now but the red zone, that’s where it’s at. Huge packs of rabid mutants roam the streets, the buildings toppled and destroyed. I loved that place.\n\nThe combat is one of the best parts of this or any other game. As mentioned you are a super hero, sorta. You can fly, jump over skyscrapers rip people in half, hurl tanks into other tanks and all that cool stuff. Not only that but you come with more blades than a Swiss army knife and each one of deadly powers is so much fun to use. My fav was infection citizens and turning them into living goop bombs before lobbing them at passers-by and watching the carnage.\n\nThis game makes you feel like a bad a.s.s, the most bad a.s.sed bad a.s.s that ever roamed the streets of NYC. With your array of powers you could destroy entire armies or mutants and humans alike. Slicing, dicing and smashing them to bits before transforming into someone else and walking away as if nothing’s happened. This game gives you the power to be anyone; You just have to consume them. That’s right, your powers health and abilities rely on how many people you can eat using your tentacles. All of the things you can possibly imagine are given to you via a large tech tree and levelling system.\n\nNot only can you use your bare hands to deal a lot of damage there are also vehicles in this game too. Tanks, helicopters and..… Well not many different vehicles but each one can blow the heck out of anything infront of it. You can also utilize your enemies weapons, slicing someone apart and then blowing up his friends with his grenade launcher, classic.\n\nThe story is great too, a man’s tale of vengeance, betrayal and hope lead him to save the world from a psychopath hell bent on forcing humanities evolution. Also there is a government conspiracy in there somewhere. The characters are great and I felt really connected to the protagonist, just like everyone else he absorbs. The music was good, not great but it served its purpose. There are a ton of collectables that offer a nice amount of back story and hidden information and I had a good time tracking them all down.\n\nThis game is awesome; there is a lot of enjoyment to be had. It is not overly long even though its open world but what’s there will entertain you for hours. Plus if you are anything like me the pure gory death you inflict on others is enough to get me hooked. Buy this allday anyday and you will not be diapointed.\n\nHave Fun ^_^","January 17","true","39.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So I was forced to skip all cutscenes in order to avoid it and watch them in a seperate video on youtube... that is really a huge downside since the story is good and also playing a mission without any backround is just slayin some mutants.\n\nSo i can recommend the game to everybody who likes open world or hack n slay games but you need to be patient with all the hickups the PC version contains and because of all the problems only buy it in a sale if you are interested.\n\nIF you have the possibility, play it on a console.","April 8","true","23.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I honestly would love a refund for my money, and time spent trying to fix something that should have already been fixed.\n\nEdit: I did get this to start working with my AMD card, there is a wonderful topic in the discussion board that helped, but that still does not change the fact that I would not recommend buying this on a PC, it crashes frequently, and I've had sound cut out on cutscenes at odd times.\nAs for the game itself the story is actually pretty decent, the game is more of the same of prototype so it is fun at times, but the combat feels lacking compared to the first one, this is partially due to having two powers out at once now, and one button is used for either power.\nOverall I would say it's average for fun, but if you did kind of enjoy the plot of prototype, I did, then this is not a must play immediately but I say an eventually, like you know three years later.","April 30, 2015","false","18.9"," 32 of 65 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","32","65","3","3"

Not as much of a thrill as that first time you learned each power in Prototype1, but it has its moments.\n\nUsing stealth to avoid unnecessary combat was always my favorite option, but when I had to fight, I would always call in my Brawlers. Some might consider having five large allies as a mechanic that ruins the game experience, but you can always choose to go at it solo if you prefer.\n\nThere were a few things I did not like in this game, but they were tollerable:\nDefensive misions\nPowerless Blackwatch missions\nTimed "collect the cargo" mission\nThere is always an easy way to win a fight and a hard way. The game lets you pick which one you want to try most of the time because it is an open world.\n\nThe game encourages you to do side missions and level up because you become more badass and powerful with each upgrade. With the right upgrades, the game can become more and more fun.\n\nGlad I bought this game, I will revisit it some day when I want to run through both the games and relive everything again.","September 30, 2015","true","18.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

None of this was possible.  Started the game I quickly found out when it said use left mouse botton only, the right botton worked.  Then when the game said to use right button to siphon life and restore health, no button anyplace on the keyboard or mouse worked. The game was stuck.  I had to alt + delete to quit the game.  Did some google searching and found lots of issues with this game starting with non Nvidia Gfx cards to changeing mouse configurations.

There are references to the first game but it's not needed to have a fun time. This game is a Power Fantasy and it does that in spades, you feel powerful. Enjoy. My review below is for people who have played and enjoyed the plot and storyline of the original Prototype.\n\nTo fans of the original Prototype, this game is about the same. It's a big more organized, with a bit more work put into it. But it has the same progression and feels very much like you are just playing the original Prototype with a few extras added in. If you feel a "Prototype itch" this may be a decent game to pick up if it was heavily discounted, but I generally do not recommend this game. I do not recommend it because the completion of this game left a bad taste in my mouth. I enjoyed the original Protoype, and loved the story and the plot. But this game throws it all away. Because (Spoilers)  Alex Mercer, the original protagonist, is rewritten as a batshit crazy idiot-ball carrying villian who actively pursues the very thing you fought to stop in the original game. Which, as someone who played the first Prototype who enjoyed and got to understand the complex personality of Alex Mercer, I find to be a complete cop-out, and this just thoroughly destroyed my enjoyment of the Prototype franchise.","June 22, 2014","false","16.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

AMD has a LOT of problems running it, and funnily enough I have a AMD graphics card.

The developers don't even care to fix this problem as it has been a problem for some time now as I realized.

I WOULD absolutely recommend this game if it was not so definitely broken.\n\nNo matter if you have a last gen pc with tons of ram (i have 32GB) and a last gen video card (i use AMD wit 2GB). The game lags and crashes every about 10 minutes. It's just a bad porting.\n\nToo bad because there are some aspects in which the game really shines. Graphics are very cool, when the frame rate doesn't drop. Controls are improved, and the overall impression, compared to the first episode, is of that a world which is actually alive (also thanks to the motion capture movements and the improved usability).\n\nThere are also some ponts where, I think, the game is actually worse than the first chapter, like the start of the game (I liked the "immediately in the game, and the story piece by piece" of the first episode), which I found quite slow. The second episode has a more RPG-like evolution system than the first chapter, making it duller at some ponts (as someone said, you almost cannot chose at all how to evolve your pg, you have to follow very strict guidelines).\n\nBut the very bad thing is that you cannot at all play this game. Seriously, it's very cool, but it willl just not run in your pc.

Get a different graphics card if that is the issue. If you are having lag, try to fix it properly instead of acting like you know everything about a pc/laptop. I am currently running this game on a laptop with a decent graphics card ( 4210M 2.6GHz 3.2 GHz dedicated boost NVIDIA Ge.Force) and i am having no issues whatsoever. I only have like, 1.5 hours on it, but i have played this on console, and i enjoy it alot. I have not encountered any bugs just yet, but if i do, i'll chose to ignore it, or try to fix it. I recommend this game, as it is on sale, and it's a good open world game. If you want to cause mayhem in NY, this is the game for you. Just like The Incredible Hulk.\n\n8/10","May 3, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The controls are easy and flows very nicely. The gameplay is somewhat easy, nothing can really stop you once you get the hang of the abilities, but the game is very fun. The story is there, but the missions are somewhat repetitive, and the upgrades don't seem very meaningful aside from the evolutions.

You play as one of the characters you have briefly met in the original Prototype, and apparently after the whole first story, a epidemic found place. Alex Mercer (main character of the original Prototype) the one behind this epidemic, and so the bad guy of Prototype 2.\n\nIn the original Prototype, the ending showed nothing of Alex turning bad, maybe even the opposite.\n\nThe game developers turn this new guy into the hero, but you never really feel any form of 'connection' with him. He just seem to be angry and blindly run, and act by rage all the time. I never have a lot with characters that act this way.\n\nAside from that the main story is rather short, and switches from one side, to the other... it almost feels like the developers re-thought the storyline halfway through the process... deciding to change the whole story hafway through.\n\nThe game never really feels to run truely smooth and the gameplay overal just isn't really working... As a keyboard/mouse player, I sometimes felt like I was making a sailorsknot in my own fingers. You ofcourse can change the buttons & actions linked to them, but it still never really works for me. Therefor I never did many side missions, as the whole buttonpart irritated me quite a bit.\n\nThe experience might be a lot better with a controller to your PC.\n\nIt does have a lot of nice, and gory situations, the developers sure have took their time on making things look really disgusting. ;) & Ofcourse the transformations of your character are just like Alex's really nice. The whole sword/arm, and rest of the transformation arsenal are still amazing to use and lovely to see.\n\nOverall most of the game just didn't feel right. It had the feel of not being properly finished, and being rushed for the deadline.

Dont expect to run this well without a current generation video card\n\n-Story is so bad it's actually painful. You play as a thuglyfe meathead with no redeeming qualities; whose entire vocabulary consists of about 10 words including "♥♥♥♥♥", "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥", and "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥". Your enemies include a PMC called Blackwatch that is so excessively evil, that African rebels who ♥♥♥♥ and murder whole villages of women and children on a daily basis would consider them overthetop. There's also Alex Mercer who you play as in the first Prototype, who has also turned completely evil for reasons I'm not even sure were fully explained.

But what I have seen is downright atrocious. This is one of the worst PC ports I've played, and right now it isn't worth a penny until it gets fixed.\nI regret paying even spending £5 on it, it's has the most unstable frame rate drops I've encountered, struggling to hit 30, then plummeting down to 5 fps without explanation. But it's ok, it's not unpredictably buggy, because it happens constantly, regardless of what I'm doing.\nIt's so bad that the game becomes almost impossible to control, and I wasn't able to play any more than a few minuets before getting a headache. Because of the poor K&M controls it's best to play this with a game pad, then, and only then is this game remotely manageable.\nBut from a design point of view it seems to fall for the usual mistakes that a lot of major release games do, the opening of the game gives you no control, holding you hand all the way through a series of frustrating QTE's, that you can't even fail because time stops, so you can sit under the fist of a giant monster for 5 minutes while it waits for you to click, this is Rambo: The Video Game level of design (but don't worry, you still get an achievement at the end of that level... >.> )\n\nI heartily recommend that you don't buy this game for any money, unless you want to spend you valuable time fiddling with community made patches trying to get this broken mess working, because this game has not been patched by the developers or Activision after 2 years.","June 28, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was fun running around this big city with super powers, running up buildings, gliding around, destroying tanks and cars, doing some mini challenges here and there, but after a while it all wears off when you realize that there really isn't a lot more to this game than that. The mechanics seemed good enough at first, but later on the controls and mechanics just get in the way and cause bouts of frustration when battling bosses and harder enemies, using either keyboard and mouse or controller. Luckily I got both the 1st and 2nd Prototype games in a bundle deal that was about the same price as a couple of sandwiches. I wouldn't ever pay more than that for them.

Plus, other courageous reviews present a depth n' detail storyline.\nI'm here to help those suffering from the ATI and AMD issues from the severely poor port that I experienced.\nThe original prototype I felt added a significant Replay value, and that is the winning poll in my vote. In playing Prototype 2, I see it was a bit rushed and perhaps that is why devs abandoned it. {Being under economic pressure can cause serious stress attacks.}\nNevertheless, it was fun, but I only feel like going back and playing the original...even in it's crusty old black and white building state.\nNow, for the ATI and AMD users, this is a MUST, if you are a hardcore Prototype, Infamous type player then I suggest getting game with these programs:\n\nFOREMOST TO DO - GO TO Steam Users' Forums > Steam Game Discussions > M - P > Prototype series\n[ FIX ] Prototype 2 Radeon Memory Leak Lag Fix by Kompster, as this fix may not help everyone.\n\n1. RadeonPro - allows you to run this game or otherwise you suffer severe memory loss/loop - both on your PC and in your mind! - Thanks to Kompster!\n2. SweetFX - a FX configurator with options/features such as SMAA Anti-aliasing, FXAA Anti-aliasing, Advanced CRT, Bloom, Vibrance, etc.\n3.Dxtory - camera stuttering and mouse lag fix (I suggest playing with a USB xbox config controller, I play with a old logitech controller with Xbox 360 controller emulator and it works fine.) Dxtory, I have not used and was given through the Steam guides section from FRAY. As I play with a controller to avoid this type of issue.\n4. Buy a USB Gamepad/Controller and Download a good emulator - preferably Xbox 360 emulator, though I love sony's cntrller layout better, my suggestions x360ce\nwww.x360ce.com/default.aspx\n\nAnd that is all, I shall say for now, my system:\nOperating System\nWindows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1\nCPU\nAMD FX-8350\nVishera 32nm Technology\nRAM\n8.00GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 671MHz (9-9-9-24)\nMotherboard\nGigabyte Technology Co., Ltd. GA-970A-UD3 (Socket M2)\nGraphics\nSceptre X24WG (1920x1200@60Hz)\n2048MB ATI AMD Radeon R7 200 Series (MSI)\n\nFYI, to make recommendations on a game that has severe performance issues, I can only state that you purchase this as I did, "As Is". You may need to do some searching, reading, HID unplug and replug, program installing amongst other things to get this game to run, feel you don't like reading, searching, etc. then avoid. This may help if devs had stated this.\nUpdate May 1, 2015: I have been beaten this game on steam and previously years ago on console.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychoticworm/recommended/115320/","psychoticworm","psychoticworm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychoticworm/","226 products in account","Overall 6/10\n\nGamers know whether a game has good replay value within the first 10 minutes of playing, by that time if the mechanics of a game don't capture your imagination, you can forget replay value. I'm a very positive person and I'd like to start by saying that if there ever was a Prototype 3, I would play it and give the series another chance to redeem itself, so dear develompent team working on Prototype 3 and development team who produced Prototype 2; please review some notes below in regards to why Prototype 2 sucked, and what was good about it.\n\n-The reason Prototype 2 sucked:\n\nThe mechanics and controls were nowhere near as fluid as the first installment of the game(starting out), nor did they emulate the controls of the first game very well. The game does not feel as 'quick paced' as the first. What I mean by this is that even turning around is too slow, running up buildings I feel like some fat guy with a corn cob shoved up his butt, trying to race to the nearest toilet, casually. Gamers need that 'parkour' feel that the first game had without the fat guy running to the toilet feel the second game has. Your gamers want to feel like ninjas, Super Hero Ninja Samurai Monks(title in development) running through the city, thumping into people and body checking them just to see them slowly stand up and act like nothing happened.\n\nThe camera controls felt a little laggy for default, and sometimes did't work at all when trying to get an outward view while running up a building, it was very frustrating trying to fight the first 'Pink Hulk guy'when you changed the dodging mechanics that the first game had. I mean, are you guys even gamers? You do realize that you DON'T need to change essential game functions like that to create a great sequel? Anyway, besides the controls there were several other problems with the game that was basically annoying to sit through and act like I care:\n\nThe story was way too linear, and the intro/tutorial was too long, and should have had an obvious 'skip' option for the experienced Prototype One players, and if there was an option to skip the nearly hour to two hour long intro tutorial garbage, I couldn't find it. Thats one thing top gaming companies have a problem with, turning videogames into an interactive movie that you have to sit through, thats one thing that destroyed my joy for the Assasins Creed titles. I'm sorry I'm the type of gamer that needs to hear my objectives and story while I move around and goof off, its more emmersive (its one gameplay feature that Doom 3 and half-life did very well, and I am hoping to play the latest iteration of these games also.)\n\nCharacter didn't feel as powerful when landing, climbing and picking up objects. There were much bigger and more pronounced textures and effects in the first Prototype when landing and running up buildings(the cracks on the walls and holes in the ground left from contact with his powerful limbs.) This was a particularly satisfying touch to the first game, makes you feel like you can break through anything(without leaving the destruction around for too long.)\n\nThe way levelling your character worked: I prefer the Evolution Points method, seeing that you have hundreds of thousands of 'something' on the HUD when your playing as a super hero, and then spending it all, has its appeal. It has a certain appeal in a lot of games actually, makes you feel more accomplished.\n\nDid I mention that the intro tutorial was TOO long, limited, and drawn out??\n\n\n\nWhat Prototype 2 did right: Explosions worked pretty well, but thats one feature that is easy to make look good.\n\nThe boost wave effect when you hold down the run button was a nice touch, but somehow wasn't the right kind of emphasis on his actual speed in the intro.\n\nThe overall textural appearance of the wolverine ability was much nicer and cleaner, and the fighting style for that super power wasn't bad either.\n\nThe new enemy types were a great and welcome addition, namely birds and other land creatures. Its nice when game sequals give you a fresh variety of enemy types to combat.\n\nI liked the effect of the hunting ability, the radar sense was pretty cool, but I think it would have been better if the minimap was involved in the hunting ability, then you wouldn't have to be required to get to a really high building just to seek out targets. Gamers like the freedom of choosing how they execute a search, as long as the enemy/target general location is easily determined.\n\n\nLike I said, I really hope for a Prototype 3, And don't give me this 'theres too many super hero games out there' crap, the super hero genre is alive and you have a whole class of gamers waiting to play the newest original title. By original I mean, NOT a Disney/Marvel mashup,but a game like Prototype with its unique querks and storyline.","July 21, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I loved the first one so I was excited to play the sequel but terribly disappointed to find out that it's completely unplayable with my AMD Radeon 6950 and there is absolutely no sign of support from the publisher so this will likely never be fixed.\n\nGranted this GPU is old now, it still runs most games maxed out or nearly maxed out with no problems. The fact that I can't run this game even with all graphics settings turned way down and resolution reduced makes no sense to me.

Stealth is always an option rather than outright charging into combat, and is sometimes necessary on harder difficulties to get out of a mess, but it's clear the focus of the developers was on causing as much chaos with your nigh-invulnerability as possible. The only con is the story and main character somehow manage to be worse than the first game, but that's never been important to either title in the series in the first place.","January 5","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I swear the designer wanted this to be a racing game because 1/3 of the missions are race against time, where you pick up boxes (and they give you a little time boost) meanwhile being shot out of the sky with rockets. For such a bad ♥♥♥ I'm not sure why it takes our hero so long to recover.  I tried, I tried so hard to play this game to the end but it was just such trash I just couldn't. I'm somewhat of a completionist so the 20 hours I have into the game are not straight storyline. I doubt this poorly put together plot even has 20 hours if you run it straight. I am just so disappointed at how poorly this followed up such a great game.

Rating this game up because you can eat people is just I don't even\n\nAlright. Let's handle this like gentlemen.\n\nWHY THE HELL DID YOU DO THIS AND WHO THE HELL IS HELLER AND WHY THE HELL DID HE DO WHAT HE DID HE'S NOT EVEN THAT-\nHell, I thought Heller would be okay at first. Thought he'd be like Finn from the latest Star Wars movie, BUT NAH. Just a slangy, snappy little nugget that just came in outta nowhere and made everything suck.\nI don't know why they thought it was a good idea to bring in a random character so lame and flatlined AS A PROTAGONIST into the prototype series. "Send the ground my regards, mutha♥♥♥♥a." Makes me cringe so hard like I'm going to give birth to another bluescreen. That being said, first mission= crash. Crash crash crash. Had to load someone else's save to get past that. In fact, why not just load a save that beat the game so I can get on with it and use my Alex Mercer skin? Other than the fact that they made his hoodie look like an pistachio (which is a joke by the way), the mission name "Murder your Maker"... Okay, goodnight. Let me just go to bed and sleep on it and not post a bad review the next day... COUGH COUGH OH NO I CAN'T SLEEP I GUESS I'LL JUST...\n\nLet's just say that the storyline for this game is as simple as it is, and boring.\nNo, not the Steam description "Become the ultimate shapeshifting weapon!" But what Google or Siri says, Hell, I don't know. Find bad guy. Kill bad guy. Bad guy also just happens to be yeah I think you know.\nI will say this: The gameplay is amazing. I absolutely love it. But when I'm wearing my Alex skin and I hear him say something that sounds like "Surprise, mutha♥♥♥♥a" or anything that Heller would say...\nJust put on the zombie Alex skin, and sit back to the "HUMMMUMMMMUMUMUM KKKKKKKKKK GAHAHHAHAHHHH MEMEMMEMMGHHGHHGEMMEMMERRRR"\nI miss the guy that would punch strangers on the sidewalk. I miss the guy that said he wouldn't let them erase Manhattan, and killed pedestrians anyways. You cannot turn the legend into condensed soup.\nThere are so many memes I could make of ALL the characters in this game. Alex, Dana, and don't get me started on Heller.","April 26","false","462.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's frustrating beyond belief trying to get this game to even run. I get the game to start up one damn time, and it crashes half ♥♥♥ through the first mission when you're chasing Alex Mercer, all the while getting maybe a pitiful 14 fps even on a high-end machine.\nSome say this runs just fine on ATI cards. I have an ATI card, and this is what happens. Everytime I start the game now, it black screens and becomes unresponsive. The "fix" to disable HID devices did not work for me. Verifying game file integrity on steam also did not work. Google research on the issue leaves me little else to try.\nRadical Studios is dead, and so is my hope for being able to play this game on PC.\nIf you're looking for troubleshooting simulator, then get this game. If you're thinking about playing this game, then take a pencil, sharpen it, and shove it into your eye, because it'd be less painful to be in the hospital for weeks holding that pencil steady than to spend another minute fixing this damn game.","June 12, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","5","12","3","0"

This is not lying : I actually bought Prototype 2 last year (and it's a pirated version and CHEAPER) but there was no lagging issues seriously.\n\nPrototype 1 is actually quite more fun when in the free roam BUT Prototype 2 has the funnest, funnier(actually Prototype 1 seems doesn't have alot of sense of humour), actions on the Main Missions and Side Missions.\n\nApart from that, Prototype 2 has alot of different features than Prototype 1. But, if you haven't play Prototype 1 yet and play Prototype 2 instantly, you have no problem (and you suck for not playing the first). The parkours are okay in Prototype 2 but this new "chasing the  Evolved]  system" are quite hard and sucked just because of it's parkours.\n\nFinally, you can't have fun in the free roam eg. you can't find any  Orion 1/ Super Soldiers  in the free roam, you can't find  Thermobaric vehicle , you can't fight/find  Evolved  to fight againts the millitary. You can only find them in the Main Mission and the Side Mission. Prototype 1 has everything you want to fight/use/enjoy what they have eg.

Let's start with the main character: Heller is just dumb brute and no amount of his dead loved ones makes him relatable. Mercer's quest for identity was nothig astonishing, but at least his lines were never this cringeworthy. And in no way he deserved to be made into this horrible kind of villain. Movement and fighting mechanics? Never truly shined the way they were intended to thanks to the broken lock on system. Movesets of each weapon are lacking variety and being able to use two at a time doesn't just scratch that itch. And most of the pleasant little details and moves were added only to RADNET edition. The story? Goes all over the place and gets nowhere without a sequel to deliver any catharsis whatsoever.\nVerdict? Play the first one and hope for a reboot.

The game itself is immence fun, focusing on openworld exploration and combat, with the main character having crazy genetic based powers. The game itself is all about speed and manuverabilityl, which makes the fact that you can not keep a consistent framerate in this game at all. This makes the game literrally unplayable when too many things are happening on screen. Prototype 2 is never gonna get fixed in any official capacity, and there is no consistent way to make the game run at a decent framerate. This means that for all intents an purposes it is fundamentaly broken and should not be played by anyone who values a smooth experience.","June 27, 2014","false","9.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You see, instead going fair, the game changes your ♥♥♥♥ing controls during boss battles, you randomly fall through the floor, and some boss battles have non avoidable attacks right after the cutscene, just removing your health for no real reason. Oh, and did I tell you that you can fall through the floor? You can also change gravity and fall upwards, which is kind of entertaining. Or fall through the wall. There are many bugs in the game, and as such, it's not playable. Enemies instantly regenerate all their health by being stuck in an animation. Another fun fact - some of your attacks won't work on bosses. I'm fine with that, but if only the OP attacks work, then the boss battle turn into wathing the same animation forty times, due to the fight difficulty being the incredibly long health bar of your enemies.\n\nThe good parts:\n+ The game runs smoothly.\n+ Free roaming is great.\n+ Carnage is fun in the beggining.\n+ When the game is not completely broken it's really fun...\n\nThe bad parts:\n- ...but it is broken all the time.\n- Some of your attacks are completely worthless and some are incredibly OP.\n- Bosses use unavoidablr attacks to make your life miserable.\n- The plot is so stupid, I honestly prefer to watch Batman & Robin to it.\n- The main character is the biggest idiot in the gaming universe.\n- The plot twists that aren't even changing anything, while being obvious.\n- The mentality of most characters points to mental retardation.\n- Soundtrack is irremarkable, just generic action game music.\n- After some time, everything becomes annoying to the limit, expecially the collectables you need to upgrade.\n- Listening to the same lines over and over and over and over...","August 30, 2014","false","11.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","4"

I do love this game!

You can consume almost everybody to gain health and to obtin memories that help you to understand better the story. In the city you can find collectibles to be found and liars to be cleared for mutators as a reward. Mutators give you superpowers and you can earn XP points by completing missions. As you level up you can open and obtain upgrades that make Heller more deadlier and give you advantage during the gameplay. The game ends with an epic fight against your creator, Alex Mercer.

If you've played Prototype then you've already done 90% of what Prototype 2 offers.\nExcept Prototype 2 has a worse story.\n\nI realize in the first game that Alex Mercer isn't really a dynamic or deep character, but the mystery of the situation and the fact that he generally seemed interested in helping people made him appealing.\nIn Prototype 2 you play Angry Black Man. You can tell this because his name is Heller. He's a part of the military, he has a wife and daughter he loves, and he generally treats everybody like crap.\nThis is all you ever you will ever know about him.\nHe get's about 1.5 seconds of character development  during the game that almost made him somewhat human (A later scene with Dana asking her to do something for him, and when he decides not to flat out murder somebody like he normally does).\n\nMercer is even worse.

Uh... don't know?\nSince in the last game he's a good guy who's trying to stop the spread of the virus the sudden swithc to deciding that it needs to take over the world is jarring. And they never explain it.\n\nThe side missions can be fun, but they're all "find this guy and eat him", "kill these monsters", "sneak into this base and eat him", "drive a tank/helicopter", or the worst of the lot "Run and collect things that fell out of a helicopter".\nSounds like an okay mix, but they get old real quick.\n\nThe main story can be completed in one sitting if you just rush through it, and since the story is bizzaro and almost non-existant it's not really worth the effort.\n\nAnd the ending is really a face palm moment.\n**SPOILERS!!!!***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou become some kind of virus god capable of eating all the infected stuff in the entire city.\nBecause we needed a quick easy way of cleaning up the mess that was New York to make it seem like a real ending.\n\nLike I said, the gameplay is a lot of fun, but personally I'd suggest playing the original.","May 10, 2014","false","16.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I have only just finished it so I wish to put my thoughts out there while they are fresh.\nif you were looking forward to an interesting improved version over the origional Prototype you will be serverly dissapointed. if you want to have some more fun in the Prototype universe, go play the origional again and save yourself the pain.\n\nCredit where credit is due, Prototype 2 DOES look good, I will give it that. But thats about the ONLY thing it does better then the origional. It just feels as though the developers kinda.. well... dumbed it down for example the progression system in the origional was that you would earn EP (Evolutionary Points) through the main story and through doing side missions and then you could freely choose how you would evolve your character with a few story limitations (which made sence) and could unlock new abilities and combo moves.\n\nIn Prototype 2 however the EP that you earn are directly channeled into a liniear level up bar where once it is filled simply gives you a level up point that you can choose to place in either:\n\nHealth\nRegen\nMovement\nMass\nFinishers\nand Disguise (which in almost completly pointless I might add)\n\nOnce the point has been placed it simply gives you a straight up boost to the thing that you choose.... and thats it....how boring. Now before people go off at me YES you can do side missions to aquire "mutations" (selectable passives) but again that is quite boring and not worth going after as the game can quite easily be completed without aquireing more then a single passive...\n\nAnother problem is that many of the enemies you will encounter are just re-skins. There are some new enemies but most if not all will instantly be recognisable which is a shame.\nmost of these things I could deal with but what really put the nail in the coffin for me was\n\n*not really a spoiler*\n\nThe final boss fight, Obviously you fight the protagonist from the first game (Alex Mercer) and I have to say it was one of the worst if not THE worst boss fight I've ever had to force my way through, because I refused to give up on the game after making it so far, but my GOD it was terrible.\n\nI like many of you I'm sure remember building up Alex to be the ultimate badass killing machine. Yet once you reach him, to destroy your maker.... it's just pathedic. The fight is a spam fest of dodging and back stabbing with scripted movements, camera angles and area restricting nonsence.\n\nFirst off. The spam. my GOD the spam. Yourself and Alex literally jump around each other constantly because many of Alexes attacks are unblockable and auto hit unless you are spamming the hell out of dodge. Then once you land behind him you back stab him a few times, then rinse and repeat.\n\nThe camera angles kind of lead into the area restriction problem. you confront alex on top of a building and after having the whole game free roam, you are now restricted to this one roof top for the duration of this fight and in doing so the camera has to use funky angles just to try and keep up with all the stuff flying around the screen causing many, MANY problems and it is just stupid. Yes the origional did the same with its boss fight but at least it had a semi decent reason of being on an aircraft carrier and at the very LEAST that boss had minimal scripting and the fight was still "free roam"\n\nIn all honesty it would have been better if they had just made Alex like the (minor spoiler) Evolved where they fought you around the city in free roam. It would have made the fight so much better.\n\nAll in all I am dissapointed which makes me very depressed as I absolutly loved the first game and played the hell out of it, this sequal.... just makes me sad.\n\nIf you are new to this universe go buy the origional and have a blast. If you are a fan like me? then just avoid this and go have fun with the origional again.","June 27, 2014","false","16.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Then out of left field comes the crippling framerate issues.  Apparently if you have an AMD graphics card, this game's framerate turns into a Powerpoint presentation as soon as one of the following things happens:\n\n1) It rains. (This happens fairly frequently.)\n2) A helicopter shows up. (Ditto.)\n3) The game just wants to ♥♥♥♥ with you. (I SENSE A PATTERN HERE.)\n\nKeep in mind that this is with the graphics set to the lowest possible settings.  Even then the framerate issues persisted, and I eventually just gave up.  I've jumped through MANY hoops to play good games (I spent nearly 2 days getting both Fallout 3 and Myst to work on my PC) but this game appears to run like ♥♥♥♥ for no reason whatsoever - I've tried multiple fixes on the internet but nothing has worked.\n\nI paid 15 dollars for this and regret it, because I didn't even get to play the whole damn game.

During every cutscene, the game somehow seems to enter a state where it has to recalculate the entire environment or something. Actually, I don't even care WHAT it does during that time, because after every cutscene, I can bet my ♥♥♥ that I'll be stuck in an infinite loadingscreen, introducing me to another round of "start the game from square one".\nHow to avoid this problem: so far, this problem never occured if I actually skipped a cutscene - but let's be honest here: I'm trying to get into the story of this game, and there is NO way I'm doing that without cutscenes.\nHow to solve the problem when stuck in the screen: Just close the damn game. Just for fun, I've even left the game in a loading screen for a while today, just to see how long it takes to finish up loading. After one hour, I closed the game, because I realized that ♥♥♥♥ would not be progressing.\n\nI do not dislike the game itself, the concept seem fairly decent to me (so far). The problem I do have, is that the game is unplayable for me, which is (obviously) a huge let down - especially since I'm a huge fan of the first part of this series.","March 16","false","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

While this may seems like a minor annoyance, it seems the game devs loved to include this as a side mission, so I have to keep on doing these mission in order to gain perks. I think of them as hard as nails platform level, since if you make one mistake, it doesnt make sense to continue, you may as well just restart. Other than this, the game is epic, just fix this probelm game devs, and ill gladly give this game a thumbs up. (Also, dealing with rockets while trying to climb a building is impossible, if you try to block the missles, you fall, if you get hit, you fall, if u try to avoid them, you can't, leading to an almost impossible game of luck, not skill).\n\nOh and also, can you disable the automatic manuver that happens if heller runs off the edge of a building (he throws himself off sideways). If you hit space 1 milisecond too late, he does this, and I have no clue what this manuver is useful for, when i go off a building, I either want to glide, or fall straight down. This stupid animation, stops heller from gliding for 2 seconds, by which time, you have lost a considerable amount of height, or you have hit the ground. In the side missions when you have to run from package to package, this single animation has made me have to restart a single running mission more than 50 times (it got to the point I started counted my restarts). There is not use for this animation, and all it does it makes a normal challenge into a touch as nails platformer like challenge, which if I wanted that, I would have turned the game onto hard, but im just playing on normal, so can enjoy the game and the story. This animation is almost like Heller deciding to take control rather than the player controlling him and unless it is a cutscene, I should be the one controlling heller.)","February 17, 2015","true","39.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Really, really a hatefull jerk. The daughter and family parts don't match the character you play and seem like they were added last minute to make him more likable, they do not. Seeing that that didn't work the makers of the game apparently decided to make Heller seem less like a collossall deuche, by making all enemies into even bigger ♥♥♥^holes. This i consider a cheap move which ruins any story. This is best shown in Mercer, who is out of nowhere a psychopath. I was most angered by that, as i liked him in P1.

The enviroment was still invulnerable, even when blowing up something huge, and player impact on the city was minimal as the "city control" mechanic had been removed.\n\nThat said the game did improve with more powers, More challenging creatures, and a (if slightly overused story line) good story. In P2 you get to control a pack of infected which is awesome, by the way.\nHowever even after consuming mercer you still dont get access to your own small personal horde, something players loved the idea of.

It has a decent storyline, and some of the challenges are fun..but the best part is just rampaging around. If you are squeamish at all to the smallest amount of blood or death, then turn around and uninstall..this game is not for you. Otherwise I highly recommend this game, but I recommend using a controller to play it as the mouse & keyboard option feels very sloppy. Perhaps it's because I played this for like 50 hours on ps3 and I'm just used to the controller..but that's my opinion.\n\nGraphics are average, with controller movement is easy to get used to and pretty well-done.  This is easily one of the bloodiest & most violent games i've ever played, so be warned. Story is good enough, but fairly predictable and unoriginal. Voice acting is nice, they did good in that aspect (at least for the main characters). Completely open world, minus going into buildings or swimming..or leaving the island (they will just shoot you down with rockets). Several very fun powers, pretty much all melee but powerful..and you can basically fly. You can hijack vehicles including helicopters & powerful tanks.. and use guns that the enemy drops, the only useful one being the rocket launcher, however.  The upgrades you get improve you a huge amount over time and are very satisfying.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but some of the big boss fights are quite memorible.","June 19, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot and characterization is reminescent of recent Michael Bay movies. It's just a hodge podge of nonsenical reasons for you to blow things up, a borderline racist depiction of a black main character, and a peppering super sexualized supporting characters. The dialogue oozes with the maturity of teenage focus group testing and is the kind of thing I may have thought was amazing when I was in middle school. Everything about Prototype 2's story is a vast step backward from Prototype.\n\nDespite all of that, I still had a blast, because the mechanics of the game feel good. They make you feel powerful. Thankfully, there is no pretense of heroism throughout most of Prototype 2, so  you never feel guilty about using and abusing every bipedal meat buffet in your vicinity. It wants you to wreck everything around you, and makes it feel good to do so.\n\nIt's better than the original Prototype because many design concessions have been made for the sake of playability. Rockets are now telegraphed by a laser and a beeping sound you will hear long after you stop playing the game. Upgrades are handled differently and the majority of them are awards for completing side objectives that are surprisingly fun to complete. This means that the collectible component in most free roaming games is actually meaningful in this game.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic experience.","July 16, 2014","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

James Heller who was turned into what's known as an 'Evolved' by Prototype 1's protagonist, Alex Mercer. As you progress through the game, Heller learns of the horrors that Mercer has wished to cause, ultimately having a plan for the whole of humanity with malicious intent.\n\nApart from the story, the game is honestly relatively the same as that of Prototype. The only differences being that Heller has a fifth power known as Tendrils and has the ability to summon Brawlers (a medium-sized infected monster) varying between 2-4 to aid him in combat. The game itself offers only a scant amount of enemy variety from that of the first game,  adding in only four new enemies, Juggernauts, Goliaths, Flyers (can't remember if they have an actual codename or if that is their actual codename, but they're pretty much just infected birds), and Evolved.\n\nWhen Evolved were introduced as an enemy in the game, I myself was personally excited. 'To be fighting against those with similar powers to mine, damn what a refreshing experience!' Unfortunately, I was only like that for the first few Evolved units I fought. After the third one went down, I realized that they all had the same attack pattern, same dodge and attack qte, and generally the same weapon types. There were only a few times where evolved were different, and that was when you encountered Evolved with the Pack Leader and Whipfist abilities, to which you simply beat their face in and consumed them promptly, attaing their respective powers. The fact that they didn't give any extra variety to these guys was staggering, and honestly kinda saddening. I would have loved to have fought off Evolved trying to slice me up to bits with Claws or the Blade power, or dodge out of the way when an Evolved would try to pummle me with Hammerfist. Unfortunately, everyone had little bitty sword hands. It may have been stated at some point that others don't have the ability to maintain advanced forms due to their genetic make-up, but at least give us some different forms of combat.\n\nAside from the bad enemy variety, everything else was alright. The story developed in a good Prototype fashion, there are collectibles and side missions aplenty, and a new perk system that allowed the player to have more variety with how they went about playing their James Heller.\n\nIf you aren't a hardcore Protoype fan but are a fan of hack n slash games, I'd suggest waiting for this game to go on sale for $10 maybe $15. The game offers a decent 10 hour single-player experience (this of course means not collecting everything) and is an alright grab for a low price.\n\n7/10","November 2, 2014","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other than that, it has an even amount of progression and skill based achievements that will keep you engaged.\n\nStory\n\nIt plays like a mini-scifi/horror tv series that is a bit on the raw side with good acting and cut sequences.\n\nCombat\n\nIt is extremely fluid and flexible and will appeal to both digital samurai and button mashers. However, this is NOT the type of game you play with a keyboard and mouse...\n\nGraphics\n\nThey're not the best nor are they the worse - it's a happy medium considering it's a sandbox environment. Load times are near instant on medium systems and there is virtually no FPS choke points that I've encountered despite the hundreds upon hundreds of zombies roaming the city...\n\nOverall, this is one of those weekend warrior games that will keep you entertained and decently challenged for a good 30 hours...That’s if you’re going for 100% completion.\n\nHowever, my only complaint is that you can't reach 100% completion without starting a new game on insane mode and racing through the storyline. I bought the DLC thinking that I could finish things up but alas, the EP gains are null.\n\nSo in other words, buy the dlc for the mini games (which are challenging and fun), but start a 2nd playthrough on insane mode (which inherits everything you've completed in past game modes and only takes a couple of hours) for the extra EP if you want to complete it.","November 4, 2014","true","34.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good story, character building, reaction times, and who doesn't like killing diseased zombies. It's kind of like GTA super villain edition. Where does the character Heller place himself in the midst of vast corruption in the government, corporation, and the rebels? You can explore, drive tanks, fly helicopters, fly (glide), use weapons which are attached and detached with special manouvers.\n\nNow for the Con, and it's a big one... It would seem when they ported the game over to PC, the developers didn't think about memory management. A memory leak!!! The application seems to handle up to a 4gb ram allocation. Anything more and it locks up and abnormally ends. I have 16 gb and really enjoyed Prototype I so this wouldn't stop me. I found you can keep an eye on the physical memory in task manager, displayed on your second monitor. Prior to that threshold (for me it was at 7.1gb (you will need to identify your own as you may have more or less applications running than I do), you can alt+tab out of the game and then go back in. In doing it this way, windows will clean up the memory leaked until it builds up again. It definately adds a challenge.","October 14, 2014","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fixes the few annoying bits of the 1st game (the repetitive base infiltration segments that ended up all feeling the same) and adds even more enjoyable & destructive modes. The story is nearly as good as in the original due to fact while it doesn't have the same crazy twist, you do get to turn the tables on the previous anti-hero and main character of the previous game as Alex Mercer is now the main villain and you end up having a kick-♥♥♥ epic battle against him.\nI also have to say that I'm a bit biased as there are very few games where the main character is black and well-done, and being a black man I'm always looking for more cultural diversity in my games. So it helps that while being a one dimensional-character James Heller is pretty decent as far as characters go. It would have been nice though to have him interact more with his daughter as at times it doesn't feel like she's a big part of his life or the main reason why he's fighting and he can come off as just another really angry black man.\nThe gameplay is akin to that in the first game as you can run up buildings, toss cars, glide across rooftops and from on end of the city to the other as you become more powerful and run at such speeds through the streets of NYC that the ground cracks under your feet and you feel that sense of mass and speed as you collide with NPCs and other elements in the environment and send them flying! Being a superhero (cause face it, that's basically what you are) rarely ever felt this good :D\nThe combat is also a lot of fun as your various virus-related abilities make you feel increasingly powerful and badass and you can carve (literally lol!) a path of utter destruction through your enemies and the city of NY. It's a joy to experiment with your increasing array of lethal abilities and learning what works best against which enemy and being able to weaponize grenade launchers and other weaponry that you literally rip from vehicles is a blast xD\n\n8.75/10","August 7, 2012","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed the first one also. I think this is one definitely the better one. The combat is improved 100% by the new shield ability. It’s great fun open world superpower action. The story is interesting enough to keep your attention. The enemies are varied and all fun to fight.\nIt is a console port but personally I think it is quite a good one, with one exception. The game has a really bad memory leak with a constantly increased amount of memory being used. This is simply fixed by alt-tabbing out of the game every 20 min or so.\nOverall I would recommend to nearly anyone, especially if you played the first prototype.","March 29, 2013","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story gets better, more insanity and badass. Combat system feels alot closer to something like the batman games which I thought was a better combat system compared to P1. Upgrades are received via challenges and missions instead of XP like P1. I got P1 & P2 + DLC from amazon for like $7.50 a few months ago, great deal for great games.","May 11, 2013","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, the same can't be said about the actual port itself however, as visuals can be described as unimpressive at best and ,even worse, the framerate is inconsistent and inexcusably low. The game took me 15hrs on hard with all side objectives done. There is a freeroam mode after the ending and also an NG+ & a higher difficulty unlock. Heller takes time to reach his lvl cap + there are random permanent power up boosts that you may miss by accident (the power up target dies, etc), so a 2nd playthrough is pretty much guaranteed if you want to 100% the game. There isn't much mission variety but thankfully playing as a walking apocalypse never gets old. The story isn't particularly great but it's enough to make you want to progress further. All in all it's worth a look.","September 1, 2012","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story has been made a bit more coherent, and while it leaves less puzzles for the player to figure out himself/herself, it makes for an overall nicer storyline. The graphics are top notch, a lot of the movement has been improved, and well, the gore and splatter is more plentiful than ever. Definetly worth the playthrough.","July 28, 2012","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The power you will have over the game is so damn powerfull. You fly,smash,consume like no other anti-hero.\n\nThey improved a lot of the original prototype. Graphics are not ♥♥♥♥♥ the best but it still looks good on pc. Don't take the story serieus just have fun and go baller on everything that's this game motto.","February 1, 2013","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Does not have the replay value of something like Batman: Arkham City.  Requires the DLC to get enough playtime, though.

It has far exceeded all of my expectations and I've only played for one day. I look forward to progressing. [So this is not a full review of course]\n\nThe movement is so fluid, yet forceful. I look forward to many, many hours of playing this. The plot is interesting so far. I don't think missing the first Prototype is a problem.\n\nI highly recommend this unique release. It is very similar to the movement in Assassins Creed, but Prototype 2 is more powerful and faster. There’s more to the game than combat, though, they guy has a few  less destructive powers that seem to play a significant role in the game.\n\n","December 30, 2013","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game basically tells you approximately where each collectible item is, so you don't have to search the net or spend forever hunting them. The combat is simple and enjoyable.\n\nThe story is boring and the dialogue is awful.\n\nI didn't bother trying the game with Keyboard & Mouse, I just figured it'd be best with a controller... as these sorts of games tend to be.","September 15, 2013","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, that's all you do, but it's better than nothing. Glitches could be anywhere (for example, a Blackwatch soldier decided to shoot his own commander, then proceed to start humping a tank), but could be funnier than Krusty the Klown from the Simpsons. 9/10 Story, 10/10 Weapon variety, 10/10 graphics, Infinite/10 glitch hilarity (please never fix those), and finally, 7/10 enemy variety.
