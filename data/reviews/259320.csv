I thought it would be more like Desert Strike on the SNES/PS.  Controls and gameplay were not very enjoyable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/259320/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","This is easily one of the saddest games I've ever played.  Not sad as in "gripping story", sad as in "they actually thought this would make money, bless their little hearts". Nearly everything about this game is done poorly, from the interface to the controls to the effects to the voice acting (ESPECIALLY the voice acting).\n\nThe game's plot, such as it is, is delivered via laughably bad translated text, spoken haltingly by the single voice actor for the game.  There is at least justification for each mission, but truth be told the game would be better off if there WASN'T.  The plot is so thin it may as well not be there, and frankly is embarassingly crappy.\n\nSpeaking of that voice acting, the one person they got to do voice work for the game either has no acting talent, a poor grasp of the english language, is 12, or all three.  In addition to the pre-mission text, the same actor also shouts out random "taunts" and "reactions" as you play.  I put those in quotes because they are all delivered with all the emotion of a plank of wood.  Not only that, the random barks are translated just as badly as the main text, leaving us with taunts like "take that terrorist dog".  There's very little variety, and the taunts/reactions happen frequently, so get used to hearing "see you later alligator" delivered by a heavily tranquilized teenage mental patient a million times.\n\nAs for actual gameplay, it's pretty bad.  Your main weapons is your basic gattling gun, though it seems to cut out randomly; I'm unsure if its because of poor control implementation or some sort of overheat system that isn't displayed on screen.  You have two banks of missiles you can choose from, but they do barely any more damage than the gattling guns, and the difference between the two is not obvious and is definitely not explained.  In fact very little in this game is explained other than "shoot things and sometimes it extends your time".  Random pickups float in the world, corresponding to mechanics that you can only guess at based on their icons.  Picking up these items results in bright, flashy effects that signify seemingly nothing, and half the time you can't even pick them up for reasons which (again) aren't explained.  You weapons do a varying amount of damage, seemingly at random, sometimes mowing down enemies in quick succession, sometimes taking 2-5 seconds just to take down a basic grunt.  Targeting is entirely automatic and picks up far too slowly, leaving you with no way to dumbfire at enemies you know will be coming from the top of the screen.\n\nBeyond the gameplay though, the rest of the game is pretty annoying too.  The menu screen is a constantly revolving and zooming view of a helicopter, set at a speed juuuuuust fast enough to make you slighty queasy.  The configuration options are confusing, using non-standard button names for gamepads, particularly 360/XBO controllers which should have native Windows support, though to be fair the options are rather detailed within that.  The biggest problem though is that you are required to enter your serial key for the game literally every time you start it, and sometimes randomly when you back out of a sub-menu.  On my first launch I started the game, entered the serial key, configured my control options, then was prompted to enter my serial key AGAIN.  Oh, and as a bonus, it refused to accept my serial key the second time.  I wound up having to restart the game entirely.\n\nIn short, Heli Heroes is a hot mess. There's some basic enjoyment to be found under there, but the overall system is too clunky and confusing to make that an easy task.  You may need to consume a great quantity of alcohol to find this game not annoying, and even then who knows.  Quite honestly you will find a more robust and rewarding helicopter game in something like Tiger-Heli for the original NES, because at least that has consistent controls, reliable gameplay, and no repeated requests for a serial key.  Do not waste your money or time on this game.","March 15, 2015","false","0.4"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","28","37","6","0"

I'm pretty forgiving of this genre, but this one has some flaws that annoyed the crap out of me.  It has terrible overused one-liners and non-intuitive level navigation.  I'm ok with one-liners, but when you have one for EVERY single defeated enemy, and random map desstructible, then it gets really old.  Especially when you light up a grove of trees, and then you hear, "Die terrorists!" and 9 other equally engrossing one liners. Even some of the training levels were tough to navigate.  One such level required that you defeat all enemies, but took me about 30 minutes of trial and error to reach some obscure corner to destroy some benign weapons cache to win.  Overall, the graphics are decent, but gameplay has some flaws.  If they fixed these quirks I'd say it still remains a mediocre shooter.","December 28, 2013","false","0.5"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","4"

It looked decent enough and it was only a couple of bucks (I bought it on sale, by the way). What I got was a rather clunky experience that I only enjoyed with a friend, but not alone. I'll list out my problems below:\n\nControls: For the most part, the controls responded to my inputs. For some reason, my controls gave out on the third tutorial. It seems as though control of your helicopter freaks out sporadically. However, those times are few and far between, so the controls are alright at best in my opinion.\n\nGame Play: Lackluster. There is no real sense of where you're supposed to aim at the enemies and overall it seems like the one thing I look for in a game, bores me to death. Also, the helicopters you get to chooses from don't even feel different in the slightest.\n\nPowerups: I add this because when an arcade game comes along, there is bound to be powerups found. However, most of the time, I don't know what they do. Some are self-explanitory, but other don't make any sense. If there was a system that told me or at least some kind of instruction, I would be fine with it.\n\nVoice Acting: This is one part of the game I like solely for the reason it sounds like early PS1 english voice dubbing.\n\nSoundtrack: Forgettable. Sometimes non-exsistent.\n\n3/10. This game is a lackluster experience unless you have a friend along. If this was a comepletely single-player experience, it would score lower. All in all, do NOT buy this game.","April 28, 2014","false","1.4"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","0"

That's Heli Heros. It's using 3D graphics, but there's no 3rd dimension in gameplay... you move left/right and a little forward/back. Moving forward increases forward speed, while pulling back gives you more time to shoot forward. You have cannon and "weapon", and you can choose which weapon to shoot via the other buttons. Controller is supported but remapping is limited as I can't map, say, "right trigger" to be cannon, only buttons (XYAB). You probably won't even have time to switch weapons, and some levels have time limits where you get extra fuel for shooting enemies and structures (hah!) if you want a simple arcade game, this is not bad, but you probably should be playing Spartan Assault instead.

It seemed to be in the style of old classics like "Desert Storm" for the Amiga. But even that game had a better handling 20 years ago than Heli Heroes. The controls are bad, the camera is shaky and tends to fade out completely. The action is lackluster, the aiming isn't good and there just Isn't much to do overall. Yes, I only played the game 20 minutes, but believe me, those 20 minutes are enough to make up your mind.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/259320/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Heli Heroes is a budget title from early 2000s and a vertical shump at that. It doesn't seem to be much, but genres like this one were already viewed as a thing of a past by that time. I could easily mistake it for a Shareware game, expect it isn't.\n\nAs it's quite an old game, how does it work? Well... one thing for sure is that it works. You can configure the game, where you can set a resolution. But while you can choose widescreen resolution out of a list, a game wasn't designed for this. What it will do is to cut a portion of screen above and below, so in order to see whole intented game screen, you should set resolution to 4:3 one!\nYou also can't change controls, and seeing how it uses Shift and Ctrl, you better be careful at button mashing it, unless you want curious Windows to interrupt you. Just hold it carefully.\nAnd yes, the pleasent thing of having to enter your key and of having score leaderboards not work anymore.\n\nAt the main menu you can choose whetever you want to Start Game or want do Competition. Competition is like a classic arcade game, or like endurance, or survival... Anyway, you have to play from first mission without continues and saving of sorts, and your score will be written down in highscore leaderboard where you compete with other players for better score if forget that it doesn't work anymore.\nOtherwise, you head into simple Start Game, where you can choose mission and difficulty, the missions being unlocked progressively. And you can choose between two helicopters, first one having guy as voice and has more damaging chaingun, while second has female as pilot and has more armor. You probably should go with first one, but then again, you will spam rockets a lot more. Male voice is also more tolerable, and characters speak a lot in this game, somewhat cool and somewhat annoyingly. Yelling to find ejection button upon single hit and saying "take that you terrorist dog" upon shooting down a tree.\nAnd then there is a two-player cooperative mode. But it's a local thing only, hope you got a friend who doesn't mind trying games like this. Didn't get to try it myself. But you can also easily control two players in same time on keyboard, if you want to try something new for fun.\n\nThe story is quite simple. You are American. And then there is America's dream enemy, the terroristical group Revolution Now. NOW!! Which has both arabian and russian roots, as well as a bit of alien.\nOn good side, that means that you will travel through stereotypical deserts and snowy areas too, and I must say, 2000 year lighting looks jolly on the nighty Siberia levels. And yes, it's one of better moments in game, while you listen to the better music out of a very small selection that game has.\n\nSo yes, gameplay is your military vertical shooter, not Desert Strike genre, no. It doesn't go too crazy, so it's more simple, just flying forward, sometimes getting to choose direction, shooting down things that shoot back at you and collecting powerups, with only one of them being a negative one (turns screen upside down). Most often you have to do additional mission, that is to destroy something or amount of something. In those cases the direction will loop you around the place. There even once was a single mission in which you had to search for a president from a downed airplane, in which you had to choose what turn to take every few seconds or so, but that's a single case.\nOtherwise, you shoot, you make things explode. You collect power-ups to level up your minigun, which you shouldn't use continiously, as it heats up and starts to shoot slower. And you collect all kinds of rockets, whetever lasers or big nuclear bomb, which is hard not to take damage from, and spam it on everything as well.\n\nOh, and then there are boss battles. You are going to chase some kind of tough airship, which will stay on top of a screen, shooting back at you. It seems to be pretty fine and all tough and great, until you realize one silly thing. Upon getting hit, they activate a one-second or so shield. Thus if you keep on spamming chaingun AND rockets, you will get nowhere. Using strong rockets every few seconds on other hand will give you a victory in each boss encounter quickly, maybe too quickly. Weird concept.\n\nSo yes. It's not horrible. It's a small budget game from 2000s. Doesn't bring anything new, does no horrible wrong, gives you action and explosion. Not something I can recommend to anybody, it's still something you can skip on. But it's good enough for what it is.\nSure not as bad as Steam reviews made me belive.\n\nOh yes, and the non-stop vertical movement in this game will do a weird thing on your eyes. After stopping the game, my eyes kept on moving image vertically slightly for a minute or so.

Obviously, this slumlord publisher doesn't even believe it when you enter the registration code you get when you bought the game!\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really did, but this piece of "Topware garbage" (ok, that's redundant) just won't let me! My first and biggest red flag should have been it was from Topware, a company which should change its name to something more appropriate, like "Crapware", "Shovelware", or "Nagware".\n\nOnce the game started (after the DX installs), the first thing I was presented with was the serial code registration screen. Upon entering the serial code, I promptly went to the "Options" area to check / change whatever, and upon backing out to what should have been the main screen, I was once again presented with the registration screen. Upon entering the code AGAIN, I then exited the game, thinking that perhaps shutting it down would save the registration code...\n\nHOW WRONG I WAS!\n\nAfter starting the game back up, I was finally greeted with a proper title screen & menu. I decided to begin the tutorial in order to find out the specifics of this game which I thought would be a nice homage to the scrolling shooters of old (Choplifter, Raiden, Sky Soldiers, Dodonpachi, etc...). Once the mission started, I was instructed to move from A to B and shoot targets for extra points. This is when I found out the only thing on my XBOX 360 wired controller the game recognized was my joystick, so I spent the entirety of the mission moving around on-screen, collecting power-ups / ammo, targeting things, and not able to shoot them. Once I "completed" the first tutorial mission, I decided to exit back to the title screen so I could check my control configuration...\n\nAND ONCE AGAIN GOT THE REGISTRATION CODE ENTRY SCREEN!\n\nIt is at this point I gave up and rejoice that I only spent a buck or so on this lesson in terrible coding and Topware "quality".\n\nDon't buy this.

It gave me a flashback of old classic top-down scrollers that I used to play with my friends as a kid. And this game seemed to have 3D graphics instead of bitmaps -- which in some cases does work out.\n\nWith anticipation rising I launched the game, checked the controls and started my flight. The pad controls felt suitable and the chopper felt to respond rather well. First target in sight! Fire! ... "Die, you terrorist dog!" ... WTF? Okay, so the ammo automatically hits the target if you are remotely aiming towards it, I can live with that. And I could even live with below mediocre level design and cloggy textures and below average sound effects. But I cannot tolerate those darn pilot comments every time a target is taken out or you are getting hit! Sure, there's a variety in those but that's pretty much all you hear along side with poorly suiting sound track.\n\nFour training missions was enough for me. There are better games to spend your time with than this. There is a 2 player co-op but I rather have a friend join me for a game of Rayman than Heli Heroes.
