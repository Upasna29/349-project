This junk from the now hollow Infinity Ward runs smooth on consoles that are 8 years old but has FPS dips, stutter, freezes on high end PC gaming machines. A complete downgrade from Black Ops 2 which was clearly optimized for PC and had PC centric featueres like FOV slider, shadow resolution, DEDICATED SERVERS etc. This seems to be running off of some XBOX emulator, because the performance/visuals ratio is laughable, I cannot believe this ever got through QA testing.\n\nPeople turn everything to low or off just to maintain an acceptable framerate on this garbage, are you kidding me? My rig has twice the performance of last gen and next gen consoles and yet you tell me I should accept the fact that my FPS drops to half when I look through a freaking scope!?\n\nAnd to add insult to injury the so called PC features are half ♥♥♥♥♥ and absent, the textures are so pathetic that you can't actually believe the game takes up 30+ GB on the harddrive, yet the game pulls all of your vRAM for some odd reason, the game looks worse than Battlefield Bad Company 2 a 4 year old game but needs three times the hardware to perform the same. A group of trained monkeys could have done a better job porting it to PC.\n\nOverall a complete waste of money and a complete joke. The hacking in this game has been of massive proportions and when IW could see that their anticheat meassueremnts were a joke, they went and enabled VAC, but not until the PC population playing  was reduced to a GHOST town (pun intended). IW is dead and most of the talent left the studio, no one should expect anything from these clowns ever again.\n\nMy rig:\n\nIntel i5 3570 @ 3.4 (3.8 Ghz in turbo mode)\nGeforce GTX 680 2 GB GDDR5\n8 GB 1600Mhz DDR3 RAM\nWindows 8.1 Pro x64\nASUS P8H77-M MOBO\nCorsair HX750W PSU","November 25, 2013","false","9.3"," 6,011 of 7,014 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","011","7","0","198"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/recommended/209160/","linusolsson","Z0mBi3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/","2548 products in account","I have always enjoyed Call of Duty. I know most people won't agree with me, but I really like the previous ones. Easy, fast-paced action that were fun and addictive. However, the latest installment, Ghost, is a disaster.\n\nThe "new engine" is actually just a modded version of the old quake engine, and that is far from next gen. Ghost is laggy in multiplayer, even though I have strong internet connection (100mbit/s) and a computer that can handle most new games on high/ultra settings. You can't change your FOV (field of view), which is stupid. Audio settings is also very poor and I can't mix them as I want. Ghost required a stupid amount (6gb) of RAM at lanch to even run the game, for no apparent reason. That has however been reduced to 4gb now.The game looks awful and still doesn't run well, which is a serious problem.\n\nThe new maps in multiplayer are a lot bigger then usual. It seems like they have stolen a lot of ideas from Battlefield 3 here. However, the engine isn't made for these big maps, so It runs with quite poor FPS. The bigger maps is also boring, and it's not what Call of Duty is suppose to be. It should be close combat fights, with fun weapons and killstreaks. It's suppose to be a unrealistic but funny shooter. The opposite of Battlefield.\n\nThe game is laggy even in the main menu. It's like they haven't even tested the PC version before lanch. Lazy, greedy, moneygrabbing developers, fake advertising and promises is why this game deserves my fail of the year-award.\n\nThey haven't put much time into optimizing the game properly for PC, and that is not acceptable for a big studio like Infinity Ward. Instead of buying this buggy,boring and unfinished mess, go pick up Battlefield, CS:GO, or Call of Duty-Black Ops Instead.","March 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 526 of 587 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","526","587","0","38"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/209160/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","Call of Duty has been one of, if not the most well known franchise in gaming this past generation and last. The franchise has been in decline quality wise after the release of Modern Warfare - excluding maybe Black Ops 2 - which leads to the release of one of the weakest entries (Both Single Player and Multi Player) in the franchise yet. From the get go, you'll notice this game was built by Infinity Ward on the grounds of pure arrogance. This game is the very definition of "Bare minimum".\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts stars a few protagonists, main one being Logan Walker - and the world they live in after a devastating Orbital Strike after a space station was hijacked. The story follows a special assault squad that go by the name of "Ghosts" and the brother's entry to said Squad as they fight to take control of the US again.\n\nSafe to say that while I did enjoy the campaign, the game is still very, very bare bones in EVERY area possible. The campaign will run you up to around 4 hours - maybe less if you're more skilled. There is much less variation in this game than in previous Call of Duty titles and the story is kind of... silly.\n\nThe visuals are pretty standard Call of Duty, looks worse in some areas than other games - namely environments. Ground and wall textures often look very muddy and really contrast against the character models. There is a large degree of inconsistency with textures all across the game which makes the game look visibly worse than even Black Ops 2 - arguably though, it has better effects, like smoke particles and such. One thing I also have to mention is how lazy the character models are. I've noticed certain colors in textures, or maybe the meshes themselves maybe (?) that are "invisible" [Note: This is a detail that only those with knowledge with how 3D modeling/texturing work will notice and know what it means.] and you can see the background through the meshes, this is pretty common on the hands or in certain cutscenes on their faces.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=211288916\n\nSound is pretty decent though. There are a few decent tracks across the game that are pretty good, but are all ultimately forgetable. Guns sound pretty good too, at the very least. Weapons in Call of Duty titles have always had pretty good soundwork dedicated to them and this game is no exception, even if the soundwork is definately re used from previous games. The menu sounds are also recycled STILL from the older Modern Warfare titles, and this is pretty displeasing by now, it feels lazy. Voice acting is generally pretty decent all around as well, as far as military speak goes I suppose.\n\nGameplay is still the exact same old Call of Duty you've been sick of for years now. It has the exact same controls, the exact same annoying Sprint cuts (Lets you run for a second until it cuts, then forces you to repeatedly hit the Sprint key for short bursts), the exact same annoying grenade mechanics (Still has the "Run until the market on the screen diseappears or throwback) , the exact same stupid recoil inconsistency on weapons, the exact same scripted campaign sections (Press "Key" to do this or that instead of doing it yourself) and the exact same plot twists to boot. You can play as the dog, Riley - whom your control in First Person view as you go sneaking about in tall grass, you then hit a key and Riley will instantly kill an enemy.   You also play as an Attack Chopper later on in the game, but it feels like you're controling a dude on a jetpack because it handles pretty linearly and you pretty much just hold down a key to get lock ons and release to kill them on sight, or shoot em all up - occasionally use Flares to divert missiles from hitting you and that's about it and then later on in the game, you get to control a tank, which feels like a very lightweight version of the same Tank mechanics you can find in Battlefield 3, you hit a button to shoot a missile (lock on as well) and another to use the rail gun. Other than these, the gameplay is still pretty much just run down a corridor shooting every guy on sight so you can advance to the next - it's enjoyable, but ultimately nothing worth replaying. There ARE Intel collectibles - same as past Modern Warfare titles that go by the name of Rorke Files, but they really aren't worth going after.\n\nAn extra mode they made - called Extinction - is ultimately one of the silliest things they have done to date. It's a less glorified version of Black Ops' Zombie mode sporting only 1 stage and being reduced to a wave based shooter as you destroy alien stuff across the map. It's a fun mode the first two or three times you play it, but because it's only 1 map (yes just 1 map)  there's not much to do after you beat it once. You basically have one player carry a drill around and work with it (it breaks down at times) while they fend off a horde of incoming aliens, as you progress further in the map the aliens start getting bigger and badder. It's pretty much a glorified horde mode, except it only has 1 map.\n\nAll in all though, this is - by far the WEAKEST modern Call of Duty title they have ever released. Previously, I would have said Modern Warfare 3 was the most laughable title they had released, until I played this one. Sporting a very short campaign, highly inconsistant texture work, re used assets down the toilet, a laughable story, a 1-map extra mode (Seriously??), and NOTHING new added to the base game mechanics - this ends up being the most obvious of all lazy works and servers at pure arrogance by part of Activision at chiming in a once great franchise.\n\nNOTE: This review only covers Single Player and Extinction mode.\n\nPros\n+ Great smoke and particle effects\n+ Good Voice Acting\n\nCons\n- Re-Used Gameplay Mechanics\n- Re-Used Sound Effects\n- Texture Inconsistency\n- Very scripted and linear campaign\n- Next to no variation\n- Short Campaign with a laughable story\n- Collectibles serve little purpose\n- Mediocre not fleshed out characters\n- Extinction mode only has 1 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map\n\nPC Port Notes: To get the best visual quality on this game - be sure to have Screen Quality on Extra - anything below looks like it's rendered in sub 720p and be sure to do this BEFORE you actually start the game as ANYTIME you change ANY setting in game - it will force you to watch that stage's LOOONG intro video again everytime you want to change any setting in the Video Options.","January 31, 2014","false","9.1"," 371 of 412 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","371","412","0","17"

I didn't expect the story to be as bad as it turned out though…. “Generic” is the perfect word to describe it. The characters in particular were boring and completely cliché. Most of the “important events” I saw coming a mile off so they failed to shock me or feel any form of emotion whatsoever.\n\nThe second issue was the overall performance of the game. I cannot believe that Infinity Ward released something so buggy and so broken. There are numerous issues on my system despite being more than capable of running the game on max. The sound regularly distorts into a crackly mess and game lags up every once in a while. To top it all off it Ghosts sometimes COMPLETELY freezes my PC forcing me to restart the whole system. These issues alone made me hate the game.\n\nThere were other issues that annoyed me. Who the hell designed the sounds for the weapons? They were absolutely terrible. Every time I pulled the trigger (regardless of which gun) it sounded like I was at a construction site rather than a battlefield. I will add that the overall quality of the SFX was below the standard of the previous games. That was so obvious it made me cringe.\n\nI’m used to short campaigns from the Call of Duty games, but Ghosts was ridiculously short. The only reason it took me 10+ hours was because I was playing on Veteran difficulty where I was often instantly killed by the AI and their godlike aim. This only made it more annoying than challenging. Each mission (if you could call them missions) lasted around 8 minutes in length. They were over before they had even begun really.\n\nI was just so disappointed with CoD Ghosts that I can’t even find anything that I did enjoy about the game. I have refused to even attempt to play the multiplayer and the extinction mode may salvage something, but I don’t know if I have the will to find out. I expected a worse experience than the Modern Warfare games, but I did expect it to beat the Black Ops series. This is by far the worst CoD game to date so avoid it at all costs. Trust me, it just isn't worth it.\n","May 5, 2014","false","9.1"," 439 of 503 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","439","503","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmaguiar/recommended/209160/","prmaguiar","Shiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmaguiar/","1410 products in account","Well, here we are again: another year, another Call of Duty, as the saying goes.\n\nThis franchise has grown incredibly stale in the past five years or so. Infinity Ward has stuck to the same formula since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and as a result, almost everything in Ghosts feels dated and unimaginative.\n\nNot that some widely acclaimed aspects of said formula needed any change. For instance, the core gameplay mechanics, such as the shooting itself, still feel slick and polished.\n\nBut how do you justify a 50-gigabyte installation size and the “next-gen” marketing this game received, when it looks barely nicer than stuff that was released in 2007? It’s not an ugly-looking game, sure, and the textures do look pretty good, despite what some people may say. But comparisons with Battlefield 4, Metro: Last Light and other recent titles are inevitable, and the fact remains that everything else in Ghosts, graphics-wise (lighting, particle effects, physics, etc.), is subpar.\n\nI am not one to judge a game solely on its graphical fidelity, however. The problem with Ghosts is that, sans the welcome addition of the ability to practice against bots, it has no redeeming qualities to speak of.\n\nThe single-player campaign is short, cliché-ridden and does not give the player any freedom. You just follow scripted orders from your “A.I.” companions, moving forward when told to and shooting enemies that pop out of hiding (when told to). It doesn’t help that the story is entirely predictable and that the voice-acting is abysmal (and since we're on the subject of audio, what can I say about the game's single, useless "master volume" slider in the settings menu?).\n\nBut most people seem to buy Call of Duty games for its multiplayer portion. And it too is a colossal failure. Maps are poorly designed and don’t support more than 18 players (most matches have 12 or less players). The matchmaking system is terrible: teams are completely unbalanced more often than not. There are no dedicated servers, despite Mark Rubin’s (Infinity Ward’s Executive Producer) promises prior to the game’s release. Teamwork is non-existent, as people just run in circles and shoot each other in the back to get the best possible kill-to-death ratio and unlock ridiculous, balance-breaking “killstreak” bonuses.\n\nThen there is the fact that once again, Activision will charge a good deal of money for upcoming map-packs, since not only is modding unsupported, but frowned upon.\n\nThe "new" Extinction Mode is not even worth discussing. It is basically an uninspired rehash of Treyarch's far superior "Zombies" horde-mode (from World at War and the Black Ops series).\n\nTo top it all, Ghosts suffers from a myriad of technical issues, such as glitches, crashes and framerate drops. And as a sign of Infinity Ward's everlasting "love" for the PC audience, there is no field-of-view slider of any kind, and a single slider for audio. Individual sliders for music, sound effects and voice communication would be too much to ask, apparently.\n\nThe bottom line: don’t buy it.\n\nUPDATE (07/31/2014): I should add that, at this point (almost a year after release), the game has become nothing but a glorified DLC-selling platform, and there's effectively nothing to differentiate it from the dozens of low-quality free-to-play games on the market... except for, you know, the full entry price.","November 25, 2013","false","6.4"," 3,713 of 4,731 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","713","4","0","65"

These are the reasons:\n\n1. Worst netcode by date. The faster the connection, the more the delay. People with slow connection apear on your screen with seconds of delay and the most annoying thing is, they do get hitmarkers on you instantly, even if you don't really see them.\n2.Bad FPS. It's completeley random honestly, but 2/3 of the hardware gets unplayable FPS, so far GTX 560 Ti and radeon hd 7770 seem to work the best for this game. Considering my PC handles Battlefield 4 with stable 65fps on Ultra, do you think it's logical that i get 20fps at max on such outdated engine with old 1998 textures and 800x600 resolution?\n3.Hackers. This is literaly the most hacked CoD game by date. Literaly a world record. Considering that I've been an admin for 2 years, I can perfectly recognise a hacker, not to mention these hackers don't even hide the hacks, they directly jump with their agressive aimbot and godmode + all perks.\n4.Mouse input delay. Have a good aim? Good luck with mouse delay ;)\n5.Worst matchmaking by date. 20k players and it takes ~5 minutes to find any game under 800 ping even though there are suposedley dedicated servers. To add to that, if you're from europe, 2/3 of the times it will matchmake you with russians/americans and vice-versa.\n6.Overpriced. Not even worth 1/3 of the current price.\n7. Poor anticheat and report system. This literaly does nothing.\n8. No VAC.\n9. No staff which takes care for hackers like in Black Ops 2.\n\nOn the other side, gameplay is pretty fun, big maps, good weapon + killstreak balance overall. Honestly if there were no matchmaking issues, hacker issues and FPS issues, this could have been the best CoD ever made.\n\nDo not buy this game. Wait 'till it gets hacked and dedicated servers get available or hope for actual clientside ones to be available in the approximate 2 years :)\nALRIGHTY GUYS, 2 YEARS HAVE PASSED AND THIS HAS NOT CHANGED SOOO....","December 5, 2013","false","0.6"," 739 of 929 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","739","929","0","53"

Don't buy this game. It's just so freaking bad, it's hilarious.\n\nIt's not the same story that was with MW3, it being a re-skin copy+paste of MW2, they actually made some new "innovations" (if you can call them like that) and changes in this game, like... dogs. On second thought, there really isn't much new here.\n\nThough, that being said, they took out way more things than they added. Forget theater, forget treyarch's amazing and actually innovative Pick-10 system, forget in-game livestreaming or League. That's all tossed in the trash.\n\nOh, and let's not even begin about the state of this game on PC. It's a joke, IW are literally saying "♥♥♥♥ you" to every single PC player. No FOV slider, no dedicated servers, framerate capped at 90 fps (the actual ♥♥♥♥?) and the fact this game lags, freezes, stutters, drops fps even on beast PC gaming rigs. It's just sad. And if you saw them say "we are working with Nvidia to make the game look better" yeah.. that's also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, Treyarch's last years Black Ops 2 looked better.\n\nAnyway, please don't buy this, get Black Ops 2 instead or Battlefield 4 and play a good, well optimised and good looking PC games instead of this ♥♥♥♥.","November 26, 2013","false","2.2"," 419 of 515 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","419","515","0","25"

I think a mass class action lawsuit for failure to produce something worthy of a fraction of the money people had to pay just to play it let alone the cost of the game is in order. the grafics are jenky and the fps drops are the worst I have ever seen in my, short, 4 yrs of online (fps multi-player) gaming. It takes forever to find a game regardless the number of people in that mode (normally very low numbers in pc version). Aimbots are all over this game and don't try and hide it. I still see these people often so my guess is there is no policing of the game. The maps are garbage from a run-n-gun perspective. The maps are really catered towards the campers. Very buggy and glitchy over all. I think it may be time to look into another franchise as this one is an epic failure at this point. Fix the game and give us our dedicated servers with mod tools back and I may change my mind. Until then, COD is not something I would recomend to anyone.

It does not look that much better than Black Ops 2 did, but demands way more juice from your system than that.\n\nTo also compare it to other video-games: Battlefield 4, the 'other' big shooter of last year which direclty competed with Ghosts, runs at maximum settings and 1080p with always above 60 FPS for most new machines. If you take the same rig for a spin on Ghosts you actually have to tone down the graphics a notch to get into CoD-playable regions, since CoD also - always - had strong disadvantages if your FPS is all over the place and not at a rock solid 60+. Things like mouse-lag, input-lag in general and even rounding-errors (your guns fire faster/slower depending on what FPS you run at). Meanwhile it looks vastly inferiour to the direct competitor.\n\nSo yeah, that's a no. Don't waste your money on this.

Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).\n\n2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.\n\n3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.\n\n4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.\n\n5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.\n\n6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired.","December 30, 2014","false","22.6"," 236 of 324 people (73%) found this review helpful 272 people found this review funny","73","236","324","272","9"

This is the worst CoD to date.  My experience has been nothing but continuous crashing and lagging. The patch helped a little bit but the damage was already done.  Launch day there were 35K people playing this game. Now most nights only 4K people will be on. Most of the new game type lobbies are empty and no one to play with, like Hunted.\n\nRemoving the most beloved objective game modes from the game was just plain dumb. I blame Mark Rubin for creating a mess of a game. Where are the dedicated servers? Oh there arent any, they are hybrid servers supposedly but still P2P. Which means  if you have a SSD, you will more than likely be host and get shot up by those who are lagging before you see them.\n\nThe leveling system is ridiculous, YOU DONT EVEN HAVE TO PLAY MP to get tokens to buy all the best weapons and perks. Simply play some Squad matches and get the tokens you need to get your Character the best weapons, perks, and attachements before even playing online versus. The leveling system should have been kept seperate from Squads and MP.\n\nThe amount of hackers playing the game killed it entirely. I have given this game enough chance to know it is ruined. I do enjoy the map sizes. The maps are really incredible but the color palette  sucks.\n\nOne last note. NVIDIA Geforce Experience says I can play this game on the highest settings. COD tells me to set everything to the lowest settings. This tells you there is some very poor optimization for this  game to run on PC.\n\nI give this game 2/10","November 25, 2013","false","1.9"," 107 of 135 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","107","135","0","0"

Non stop stuttering and frame drops. The low field of view is appauling. I tried the FoV changer, but it doesn't sort it when you zoom in/aim down sights.. it just puts you back to 65 FoV which is nauseating. I'm convinced that Infinity Ward purposely leave out a field of view slider for PC because of the lazy and unfinished animations. At the beginning of the campaign with 90 FoV using AgentRev's fix, you can see your hands on the bottom of the screen, but more arms pop out of the side during cut scene events with the other hands still present. The same happened in MW3 MP. When increasing the field of view, you could see dodgy reload animations or while sprinting, some guns would look messed up.\n\n\n\nWhen IW make a Call of Duty game.

Please also bare in mind that this review is purely and solely based on the single player side of the game - I will touch on the multiplayer side but only briefly.\n\nCall of Duty: Ghost is the tenth game in the COD series, and was released in 2013 on PC, PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U, and then re-released on launch of PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nThis was my first COD game that I had played in a while, so the problems people have had with the gameplay becoming stale and lack of innovation didn't effect me so much. Yes the gameplay is very much the same as all of the other Call of Duty games, however I still had fun whilst playing it. I have yet to play the multiplayer, and to be honest, I probably won't. The single player campaign follows the character of Logan Walker. You also play as Baker, Elias Walker (your father) and a new addition of playing as a combat dog, Riley.  There are no new elements to be seen in the gameplay, its very "Call of Duty", aim and shoot is pretty much the whole game with the odd quick time event thrown in. There are some really interesting levels when you are in space and underwater, however my favorite levels were the vehicle based ones; where you take control over tanks and helicopters - they add a little something extra to the game in my opinion, breaking up the monotony of the classic ground troop fights.\n\nGraphically, Ghosts is very dated; I was playing on 4K resolution, and it still looked very poor. Textures when close up are so low res it's hard to imagine this is a game which was released in 2013. The game uses an engine which was used in previous COD releases, but with apparent "significant upgrades", however I don't really see a difference in graphic fidelity in Ghosts and any of the other "recent" COD games.\n\nGhost had a story which kept me interested right until the end, however I felt that the game's ending really did not do the game any justice. I really felt like I was getting a big two fingers up to me when it happened. Not sure whether people will class it as a spoiler, but the cliffhanger at the end really relies on there being a sequel in the Ghost franchise, however unlikely that will be. Up until the end though, it is a compelling story - maybe if you quit just before the end credits you'll enjoy it more!\n\nThis is another game where you will not die or fail on the single player mode; you are with a squad of other characters for the majority of the game; and you could very easily just sit back and watch the fire fights if you were so inclined and you would still not fail. Even when playing on higher difficulties, there is no real ramp in the challenges on show.\n\nWith the games extremely linear level design, it leaves you very little time to explore the world in front of you, that being said, there is no reason to want to either though. There are one set of "collectibles" to be on the look out for, and that's it - I guess it is to be expected from a COD game though. It would of been nice to maybe find little bits of extra plot and story through hacking computers, finding files etc.\n\nThe single player mode took me just about seven hours to finish - I thought that was an OK length for the game;  I wasn't growing tired of the gameplay by the end of the game but there is no reason at all to play it through for a second time - expect of course if you want to play on a higher difficulty; but even then, I wouldn't say it's worth it.  Where you are going to get your mileage out of any COD game is the multiplayer - however I still don't plan on playing it simply because I am not interested in the multiplayer side of many games.\n\nTechnically I didn't have any bugs or issues whilst playing. I was able to play on a steady 60 fps on 4k resolution the whole play through. At times the frame rate was even in the 100s. It certainly looks like the PC version of the game came out on top of the consoles on the technical side of things, since the consoles could barely even achieve 60 fps on lower resolutions, Xbox could only handle 720p. This game is better off being played with a keyboard and mouse, however the lack of FOV sliders did make me feel a little bit nauseous with the camera swaying around all of the time when moving. You can change this in .ini settings but in this day in age, PC games need a FOV slider as compulsory in my opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, whilst there may seem to be more negatives than positives in my review for Ghosts, I did have a lot of fun whilst playing it, however the price of £39,99 is absolutely ridiculously especially for a game which has been out almost two years now.  If like me you are just going to play the single player mode, wait for the game to be around £10, but if you are going to be jumping into the multiplayer side of things (there is still a very active community out there too!) I would happily say you can pick this up for anything below £15 - since you will get the seven hour single player as well as many many hours of CODs core element, multiplayer.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It is almost impossible to create your class in between matches dealing with  the lag in the menus.  There is no connection preferences so you will be playing with people on other continents. They even removed your ping status in match so there are no more bars or numbers telling you your latency (connection) to the server.  You can turn on the lag-o-meter in your config but that will only show the quality of the connection and not the latency.  Oh yeah and in typical IW fashion they kept the FOV option out of the game.

Now dont get my wrong there were some fun moments in the single player campain but overall it seemed to lack something that im not quite sure what is it but im sure most would agree. As for the multiplayer its fun at first with the new things to play with but it gets pretty damn boring after the first week or so because your generally doing the same thing over and over and this includes the extinction game mode, as i said at first its pretty fun but then your just doing the same thing over and over.

Two identical PCs may not be equal in the ability to run it; and also a cheap non-gaming office laptop like mine can run it well enough to be playable (and has never crashed since purchased in February 2014), while the game may fail miserably on a good gaming rig which runs other demanding games well.\n\nGameplay:\nMultiplayer: at the time of writing, number of players online is fluctuating approximately between 200-800. If you play popular game modes like TDM, for me, I have never had any problems finding a game. Other game modes or DLC maps is difficult to impossible.\n\nGhosts is probably the most different COD since COD4MW - bigger maps, map layout not typical of other CODs, and the weapons and movement physics have more inertia/weight to it, thus a very slight slant towards the BF3/BF4 feel. You either love it or hate it. I have 6 CODS since COD4MW, and 8 BF games - being also a BF fan, I happen to like these characteristics of Ghosts, while most COD fans really hate it for these same reasons.\n\nAI emulating 'multiplayer' matches: A significant number of players play and enjoy Ghosts for these feature - setting up private matches with AI (or bots), or playing the 'Squads' mode - where you can configure in detail your whole AI squad and challenge other players' squads. While this is essentially you and a bunch of bots in your team and the other, you can still rank up via this method. While any idiot knows that playing with bots will NEVER be the same with multiplayer with human players, Ghosts bots are among the best out there (comparable to CSGO bots or maybe better? You be the judge) and these bot matches can be fun.\n\nShould you buy it? Due to its unpredictability as mentioned above, you are taking a risk. I managed to test it during a free weekend, and spent many hours to finally be sure I can make it work on my very humble PC before buying it. Apart from trying on a free weekend (which won’t happen anymore for Ghosts), no matter how powerful your PC is, there is a big enough risk that it may be problematic - so its a gamble purchase technical-wise.\n\nGameplay: if you want classic COD, this is not it. But if you want something different than the rest of the CODs, this may be fun for you. I am in the minority who likes the gameplay - but at the same time, I already have another 5 COD titles to play with for classic COD gameplay).\n\nCampaign: I can't comment on this since I never play any games' campaign.\n\nSo, technical wise, buying Ghosts is a gamble because how powerful your PC is may not be the only factor which decides whether or not it will run well.\nGameplay wise, Ghosts is not the typical classic COD, and most people hate it. The question is whether you belong in the majority or the minority - which will end with you hating or loving it.\n\nI belong to the minority, and my preference is purely personal taste of course. And I am the lucky ones who got Ghosts to run well enough on my potato for me to have fun.\n","December 30, 2015","true","1.8"," 93 of 134 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","93","134","7","3"

The commitment of Infinity Ward and Activision have been questionable with the latest installment in the CoD series. On release day there was of course the 6gb of RAM requirement which there was no explanation for (now lowered to 4gb RAM requirement which is standard for a game now a days). It seems although the heads of the developers have been elsewhere with the "Next Gen" consoles coming out and have still failed to fully optimise multiplayer (Every other call of duty you could get 80+ FPS on a nvidia GTX650Ti on high-ultra settings) let alone rid the game of hackers with what feels like a non existent anti-cheat system. I put plenty of hours into this on release weekend and have never really touched it since. I'm curious to see what the DLC will bring although i must say i'm not to keen on spending more money on a game that i might never touch again. Anyway with that being said here is some of my thoughts\n\nThe positives :\n- Infinity Ward/Activision did release a further optimised patch to show they care but the game is still poorly optimised compared to others. Saying that, campaign is way better optimised than Multiplayer and is actually playable.\n- Controlling riley is a nice feature (Just not worth 32.4gb of my hard drive.)\n- Extinction was a nice attempt to make something of this game. (I enjoyed this game mode. Just gets very repetitive.)\n- Squads/Spec Ops is in this game. (Although i feel it has been kind of neglected.)\n\nThe negatives\n- Bad optimisation. Possibly the worst port to date?\n- The number of hackers online is unbelievable\n- Campaign missions are really lacking that something, i was kind of lost and struggling to connect what i done in missions had to do with the actual story.\n- Player base has already dropped so much be it down to hackers, bad optimisation or the repetitive gameplay mechanics.\n- "Next Gen" game made on the ancient call of duty engine with a couple of tweaks here and there.\n\nI would not recommend buying this game unless there is some significant changes and finally some attention paid to the PC Port for once by Infinity Ward.\nOverall Score: 6/10","December 24, 2013","false","2.6"," 51 of 67 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","51","67","0","1"

If you are looking for an uber-realistic, fist person shooter, then this is the game for you!\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ghost Recon is the 666th installment of this series.  It has first-class graphics (I can't even tell if it's real or not!)  and there's no glitches as many of you have seen in many other games.  I have so much fun playing this and have never gotten mad at it.\n\nThe Next-Gen Engine from 2025 is still going strong, even though it's -11 years old.  I can't believe that Infinity Arch made a whole new engine in such short notice!  It's also a really great improvement and makes Counter Strike look like a pile of poo.\n\n\nAs far as hacking goes, I haven't seen many of them becaues the loomynarty comes and saves the day most of the time.  Also, IF there is a hacker in the game, the Tom Clancy Valve community calmly and nicely tells him/her to go away and play Combat Arms.  That game gets hacked so much anyways.\n\nSpeaking of the community, they are really, really nice people.  No matter how old/young, sex, religion, and race you are, you get treated with respect.\n\nAll in all, the game is great fun and I definitely suggest you get this game for you and all of your friends.\n\n\nP.S.

This is an unfinished, unoptimized product. They should release a proper PC version of the game. The netcode is garbage, we need dedicated servers. Matchmaking system is a bit slow. The graphics are awesome compared to the previous CoD titles but you need a REALLY high-end computer to play this smoothly.\n\nAlso after playing for an hour, I'm now 100% sure that Activision bribes game reviewers. It's amazing to read some reviewers praise the worst spawn system I've ever seen.\n\nThe UI is cool, being able to customize the player model is cool. I miss the "Pick 10" system of Treyarch but this is alright too, I guess. Weapons, equipments and killstreaks are balanced well. I enjoyed having a guard dog companion.\n\nI encountered too many cheaters, almost one in every match. It's quite annoying but maybe it's related to the free weekend that's going on right now. Time will tell.\n\nStill seeing gun barrels sticking out of the walls in this year. Just how hard it is to fix this?\n\nI kind of have a buyer's remorse now because I already own Black Ops II which seems like a better game than this.

I have to say, I am 100% not impressed.  Multiple issues with the gameplay, performance issues, low player count, and as of 23Nov13, a huge hacker problem.  The biggest issue, is that the developers actively refuse to do anything about the problems.  The forums are filled with problems and the "moderators" have actually quit ignoring the threads, now what they're doing is giving the exact, and when I say exact, I mean "word for word," same generic answers to every thread made for whichever thread type and immediately locking the thread.  I have sent multiple emails to Infinity Ward and Activision, I have posted 11 questions on the official forums, I have called both Activision and Infinity Ward, but have literally gotten no help.  I have never, even with brand new indie developers had such a horrible experience with a game or its developers.  I have actually gone ahead and filed a complaint through the Better Business Bureau because of it.  Hope this helps if you're thinking about getting this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/209160/","daniel_faraday","Daniel Potter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/","845 products in account","Back in november, my friend got COD Ghosts. Unfortunately for him, his computer wasn't enough to handle the game. And that's how i got to play COD Ghosts. Now that Steam's Family Sharing is out, i can finally give my honest review about this game. In advance, i want to say that i played 20 hrs of multiplayer and 6 hrs of singleplayer, and i think that i had experienced enough, to give this game a review.\n\nNow, COD Ghosts consists of a singleplayer campaign, multiplayer, and coop modes: survival and extinction.\nOne thing i want to mention is of the game's requirements, they ask too much, yet don't really make it look better then Battlefield for example, which clearly shows that no effort was put into optimization of the game. The game is of very poor quality and optimization wasn't the only victim. Others being the poor costumer service in multiplayer and stuff like gun sound. Check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t49dXbgpPSw\nThat surely isn't the way a game that makes billions of $ a year should be, i actually don't even remember the guns in COD sounding this bad.\n\nCampaign\nTerrible i would say. It lasted only about 4 hrs and had a pretty cheesy plot. The plot was about South America uniting and detroying USA. The game starts 10 years later, surprisingly, USA is still fighting, dispite their cities being filled with craters, and  them being technologically underpowered, and their gear being over 10 years old. You play as Logan, son of the chief of the Ghost Squad. And the story revolves around the guy named Rorke, taking revenge on the Ghosts. Just like MW3, the plot makes very little sense.\n\nIt also doesn't have the features that were in BO2: ability to pick a loadout and strike missions. Even though strike missions weren't all that great, i still think they had a great concept, it just needs to be executed correctly, maybe add a coop to it?\n\nThe only good thing was probably the mission variety. There were a few well done levels, like the underwater level, the car chase on ice, the skyscraper level and the dog level. And a few not so good ones, like the level in space and the tank level.\n\nMultiplayer\n"Laggy as Hell" - that's COD Ghosts multiplayer in the nutshell.\nNow someone at IW thought it would be a nice idea to have the max ping 800 when searching for a game. Now you see IW, that doesn't work well, especially when you have 2500 players playing your game, and that majority of them are playing 6v6 TDM. And i doubt that in a 12 player cap match there will be enough free player slots for everyone. The game also doesn't even have a ping indicator.\nMy advice to them is to add a server browser, at least that way people will wait in a queue for the best possible ping, and of course, add the ping indicator.\n\nIf we put this aside, we get another broken COD experience. This time though, it's the big maps. And as i said, most people are playing on 6v6, and these maps are just too big for them. And it's not only that the maps are big, but their's design as well. They have way too many paths to choose from, thus meaning that you should expect an enemy to attack from anywhere. That's why most of the time, i only see people camp.\n\nThe game had good features implemented into it though\nLike now, you have ground UAV's instead of Plane ones. Usually in previous COD's, a UAV would get shot down right away, well, now to shut it down, you need to find and destroy it.\nThe new perk system was introduced, and the token system is back(for buying gear). The new stubbing animation.\nYou now have the ability to create a character, though, i think it doesn't really matter for a 1st person shooter, and overall, it wasn't all that great compared to say, Rainbow Six Vegas.\nThe destruction was a nice addon.\nI have to say though, that "dynamic event" was just b*llsh*t. Every 1/3 of the game something shakes and new path ways get unlocked, and that's it.\n\nCoop\nConsists of Survival and Extinction.\nSurvival was the only fun you could have in MW3, and was a great alternative to Treyarch's Zombies. Unfortunately, it was ruined in COD Ghosts.\nYou play suvival on multiplayer maps, and you know, they fit that mode real nice. It has a lot of buildings, mostly givng you the ability to access every floor and towers, for say sniping. New Killstreaks fit Survival pretty well, like the one where you fly on a Little Bird with a sniper. Survival even increased it's player cap, allowing 4 players now.\nUnfortunately, it suffers from being dumbed down:\n1st of all, the enemies can withstand way too much damage, like it takes 2 headshots with a pistol to kill one. Enemy's health needs some rebalancing.\n2nd problem, is that the mode was removed of it's money system. Now you get you killstreaks, perks, weapons randomly. During or after waves your will be sent a few care packages, spread out throughout the map.\n\nNow Extinction was actually surprisingly good, it's actually the only worth a while mode.\nThe concept of it, is that you have a drill, and there are these hives that block the way and must be drilled. And when you start drilling aliens will try to destroy the drill.\nUnlike the survival, this one actually has money, and there are killstreaks, weapons to spend them on. Also it has a seperate leveling up system, giving you access to different killstreaks, classes, perks.\nUnlike zombies, aliens don't get tougher every wave, they mostly increase in numbers and sometimes new aliens types get introduced.\nAlso during the drilling, you will be given a challenge, if you complete it, you will be awarded with an upgrade point for you character. You can upgrade your gun, get different types of bullets, maybe increase your health.\nThis mode even features a health bar(though it regenerates), but still, quite nice.\nStill, only 1 map is available for extinction in the vanilla version. Would have been a lot better if Survival actually stayed the way it was, considering that there are a total of 14 maps.\n\nConclusion: We have a terrible and short singleplayer, with a few shining moments, a technically broken multiplayer and badly designed maps, a dumbed down survival mode, and a pretty damn good extinction mode. The choice is up to you, but personally i wouldn't buy it. I feel really sorry for my friend though, he even purchased the hardened edition, which included the season pass content.","April 3, 2014","false","0.5"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","3"

The US isn't the world's only superpower and is fighting and losing war. rather than focusing the on usual american patriotism Ghosts focuses on the family of two brothers, their father and their dog Riley. and the part they play in the war against the federation. Which made me care about the characters more. Also it doesn't have the usual COD ending and may surprise you! Ghosts has some very creative mission designs with trilling settings like outer space and deep sea combat, tank and helicopter missions as well as some tense moments like when after a plane crash you're scouring through the jungle or guiding Riley behind enemy lines. The game ran well, never crashed and i didn't experience any bugs. Graphically it looks beautiful. Overall it plays, looks and feels great, after beating the main campaign i felt refreshed and hoping for a sequel. This game doesn't deserve the hatred that it received. If you're looking for a good modern FPS with a good story and gameplay i would highly recommend Call of duty ghosts!","January 11, 2015","true","12.2"," 72 of 112 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","72","112","7","4"

The single player & spec ops there was great.  I hated Black Ops.\n\nSetting aside the copy/paste model that is Call of Duty, this felt really lazy.  A lot has been lifted from the MW series and the levels are formulaic and generic.  Now, that's not to say I didn't have fun.  The levels are entertaining, the gameplay is entertaining, this wasn't a waste of time.  The problem is that it's 1, maybe 2 non-story related achievements per level.  Instead of 3-4 intels per level, its 1 per level for a total of 18.  More than half of the intels are unmissable, unlike in the MW series where they spent effort hiding them.\n\nI realize these games aren't supposed to be realistic, but they really jumped the shark to where I'm just going "Oh come on, really?  Really?"  The space fights are fun, but they're so over the top & silly that it just underlines what the series has become.  The story is very forgettable, the characters are boring, the writing is full of clichés.  The villains in the MW series had legitimate reasons, they were memorable, they were interesting.  The main villain in Ghosts is just a stereotypical bad guy.  His reasons are "Because I'm the bad guy.  Argh!"\n\nWhen one of the characters predictably dies in the cheesiest, clichéd way possible, I didn't care.  I care more about the dog, Riley, than any of the human characters.  The writing, gameplay & storytelling are all very lazy.  The game is a parady of itself.  They need to stop pooping out this model every year until they can come up with something original.  Oh, and then they try to brag about their graphics.  I mean, it looks nice but it's not going to blow you away.  The graphics in the Metro series look better, and nobody cares about graphics so try again.\n\nI do emphasize that I had fun playing the game, but I can have fun throwing a tennis ball against the wall repeatedly.  That doesn't mean Tennis Ball Wall-Thrower Simulator 2013 would worthy of a recommend from me.\n\nI could recommend this game at $5 as a mindless, popcorn action shooter, but greedy Activision won't even bring it down to $9.99 until about 2018.  At least the MW series I could say has replay value, redeemable qualities & is worth $10-15.  This is quite worthy of all the hate it gets.","November 30, 2013","false","8.2"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","34","46","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjasio/recommended/209160/","ninjasio","^6NiNja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjasio/","178 products in account","I originally reviewed this game back in June of 2015. I did not recommend this game because of the bandwagon of people giving this game negative feedback. At the time, I did agree with them, but throughout the almost 3 years since release of this game, my opinion has changed.\n\nLet's start of by saying that this game is by no means in the top Call of Duty games. It is probably ranked towards the bottom of that list compared to other CoD games. Even by saying that I am not saying that this game is bad, just not as great as the ones to come before it.\n\nMy original opinion of this game was accurate. When Call of Duty: Ghosts was the newest game in the series, it was absolutely terrible. I never even hit first prestige and never went back to play the campaign a second time (until now).\n\nAfter suffering through the past two years with two respectively bad Call of Duty games, I have actually come back to this game to experience storyline another time. The campaign of Advanced Warfare was outstanding, but the multiplayer was disgusting. The campaign of Black Ops III was disgusting and the multiplayer was alright. Let's just say I came back to this game to relive a good campaign again. I was tired of the super futuristic garbage that the recent games have offered.\n\nIf I was reviewing this game soley on singleplayer, I would give it a 9/10, but since the multiplayer was poor and the general community disliked it, I rate the entire game a 8/10. The storyline does keep the multiplayer from sinking the game.\n\n\n\nMy original review went something like this:\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts is by far the worst COD in a while.\nThe campaign seems recycled, yet still playable and enjoyable.\nThe mulitplayer is just plain bad.. Like I hate it.\n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone.","May 7","true","1.6"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","26","34","0","1"

In came tight focussed maps, peppered with jaw dropping set pieces, memorable and inventive levels to break up the pace of the game ("Death from Above", "All Ghillied Up"), all contributed to make an intense cinematic experience that was genuinely refreshing at the time and well received by the majority of gamers.\n\nMoving onto 2013 and Call of Duty: Ghosts, the latest in a now annually released and stale franchise. Everything that made COD4 such a success is now turgidly reproduced ad nauseum in a manner that slowly renders the players brain to rancid cheese.\nLinear, grey levels now inject so many set pieces that control is wrested from the player constantly so they can't possibly miss the next explosion or NPC delivering a punch to the face of the protagonist. What was once cinematic and exciting is now just a trudge through a quicktime hell interspersed with the opportunity to shoot some heads of pop up cannon fodder, enemies still using 7 year old AI routines.\nCOD4's NPCs were entertaining, if heavily caricatured characters, from Captain Price's tough & rough SAS leader to Gaz's amusing Jason Statham-esque Cockney sidekick. All helped drive the narrative on as you played, with minimum cut-scene intervention. Ghosts, by contrast, features a cast of cardboard cutout meatheads, who solely seem to exist as moving objective markers for the player all the while urging the player to "Check your six" apparently for Oscar Mike who I believe has yet to actually show his face in a Call of Duty game to date, despite all the rigorous checking that we're urged to participate in.\nSpeaking of characters, we get to the villain of the piece; All good action narrative needs a great bad guy to orchestrate the violence and COD4 provided us with two of them, Khaled Al-Asad and Imran Zakhaev, extremists forged by post-Soviet Middle Eastern and East European politics, who conspire to drag the world into global conflict, forcing the player in a race against time to save the world in spectacularly enjoyable and overblown fashion.\nGhosts' Rorke (Rourke? Rork? Zork?) is a revenge fueled berk, supposedly created by a bit of an accident and some brain washing exercise and.... yeah something and stuff happened, oooh what a nasty boy he is and no mistake.\n\nAll of this is presented by a dated graphics engine, hardly evolved from the original COD4 release. Murky, dull textures. A colour pallette that seems to consist of only brown and greys. Animation which looks clunky and unnatural, especially in contrast to the dog, Riley, which has clearly had time invested in to make it move realistically and only serves to make the human characters look even more janky. All conspire to deliver a washed out experience of a game that fails to excite or stir the player.\n\nA by the numbers action game that delivers zero innovation, zero entertainment and the gaming equivalent of an unwelcome, beer induced turd into your Steam library, leaving a putrid smell and a stuborn stain on the side of the pan that no amount of bog brushing will remove.","May 3","false","5.0"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","29","42","4","0"

This "game" is actually shouting "how to make money with less effort" at you. If you're "desperately" looking forward to play a Call of Duty game, then play CoD4:Modern Warfare, or the older titles. But please, save yourself some money and time, do NOT support this copy/paste recycling policy of Infinity Ward, TreyArch, Sledgehammer Games and Activision.\n\nThe AI literally sucks. This high praised dog and fish intelligence is just a joke, for example: they like to run/swim into walls/stones and many other things... and our human enemies, well ... trust me, they want to get shot. They're like: "OH YAY, FINALLY THERE'S SOMEONE TO STOP MY SUFFERING IN THIS PIECE OF SOFTWARE!"... oh wait, now i get them, thats actually intelligent.\n\nSingleplayer is like: shoot about 200 enemies, walk a little bit, explosion here, explosion there, again walk a little bit, explosion here, explosion there, shoot another 500 enemies, again explosion here and there, maybe try to sneak in this one?, get into a vehicle and shoot about 50000 enemies and yeah close to the end we can be grateful to experience another countless 9472 explosions because thats so fckin epic......\n\nTo summarise my review for the multiplayer part: copy/paste from the old games, hackers, cheaters, voicechat kids (nothing against kids, but this...), lags, unfriendly people and the good old "i ve got the biggest boner" mentality of some players, kill 1 enemy - get promoted to level 245 (totally exaggerating, but still close enough)\n\nIf you're totally new to Call of Duty, you can give it a try (I WARNED YOU).

This review does not touch on the competitive multiplayer component.\n\nSingle Player: In the fashion of the later Call of Duty games, there are incredibly long portions of each mission during which you have no control of your character, and are forced to listen to dialogue or look at scenery.\n\nThe portions that you actually DO get to control your character are so narrow, linear, and short, that they are hardly worth mentioning. While there are some neat moments, they only appear once, briefly during the campaign, making it feel like a string of set pieces.\n\nAs for the story, it is laughable and unbelievable. I'd say it breaks the immersion, but the game never even lets you get immersed in the first place. I found myself not being able to relate to any of the characters, or finding any of them sympathetic. I'm also not sure if anyone vetted the absurd dialogue before recording it.\n\nExtinction: Aliens made it into Call of Duty! This mode can be fun, if you have a competent team. There is no tutorial on the mechanics of this mode, so seeing new people running around, making things harder, can be difficult to watch sometimes. It can be brutally hard for new players, or teams with new players. It is nice in that it does not have the completely random feel of the competitive multiplayer, but is not just a string of set pieces and cutscenes like the campaign.\n\nOverall: Ghosts plays like a bad action movie, and there is even less gameplay here than previous installments.","November 1, 2014","false","18.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vesmight/recommended/209160/","vesmight","Vesmight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vesmight/","86 products in account","The most recent installment of the Call of Duty franchise, and without a doubt, the greatest farce offered up by Activision in this series yet. This was the first Call of Duty I ever played on PC and seeing how it played out, there was no reason to buy it when I did (or for that matter, ever). I can say for certain that following this, I will not even do so much as consider purchasing another Call of Duty title on PC developed by Infinity Ward. Some games as well as previous Call of Duty titles are meant to be more user friendly and developed around  lower end systems to pass on on graphical fidelity and instead aim for a more mechanics driven experience. Call of Duty Ghosts delivers neither of those two and instead falls on its stupid masked face.\n\nUpon launch of the game back in 2013, it was a poor excuse for a console port to PC. No FoV options, pitiful graphics while consuming obscene amounts of system horsepower while running terribly, ridiculous system requirements (seriously, you need 50GB of my disk space for this rubbish?), gun play that feels "meh" at best, and God awful multiplayer level design.\n\nI'll admit, there are some interesting aspects. It's nice to see the "Pick 10" system still somewhat in place, but not nearly as well designed as Treyarch's version. Certain weapons coming with integrated attachments is a neat thing, albeit with a rather narrow selection of weapons to choose from. Though this doesn't help that the aforementioned gun play is rather boring, and no gun I ever tried had significant oomph to it to make me feel as if I am using more than some dinky airsoft gun from a corner store.\n\nAll that sounds bad for the most part, I know. But you know what sounds worse? The actual game. Call of Duty Ghosts has no doubt, the absolute WORST sound design in any shooter I have ever played. It's absolutely pathetic. Half the guns seem to sound the same, and I wouldn't mind that if they at least had some depth to the sound. But every gun sounds like you put a rock in a tin can and shook it around! In fact, that would sound BETTER than half the guns in this abysmal game.\n\nYou know what else is bad? The level design for multiplayer. I don't know what they were thinking with the pacing of the maps, but I'm pretty sure their minds were obscured by a bit of LSD. The flow of combat in the maps is terrible, and movement feels sluggish and boring. Back in MW2, the movement speed was perfect for the map size and the maps were the right size to begin with. But now we're constantly being given tiny maps compared to what used to be the norm, and to make sure you can't do a lap of them in five seconds you now move painfully slow. Not to mention the maps are organized in a way that makes as much logical sense as using molasses as libricant in your car's engine. And I hope you don't mind respawning within 15 meters of an enemy at all times thanks to the awful spawning system.\n\nNow, the Extinction mode. I'll admit, it looks kinda cool. One of the better co-op experiences done by Infinity Ward for sure, and for the Call of Duty franchise it's certainly something new. But is it a good new? Eh... I'll leave that up to the individual to decide. If I'm going into a co-op shooting gallery, aliens aren't high up on my list of preferred bullet pin cushions. Though I'll award a few pity points for trying to do something with this game in at least one category.\n\nOn the subject of the Single Player... I'll admit, I didn't touch it. Let's face it, year after year, people buy into Call of Duty for the multiplayer. If I want a lush and deep single player game, I'll look to a game that is designed around the concept of a blissful single player experience. Knowing how this game is though, I can imagine that the campaign was rather lackluster at best if not a poor excuse for a tacked on side game mode for when you ragequit the online multiplayer. And Squads? I'm just gonna ignore that... It falls within the realm of the online multiplayer, and that mode is a joke in just about every regard.\n\nSo in conclusion; this game is not worth your time or your dollars, euros, rubles, or freaking Dogecoins if you somehow managed to obtain this game using them. The game runs poorly, simple features that should have been present at launch were not to be seen, the game looks like a dated console port that has way too much brown in the colour pallete, the multiplayer is the worst experience to date, the sound in game is nearly gag worthy, and more while taking up FIFTY GIGABYTES of your monthly internet bandwidth and 50GB of space on your hard drive. It's a waste of space, a waste of time, and a waste of money. Want a good PvP shooter experience? Go buy Titanfall! If you don't want to use Origin's service (I don't blame you there), and you still want to go buy something... Go buy six copies of Goat Simulator and gift five of them to your friends. They will love you for it. Otherwise, avoid this game like the bubonic plague.\n\nGame Rating: 3.5/10","April 9, 2014","false","0.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","2"

Graphically, Ghosts looks on par if not worse than Modern Warfare 3 and somehow manages to run terribly. And why can I play the campaign on near max settings but have to revert to the lowest in the multiplayer? I don't know and I don't think IW does either.\n\nThe singeplayer campaign is nothing special, a mish-mash of the worst parts of Modern Warfare and Black Ops 2 with a healthy dose of even less "innovation" and proper storytelling and emotion than any Call of Duty game before it. The only new things this game even manages to bring to the table are the contextual lean (something not even needed on the PC version) and the freakin' dog they hyped up so much that proves to be just as much of a lame gimmick pre as post-release.\n\nAnd the multiplayer - the one aspect that convinced most to crack open their wallets every year - is HORRENDOUS.\n\nAside from the aforementioned oddity with the online portion's graphics, all the maps save one or two are ill-designed and way too big for this kind of multiplayer game, you'll find yourself spawning amongst enemy teammates more than once a match, as of two weeks ago (when I stopped playing altogether) IW had yet to nail down hacks and exploits, the kill streak system feels gutted and useless, and the ranking/unlock system is so unnecessarily convoluted that even Call of Duty veterans will have to fumble around the menus, within menus, within menus before figuring it out.\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts is just a less than mediocre showing from the series and unless you absolutely, positively need your new COD fix take a pass on this one and see if next year's installment looks or is any better.","December 14, 2013","false","13.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

This review specifically covers the single player campaign, and is specifically FOR people who only want the single player campaign. There's co-op horde mode too, apparently, but I haven't gotten to try it yet. Oh, also, fair warning: Default FoV is VERY narrow, and is only changeable in multiplayer (which doesn't carry over).\n\nCall of Duty is often at the center of video game controversy, and you would be hard-pressed to find any other series that can elicit such strong reactions from people. Reviews are usually either 10/10 or 0/10, and you will likely have friends groan at you if you claim to be a fan. There are no series other than sports that get pumped out with such regularity, and with so few innovations from game to game. It seems like sales of one game haven't even gotten a chance to cool off yet before another new one is announced. By all outward appearances, this is a terrible terrible series.\n\nYou know what, though? I have a soft spot in my heart for Call of Duty. It's a big dumb oaf of a series that you just can't help but smile at. It's very much a Hollywood Summer blockbuster movie, with non-stop action and explosions from the outset, getting your blood pumping while you're in the moment, and then making you go "...what was that?" when you're done.\n\nCase in point, Ghosts. I played through the entire campaign in 5 hours (with very minimal repeating of sections), and was in a town that was getting bombed, then in space, then back in the bombed town, then on a military base, then scuba diving, then on a ship, then driving a tank, then doing bombing runs in an airship, then in space again, then fighting on an inverted high-speed train. While all that is going on, I was switching back and forth between past and present, and controlling probably 5 different characters (or at least it felt like it). The plot and action literally do not stop to even take a breath. How can you not love that!??\n\nYou should know what to expect when you're looking at a CoD game, and this one delivers.\n\nI'm not fully up to speed on all the Call of Duty games' campaigns, but I have played a decent number of them, and this is one of the best if you're looking for a shallow, explosion-fueled adrenaline rush. If you want to feel like John Rambo, John McClane, and John Woo somehow had a baby whose life is being directed by Michael Bay, then look no further.\n\nThe graphics won't win any awards, but they're good and well-optimized (60fps at 4k maxed with a 980), sound design is solid, the gunplay is as good as ever, and there are tons of little one-and-done gadgets you get to play with throughout. If you're just here to hate all over Call of Duty, then downvote and move on, but if you're looking for some mindless action, I highly recommend this one.\n\nIt's hokey, it's fake as all get out, and it may represent all that is wrong with the video gaming market, but damn it all if it isn't fun.","September 25, 2015","true","6.0"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","36","57","8","2"

I might be a bit influenced due to my coundless hours in the Modern Warfare titles, but this is definitely a bad game.

Terrible and inconsistent performance on a GTX670, DX11 features cripple the already low frame rate and cause insane amounts of mouse lag. The game seems to have a problem with high DPI/high polling rate gaming mice since crosshair movement becomes smooth and consistent when using a controller. The lack of an FOV slider is downright idiotic, especially following on from the comparitively well optimised Black Ops 2. Prettier shaders than BO2, but ultimately not much of a visual upgrade at all.\n\nFor some reason IW have elected to throw Treyarch's design ideals out of the window and created boxy, large maps with no 'lanes' and no real flow to them. Spawns have a random feel taking any semblance of control and pacing out of the matches. It's very clear that the game has no competitive aspirations, which is fine, but it doesn't make sense following on the heals of Black Ops 2. Could be good for quick, dumb fun if the optimisation didn't completely get in the way.\n\nOh and the fish AI was a lie.","November 26, 2013","false","5.1"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

Long story short, Do not buy this. The game is terribly optimized, I only get around 30-40 on my rig and it even drop to 20 in some areas. Extra is unplayable for most people. Crashes for NVIDIA users are constant, for example, whenever I play whiteout for about 5 minutes it immediately crashes the display driver, and with AMD, it's nothing but corrupted textures on things like tractors, trucks and even some guns, making it unplayable for them.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's shockingly bad, balance is horrible with Assault Rifles and SMG's being the only practical weapons with all others only useful for playing around. The MSBS kills in 0.056 seconds while most other weapons need 0.140, weapons with built in attachments like the Honey Badger invalidate any other weapon not doing the same. The Riot Shield is completely broken with users being able to shoot through your shield completely or just shooting the bottom of the shield and the hit detection thinking they shot your foot, and on top of that, weapons actually do more damage when shooting someone's feet, the same as the Headshot multiplier.\n\nIf you think you can get past all of that for some CoD action, proceed with caution. Probably the biggest reason not to buy this is the lack of any anti-cheat, be it VAC or Punkbuster. Hackers and cheaters are abundant. In almost every lobby I have joined, my first or second one has always had at least one. This is literally killing the game, and it's numbers show, If you don't like team deathmatch or domination you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck, because there are no players in any other playlist, and dom is only even populated during the US daytime.\n\nIn my opinion, Call of Duty Ghosts is this year's Blunder Of The Year. Some will point and say, "What about Colonial Marines, what about Ride to Hell?" Now let me ask you, did anyone ever expect those to be good? Colonial marines was in development hell for at least 6 years, and Ride to Hell was made by the guys who make Nascar games. This was a major AAA release with a development cost of several hundred millions of dollars, and this isn't even playable, not even 2 months after release.

They redeemed some of their name by adjusting the game some, it runs half way decent. It was advertised as a dedicated server game yet if you play it enough you'll find out different. They left the ping feature that is one of the most important parts of online gaming out. No ping bars, no ping number. It's simply that they didn't want you to see that you were connecting to some russian host with over 300 ms of latency. This game is pure trash!

Making the bridge between a Cheater and a Great player be almost null and void. New graphics engine? Right, let everyone know you made the game to run on 4k yet you failed to compress the textures so it takes up 4 gigs of space on a graphics card to run it. Some of the top tier graphics cards don't even run this game maxed, because of lazy development. Seriously, anyone that bought this game needs half their money back for only getting a half ♥♥♥ game. Falsely advertised as on a dedicated server, I've seen multiple times a migration for peer host. The sheer amount of people that seemly pick this game up and run circles around avid good gamers is tremendous. Its rediculous that you can view their steam profile and the only games they have any time to speak of are these p2p cods. There is a reason they run around with 4.0's in these games and not one of them do all that well in any server based games. It's because they can and will use hacks in p2p games that can't be detected. Activision and Infinity Ward should appologize to pc gamers for this game. Vac is good but not perfect.

The game REQUIRES Directx 11 to even start, so if you haven't upgraded your graphics card in a while, I wouldn't bother.  It also needs a huge 50 gigs worth of hard drive space to install, for "High Res Textures" which frankly look the same as back from Mw3.\n\nI went into Ghosts thinking that maybe, just MAYBE, the multiplayer would have gotten better, but was very disappointed.   There are these random moments where your FPS is just fine, and then it randomly drops for no reason.  There are no dedicated servers, and the killstreaks are ridiculous.   But to be honest I expected terrible things like that.\n\nThe main reason I bought Ghosts was for the single player.

I started the sp campaign, only to find terrible stuttering through the opening loading screen.  Lag so bad you could only hear every other word he was saying.

DO NOT FALL FOR IT LIKE I DID!!!\n\nOkay... I will give a fair review of the game itself. This game overall is spectacular. I own it on PS4 and I love it especially the extinction mode. Campaign was phenomenal, the new extinction mode was so addicting and awesome. Multiplayer was decent and fun with the dlc's such as becoming Michael Myers and the Predator by doing the field order challenges. I still enjoy this game to this day on the PS4 and wanted to carry on the same experience to the PC to play with my PC buds.\n\n\nUnfortunately this is such a terrible PC port. It's performance overall is mediocre. It runs good for me but lacks gamepad overall even with keybinding since it moves completely slow and the same to look around. I tried using my wired 360 xbox controller which works like a charm on my other games and it seems like the game has partial support for gamepads overall. I even tried using my PS4 and Xbox controller on ScpServer and Xpadder and none of these seemed to work. I know I have no issues with Xpadder cause I can play CoD4 with my controller without a problem. A great game overall and great development for the consoles, but poor development for the PC. I also tried to verify integrity of the game's cache and optimizing it on my nvidia geforce experience as my last resort to see if that would improve it's performance and nothing. It's quite a shocker cause I have games like Battlefield 4 and Titanfall both with higher specs and works flawlessly and I even had Advanced Warfare at one point and was running very well. However, I do recommend the game for the console versions only. DO NOT waste your money for the PC version. You've been WARNED!! They would need to come up with a major update for the PC to fix the whole game to bring it back to life and to fully operate how it should to be able to recommend it. Otherwise, it's just NOT worth it. I'm so upset and I want my money back.","November 30, 2014","false","0.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I bought it. I should have spent money elsewhere.  Activisiion states in their email "fans have spoken, Ghost is the best CoD to date". On a console, maybe, meybe. I still doubt it. I never cared about campaign in any CoD, its the Multiplayer that holds atleast some of my interest. So I could care less about SP... Now for the MP. On paper it looks nice, very nice. In reality it's Modern warfare 3.5 .With better visuals, character customisation and slightly better weapon balance. That's it. Also the thing to mention, the one developer responsible for the spawn algorythm should be shot on sight. The system is so bad, that Black ops 2 system looks just about perfect, and it had flaws. Now I'll mention bad things about the game and good things:\n\nGood things: pretty balanced weapons, medium size maps(large if you played Black ops 2), nice visuals, wepons also feel pretty alive, they kick and you can really feel the weight behind it.\n\nBad things: maps are too large for standart 8v8, terrible, terrible spawn system, no ping is shown, so you don't know why the game lags like shtako, still pretty bad optimisation, possible cheaters, (kinda strange to see insta turns and aiming through walls), poor anti-cheat, rapidly declining player base. (10k people on weekend? Black ops 2 had even more on weekdays)\n\nSo in contrast how I liked and enjoyed Black ops 2, even if it had issues with weapon balance( I am looking at you smg's) I can't really paraise this game. Even though it is much more tactical thatn Black ops 2, and promotes cautious play, even camping, and has good moments its nothing that amazing that you can't get from Modern warfare 3. So if you own Modern warfare 3 and can get games without cheaters( who have declined rapidly, as I observed, moved to other games perhaps) you are NOT missing that much. It is not as revolutionary as Black ops 2, and also if you like brainless smg running you will be dissapointed.\nThis game could have been great, but in reality is is certainly not.","December 15, 2013","false","0.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

Less than 10 hours of game play is not an experienced opinion. At 110 hours, expectations that I had for the improvement of this game have all but evaporated. After noticing that my submissions for major improvements over hacking, a failed Clan War system, and more were answered on average 10+ days later, I was compelled to write this review.\n\nGame Balance = Fail\nClan Wars = Fail\nGraphics = Fail\nAdministration = Fail\nSingle Player = Win\nExtinction = Win\nSquad = Win\n\nTranslation: Co-op and single player modes are awesome. Multiplayer plays like it was developed by the same contractors that were building the building that collapsed in advance of the Brazil Olympics.\n\nCLAN WARS:\nClan Wars should have saved this game, and in fact, there was an uptick in players logging in. But as soon as the boosting and the exploiting started, despite the many posts, the admins failed to respond.\n\nOVERALL MAJOR BUGS:\nIn addition to the terrible balancing of games, the FPS and Memory for PC is all over the place. There is a huge mem leak at this time of my review, and how many weeks after release is this?  How things like these made it into a tested game is unacceptable, and people should be accountable/lose their jobs.\n\nPing balance- you will play against people from the farthest reaches of the world, with both of you changing places for smooth to sloggy game play. There seems to be a problem with the way the game throttles and balances individual connectivity. Along with that, I dont understand how it makes sense to pair your lobby in the US with FR, Poland, and etc...unless they are just having a really hard time matching games....because...at 9pm PST the other night the entire system had less than 5,000 players.....\n\nRAMPANT CHEATING\nA poorly admined game that requires you to play on their servers means that they will fix what they want when they want. Call of Duty will never be free of hacking and cheats, but this is by far the worst administered game ever.\n\nFrom my experience and for my opinion, this is the worst online game I have ever bought.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1percent/recommended/209160/","the1percent","I am the 1 Percent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1percent/","52 products in account","I fervently REGRET purchasing this game, and DO NOT recommend it to anyone who is looking for fair, legitimate, and competitive online gameplay.\n\nI have been an avid COD fan over the years, starting all the way back with COD 2. I have purchased virtually every new release--whether from Treyarch or IW--with the almost sole intention of playing multiplayer. Sadly, Ghosts is where I stop; this is indisputably the last COD I will ever purchase.\n\nWhy? It's simple: the developers' blatant disregard for online playability, neglect (or perhaps unwillingess) to ramp up anti-hack measures/ban cheaters, and complete inability to optimize the game for computers of varying capabilities all serve to undermine the integrity of the entire COD franchise.\n\nFirst, in online multiplayer on PC, there are hardly ANY players online. The only two game modes you're guaranteed to find matches in are TDM and Domination. What's the point in having all the cool niche game modes if there aren't enough players online using them?\n\nOkay, so let's look at the cause-effect: why aren't there any players online? It really comes down to two main reasons. The first is that the game is poorly optimized, and is consequently only playable by those with top-tier PCs. "Just decrease the visual settings", you suggest? Ah, if we purchase a game for $60, should we really have to downgrade the quality settings to play it? No. The developers are generating millions of profit at significant margins; why should WE have to compromise game quality when they have the means and resources to optimize the game to ensure playability for a diversity of consumers?\n\nFortunately, I have a high-performing PC and do not experience (the majority) of the lag/fps issues that most complain about. Instead, my biggest issue and disappointment is the ridiculous prevalance of hackers. There are AT LEAST 2-3 hackers in almost every single online match. If you take the time to watch killcams of many top-scoring players, a pathetically high number of them are, quite conspicuously, aiming at you through walls/map barriers. Some are even stupid enough to SHOOT you through walls, even regardless of whether you have all stealth perks active or not (i.e. blind eye, incog, off the grid).\n\nI understand COD is a franchise especially prone to hacking--that's fine, that's to be expected. However, the sheer influx of hackers in COD: Ghosts is just completely sad. Of the 5-6 different COD chapters I've played, this is bar-none the worst for hacking. It is quite evident that Activision/IW/whoever's responsible for anti-hack measures have completely floundered. Until cheaters begin to get caught and banned (which likely won't be for a LONG while), I assuredly will not be playing much. In its current state, the quality of online gameplay is shameful, and yields a considerably frustrating experience for those who want to play fairly and legitimately.","December 18, 2013","false","1.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuintiliusVarus/recommended/209160/","QuintiliusVarus","Quintilius Varus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuintiliusVarus/","130 products in account","Multiplayer:\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts is the 10th game in CoD series. I’ve been playing Call of Duty for 5 years now and I liked most of them. But this game is really bad. This game looks almost the same as MW2/3 which are games of more than 2 years ago. IW decided to go to take the safe path, since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was their biggest success, they made all prequels more or less the same. So most IW games lack innovation.\nAlso the amount of hackers is ridiculous. In MW2, MW3 were a lot of hackers despite the fact of the anti-cheat system IW claimed to have installed. In Black Ops 2 there was not a single hacker I encountered in the time I played the multiplayer. But after having played Ghosts one week there were already signs of wallhackers and people using aimbots. It’s really frustrating to encounter hackers after having played a game without hackers for almost a year.\nCall of Duty is also infamous for their unbalanced/overpowered weapons. This time the guns are not that unbalanced however the I.E.D. makes me want to throw my computer out of the window. It is something similar to the bouncing betty but it’s hardly spottable. After you’ve heard it trigger you’re assured to explode within a few seconds. You also got a dog which has 2 times the health of a human player. It can jump on you from a distance of 5 meter and you’ll die as soon as it jumps on you. There is no animation or anything you just die instantly when he jumps.\nIs there something positive about Ghosts? Why, yes there is. The maps are much bigger than in BO2. So the game won’t end up in spawnraping. But then again IW ruined it by its ridiculous spawns. For example when my team got the A and B Flag in domination and the enemy team got only the C flag there are really high chances that the enemy will still spawn at A or B. This is why using specialist or assault strike package is not recommended.\n\nSingleplayer:\n\nThe missions in the singleplayer were okay. It could have been better but I did enjoy it for the bigger part. The missions are pretty cool and the campaign’s intro is one of the most beast intros I’ve ever played in a FPS game.\nThis campaign, though, is one of the easiest campaigns I’ve ever played in the CoD series. It wasn‘t much of a challenge. When you almost died you had plenty of time to run towards cover and regenerate health, even on Veteran Difficulty. There is, however, one thing I don’t like about the campaign which is the fact it has an open ending. This means IW wants to continue this series in a prequel which will probably be “Ghosts 2” or something like that. I really fear IW will make another game that is almost the same again.\n\nExtinction:\n\nI was really looking forwards to this new gamemode. But it wasn’t as I expected. I enjoyed playing it as long we didn’t complete the whole mission. As soon as we completed Extinction it wasn’t all that fun anymore because it became repetitive. So that’s a real shame.\n\n\nVerdict: 2/10","April 22, 2014","false","5.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","4"

Terrible optimisation for PC, I have a good PC and I still can't even run it on high when I could run BO2 maxed out.\n2. It doesn't have very many new features, becomes boring very quickly.\n3. It has a lot of bugs that ruin the game experience.\n4. Lack of dedicated servers so there is a quite a lot of hackers.\n5. Poorly designed maps.\n\nUpdated review (30/10/2014)\n\n1. Optimisation has improved a lot. I can now run it maxed out with a stable, 60+ fps.\n2. Extra graphic features added for Nvidia graphics cards.\n3. Still major mouse/input lag.\n4. FOV changer implemented in-game.\n5. FPS still capped at 90.\n6. Very small player base, last time I checked only ~2,000 people currently online.","December 17, 2013","false","0.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Story line's are all the same when it comes to first person shooters so don't expect to find something differet from betral, revenge, singular bad guy with bad organization, etc ... Utimately their all the same. So if you expect some great thing from the story line then be disappointed. I did like that you could play as the dog and that you got to control the turret gun during the game.\n\nMultiplayer\nWhat do you expect? Maps, Campers, and DLC. That's what most and all future games will contain. So don't complain. This is the only thing I have a problem with and that's the power of the guns are not well balanced. While on previous games the Sniper rifles are powerful in very long ranges it seems that the SMG have replaced all uses for Assult rifles, Large Machine Guns, Shotguns, Marksman rifles and Sniper Rifles. There are no uses for these weapons. True that these are used occasionally but the SMG is by far the most powerful weapons on the games and its a little ridiculous that a smg, which shoots an array of bullets will be accurate in its precision.\n\n2) Lack of Anti air rockets or Lock on rockets. WHY is this bad? Because we're forced to shoot most Helicopters down.\n\n3) Maniac. The power to run real fast and stab people. C'mon the hell kind of stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ is this. If i want to play FPS fantasy I'll play halo. Its like the new Call of Duty i think it has jet packs. Sounds to me like Halo 4. This is what brought me to the Call of Duty franchise the realism. I understand the Juggernaut because its a suit of armor.\n\n4) Other little things that bug me. Maybe I'm too over analytical about these things but I beleive in making forward progress not just spitting out games for the money and taking a step backwards on creativity and originality.\n\nI do love multiplayer, for what it is at the core(shooting the enemy team) and i've played this game for a very long time but the guns are the overall thing that does it for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerote/recommended/209160/","zerote","Zerote [IKS]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerote/","196 products in account","Multiplayer only review\n<rant>This game.... I should be using the "I'm not even mad, that's amazing" meme here, but the problem is i'm both really frustrated and amazed. What is amazing is also what's frustrating, and it is how a team as large as Infinity Ward, with as much money as Activision gives them, can produce a game that just plainly sucks so bad. I mean, its incredible, really. When a game is unplayable at launch, unplayable a week after launch, and just barely playable (but still not fun) almost a half year after launch, you are doing something wrong. People saying it doesn't feel like Call of Duty are right, because CoD is a game. This doesn't feel like a game, it feels like an infinite rage generator. </rant>\n\nGraphics:\n-Nothing special, especially considering its optimized so poorly that you would need a titan just to run it at medium settings. -It literally runs worse than crysis, but without coming near the same graphics level.\n\nGameplay:\n-Such lag, much delay, so teleport\n-That is all\n-Well, no, that is not all:\n-You die too fast, why does every gun have the damage of a Barret the recoil of the MW3 ACR?\n-IED, its like a claymore fused with a bouncing betty, then given steroids, and its anoying for everyone.\n-UAV, you broke it, nuff said\n-Don't ever make people rely on a mobile app to do stuff you otherwise can't do in-game. The whole clan wars thing is kinda cool, but to everyone who doesn't have one of the few phones your app supports, it's rubbish. Also, the app is just as poorly optimized as the game, it runs like crap, lags a lot, and bugs all over the place.\n-KEM in a care package? Who decided that was a good idea? My guess is some 12 year old kid who doesn't know how to play and just wants some easy kills...\n-The new prestieging system is a nice try, but a miss in my opinion. I like the Black Ops 2 system a lot more.\n-Squad points, you just get them here and there, there is no acomplishment in unlocking anything.\n-You added the 3-way split killstreak system back:D But you broke specialist, since the last killstreak is no longer all of them\n-Talking about specialist, why are there so many perks? More =/= better\n\nSound:\n-Finally something slightly positive, kinda, maybe, not really\n-The sound whoring (positional sound, for those who don't know) works, really well, but that doesn't matter because the game is already lagging so much it doesn't matter if you know someone is behind a corner. Its kinda like having nice wheels on a car, but the car is missing its engine.\n-The guns all sound like nailguns....\n\nDLC:\n-Really?\n-Wow\n-That is just asking for it. Why the heck would anyone want to throw away more money at a game that is already broken. Wolf skin, Cpt. Price skin, and so on, maybe you should have focused on fixing the game insteaf of making an extra 10 bucks off the 5 people acually buying it.\n-Can't speak for the map pack DLC's as i have not wasted my precious money on them, but they are most likely alright. What bugs me about the DLC's is how they focused on DLC instead of fixing the broken game. (you don't spend your money adding a new TV to your house, if the roof is missing do you?)\n\nEnjoyment:\n-None to be found\n-Like, at all\n-Even getting a kill or a killstreak just feels random and unrewarding\n\nAll in all:\n1/10 I mean, at least the game starts up, that all it gets a point for, being able to start.\n\nPS. Except for launch week, Black Ops 2 has generally had more players online.","March 6, 2014","false","0.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

A 8 year old console runs the game flawlessly.\n\nOn PC however, the game is horribly optimized (I have a GTX 670 and I play on almost the lowest settings to avoid frame stuttering). There's also hackers in almost every lobby, which is just great.\n\nInfinity Ward is most likely never going to fix the issues with this game, as they don't care for the PC version due to the massive amounts of money being shoved up their asses anyway.\n\nFor PC users, buy Call Of Duty every other year, when Treyarch makes them; they care for us.\n\n","December 27, 2013","false","0.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

Becuase the Executables are Single Player and Multiplayer then they show different times.\n\nThe good point is the Extintion game mode is fun. Thats about all i can say that is good about the game.\n\nGame looks terrible, i have optimised video and no joy. Tried custom settings and still no improvement. The textures are awfull. The Framerate is unstable, Items like the red dot site on the gun dissapear and reappear.\n\nWhen your doing well its annoying to be kicked out of Exinction modes when your a good bit through and cannot get back in. Even the Manu at the start and the opening cinematic lags and jitters the audio sometime bunny hops in and out. The ammount of Ctrl Alt Delete's i have had to perform for crashes is far too much for my liking.\n\nThis will be the last COD game i buy.\n\nI do not reccomend this game for the PC. If you do have a console however i think the experience may be much more of an improvement there in regards to stabbility,\n\nHope this helps.","January 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

First of all, I had to upgrade my PC to get past that stupid error in the beginning because I didn't have 6GB of RAM. But I thought: Well, since the game has such high specs, it must be worth it. Furthermore, the game itself was a bit more than 40 GB. And to be honest, I think that most of that space just went to Fish AI and Dog AI.\nThe Singleplayer Campaign was alright, and the ending was pretty good, although unrealistic (Welcome to CoD). The loading screens with the cutscenes were really laggy, and the audio kept on buffering, too. There were huge gaps in between missions (You just jumped from random place to random place), and most of the time you still really didn't know what was going on. The characters weren't intruiging whatsoever, and the only character you remember after you finish the campaign is Riley, the dog (Oh, the irony). The only thing I feel that's good about the campaign is the voice acting, which is quite well done. (I guess it's good 'cause Infinity Ward didn't get a chance to mess with it.)\nThe Multiplayer is, in one word, horrendous. It's like Infinity Ward didn't even bother, nor test their Multiplayer, that's how bad it is. They feel like they can get away with making the same game over and over again, but this time that's not the case. The time to kill is way too fast, the game is infested with campers thanks to this. Soundwhoring is WAY too easy, which also leads to more camping. The dog is too overpowered, it has more health than a player and it just one-shot kills you, while you can't do anything about it. THE MAPS ARE WAY TOO BIG! After 5 minutes some matches still have about 30 kills per team. The teammaking is worste than ever. Also, the spawns are absolutely horrible, you just spawn in front or behind enemies. And the worst part is, Infinity Ward really doesn't seem like they want to fix any of their issues. Instead, they just opt to dish out more DLC. The DLC is, by the way, quite creative, but the fact that you have to buy the DLC to make this game "fun"  (to some extent) is a majour downfall.\nThe game is also very poorly optimised for PC and there are barely any options. Also, the graphics are horrendous, too. I swear the graphics in Black Ops 2, and even Black Ops 1, were better. The colour scheme is bad too. I wish there was an option so you could change it, cause it's really hard to differentiate different objects. And the final nail in the coffin is the fact that pretty much no-one plays it on PC. There are about 2K people online, and the maximum amount of players nowadays is about 3K. So it takes forever to find a game.\n\nSo, overall, I really wouldn't reccomend this game. Since most people will buy this game for the Multiplayer, I seriously suggest that you don't even bother with this game. This game is definitely the worst in the Franchise. With Advanced Warfare around the corner, I hope that they can deliver a better game. If you want this game, I just suggest sticking to Black Ops 2 for now (It's better in pretty much every aspect, and it has more players online). Oh and by the way, Extinction is a worse version of Zombies and it only has one map (unless you buy the DLC, obviously).\n\nMy rating for this game would be a 3.5/10.","July 18, 2014","false","6.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Consistent lags, no FOV changer, poor support for the  aspect ratio of 21:9. Sometimes the game lags more, sometimes less. Sometimes it's even unplayable.  The game also has very bad maps. Some maps are too big, some - too small. Free Fall bonus map is a joke. You die too randomly there. I also think that developers didn't pay much attention to the killstreaks. The only killstreak I like is the K.E.M. Strike. It just feels like they put a ton of effort into it and forgot about other killstreaks. But besides these problems, Call of Duty: Ghosts has very nice weapons, which feel so much better than in Black Ops 2. Also, the game has a wide selection of perks. The gameplay isn't much changed but  feels  better than Blak Ops 2 and MW3. At the moment it doesn't seem unbalanced. Even though this game has a ton of issues, I think it made it's way to my TOP 3 COD games list. Just because I like it's gameplay much more than other Call of Duty games. Unless you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan, I wouldn't recommend this game. It just has too much issues that need to be fixed. At the end of the day, I give it a raiting of 6/10","November 10, 2013","false","7.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

Since I never owned or played any CoD games in the past, I've decided to give this one a try.\n\nIt was worse then I thought it would be.\nIt definitely earned the notorious title for being the worst CoD game ever played. It's quite a record to break out of the norm. Hahhahahahha!\n\nIt's not properly optimized for PC. At all. It's mindboggling that even if its configured correctly with my MSI GX60 gaming laptop with a AMD Radeon graphics card (HDD of 750 gb / 7200 RPM), I assumed that it would run the damn game with minor flaws.\nBut no, constant experience of heavy lag and frequent crashes are still occured. The FPS is out of control, the graphics are trimmed to mediocre even in the highest setting. So despite fixing it with different anti-alising settings and playing it in low quality, it's not smooth and fun to play. As a matter of fact, you couldn't even play it, period.\n\nI think this game was designed intentionally in favor of the consoles so the "next gen" archaic requirements such as the Xbox One would generate some more profits. Just as shown in one of Microsoft's Full Press Conference of the Xbox One video, this could be the explination why the PC servers were ♥♥♥♥ because Infinity Ward put no effort with the PC version.\n\nTV TV TEEVEE TV SPORTS SPORTS SPORTS CALL OF DUTY DOGE DOGE DOGE OF DUTY.

There isn't much to comment on other than guns fire bullets and those bullets kill quickly. The movement is no doubt the smoothest of any CoD game right now. The fast vaulting, the transitions from prone to couch to standing is really well done.\n\nGraphics 5/10\nThe game has low resolution textures that aren't really interesting to the eye. The foliage is a definite improvement over the last game. The water is disgusting low resolution and static. The guns and character models on the other hand are much higher resolution. Effects such as bloom, depth of field and sunrays aren't anything new so that's the reason for the low score. Though props to Nvidia for including Physx fur tech which to me looks really amazing, but the amount of time you spend looking at dog fur is next to none. Physx turbulence adds dynamic effects to smoke and other decals much lags more than it does good.\n\nAudio/Music 5/10\nThroughout my whole playthrough of the story I can't recall any song or music within the soundtrack that caught my attention. The audio design for guns is minimal to me with most guns sounding the same just pitched differently. Explosions have a noticeable lower bass volume to them making them less epic and enjoyable.\n\nStory 5/10\nThe story is functional. Nothing amazing. Plot twists are somewhat expected and is just another story of a few guys saving the world from destruction. Voice acting is rather okayish to bad, no noticeably good voice acting.\n\nSetting 7/10\nThe story does take you around a few places. The forests are a nice change to the environment as well as the snow but external conflicts happen rarely as most gameplay is focused in tight in door corridors. The game although ugly as it may be, does the forest scene rather well by throwing around foliage and trees and other decals.\n\nOverall 5.5/10\nThe smooth gameplay is what keeps the game above the 5 mark. This game has got to be the worst CoD game I've played in a while in terms of story and overall design. Compared to Black Ops 2 or even Modern Warfare 3, this game is truly a step backwards in all aspects of gameplay.","December 6, 2013","false","4.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

Crashes, FPS drops, bugs and laggs arent rare at all...\n4.The System Requirements are insane and indefensible\n5.There are not enough people in the un-popular modes, so you will have to play TeamDeathMatch or Domination most of the time.

The gamestyle is good.\n2. If you havent played CoD before, buy it now! You are missing the best FPS experience at all times!\n3.This game goes good with friends: You play, you laugh, you enjoy. You wont be alone anymore! =P\n4.At the moment, when in BattleField you go through objects, and Titanfall steals ideas from CoD, its the best FPS game that you can find.\n5. You wont finish this game so easily: The way to Max prestige is very long, and there you dont get the feeling that you are repeating yourself.\n6. The Extinction mode is unique, you wont find it anywhere else. If you like this mode i advice to buy the Season Pass.\n\nIf you like this game, and if you arent, i want you know that although this CoD is controversial, the previous CoDs were awesome, so Do not disqualified the next CoD!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/209160/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","“Forward” - there may be no better way to sum up the essence of this 2014 adrenaline-driven military frag-fest Call of Duty: Ghosts. Every single moment I’ve spent playing the game so far, regardless of which mode, has encouraged, nay, begged me to keep the gas pedal on the floor and not look back. The only way “Forward” doesn’t apply, unfortunately, is to the overall innovation and evolution Ghosts brings to the series. It brings the same solid experience gamers are used to, but unfortunately cuts a few great things its predecessors have added to the mix while failing to replace the missing features with anything substantially meaningful. Call of Duty: Ghosts isn’t by any means a bad game, it just isn’t nearly as good as it should be.\n\nWhile it used to be the focus, or at least a large part of the experience, the campaigns in the Call of Duty franchise have been pushed so far to the sideline in a majority of fans’ eyes that a large portion of the community probably wouldn’t bat an eye if they were removed completely. Perhaps I’m underestimating people’s interests, or perhaps I’m just odd, but I’ve always had a blast playing through every campaign since Call of Duty 2. Sure they might be mindless and a little confusing at points, but sometimes I just want to sit back, shoot everything that moves, and feel like I’m in my very own action hero movie. While I still enjoyed playing through the campaign, I couldn’t help but be underwhelmed with Ghosts’ story. While it’s just as loud, crazy, and busy as ever, it lacks the improvements and ingenuity that the previous Call of Duty games delivered.\n\nI’m happy that with this outing developer Infinity Ward has moved on from its three title run with the Modern Warfare story. While the series-within-a-series started off with one of the most influential shooters of the last decade, by the third entry the campaign’s story had become so over-the-top and convoluted that starting with a clean slate was definitely a smart decision. In its purest form Ghosts is about a world where South American forces expand their reach north and into the U.S.A. The baddies, and frontrunners for the coveted “most generic bad guy name” award, are The Federation, and they decided they really needed to invade the land of opportunity because, you know, reasons and stuff. Luckily for us, brothers Logan and Hesh, their dad Elias, and their trusty canine companion Reilly join a few other combatants to take the fight to the Federation through land, air, sea, and space.\n\nIn an ideal world Infinity Ward would have learned from what has worked best and worst in the last few Call of Duty campaigns and used their fresh start to weave a narrative that, if not emotionally investing, could at least try enough new things to justify its annual release schedule. Unfortunately it does neither. If I’d played Ghosts’ campaign a few years ago, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot. The problem is it’s a regression from what we’ve seen before. The campaign is incredibly linear, giving gamers, with very few exceptions, tools they’re used to using, and fails to create any characters that I care about seeing again.\n\nRegardless of how much emphasis the marketing team put on the campaign with posters and trailers, multiplayer is still where most people are going to spend the vast majority of their time. Just like its single player, Call of Duty: Ghosts’ multiplayer plays it very safe and delivers a tight, solid, and almost overwhelmingly familiar outing that is hurt by the feeling that it could and should have been so much more. The multiplayer suite is anchored on a largely expanded pool of customization options. The first thing you’ll notice is that the choices are staggering. There are an absolutely ridiculous amount of choices to choose from to the point that I spend a good half hour just scrolling through everything trying to plan the best ways to synergize my options. The perks are what have received the biggest boost, now numbering at a whopping 35.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint Call of Duty: Ghosts’ multiplayer is still as silky smooth as it’s ever been. It consistently held a high frame rate, the weapons are generally balanced very well, and only very rarely was there a disconnect from what I saw on my screen and what the kill-cam showed after my death. However, a game can be as technically solid as it wants, but if there aren’t fun game modes and maps to play on, it’s all for naught. Many of the locales are disappointingly uninspired in their visual design. The campaign has a lot of cool locales that would make for some great ways to mix up combat, but they’re ignored.\n\nRounding out the important areas of multiplayer are the available modes, which, you guessed it, tweak things just enough to be different from last year without doing anything really exciting. Returning favorites are back such as Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Search and Destroy, with Cranked and Search and Rescue being new modes with only minor twists. There are also a few co-op options for those that are interested, but I’m not going to spend a whole like of time talking about them as I just wasn’t compelled to spend a lot of time with them. Extinction mode is Infinity Ward’s answer to Treyarch’s famous Zombies where the undead are replaced by aliens, but its relative repetitiveness and small scale seem like a bore compared to the monstrous behemoth that Zombies has become. It’s fun for a round or two if you’re playing with friends, but with only one relatively uninspired map and “destroy the pod they come from” the only real objective, I just don’t see it holding a crowd for long.\n\nIf you play Call of Duty: Ghosts in a complete vacuum, without taking into account past titles in the franchise, expectations, or other games in the genre, it’s a good game. For as many bad things as I said about it in the review, it’s still got the solid underlying foundation that the franchise is built on, and I’m sure everyone can find a level of fun. The problem is that the game doesn’t exist well in a vacuum. The issue is that while there are a few additions, Call of Duty: Ghosts actually takes steps backwards, nullifying advancements of its predecessors. It’s the game’s potential and the knowledge of what could have been that stings the most here. Overall 7/10.","October 23, 2015","true","267.2"," 35 of 62 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","35","62","3","0"

This is the poorest release in the Call of Duty series.

From poorly optimize code to bad game mechanics Call of Duty Ghosts is a big step backwards from Modern Warfare 3. This will be the last Call of Duty I purchase developed by Infinity Ward as they are not the old Infinity Ward we once knew. The new Infinity Ward is only concerned about rushing out unfinished software while taking your hard-earned money. If you like Call of Duty stick with the older games or wait till Treyarch releases their new game later this year.

To give you an idea of how poorly optomized this game is I can run Battlfield 4 at ultra settings with an average framerate of 30 and I can't play this on a mix of normal/high settings without hitching/stuttering, it should be noted that this problem is largely resticted to the multiplayer and not the single player from what I've seen. It seems like the only way to fix this (in part) is by disabling distortion, motion blur, DOF, terrain detail and shadows (the last one doesn't actually disable them it just makes it less dynamic). I'm not sure if there will ever be a fix for these major graphic problems but until they do this game will have a very small online community.\n\nEven on sale I would strongly suggest that you DO NOT buy this game on pc. While the game itself is fun and the pc controls are good it is still one of the weaker games in the series.

But I do not recommend this game to those who don't have it yet.\n\nParadoxal, isn't it ? Let me explain why :\n\nI was a fan of MW3 and, of course, I decided to buy this game, specially for clan wars. Now that I have it, I play it. It would be a waste of money not to play and I want to achieve all the goals in clan war before i quit playing this game. But for those who don't have it yet, I want to inform them about all the things that could disapoint them.\n\n1) You need a very good PC to run it : I mean, even Battlefield 4 runs better than Ghosts ! And... it is not more beautiful than other COD games. Battlefield 3 or Crysis 1 's graphics are still better ! This is not my own opinion, this is the opinion of many players. So, if you want to play this game, prepare yourself to pay a lot for a new graphic card, etc.\n\n2) map packs are not worth it : they are expensive and nobody plays it. Specially because new maps are not mixed with old ones. Because everyone is playing the old ones, it's getting harder and harder to find people to play on the new maps. For example : the free fall map was exclusively reserved for players who pre-ordered the game. "They" finally had to make it free and playable for everyone because ABSOLUTELY NOBODY was playing it ! Season pass is not worth it too, because it does not even include coolest stuffs (and sometimes very useful ones) such as extra slots for loadouts, wolf skin for the dog, or captain price skin.\n\n3) because fewer and fewer players are playing it, it is already more and more difficult to find players to play with. Only TDM and Domination are still played enough. Specially for clan wars, this lack of players will be a big problem.\n\n4) clan war is a total failure. Because I was getting bored shooting on noobs when I was playing MW3, I got very excited when I heard about clan wars coming on Ghosts. I thought it would be a good occasion to meet and fight against best players, to participate to some kind of online competition. Good thing when you don't have the occasion to play in LAN or in real LAN tournaments. But Clan war is nothing like that. You don't fight other clans, you play as usual and the competition only counts the number of victories. The clan that gets the most victories during a certain time wins. So, clan war is just a "who will kill the most noobs" competition. Except for diamond division, it is even a " who will not sleep " competition (because clans who sleep the less will, of course, play more and get more victories. Clan war is the most disapointing part of this game.\n\n5) Hackers were a big problem. Every day, every night, there was at least one hacker every 4 or 5 matches. "They" finally reacted and banned tons of them. But it was too late. Now, because of those massive bans, it's even more difficult to find players to play with. They should have made a system like : warnings first, then punitions like stats reset, and then Ban.\n\nMorality : For those who have this game already, let's continue to enjoy playing it. The community is small on Steam, but we can still have fun. But for those who don't have it yet, please think twice. specially about the cost of this game, because it will include the upgrade of your PC (if you don't have a decent and very recent one). And, as mentionned above, the second biggest problem is the fact that less and less players are playing it, for all the reasons I explained : tons of good players who quit playing because of the cheaters, then, tons of cheaters who got banned, technical needs : not everyone can afford a so good PC for the moment, map packs that are dividing the community even more, and, last but not least : many players who leave for other good games such as BF4, Titan Fall,... and even old cod like MW3 (many of my friends went back to mw3) etc.\n\nBest regards.\n\n(Post Scriptum : I had a GTX 580, and I had to upgrado to GTX 780 to run it fully)","March 27, 2014","false","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I have a pretty powerful gaming rig that can run almost anything maxed out at 60+ FPS. This game, however, brings it down to its knees. Its unbelievable !!! Even the MAIN MENU stutters!!!! Even at 1280 x 720 medium settings, frame rate will sometimes drop below 40, leading to many unfair deaths. And dont get me started on graphics quality. Even at 1080p with all the bells and whistles turned on, the game looks like ♥♥♥♥. Everything is colorless, washed out and textures lack detail. A game with such outdated graphics should frankly be able to run at 120 FPS -  on your laptop's integrated graphics ... LMFAO!! IW didnt seem put any effort into optimizing this junk.\nAside from horrible graphics and lag issues, multiplayer gameplay itself has taken a turn for the worse. Maps are gigantic with little thought given to design and actually polishing them for competitive/objective gameplay. You can get shot from hundred different directions at any time..and the color scheme makes it difficult to spot enemies.... its a total mess. ARs dominate every other category due their good hipfire spread coupled with map size and insanely fast times to kill. In Previous COD games, skilled players had time to react and find cover and actually fight back after getting shot first. NOT HERE. If enemies see you first and start shooting .. YOU WILL DIE!! AND THERES NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.! In terms of Game modes, I actually like the fact that domination Capture points are set-up in a triangular fashion on most maps. Makes it harder to spawn trap. TDM and Domination are in fact the only game types worth playing, because they got rid of many of the classic games modes !!! Where is Demolition ?? Where is Hardpoint ? And What on earth happened to Capture the Flag ( my personal favorite) ?\nThey have somehow managed to suck every last bit of fun out of this once great franchise. And I'm saying this as someone who has played and loved every COD game since COD4:Modern Warfare. Heck , even put in nearly 1000 hours in MW3 and Blops2, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed. After playing blops2, i was actually rather excited for Ghosts. But 30 hours in, and man am I disappointed! .....I am angry at myself for falling for the hype. Angry for spending $119.99 on the hardened edition pre-order. Should have known better.","December 4, 2013","false","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

I'm running it on 24gb of ram on a 290x and a i7 proc and it still suffers from frame drops. I ran the SP just so I could write this review.. changing the video options kicked me back into the stupid intro movie every time.\n\nI'd like to call the multiplayer part of this game COD : Clowns, because that's what it is. Running around with Hollywood characters to make up for horrid maps and horrid guns. Maps are too large and the guns kill to quickly. The perk system is a mess of complexity and the system for picking up challenges/briefcases is also just a mess.\n\nThe audio options has about as much depth as the irony video on YouTube (if Quake was done today) and in traditional IW manner you can't turn off annoying stuff like music in multiplayer. Basic stuff that was requested back in MW3. Well actually you can by renaming some music files in your library, I posted a tip about that in some reddit thread and to this day my blog post are some of the most popular posts when I look at the stats..\n\nTheir removal of the UAV does not work at all since you now never know what level of UAV the opposing force has, something that alters your gameplay in previous COD games (ie, if the enemy has an UAV up - be alert/or go with a stealth class...if they have a VSAT up, be stupidly alert). The maps also foregoes of the classic three lanes and instead turned everything into an effing mess making it impossible to do well in a consistent manner and rewards sitting on your behind too much.\n\nMore than anything though the visuals are cluttered and foes are hard to spot. It stutters and has frame drops no matter on what system you run it. Maxfps settings are gone and the FOV slider was too little too late.\n\nI don't see myself buying an IW game ever again and I will not pre-order another COD title until I see proof positive of how well they perform on PC, has maxfps settings, soild settings for mouse sensitivity (F the freaking slider, if I want 1.004 then let me).\n\nThe only thing that is good about this game is the movement system and the hit detection, wich they fussed up anyway since all that big talk about dedicated servers was just plain horse dung..more often than not you are running on hosts as opposed to BO2 wich has ded servers only for PC.\n\nJust to write this review I ran SP for like 5 mintues. It crashed twice. Well done IW, well done. Stick your silly camos, your brotastic tier-1 crap and utter arrogance far up where the sun don't shine.","July 14, 2014","false","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There is no story, there are cliches, and random illogical events, and you've already finished the 4 hour long campaign. The scripting is static, there is NOTHING dynamic in this game, unless you sit around and wait for the slow NPCs you will bump into them at every _damn_ door that needs to be kicked down, you will be teleported away between scripted events, just because you didn't stood still, and you will be insta-killed for -no actual reason- just because the scripted message: "Don't go there yet, some more enemys spawned there like 0.1 sec ago" is two seconds late, UNLESS you sit, and wait around every time like a mentally capped zombie.\nMP: There is no actual recoil, the maps are way too small, and simple, altho you can choose from a lot of weapons pretty much all does the same damage with the same accuracy (except the big snipers obv.). Pointless killing around is fun for a couple of hours, but for 60€ .... no, thanks.\nThere is no optimalisation. This game was made for consoles, meaning both the hardware requirements, and the intellectual requirements.\n\nI honestly see no point in buying/playing this game.

At least not at the price they are asking since this COD has been the biggest failure for PC ever. I pre ordered this game and have tried playing both single and multi players. I liked the single player but the multiplayer is a piece of crap. The maps on the highest settings are not really graphic at all, Frame rates drop on you all the time, Ping bar is missing so you can't even tell if you are lagging because of your connection to ping due to it not even being there, Spawns are horrible, and i mean horrible i have had soo many times where my enemy spawns no more than 2 feet beside me, i am not joking. Map layouts are horrible and i still have not even had a mp match on the supposed free fall map which i did try out by myself in private match and found that map not to even be half what was promised. There are no servers at all only quickmatches by activision. Also when you try to find a match you are lucky to even find 15 lobbies on a good day in TDM. I am serious, i rememeber MW3 BO2 all of these had 60+ lobbies to join well into their life. Even now i can open MW3 and find more quickmatch lobbies for TDM then i can find in COD Ghost. Ghost was a joke, They have fixed ram issues and several boot up issues but the gameplay issues are still the same.\n\nIf any of you were expecting the gameplay to be anything like the modern warfare series, then you are in for a surprise. It is what i would call a half breed between the MW series and the BO series. People bought this because they wanted MW series type of gameplay. Others buy BO series because they like that better. Well this one mixed both and it is rotton horrible. If Infinity ward doesn't fix this game then i will skip CODs from here on till i find another proven good one. I am looking forward to "Enemy Front" and "Homefront 2" by Crytek. Well this is the end of my review of this game and i really hope they fix these issues because i paid $60 pre order for nothing. I still play more MW3 than i do in this game.","December 12, 2013","false","8.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

It exists. Deliberate or not I dont care, but it has completely tarnished the multiplayer experience. I kept playing to perk up and develop squad points believing that it would improve my multiplayer experience. Maybe my gun wasnt spec'd out enough? Maybe I didnt have the right perks? What a waste of time.\n\nAnd to be honest I only started playing the multiplayer because the single player campaign wont let me proceed past a certain point without a CTD. You see each previous time the game C'dTD, if I restarted it and tried again, 1 out of 5 times would be successful. Only until I reached a point in the game that I just cant seem to get past without a CTD. In all of this madness, I felt I needed to get my money's worth. So I switched to MP. But my sole multiplayer experience was serving as cannon-fodder to those with a poorer internet connection; the ones who benefited most from compensation lag.\n\nI had several COD games on my wish list.

So, the first thing. Optimization. I'm running a high end computer with over the required 6gb of RAM. I have 16. I also have a GTX 770 which should easily cap this game on ultra settings. I didn't get what I expected. I'm getting around 60fps and then I get sudden dips to 20 for no apparent reason. This happens every minute of gameplay but it is still VERY annoying. The next problem this game suffers from is the map sizes. These maps are becoming pretty big. Just stay with the same map size, nobody said that small maps were bad. Battlefield is from making big maps. The campaign really saves the game from what I've played but the game is mainly based around multiplayer which is something in which IW has failed terribly. This game is also missing a FOV Slider. I don't know why but every Call of Duty game that IW makes is just missing so many things that the Treyarchs version isn't. The week this game came out, there were a lot of hackers around already. I also have to download 3rd party programs to do something that I should be able to just adjust IN GAME. The graphics are simply, terrible. Yes, I agree that they've finally made that move from the previous generation of Call of Duty games but come on... These aren't the 'next gen graphics' that we were talking about. The graphics aren't even compressed and they still manage to look somewhat terrible. This game is also filled with campers but I can't blame IW for that. My biggest problem is the fact that the main menu lags. Lags a lot. So does the mouse when you play the campaign. I was getting a lot of what is know as microstutter but I was playing without SLI. This is the thing that really annoys me about this game. The people at IW have a lot of money. More than you can imagine and they also have a huge fanbase. The fanbase gives constructive criticism but IW doesn't do anything about this. I remember tweeting to a person who is meant to take criticism from fans and I ended up being blocked. Oh yes, did I mention, I get over 60 fps on ultra settings in Battlefield 4 but get a lot less on Ghosts? I play Ghosts on medium by the way. It just seems that for this generation of shooters, I'm going to stick with Battlefield 4 and I also recommend that you do so too.\n\nGame rating: 2 / 10\nCampaign Saved the game.","January 19, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

The singleplayer is bad, but the multiplayer is fun to jump into now and then and doesn't require much thought or strategy. It's the kind of game that you can jump into for a short amount of time and stop playing whenever you want. Camping is a big problem in this game however, which might ruin some players' experiences. You might encounter some hackers but it's quite easy to report them.\n\nBack to the campaign, the story is ridiculous and is hard to follow (not really worth it anyway). Basically all of South America invades the US by shooting it with giant missiles from space... you get the point. That being said, it is still fun to occasionally control some ridiculous weapon attached to a helicopter to mow down tons of enemies.\n\nThe real reason I wouldn't recommend this game on PC is the how bad the port is. The graphics don't look much better than the console version. Framerates aren't good either. It dips below 30 fps on my rig (which gets around 50 fps in Battlefield 4, a far better looking game). There's one attachable sight that makes the game go to around 5 fps (not intentionally). To conclude, if you do want to get this game, get it on a console.","May 3, 2014","false","7.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Lag/stuttering, call it what you will - it's like watching a poorly made stop-motion animation! There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to how you get kills. I've emptied clips into opponents, only to be killed with a hard stare. It can be so unbalanced as to be almost vertical.

In the last 10 games I've played I've been against 6 hackers - they're easy to spot as they have every perk and upgrade going, can kill you from the other side of the map through half a dozen concrete walls and tend to have k/d scores like 75/2. Also, they tend to boast about it as IW and Activision don't ban these idiots. If you go to the forums to complain they just give you a stock answer about reporting them ingame.\nWell, sorry guys, it's been a fun ride.

This formula hasn't been changed in 6 years. If you were buying Ghosts hoping for a revolution, like I did, you will be dissapointed like no Asian dad ever was, when their son brought Fs home.  If you came expecting something quick that would keep you occupied and like all the millitary stuff, you shall enjoy this game. The multiplayer hasn't changed as well. The enemy will still spawn on you from time to time. You will still get shot in the back and from the side for no reason. And you will get yelled on by a tween, stating he had intercourse with your dear mother. Gameplay flaws aside, there are the TECHNICAL ones. The ridiculous RAM requirement (was fixed from 6 GB down to 4), the occasional LAGS (if you look from side to side you get tearing), especially on startup of a match. And it doesn't even look that good to have the right to drop framerates. It's seriously not optimized for PCs. Checked on both a fairly low-end notebook and a mainstream, capable gaming desktop. It's the kind of port-it-from-the-xbox-and-slap-it-on-windows port. I realized I made a mistake AFTER purchasing this game. Have I tried it before, I would go with Treyarch's installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. Overall, the game is enjoyable and the campaign is truly epic, but the technical problems and the slowly-getting-old gameplay mechanics are something that will probably bug the most of players, who are familiar with the CoD franchise or FPS in general. For your first Call of Duty, this is not a bad pick, however.","February 1, 2014","false","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, the campaign is very well-written and the multiplayer is as intense as it used to be back i the older games.\nBut why won't I recommend this game then?\nWell, the biggest problem is that nothing "really" new has happened. Yes, they've made a few cool changes to the perk-system but honestly once you get used to that, you realize that the perks you can choose are pretty much the same.\nThe second largest problem is their way of designing maps in multiplayer. In the older games (here I think mainly of MW1 and MW2) the multiplayer maps were taken right out of the campaign and put into multiplayer to be used in different game-types. For players like myself, who loved playing both the campaign and the multiplayer that gave the maps a kind of "homely" feeling. The maps back then had better design and felt more intuitive.\n\nAs I see it they've run out of ideas and have begun running in circles instead, just destroying a once good formula for a game.","December 13, 2013","false","8.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The worst case of consolitis I've ever seen.\n\nThe multiplayer was a massive disappointment the overshadowed the whole game. Perhaps it's time for the franchise to go away?

The single player is 4-7 hours long, depending on your skill level, and is full of the same trite bull.  It's a glorified shooter-on-rails.  Put, click, and shoot.\n\nThe multiplayer portion of the game is what really ruins the game, in my opinion, however.  It's buggy as hell, for starters, and lag seems to be an issue no matter how decent a connection every player in a given lobby has.  To boot, as with every CoD game in the last decade, hackers make their appearances in droves.  The difference with Ghosts, however, is that no one is doing a damn thing about it.  Within the first three months of Ghosts, it's already as shabby and hacked-apart as MW3 was in it's last months.  Steam doesn't do anything about it (and why should they, it's not their game), and Activision has, once again, put aside the pleas of its fans and left out any sort of hacker control.  No votekick, no PunkBuster, nothing.  For any legitimate players, your choices soon dwindle down to playing against Bots, which have neither skill nor allows for any real EXP gain.\n\nThe most frustrating factor to me, however, is how terribly the servers are.  First, we never really got those dedicated servers that were promised before launch, did we? No, all we got was this terrible hybrid system that disallows for any control over who and where you play.  Even worse, though, is that, because you have no way to look for servers, you're stuck, just as in MW3, waiting for a lobby to find enough players to launch.  For sometimes as much as half an hour at a time.\n\nUltimately, Ghosts is a tired and vain game, with nothing new or fun to offer its players.  Don't make the mistake that I made: don't buy Ghosts.","March 16, 2014","false","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Ghosts single player was fun for the short time it lasted.  What I usually buy COD for is the Multiplayer.  After BO1, the multiplayer sytems SUCK!\nThe only reason I tried Ghosts was due to the LIE that they would have dedicated servers.  The first month of playing against HACKERS who had cheats on the day of the release of the game made me quit.  During the first month playing, I was unfortunate enough to get stuck in a hacked lobby at level 41 only to come out at 60. "LUCKILY" for me, six months later when I gave this crap network code another attempt, I was not one of the ones who had been perma banned due to the first six months of hackers ruining it for the honest players, I merely had to go back to Level 1. Thanks.  So, having hated wasting the money, I try again.  The maps are good, the weapons are good, the cusomizations are good.  The matchmaking system STILL SUCKS.  IF you are luky enough to find an open lobby, you have a good chance of getting sucked into a foreign host, and then you are gonna die alot.  People cry hack left and right, but its just the crappy host system!  It can't help but be biased.  PLEASE bring back RENTABLE servers.  People can find ones that work well for them, that are close to them.  The Run and Gunners can play their style.  The Snipers can play their style, The Tactical Servers can have their style.  Heck, even the racists can have their own servers and call each other the N word all game long!  I game to relax and have fun, not to have some twelve year old who just leaned their four letter words curse everyone out every time they get owned.  I am gonna play this one out until it dies (and with a mesley 80-90 hardcore players online at night lately, it might not be long) but I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER MULTIPLAYER GAME WITHOUT RENTABLE SERVERS.","June 14, 2015","false","31.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

LOL! What a joke! The multiplayer on this game was absolutely unbearable, I couldn't go into a single match without the constant stutters and instantaneous framerate issues - I found myself getting awfully frustrated and just unable to play any longer. Let's face it, Infinity Ward is a shell of it's former self, the devs didn't even put in the slightest bit of effort into porting this game over to PC, this is a big let down to people who were expecting an improvement from last years game (not me).\n\nIf you do plan on getting this game however, save yourself the money and just get it for console, as that's where this game is meant to be played, it will save you the frustration of this horrible port.\n\nI haven't touched the campaign or extinction mode yet and I probably never will, because I never find joy in playing the campaign on a COD game at all and extinction mode just looks extremely bland. My advice to you potential buyers out there is to refrain from purchasing this game and spend the money on something else that has more value.\n\n3/10","January 5, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They finally started to police the servers, and the cheating dropped off significantly.  HOWEVER, whatever triggers they are using to find such people are too restrictive (or just in error), and last week I was permantly banned (after playing for about 400 hours).  To be clear, I do not cheat, have no interest in cheating, and do not have or use things like FOV.  One solution is to just buy a new game (i.e., give them more money) and start from scratch.  The reason for not doing this is that I have no idea why I was banned and would likely just end up getting banned again.

To be clear, I do not cheat, have no interest in cheating, and do not have or use things like FOV.  One solution is to just buy a new game (i.e., give them more money) and start from scratch.  The reason for not doing this is that I have no idea why I was banned and would likely just end up getting banned again.

I am a Call of Duty fan. I have been a fan since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but this game may be the game that stops me from purchasing another Call of Duty. This game's PC version was poorly executed, and if this is the treatment I expect to get with future titles, you can forget it Activision. To start with, I have a fairly nice machine. I can run Skyrim on the highest graphical settings with HD graphical mods with excellent FPS, but I have to run Call of Duty: Ghosts at a medium setting because of how utterly poorly optimized this game is. Graphics are not everything, but they are an important part and in this respect Call of Duty fails. It's "revolutionary graphics" looks pretty much the same as other titles in the franchise. On to the gameplay (when the game decides to let your machine play), it's not bad. It's a pretty decent ARCADE SHOOTER. This game is not in any way meant to be realistic, and if you come into the franchise on that assumption you are wrong. The upgrading and leveling system is pretty nice, but nothing spectacular. The game hardly improves from it's predecessors. Not the mention, Activision insists on its horrible "Hardened Editions" or DLC models. This game is just another cash grab, and I feel ashamed that I have given so much money to these people. Do not purchase this title for the PC.","June 21, 2014","false","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

With framerates dropping below 60 even on the smaller levels, it disrupts gameplay quite a bit when your framerate drops in the middle of a gunfight, causing you to die when you should have lived.\n\n+ Character Customization\n+/- Updated engine adds prettiness\n\n- Hitreg\n- Lack of Anti-cheat [EDIT: Their is a anti-cheat in place, it works to a degree]\n- Poor map design\n- Poor weapon and equipment balance\n- Poor optimization\n\nOverall, If I didnt get this game as a gift, I would not be buying it, but if you got it for free, its a good bout of fun.

Reasons being is that this game isn't really optimized for PC, meaning that it doesn't work well for PC, but seeing it is still within the first week of release, they might do some patchs 'n' updates later on. Furhermore, the game also tends to freeze up now and then when I'm navi-*******-gating through the menu and there are some performance issues during gameplay that you can get your head around....but still.  The graphics and game design are somewhat the same to the previous COD games, like Modern Warfare 3, so I, in all, don't feel like this game is new.....I mean...there are some elements that make this game new like extinction.....new game modes like cranked and hunted.....but....to me....it feels like I've already played it....this might be a stupid answer considering the fact that I was an....enthusiast of Call of Duty since Modern Warfare. Again, this game's more adequate to play on Console than PC.\n\nSo.....as a reaonable conclusion, if you play Call of Duty for the story, purchase it. But if you're considering purchasing BF4 instead, then go for that because it looks like BF4 will overthrone Ghosts in all gaming aspects. For me, you know, I had a little disposable income and thought "spend it on one of the most biggest gaming franchises in the world" and gosh-dang...I couldn't be more infuriating.

I am a Call of Duty fan. I have been a fan since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but this game may be the game that stops me from purchasing another Call of Duty. This game's PC version was poorly executed, and if this is the treatment I expect to get with future titles, you can forget it Activision. To start with, I have a fairly nice machine. I can run Skyrim on the highest graphical settings with HD graphical mods with excellent FPS, but I have to run Call of Duty: Ghosts at a medium setting because of how utterly poorly optimized this game is. Graphics are not everything, but they are an important part and in this respect Call of Duty fails. It's "revolutionary graphics" looks pretty much the same as other titles in the franchise. On to the gameplay (when the game decides to let your machine play), it's not bad. It's a pretty decent ARCADE SHOOTER. This game is not in any way meant to be realistic, and if you come into the franchise on that assumption you are wrong. The upgrading and leveling system is pretty nice, but nothing spectacular. The game hardly improves from it's predecessors. Not the mention, Activision insists on its horrible "Hardened Editions" or DLC models. This game is just another cash grab, and I feel ashamed that I have given so much money to these people.

Black Ops 2 still held up and I thought to myself that let's see if IW can top Treyarch with the latest CoD. As it turns out, Call of Duty: Ghosts may be the worst purchase I have made this year.\n\nLet's start off with 6-7 hour single player. The story itself is ridiculous. It barely makes any sense and a majority of the characters are bland and completely forgettable. It's usually a bad sign when I actually want most of the good guys to die a horrible painful death. On top of the story and lame characters the game is littered with quick time events, a game concept I absolutely hate if used in the wrong way. I can understand a QTE every now and then and if they're done well. In this game, they slow the game down and it feels like a chore every time one pops up. If we need to jump out of a helicopter to start the stage, the game can do it for us. If we need to rappel up onto a catwalk, I don't want to hold 'F' to do it. It breaks the immersion from the game and you don't feel accomplished when it's done. It's literally "Push button, you are winner!". No thought and very boring. And where did the branching storyline from Black Ops 2 go? It may have not been anything new in games, but it was new and interesting in CoD as a series. But nope, IW needs to be as arrogant as possible when it comes to expanding upon things made by Treyarch. IW, you can advertise your single player for having a writer who has won multiple awards writing your game, it's not gonna change the fact that this story is crap, and it's only made worse by the lack of enjoyable gameplay. (And that twist ending... With that scene alone you just made a majority of the CoD: Ghosts campaign null and void and are already sequel baiting for CoD: Ghosts 2)\n\nMultiplayer, on the other hand, is the same as ever, if not a little worse. If you like IW CoD multiplayer before, you'll probably like it now. If you liked Black Ops 2 (I admit, I feel it's on par with CoD4), then you will be disappointed. Most of the new good features that Treyarch implimented into BO2 are nowhere to be seen. I think the only feature that survived was a strange version of the loadout points, except now they determine the amount of perks. There's a few new gamemodes that I find interesting and such. I don't know how many of them are original ideas and how many of them have been done before, but new gamemodes are always fun. But with the game as is, it's the same old CoD on the same old downward slope as the series has been on since MW2 (or what I think at least)... And where's theater mode!?\n\nThe only gamemodes left to talk about are Squad mode and Extinction mode. To be honest I hadn't tried Squad mode, but I probably won't either, due to lack of overall interest in the game already. I tried Extinction mode, and to be honest, it's not that bad. As horde modes go, I liked it and it is on par with Treyarchs Zombie mode. However, it's nothing game changing. It doesn't help the game in any way really. I think the only reason they did it is because Treyarchs Zombie mode was popular and Activision just wanted to milk some more money out of another horde mode. Extinction isn't bad, but it doesn't save the game either.\n\nOn top of all of these things, the PC port just seems dreadful. Plenty of FPS drops all around, and I've heard that the PC version might be locked at a low framerate. I haven't even really checked for my max FPS, but I've heard others have had a problem like this before. Also, this might be a problem on my end, but I can't seem to get the game to run on my native resolution (1920x1080), which does bug me a lot. It often opens in a borderless window instead of the fullscreen I wanted. IW, do you just hate PC gamers?\n\nNow I'm almost always on the line that graphics don't make a good game, but I think it needs to be mentioned: for a "Next Gen CoD" the graphics are far from impressive. It still looks pretty much the same as MW2 or MW3. If this is what it's like to step into the next gen of CoD, then please count me out.\n\nOverall, both this game and this port are terrible. The single player is forgettable, the multiplayer is less impressive and the extra modes are not a selling point. I think I used about 50-60€ on this game when I bought it and I feel that this is the worst thing I have spent it on this year. Just do yourself a favour and don't buy this game.

I started up COD Ghosts and decided to play the campaign. The campaign in my opinion was not all that bad it lacked a basic story like most fps games, but it was ridiculously easy at some times. I spent a good eight hours on the campaign so it is pretty normal for the series. So COD Ghosts if you were only to play the campaign i would give it a 6/10. So i finished the campaign and started up multiplayer, this is where everything went down hill. Start it up make a charecter first lobby i join is hacked, so i leave the game and then play another. The texture quality of everything was terrible considering the game has a huge install size. It lags (Its not my components i can play BF4 on ultra at 60fps) and half of the thirty minuets i spent on the multiplayer I was wondering what kind of LSD the programmers were on when they coded it. So in total for multiplayer i rate it a 2/10. So a combined score for ghosts considering most people play the game for multiplayer 3.5/10. I also forgot to mention before the patch that fixed the pc side of the game it was completly unplayable, worst cod ever if anyone is debating this vs BF4 Get BF4.","February 5, 2014","false","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But, you would think that the developers behind the Classic Modern Warfare experience on PC (Infinity Ward) would have a little more respect for their PC fanbase. As small as the PC COD community is, we do have high expectations, just as our console friends of this yearly series. So, it came as a huge shock when I discovered how limiting the PC Ghosts experience was. The core game is Call of Duty with all of it's usual bells and whistles such as a set-peice filled campaign, class driven multiplayer, and the new co-op extinction mode. To put it as simply as possible, if you came for COD, you get COD, but that's just about it. Also, if you have a beast rig that makes titles like Battlefield 4 glow with realism, expect COD Ghosts to look like a muddy and uninspired mess. With the budget Infinity Ward has, and after boasting about their new game-engine, you will be suprised to see just how last gen this title is. To be honest, this is by no means the worst looking COD title out, but for next-gen, and also being compared to their competition Battlefield 4 you might not want to account visuals as a game changer for your purchasing descision. The online is addictive (and frustrating) like previous titles which alone does make the game worth a whirl, but with horrible clan support, no real compelling or inspired weapon upgrades, and with horrible FPS drops the online will get tedious and make you question why you're not on Battlefield at times. For 60$ game is a no-go in my humble opinion. I'd wait for the bargain bin sale before picking this COD title up.","January 8, 2014","false","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They finally started to police the servers, and the cheating dropped off significantly.  HOWEVER, whatever triggers they are using to find such people are too restrictive (or just in error), and last week I was permantly banned (after playing for about 400 hours).  To be clear, I do not cheat, have no interest in cheating, and do not have or use things like FOV.  One solution is to just buy a new game (i.e., give them more money) and start from scratch.  The reason for not doing this is that I have no idea why I was banned and would likely just end up getting banned again.  Because of this, I do not recommend this game (at least the multi-player version).","September 17, 2014","false","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They couldn't seem to make a level without some awful gimmick - fly a chopper and apathetically shoot at things, go underwater and shoot at a man, uhoh now he takes more bullets to kill! SPACE? Exciting. Now you're a fricken dog wowowowow\n\nMultiplayer - Pretty much standard fare for every CoD game for the last 5 years. Exact same gameplay and the graphics are hardly better. You get the drop on a guy, you shoot him with laser bullets with no spread or recoil and he dies OR someone gets the drop on you and then you die. The only way to rack up more than 2-3 kills per death is to camp; and luckily with the right perks this game rewards camping. This game makes every other multiplayer shooter seem better just by existing.\n\nSeriously, Battlefield 4 is more along the lines of what this game should have been.

In addition to the running issues, the so called "flow" in multiplayer is non-existent. The maps are just to big for 6v6. Either it takes hours to find some opponents or, you spawn right on top of them. Or they spawn right on top of you. This might be the programmers solution in order to make some gunfights possible, but it takes the whole fun out of the game. There is no fun in spawning and getting picked of by some sniper. Talking of campers. This is the only way to get a decent K/D in this game, since it takes like three shots on target to be killed. Either you camp or you die.\nI don't know, why i spent my money on this game and I know for sure, I will not buy another COD game for a few years now.

This is a master piece with significant improvements over its predecessors in terms of game play, graphics, sound effects, and everything you can imagine which makes Call of Duty: Ghosts both an astoundingly innovative entry in the series and a true next-gen experience. This game should be archived as the sole representation of our entire existence and cast out into the cold reaches of space to show all life in the universe what mankind was created to make, which is a masterpiece thousands of years in the making combining all of our collective knowledge and resources to make this game. It is so great of an achievement of mankind that I call it a game only for the lack of a word that would properly describe this gift from god.","November 13, 2013","true","20.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The menu screen lags for crying out loud. Not too mention the amount of hackers. Sorry COD, I'm done with your universe.

It feels like you are playing Hardcore mode all the time and for some reason, the dogs in MP take more hits than people. Either the guns are overpowered or you dont not get enough health. Campers are a HUGE problem in this game. The new silde thing in this game is pretty cool though. Also, I have heard there are a lot of hackers and I have run into about 3 since ive been playing. Moving on to creating a class: It's annoying. You have to hog "squad points" and it gets boring sometimes. Lastly, still waiting for dedicated servers and hopefully rentable, dedicated servers.\n\nSP- There still is a little lag here, but I really enjoyed the story. Really keeps you on the edge and makes you want to keep playing.\n\nBottom line: This game is not bad, but it is far from the best. Many updates and patches are needed.The main problem for me is again, dieing too easy. I remember in other cod games if someone has shooting you from behind, you could sometimes jump, spin around and maybe have a chance to kill them, but not in this game.  I do not recommend it as of today (12-12-13).","December 12, 2013","false","6.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMiniEbola/recommended/209160/","TheMiniEbola","ScarryBott","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMiniEbola/","45 products in account","I was really looking forward to this game coming out, and when i bought it, i really wish i hadn't wasted my money. The singleplayer is OK, and extintion is quite fun. However the multiplayer was a real let-down. For me, Ghosts multiplayer keeps crashing and during the middle of games, i loose the connection to the host (it isn't my connection, its the game servers). It also lacks in features that games like Black Ops 2 and other Call of Duty games strived. For example, they made quickscoping much harder in ghosts, by removing crosshairs and extending ADS time. Also, as it is designed for a console, it restricts the ability to play in 1080p, and restricts your FOV to 65. IW also restrict the ability to view your ping during a game, and the create-a-class system is terrible. They also made shotguns so OP, more so than Black Ops 2. The squads and safeguard mode in multiplayer is fun thought, and I enjoyed singleplayer. I would recommend buying Battlefield 4 instead, as I have played both games, as in comparison, Battlefield 4 is a much better game, with much higher quality graphics and features.","December 23, 2013","false","8.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"
