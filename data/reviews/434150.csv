Subscribers of mine (and other budget horror aficionados here on Steam) might remember a game called Taken that was released and almost immediately steamrolled by anybody who bought it that hadn't been bribed with a lobster dinner (or, going by the game's budget, odd smelling chocolate the developer found under a bus seat). What made that title so outrageously awful was that it was a maze chaser where your opponent could no-clip through walls to destroy you, homing in on your position the minute you spawned. It rendered the entire experience utterly pointless.\n\nI can't believe I'm levelling the exact same criticism at another game here on Steam within the space of six months. Cannot believe it. Dark Night tells you to hide and listen out for 'the enemy' whose first attack will come at 01:30am, giving you a couple of in-game minutes to find a decent spot to conceal yourself. Or a bad spot. Or just stand in the bloody open. It doesn't matter, because as soon as that timer hits 01:30am, your killer will fly through the nearest wall like a sidewinder missile, dribble all over you and chuck you a game over screen. No chance. No escape. What an utter joke.\n\nVideo evidence and general bemusement below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw4id56DHUg","January 12","false","0.2"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","43","49","13","0"

Good thing for the devs that there's people like ME out there who are happy to fork over nearly five bucks fully NOT expecting a high quality purchase.  Ah, the joys of independent PC horror gaming in the mid-2010's...\n\nMy first playthrough of (the imaginatively titled) Dark Night:  A whole lot of black with the words "press Space to skip" on-screen, and a highly meandering and poorly recorded female voice going on about...something or other.  After about thirty seconds or more of said all-but-black screen and the ♥♥♥♥-poor audio "atmos", I wonder if I'm just meant to press Space anyway, and...oh no, wait, the title of the game has come up.  Right.  I WAS supposed to wait then...good thing I didn't just skip ahead, and miss any of that all-important exposition.\n\nRighty-o, then:  It's a dark night, some girl with a distant, echoey voice is, er, taunting me or flirting with me or something, and...oh, the game has started!  I appear to be in a sparsely-furnished room, and...well, let's have a look around, shall we?  Oh, another sparsely-furnished room and, apart from the odd bed or table with absolutely nothing on top of them, the ONLY decorations around here appear to be...CREEPY DOLLS!  Gee, between the title and the scenery, I wonder what kind of game this is going to be?  It's certainly not heavily influenced by, say, the writings of Stephen King...in which ♥♥♥♥-boring folk with INCREDIBLY normal lives - and INCREDIBLY NORMAL HOMES - are most unexpectedly terrorized by the supernatural.  No, the character you play in this game clearly WANTS to be terrorized by spooky things, or else he WOULDN'T LIVE IN SUCH A RIDICULOUS ♥♥♥♥ING HOUSE.  Anyway, back to the game...\n\nFirst playthrough proceeds for a short while, a couple more otherwise-empty rooms with spooky dolls and...oh!  Appears I have a creepy Nosferatu-type dude who's decided to HANG HIMSELF in one of my many empty rooms!  Isn't that quaint of him?  Oh, the game seems to be warning me that I'm coming up on 1.30am, and I do recall it telling me something about things getting hairy right about th -\n\nOh.  My screen appears to have frozen.  Wait ten seconds, move mouse a bit...no, game has definitely crashed.  Ahem.  Does happen, even to the best of games, I suppose.  Excuse me while I just restart this again...\n\nSecond playthrough.  My expectations are, needless to say, EXTREMELY high by this stage.  Start off much the same, spartan rooms, creepy dolls, guy who's hung himself in my house...find a key, open some doors...oh, look, a hole in the floor, presumably to a basement or something...was that a message which just came up on the screen super-quickly and I neglected to read it and hey, it must be pretty close to 1.30am now and...AAAARRRRGHHH!!  HIGHLY EFFECTIVE JUMP-SCARE, I MUST SAY!!!!  But, er...I was supposed to avoid this...HOW, exactly?!\n\nThird playthrough.  Decide to head straight down the hole this time.  Get jump-scared by same (completely un-scary, come to think of it) guy again, even though it's definitely NOT 1.30am yet.\n\nFourth playthrough.  Don't get far before game crashes again.  Nearly taking my WHOLE COMPUTER with it, this time.  Cheers for that.\n\nFifth playthrough.  Not gonna let this game beat me!  Find some stairs leading up which are INCREDIBLY well-hidden, considering that it DOESN'T appear to be an attic, and assuming there ever was any PRACTICABLE intent behind whoever designed this place, architecturally-speaking.  And I'll be buggered if I can see any good "hiding places", like I'm allegedly supposed to look for, especially when I can't CLOSE ANY DOORS BEHIND ME, or even CROUCH DOWN...eek, nearly 1.30am...oops, crashed again.\n\nSixth playthrough.  Find a hiding place, behind a cupboard, and manage to get to 1.30am without the game crashing.  I think the game is warning me to find another hiding place, but I’m really not sure, ‘cause it’s the same warning which sometimes seems to flash up, like, ten seconds after I ENTER A ROOM, irrespective of whether I've found a hiding place or not.  So I'll be ♥♥♥♥ed if I have any idea what this game even CALLS a hiding spot, much less how you're supposed to effectively creep around from one to the next and...oh, jump-scared again!  By the same actually-very-ordinary-looking guy.\n\nSeventh playthrough...actually, I lie, there isn't one.  I concede defeat.  This game has officially beaten me, and my limited patience.  This game can honestly EAT MY BROWN, STEAMING ♥♥♥♥-NUGGETS, along with all the smart ♥♥♥♥♥ who are bound to come along and ask me how I can possibly write a review for a game with so little "time" up.  You know how I can write a review with so little time up?  I'll tell you how I can write a review with so little time up.  BECAUSE ANY ♥♥♥♥ING FOOL CAN TELL WITHIN TEN ♥♥♥♥ING SECONDS OF STARTING THE GAME UP THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A STINKING PILE OF BLITHERING MONKEY-♥♥♥♥♥.  Good thing that you people have masochists like myself who just CAN'T ♥♥♥♥ING HELP OURSELVES, isn't it now?!\n\nHaving said that, I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel:  Bright Night.  Or perhaps they should save that one for third, and just do Medium-Lit Night in-between?  And hopefully the devs will learn how to bring the rest of the game up to the level of their admittedly well-done jump-scares by then, 'cause ♥♥♥♥ knows, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE WHICH WORKS IN THIS GAME.  Not the scenery, not the "enemy" models, not the "stealth" mechanics...NOTHING.\n\nMan, I tell you, these cheap, quickly-made, cynically-minded "horror" game cash-ins make me SO ♥♥♥♥ING MAD.  Can't wait for the next one.\n\nVerdict: 1/10 (for the jump-scares, and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE.)","January 12","false","0.9"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","29","35","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/434150/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","Gist of the story\nFrom what I could gather, I believe we assume the role of Amelia Ash. She is 15 years old and loves to record herself while she laughs. She loves her life. She loves her friends. She felt that she deserved a better birthday so now she can’t enjoy her life anymore. Her number one dilemma is to fend off several haunted dolls that roam her house. They got a bit unruly and found a way to transform into a “human.”\n\nYeah…I think that’s what it’s about…\n\n---\n\nGameplay\nThe player must survive until 5 am. The game starts at 1 am and the dolls wake up around 1:30 am. During the course of the 5 in-game hours, you must avoid the dolls, things, whatever they are and try to survive. You can press the space bar to listen “closely” but I never found any use for it. Quite frankly, it’s useless because no matter what you do, the enemy will always get you. There’s the standard light source, in the form of a flashlight (pre-patch), or matches (post-patch). An exclamation mark will appear on the lower right corner of the screen if someone is nearby.\n\nThere was a patch that “changed” the game mechanics but in my opinion, it worsens an already terrible game. I actually waited for this patch to happen before I wrote this review but it didn’t change my impression of the game.\n\nSo pre-patch, I found an exploit that if you go to the highest floor of the house, and stand on a certain spot, the “dolls” will not be able to kill you. That’s how I was able to beat the game, by just standing there. Now, post-patch, they added this PaPa character to spice up your day. PaPa corrected the exploit I found while adding new problems in the process. PaPa needs to be taken care of so the player needs to search for a music box and wind it. Wait for an exclamation mark on the screen to appear and calm him down. Perhaps I have the timing wrong but this doesn’t work even when I walk towards him while winding the music box. He still jumps on you and ends the game. (Really, that’s the best part of Dark Night)\n\nThere is a certain amount of cheapness in how PaPa kills you. I don’t mind games being difficult games. I even don’t mind PaPa but he needs some kind of cooldown or he needs to gradually introduce himself throughout the night so that the player can learn his pattern. This is what the other dolls do…well kind of. Their patterns are pretty basic but they have a pattern.\n\nPaPa’s cheapness becomes apparent during the bonus challenge after the credits. It’s still 1:00 and I’m rushing to get the music box. I figured I have some time. Can you guess what happens? PaPa comes rushing in. Then, I thought to myself, “Maybe, I should memorize the route to the music box.” Okay, that’s should be good. NOPE…he still gets you. I repeated the action several times with improvements here and there but he still gets me. Death after death, I am reminded of my inadequacy. I’m just not good enough. Thanks PaPa.\n\nLastly, I did mention briefly that there are light sources. The flashlight is there during pre-patch (v1.09) and v1.12 patch replaces the flashlight with the matches. I thought the flashlight was terrible. The battery drained too fast but at least I can see what’s in front of me and conserving the battery is manageable. However, with the matches, it goes out too fast, and the throw of light is nonexistent (Might as well not have the bloody thing!) I know. It’s not fair to the matches. It is a match versus a flashlight. Of course the flashlight will win the day so why remove it?\n\n*clears throat*\n\nEnding rant. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nDid ya scare me?\nThe scare factor of this game, on the scale of 1-10, I rate Dark Night a 1 out of 10. 1 being, “Where are my scares, danggit??”\n\nThe jumpscares are always coupled with loud noises so that can be startling but other than that, nothing really happens. I chuckled a few times when the other dudes ganged up on me. That was good. PaPa likes to kill you a lot so there’s that…\n\nIf you “listen closely” you can hear garbled groans, moans and voices but they’re nothing more than background noise. They added no tension and just left me annoyed. On the steam page, the game is advertised as a “creepy” game. I wasn’t able to pick up any creepy vibes.\n\n---\n\nGraphics and Technical Issues\nI didn’t have any issues in terms of crashing. I did encounter a bug where the hostile NPCs would glitch around doorways.  It is undetermined whether or not this has been resolved in the patch. The recent patch also added Options in the main menu but there were some strange values in it…\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604462658\n\n---\n\nWrap Up\nI simply cannot recommend this game in good faith. Maybe wait until it’s severely discounted because you’re not missing much. There’s no substance in Dark Night. The “scares” were lousy and the enemies were cheap. I can’t even tell you what the game is about since there are no notes scattered about or narrative that informs you of your purpose. Just survive until 5 am.\n\nI really do not like down voting games because I know developers spend their time working on their games. However, I just couldn’t find anything I like about this game.\n\nI got my first refund. Sorry…\n\n---\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n- It can be funny sometimes although I don’t know if that can be considered as a pro in a supposed horror game.\n\nCons:\n- Buggy enemies\n- Cheap, loud jumpscares aren’t scary\n- In my opinion, the recent patch made the game more terrible.\n\n---\n\nIf you stuck with me this long, and if you have the time, watch me fool around in Dark Night. I must say that in my videos, I am playing on an earlier version of the game but you’ll get a gist of what it is all about. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.\n\nDark Night Video","January 20","false","1.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","1"

Video Impressions Video Here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yvlukc50H8\n\nOMG.  The game starts out sooooo good.  It's extremely effective with all the background screams and strange noises at being just super creepy.  Add in dark shadows everywhere you walk, a room with a hanging man, and scattered about figurines, and the jump scares the game will hit you with are super effective!\n\nBut while the game tells you to move around and to use items and furniture to hide when the game hits 1:30am, it becomes quickly apparent that you're playing a game where surviving or even trying to seems pointless.  Death comes regardless as while hidden, the creatures just insta-pop right in front of your eyes..even if hidden in a corner with a big dresser on one side and two walls in front of you and the other side.  POP!  The creature will just appear out of nowhere right in front of you and kill you!  This is a MADDENINGLY cheap way to get killed in a game like this where you have no chance to defend yourself, fight for your life, or run.  Making it so much more frustrating is it's obvious in my opinion that if this and a few other things were fixed, this game could be so damn good, and I've made these suggestions to the developer in my 2nd play video linked below.\n\nMy 2nd play on Launch Day with my suggestions to the developer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZoB5pzuEFw\n\nTo the developer:\nFix it dev!  You KNOW this is NOT the proper way to program a game like this!  Are you trying to suck off the success of games like "Five Nights at Freddys" with this lazy game that feels like it was "rushed" to get it up for money, or are you trying to make a proper horror game?  It shouldn't take much to fix it and make it 10x better.. watch my video to see exactly why I say this game FAILS as it is, and since it's not "early access", I can't give you a break here, sorry.\n\nDeveloper I'll wait and not refund this game in hopes that you take my suggestions to heart and make this an outstanding jump scare game!  I will be more then happy to re-review this game and change my recommendation if and when the game doesn't feel like it 'cheats' to kill you!","January 11","false","0.6"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","28","51","2","3"
