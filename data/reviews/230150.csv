This is one of the coolest paltformers I've ever played, because unlike other games of type you can't just hold down right arrow key and expect you creature to reach the end of the level. With every creature you have to sit down and figure out how to actually move it's body. I really annoyed making sense of the seemingly random movements of the more complex pre-made creatures.\nAnd let's not forget Incredipedes unique art style. You don't get to see animated wood cut illustrations every day. Thomas Shahan, who was the artist for this game, really deserves a giant bag of cookies. And the same goes for Colin Northway, who programmed this game in flash! I never would have thought that a flash game could look this well and still run at a consistent framerate.\nNote that the base game isn't all that long. It took me 2h to clear all levels(60) in normal mode(normal - play with pre-made creatures, hard design your own creatures). But there's always community levels if you crave more Incredipede action. So if length is a factor for you when it comes to this kind of games you have been warned.","December 7, 2013","true","2.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","2"

Secondly, the primary mechanic (on paper) is a really neat idea; in order to complete a level, you have to design an insect-like creature complete with limbs and ligaments and then independently control those appendages to navigate the world.\n\nUnfortunately Incredipede suffers terribly from the whole mobile port fad. Everything about it screams 99c iOS/Android app and when brought the the big screen and input methods of a PC, the experience is just abysmal.\n\nI think there’s a lot of potential in the game concept, and they clearly have a talented artist(s) but Incredipede is just not a good use of either resources.","November 24, 2014","false","0.2"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

It is a very simple game, one where you're tasked with getting from point 'A' to point 'B' but the main challenge comes from how the physics engine works against you and your lack of mobility. Trying to figure out how to hook a three-legged insectoid onto a ledge and simultaneously pick up an item is quite a daunting feat yet rewarding when pulled off successfully.\n\nThe soundtrack features droning didgeridoos accompanied by tribal percussion and the occasional monkey's screech. The achievements are also quite unorthodox as they encourage you to explore your garden outside, in search of actual wildlife, and aren't related to any in-game accomplishments at all.

For the creative, this game offers a wealth of fun experimental puzzles to work around and solve. Little is restricted, and that is a gutsy move in its own right, but that is where Incredipede stands out. Not only is the art style beautiful and the music lovely, but the gameplay and freeform puzzles make it worth playing.\n\nSadly, the very reason why this game succeeds is also why it fails. Numerous missions can lead to nothing more than trial & error sessions, leaving the player far more frustrated than enamored. Some of the earlier pre-constructed missions are evident of this, as I found myself struggling to succeed after making even the most minor errors. I often found myself knowing exactly what to do, but still ended up trying over and over until luck saw me through. This is the price a game of this design has to pay, and luckily it doesn't break the feeling of wonder, but risks embittering the player after so long.\n\nIncredipede is a rewarding game for the patient player, and is not for everyone, but the lush artwork and immense customization for both the monster and level maker offers anyone who can overlook its flaws a great time, even if it grows stale after so long. Above all, its small pricetag all but frees the player from buyer remorse.\n\nIf you like what you read or still feel uncertain, please, give it a try.

Control is done via two separate directions for multiple muscles, effectively being able to flex and retract muscles individually or in groups. It's like a slightly easier to control QWOP.\n\nThe graphical style is appealing, but ultimately I can't say that I feel that there's that much depth to the game. It's okay, and for folks who are really into 2D puzzle platformers, it's probably a good pick-up. Otherwise, well...it's okay. Not great, but satisfactory.

One of the best indie games on steam without a doubt. There are no physic engine based games that can compare to Incredipede. I'm sure most of you have played some sort of flash game some place where the whole point is to create some sort of contraption, building, or any kind of construct. What I think makes this stand apart from the rest is the mere fact you create a simple character with odd physics, like some sort of construct, with movable parts. You are really only limited to your own imagination. You can create pretty gnarly stuff and get through the various levels. The game itself has some replayability as well. The game allows you to do the levels on Easy, which gives you a premade design to finish the levels, and then you have the Hard mode, which starts you off with the base of the character Quozzle, which is just her round eye. By the way, when you finish the game, don't fret. There is a level editor included in the game. You can create some fun levels and you can share them with your friends as well. I really can't think of any negative things the game has. It is a pretty solid title, and I believe the price is just right for such a game. With that I say, whatever you do this Summer, it won't be as fun as Incredipede. All bugs wish they could have as many limbs as the gal in this game.

I honestly have never played a game as beautiful as this one.\n\nThe concept is similar to QWOP, but this game is more smooth and fun; less frustrating. You play as Incredipede, a bizzare  creature who's had her sisters kidnapped by humans. She has the ability to infinitely grow limbs from her body (distance limited). Four kinds of muscles are attachable controlled by AS and KL buttons.\n\nThe game takes about 13 hours if you play the Hard mode (in hard mode you have to create your own Incredipede for all levels, levels are harder as well) and probably 15 hours if you're dedicated enough to play player-published levels. At first though, the game can get pretty damn hard to control.\n\nAnother thing is the achievements. The game demands you to go outside and explore the real-world nature and learn about it more. The achievements are not checked in any way but I thought this was pretty damn genius. Good game to get little kids' ♥♥♥ outside.\n\nDownside is that I actually expected each levels to be much longer than that - like an indie platform - it would've definitely been fantastic. Some players may also find the limb movements to be slow, but well, it didn't bother me.\n\nIf you're planning on buying this game, go ahead. I bought this for $2 during the sale and don't think $10 is worth the contents (even though the game is superb-eautiful).\n\nEmoticon should be added!","June 20, 2015","true","19.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Each level you get a new creature to manuver. A is to rotate limbs left, S is to rotate limbs right. The object of each one screen level is to cross a beam of light finish line. Between getting to the beam of light, you can collect a cherry or knock a green apple or square watermellon into the beam of light to collect it. Each level has a cherry or two if not a green apple or two. Each level takes a few seconds. Each world has a string of more than a dozen levels to complete in order. To enter the next world, you need to have obtained enough cherries, apples and square watermellon.\n\nThere's not much of a game here. Somehow this is considered a puzzle game, because its puzzling to figure out how to move your creature? The puzzle here is to manuver your creature. Have it crawl, roll, and do whatever you can to reach the finish line. That's the game of it all. It just doesn't seem like a puzzle so much as deliberately movement. It is like if you have a bucket crawl NOT ROLL to a finish line. Is that fun? Would rolling be easier? You don't get to roll. Just crawl.\n\nMaybe there are people just rolling over on the floor giggling over how odd these creatures are and their movement, but I think its sad. A one eye creature who's life is so incredibly difficult that every movement to get from point A to B is such a challenge that its 'a puzzle'. Imagine if a person just had a torso, head and an arm, crawling or swimming around.\n\nHard mode is still really easy, but the complexity is with that mode is you'll get to customize your creature with limbs, arms and so on. Depending on what the level allows for. Most levels can be solved with any kind of creature without any real complexity. Tougher levels like those entirely over pits require you to use trial and error to make it through.\n\nThere is a sandbox mode to let you make your own creatures and even a level editor, but when the game just isn't much fun, why bother?\n\nThis game is just not fun. Most all of the creatures have slow movement if its not overly complex to even get it to move by using the simple controls. On the plus side, it has a unique art style and it is a soothing game, like watching paint dry.

You traverse through various levels using creatures made up of "legs" and "muscles".  At the start these are all creatures designed by the developer but later you make your own.  I found it to be a very interesting concept but the design was lacking.  Creatures just don't behave like anything you would expect and getting them to do what you want is a chore.  It can become quite frustrating at times.  Designing them sounds like fun but making anything with some complexity is quite difficult.  I really can't recommend this to the general gaming community but I still found it a worthwhile distraction so some small minority will likely enjoy it to some degree as well.  Overall a nice attempt with an interesting concept that just doesn't quite come together.","December 14, 2013","false","12.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The game follows Quozzle, a lone Incredipede on a quest to rescue her sisters.

You can give her antlers or a tail, use nature as a blueprint or strike out in weird new directions. Control Quozzle as she learns to swing through the trees, climb sheer cliffs, dance over rivers of lava, and even soar through the air on thermal winds.\n\nIncredipede was made by a small team headed by Colin Northway, author of Fantastic Contraption. It was written while traveling in over a dozen countries including Honduras, Turkey, Japan, and Costa Rica.\n\n- Make and control a staggering array of creatures\n- 120 levels in three beautifully crafted worlds\n- Send your creatures to your friends to try to control\n- Use the Level Editor to create your own puzzles\n- Immersive ambient soundscape","December 21, 2013","true","345.2"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","11","29","0","1"

Or if you're a millionaire and just don't care.\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun, although it can get frustrating. Sometimes it feels a bit like QWOP, but your actions are more successful. It has two modes, the standard one where you play with a creature that was already made, and hard in which you can make your own creatures. I haven't played the hard mode. I suppose half of the fun is creating your own levels and creatures, and if you're not the creative type, reeeaally think twice before buying. It's very short, so if you're not into making content, you'll be done with it pretty quickly. It also hardly has any story, the whole thing is like two cutscenes right at the start and at the end, and it's pretty anticlimactic. But the art is really nice, and the music as well, although it strangely turns off and on randomly, I don't know.\n\nOh, and it has stupid achievements. I remembered when I was adding the tag "casual" (it does feel like it), it has a tag "easy achievements". Easy? Nope. They're not in-game, they're like "go outside and let a bug walk on your hand". All of them, six or something, are outsidey, and almost all involve interacting with insects. I mean well, nature, okay, that's nice, but, you know, tell that to someone with arachno- or entomophobia.\n\nSo, all in all, if you like creating your own content after you're done with the basic game (or even don't care about the gameplay), it's probably gonna be great for you. If not though, think it through and maybe wait for a sale.","August 5, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artstyle might be a bit discouraging at first but you get to appreciate it after getting used to the scenery. The point of the game is to make your way to the end point while also collecting the collectibles in the level. This can be quite challenging, since the movement of your charachter, Quozzle is not intuitive and it takes some time to get used to. In a weird way, this game made me empathize to some extent with the people with physical disablities, who have to make a lot of efforts for doing even the simplest tasks. I don't know if this has been intentional or not, but in any case, it is an interesting experience.\n\nWhat's interesting about the puzzles, is that unlike many puzzle/platformer games, when you can't get something right, smashing the keyboard and doing that part over and over, usually doesn't get you anywhere. You will have to be patient, and know what you are doing. In that sense, the game has a meditative aspect which is quite refreshing.\n\n\nAll in all, it is a unique game which I would strongly recommend for anyone interested in puzzle games.","March 29, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact that the puzzles almost never call for anything elaborate, and are better solved using very simple and comically situational designs means that Incredipede is, however, well-designed to its purpose and makes for a perfectly serviceable puzzle game. That still leaves me dreaming of what might have been, though.","November 7, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was fun figuring out the best way to move in order to get to the end point while collecting all the items. It was challenging for me to find out what kind of creature I have to create in order to finish each level. And if that isn't enough for you the game even has a level editor where you can make your own levels and share with other people!\n\nJust make sure that you play through the regular levels first because it teaches you a lot of the interesting mechanics the game has to offer. Only then can you excel in the hard mode and in level editor.","September 18, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't think it was quite as fun as the trailers made it out to be, but it has beautiful music and a fantastic art style. Pretty solid game overall. Very frustrating at times, but never so frustrating that I never completed it.\n\nI give it a 7/10 as a puzzle platformer game.\nWorth a play if you enjoy these kinds of games, but people who find them boring or frustrating will probably find this one boring and frustrating too.","January 17","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, feels a lot like something I'd find as a flash game. Mechanics are fairly limited, puzzles get repetitive eventually, and loses a lot of its replayability pretty quickly. I personally don't recommend paying ten bucks for the game as it's listed now, but if you can get it on sale, I highly recommend it for a few hours of fun. 7/10","May 28","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also get to create those creatures before a level starts in the hard mode and there's also a sandbox mode where you can create you own creatures, levels and challenges.\n\nThe visuals are pretty enticing but when the entire game is based on struggling with controls (and rage-quits) and bare bones game modes and challenges, I really don't feel like this game can be recommended. Music is bland and everything outside the singular creature designs and possibilities factor are pretty run of the mill as well.\n\nI was pretty amused with it for the first 50 levels but by god I'm definitely going to finish the entire 120-or-so levels or even recommend the game to anybody else. You'll find much better puzzle + pretty games out there believe me. Keep searching.","June 6","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
