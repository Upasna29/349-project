"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/391220/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider is far slicker and more balanced than that 2013 reboot. Lara’s graduation from naïve punch-bag to confident adventurer opens up her skills as she traverses the ice of the Siberian Mountains, sidling across cliff-sides, using axes to climb sheer faces, firing arrows from her hand-crafted bow to create rope swings. Abilities learned in the first game that are built upon here.\n\nSet one year after the events that began her journey to becoming the ultimate raider of tombs, Lara is now obsessed with completing her late father’s quest to find The Prophet’s Tomb. Despite concerns by her pal Jonah, she embarks on a quest to snowy Siberia, determined to discover the truth about The Prophet before a shadowy military group called Trinity does. It is said that whomever solves the mystery of the Prophet will unlock the secret to immortality.\n\nBelieve it or not, that’s the quick version of the plot summary. Throughout the campaign, many secrets and a few well-placed plots twists are revealed, with tons of content on the history of the Prophet delivered by way of audio logs. In the last game every time Lara came across these logs, she would need to stop moving and listen to these entries. Worse, the backstory was not at all compelling. In Rise of the Tomb Raider this function is exactly the same, but the events leading up to finding this quasi-religious leader is engaging. It helps that the voice acting is utterly convincing now.\n\nSiberia itself is a beautiful, hostile and believable setting. Storms whirl, battering Lara as she crunches onward through sheet-white snow; abandoned Russian military outposts sit rusting between peaks. And further down, the snow melts away and forests sprout up, the tribespeople setting up camps and huts between the trees. Despite every inch being meticulously designed with conveniently placed hooks and overhanging tree branches to aid Lara’s clambering, there is a tremendous sense of place. The whistle of the wind and a cinematic flair to framing environments as huge expanses communicate a sense of isolation. One woman against the elements.\n\nCrystal Dynamics put forth a fantastic effort with audio and sound for Rise of the Tomb Raider. When you hear the sound of Lara’s boots crunching against the fresh fallen snow, you’ll be brought right into the game. I could almost feel the bow stretching to its limits by the sound of the string crackling and tightening. This is good audio, people. When the sound design can make you feel the action you’re doing, that’s an A+ in my book. Lara’s voice work is remarkable. She could be brought to life through her dialogue alone.\n\nThe gameplay of Rise of the Tomb Raider is reminiscent of the 2013 game which requires the player to control Lara in a third person perspective which features exploring, climbing, stunts, combat and a healthy dose of puzzles. The title also boasts some great quick-time events which flawlessly switch from ingame to an interactive cinema that requires you to push a button or perform an action such as jumping at the right time or attempting to use your pick axe.\n\nClimbing mechanics seem much sturdier then the previous game as you precariously explore dangerous mountains and forgotten cities looking for clues, documents and ancient treasures. So as you jump, climb and hang, the control of Lara is perfect and even the wall scrambles which require you to run up the wall in order to reach a climbing point all work well.\n\nCombat is another element of the game which works well and it’s always a joyous moment when Lara gets her handguns because it pays homage to the original series. So while you shoot and use a variety of different weapons against your enemies, you’ll also need to use the environment to your advantage that may be covering or using something else to destroy your enemies.\n\nThere’s a stronger emphasis on stealth this time around, using the environment around Lara to get the edge on her opponents. So for example, in most encounters, at least outside of the guided and highly entertaining cinematic set pieces, enemies won’t know they’re being hunted unless the player makes themselves known. There are trees to climb to avoid detection, shrubs to move through to silently incapacitate foes and various distractions to use to your advantage. There’s even a minimal detection meter that will pop up over enemy heads, but this feels a bit underutilized as it’s just a two state alert (curious and found) and rarely came into play.\n\nAs you progress, you are awarded points that can the be used to purchase these skills plus the items you found in the world can also be used to upgrade your weapons and equipment. Apart from the main mission, there are also challenge missions such as exploring a new tomb or using some newly acquired skill to help complete this task. This definitely increases the gameplay.\n\nCrystal Dynamics have effortlessly done the impossible with Rise of the Tomb Raider, crafting a sequel that is superior to their reboot in every single way possible. It’s a bigger, more expansive experience that has a captivating narrative, engrossing gameplay loops and an absolutely stunning presentation.","January 28","true","177.2"," 287 of 342 people (84%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","84","287","342","16","8"

RoTR takes place one year after the events of TR2013 and you are of course playing as the character we all know and love, Lara Croft. This time around, Lara has set her sights on something known as the Divine Source, an ancient artefact that her father was trying to locate until his untimely death. While your adventure begins in Syria, the majority of the game takes place in Siberia in an area once controlled by the Soviets. Lara’s interest in the Divine Source has attracted the unwanted attention of an organisation known as Trinity who also wish to find the Source though they want it for different reasons, they are willing to do whatever it takes to get their hands on it. While the story isn’t really RoTR’s main selling point it is an engaging and for the most part well-written story that ties all of the missions together well.\n\nAs you’d expect from a recent release, RoTR is an absolutely gorgeous game though you’ll need quite a powerful rig to run it on the higher settings. While the appearance of the game does help make exploration more interesting the game is still enjoyable on lower settings. Personally I was running the game on lowest graphics settings on 1280x720 (my native res is 1920x1080) and while it wasn’t exactly easy on the eye I didn’t find that it took away from my enjoyment of the game. While we’re on the topic of appearances, I’ll briefly mention animations. RoTR is very well animated, as you’d hope, both with lip sync and general movements which really helps the characters feel real and give the player a real sense of just how cold Siberia is and what harsh conditions the characters have to put up with.\n\nRoTR’s gameplay is very similar to TR2013 though there is less of a focus on combat and more of a focus on the exploration side of things. If you’re familiar with TR2013 then you’ll know that the reboots are third person action adventure games with a few puzzles thrown in, if you can really call them puzzles. While RoTR has cut down on combat the gunplay is still a hell of a lot of fun, especially the stealthy portions which make up most of the enemy encounters in the game. You’ve got four different types of weapons at your disposal: the bow & arrow, a rifle, a pistol and a shotgun. While you start out with a bow the other three weapon types are unlocked over the course of the game with a few variations to unlock too. Speaking of unlocks, one of RoTR’s new additions is an item shop where you can buy equipment using the collectible currency in the game. While it can be handy to have the shop available to you it’s not a huge problem if you can’t find enough of the currency to buy what you want as most of what can be bought in the shop can also be found just by playing through the game. As well as this currency there are a few other types of collectibles most of which act as a way to feed you the backstory, such as Russian documents that discuss the layout of the building you find yourself in or even the origins of some of the in-game factions.\n\nOne of the other new additions is crafting equipment as well as ammo and bandages. The equipment you can craft is what you’d expect, ammo capacity upgrades though they do require quite a lot of resources which you’ll find by hunting animals as well as keeping an eye out for certain things in the world. You can now craft arrows, both regular and special, as well as use things you find in the environment to craft useful things such as using a bottle of alcohol and a rag to make a Molotov cocktail. Bandages can be crafted in and out of combat, though you’ll probably only need them in combat, and are again made using resources found in the world around you. Of course there’s also weapon upgrades in the game which you again make using resources found in-game and there are quite a few new outfits for Lara which are mainly unlocked by completing certain missions. There are a few other new mechanics introduced in a similar vein to the rope arrows we became acquainted with in TR2013 (which you also get in RoTR) but I won’t talk about them so I don’t spoil them, I will say they’re a lot of fun to use though.\n\nA big part of any Tomb Raider game is obviously the challenge tombs you can play. This is another area in which RoTR is very similar to TR2013, the tombs aren’t hugely challenging and they’re quite short but you do get nice rewards for completing them. Rather than the weapon part rewards in TR2013, RoTR offers players special skills for completing the optional challenge tombs which can’t be unlocked in any other way. The skills aren’t game changing with what they offer the player but they do make it worthwhile completing the tombs if you wouldn’t want to otherwise though the tombs are pretty enjoyable anyway. The similarities continue when you look at the skills available to you when you level up. While there are some new skills related to some of the new gameplay mechanics the majority of the skills are either the same or very similar to those available in TR2013. The skills are still useful of course but it can be a little bit frustrating having to unlock skills Lara learnt an in-world year ago (if you played TR2013). Speaking of skills, a couple of them do feel almost like cheats, such as once which gives you automatic headshots on three enemies when your bow is fully drawn but if you do think that's cheating you can simply avoid unlocking it.\n\nLike I said earlier, RoTR seems to be less focused on combat and more focused on exploration. RoTR gives the players several large areas and a few smaller ones to play around in and these areas can be explored in whatever way you want at whatever pace you want. If you want to you can just rush through the game, only doing the story missions and complete the game in around twelve hours. The game really is meant to be played with you doing at least a little exploration though. It is beneficial to go through the areas doing the tombs, exploring crypts, hunting and finding the strongboxes mainly for the upgrades that these will give you access to, making the later game slightly easier where the enemies are significantly more difficult. If you want to do a 100% completion run through the game you’re obviously going to be spending a lot more time in the game since you’ll have to go back through each and every area but I imagine most players won’t be aiming for this so it’s probably going to be around fifteen hours of gameplay for most players, that’s the main story anyway. There’s also a new game mode to keep you busy called Expedition Mode. Expedition Mode lets you replay story missions while using cards (earned by reaching certain story milestones and can be bought using in-game currency earned in a similar way) to either make the level more challenging or easier. The difficulty factor of the cards contributes to how many points you earn, points can then be compared with your friends for each level with the game’s leaderboards.\n\nVerdict\nWhile Rise of the Tomb Raider doesn’t offer huge improvements over the previous title it does give fans of the reboot more of what they enjoyed. It’s a gorgeous game with great gameplay and while it does require a good PC it can still be enjoyed on lower graphics settings.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","February 3","true","17.4"," 212 of 255 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","212","255","9","10"

This is without doubt one of the best looking games out on the market now. Whether it is the lifelike snow where you can see the miniscule ice crystals, the way the sun rays shine through a massive cave system or the elegant painted on the walls of ancient tombs… It simply is just gorgeous. But also the small details will make you fall in love with this game, like Lara wringing her hair out after taking a swim.\n\nRise of the gameplay:\nRise of the tomb raider has smooth controls, comparable to the previous title. It plays the same but you have more options now: for the first time you can climb in trees (hello assassin’s creed) and more weapons are available. Especially the bow and arrow feel really good compared to the one in Tomb Raider 2013. By improving previous features and adding new ones, Rise of the Tomb Raider plays like one of the old tomb raiders but still has a pleasant fresh feeling to it.\n\nRise of the tombs:\nIn the previous titles, tombs were small caves where you could find some extra ammo or some goodies, or a little experience if you’re lucky. The tomb design in this game is really powerful and makes me wonder why they are optional. They all contain memorable puzzle that will provide variety from all the action. Don’t expect any mind-bending puzzles that force you to look up a guide, but they all are gold-grabbing-finger licking good.\n\nRise of the conclusion:\nCrystal Dynamics created a dazzling exciting adventure which exceeds her predecessors in every aspect. A magnificent action-adventure game with more freedom,  both in exploration and gameplay.\n\nThe real Lara has risen!","January 28","true","4.2"," 368 of 494 people (74%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","74","368","494","38","16"

More importantly, does this game have puzzles?\n\nPresent and expected are the improbably improbable puzzles ubiquitous to the Lara universe; I ‘pray’ for these contraptions with secrets hidden beneath massive moveable walls and oversized cogs each controlled through a series of timed switches powered by gravity and water. A little bit of patience always yields a Codex with life changing knowledge (nudge-nudge wink-wink).  Inexplicably these puzzles seem to have been relegated to the “optional side missions”, a direct in-game quote. These are the classic Tomb Raider pieces that I love and I completed them as soon as possible; they always yielded extra XP, gold coins and skills; I wish these puzzling sections had been way longer. What then is ‘central’ to this digital archeological hunt? Read on….\n\nThe main plot unfolds wrapped as a “third person shooter”. Feeling a bit shaky are you? Yep, the spelunking has really taken a back seat to the shooter gameplay. There should have been far more dialogue options for negotiations, skillful stealth mode with zero death, and more creative gameplay in the central campaign.  Has Crystal Dynamics made a choice or a mistake? Don’t get me wrong, I love shooters but not this one. Combat with guns in tight spaces and an over the shoulder camera leads to a poor combat experience. Would you like a game with great combat, weapons and well designed arenas? Try Unreal Tournament 3 Black edition instead. Consequently, I found myself  avoiding all main story paths as long as possible because they were so combat unpleasant, and eventually I set the game to the easiest setting to make these encounters as short as possible. What else made the campaign a grind? The controls are ‘tuned’ for parkour platforming; mid combat my character kept putting away the gun and jumping into water or grabbing a ledge; who wants fudge? The default graphics settings use over-the-top screen effects making it uncomfortable: ‘water splashes on the lens’, ‘depth of field’, and others, all of them summing to a ‘digital finger in the eye’. Thank you Crystal Dynamics for letting me turn off all those ‘enhancements’ in the options menu.\n\nCrafting and skill trees were welcome and enjoyable although heavily dependent on hunting. The upgrade mechanics lead to a veritable slaughter-fest: I must have killed over 700 bunny rabbits, 300 deer, 50 wild boars, 10 grizzly bears, and a partridge in a pear tree. In fact I started farming previous maps for humans because they had the specialized parts. The weapon upgrades yielded for the most part palpable advantages in engagements: Would anyone like an RPG arrow head? Woooooo!  The remaining XP system felt hollow and served to redirect you back to previous maps, that is, if you want to find all coin stashes, hidden provisions, caves and relics. Meh. This is just a poor substitute for replayability.\n\nCrystal Dynamics have done superbly well with the extra game modes. I was particularly impressed with “Endurance” mode placing Lara in the Siberian wilderness to see how many days you can survive; requirements to eat, stay warm, collect resources, craft, and collect artifacts improve your chance of survival and reward the players having skill. Many players will enjoy “Score Attack” mode, an arcade version of the campaign. “Replay” game mode allows you to compare yourself to your Steam buddies through point accumulation.\n\nWhat else should you look forward too?\nA visually stunning and sprawling game world. check.\nTons of Steam Achievements. check.\nOne Special achievement for teaching BBQ chicken to fly. Sweet!\nPuzzle deaths: 30 times in a row with a game reload. Blame wonky controls. Rage quit. double check.\n‘Collision detection’ that doesn’t know ‘collision’ from a ‘hole in the wall’. triple check.\nExcessive grunts, breathing, and expletives in that sublime British accent. Yeah.\n\nBuy this game; all Tomb Raider fans will find something they were looking for and ‘more’. Thumbs up.\n\n\nMy score 9 / 10\n10 / exemplary execution of the genre with compelling innovation\n9 / exemplary execution of the genre don’t miss out, for fans of the genre and the curious alike\n8 / for well done not a must play, fans of the genre and newbs will be happy it is well done\n7 / for calibrated expectations only, fans of the genre would not miss out if they skipped this\n6 / only for serious fans of the genre for whom game play with bugs is acceptable\n5 / enough bugs to make me unhappy\n\n2016.02.17","February 18","true","85.5"," 169 of 213 people (79%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","79","169","213","24","5"

It's a glorified QTE system. Expand on the jumping system, design the levels so that I can jump, hang and land everywhere and have to figure out the way on my own, not this linear solution.

The last generation saw games evolve past pretty pixels and simple gameplay mechanics as studios set about achieving their cinematic ambitions thanks to the available technology. The upside of all of this is that while trying to beat Hollywood at its own game, game studios and publishers are slowly placing good storytelling at the heart of their games. Audiences are growing up and demanding more mature content while graphics are constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of realism. Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on which side of the coin you fall, gaming characters now need to appeal to a far more broader demographic than merely just teenage boys. So out with the highly sexualized, top-heavy gymnast who previously enjoyed traversing the snow peaked caps of Nepal in a set of hot-pants and tank top while supporting Mount Boobius on her chest in favor of someone more real and tangible - and flat chested.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623439786\nLara's origin story worked wonders giving us a more real, relatable and well rounded Lara that was not only NOT invincible but bled, cried and groaned. A lot! Where the origin story focused on survival, Rise of the Tomb Raider grapples with the nature of obsession with a head-strong Lara letting her obsession with with her late father's research into the lost city of Kitezh and the promise of a immortality take her down a dangerous path. Her father's partner, Ana, attempts to warn her from following this obsession with Kitezh as this sadly drove him to ruin and eventually suicide. Of course Lara ignores the warning, heading off to Syria to find The Prophets Tomb which supposedly houses the Prophet of Constantinople and hopefully the key to immortality. Of course things are not as simple as that. They really ever are. Hot on her heels, and to make sure she does not succeed with her current mission, are an ancient organisation of knights known as Trinity who have their own dubious reasons for wanting to get their hands on the the divine source.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raiders plot is a bit more expansive this time around with varied locations that sees Lara traverse from the dusty deserts of Syria to the snow peaked mountains of Siberia and its surrounding forests. Once Kitezh has been located and found an element of the supernatural is included where players will get to explore a hidden world ruled over by a sect known as the Deathless Guardians. Each locale is exquisitely designed with some of the most shiniest and beautiful graphics ever to grace the PC bringing each area to vivid life . Rise of the Tomb Raider is definitely the most downright lovely and detailed game I have ever played on the PC. While my specs where below minimum with regards to the GPU requirements (a 4GB mobile 680M GPU), the game still looked outstandingly good. I can only imagine how beautiful it can or could look with more PC power at the helm. Even with my minimum spec GPU I was able to sustain a relatively good 30FPS throughout most of the adventure. However, for some strange reason cut scenes really caused the frames to tank sometimes even dipping into single digit territory. While this didn't happen too often I did find that the frames tended to fluctuate wildly during cut scenes. Hopefully this is an issue Crystal Dynamix are hard at work trying to solve as it also affects beefier systems.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623682491\nWhen it comes to gameplay, Rise of the Tomb Raider tinkers with very little that made the reboot so successful. Cover mechanics are as solid as they where back in the reboot with skills and perks getting a much needed and more detailed work over. If like me you where blown away by the reboots escape sequences, Rise of the Tomb Raider features a fair few that amplify the action and are simply exhilarating. Often I found myself  needing to catch a breather after each had just taken place. Much like the first one your successful run through each of these gauntlets will be determined by how quick your reflexes are as well as your muscle memory. None of them are particularly long so dying during a sequence thankfully doesn't end up becoming a chore. Rise of the Tomb Raider also features more tombs to raid this time around although they are not as detailed or intricate as the tombs from the past. It appears in this department we are taking baby steps.\n\nWhile the reboots tombs where laughable at how simple they where, Rise of the Tomb Raider at least has the good graces not to overly dumb them down this time around but still they are not nearly where I was hoping them to be. The original series often struck a fine balance between gun battles and exploring and while exploring now also comes in the form of an open world to discover it would be nice if the next installment gave us tombs that are way more substantial. Gun battles against the game worlds enemies also appears to have been toned down somewhat from the first adventure although the ruthlessness with which Lara dispatches her enemies, I fear she may be in danger of turning into a complete psychopath. I highly recommend setting the game difficulty above normal because normal is just way to easy. Having gone back to play the reboot straight after finishing up the sequel it becomes very apparent, very quickly that Rise of the Tomb Raiders normal difficulty is a bit of a cakewalk. Having never touched the multiplayer portion that came with the reboot I certainly didn't miss it this time around. Instead the game offers up score attack modes for each level you clear that can then be used to challenge your friends. There is even an in-game card system that you slowly unlock through the main games campaign that grants perks and traits which are fully customizable and can be loaded in or out of a level when challenging your friends to beat your high scores.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=617638239\nRise of the Tomb Raider is that sequel that, while not straying too far off the beaten path, offers up everything the reboot did but on a far larger and grander scale. The games core systems have also been refined in positive way, such as the fact that Lara can now actually run, through to crafting and hunting that overall make the game a far more enjoyable one.  There is a lot to interact with here and thankfully the systems don't come across as too simple as the survival element of the reboot did or end up hindering ones enjoyment. With an adventure that is incredibly cinematic, Rise of the Tomb Raider is one of those games that I imagine is just as much fun to watch than play. Thanks to some truly phenomenal facial tech and and excellent voice cast headed by the fantastic Camilla Ludington, Rise of the Tomb Raider easily rises to the top as the consummate AAA blockbuster for 2016 that for the most part nails everything it sets out to do. Lara Croft is once again reborn and I for one eagerly await the release of her next adventure because as it stands, Rise of the Tomb Raider is now my favorite action adventure title. 2016 may still be young but Rise of the Tomb Raider certainly ranks up there with the best of the best. In fact by year end it very may well nab my GOTY for the year.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 27","true","38.0"," 135 of 172 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","135","172","7","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/391220/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider is an action adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. This game is the sequel to the 2013 release of Tomb Raider.  Rise of the Tomb Raider was released initially on Xbox in November 2015, but has just been released in January 2016 for PC. It is also due to release on PS4 later in the year.\n\nFans of the series will probably know what to expect when it comes to Tomb Raider. The reboot in 2013 changed the formula to the original series, and Rise of the Tomb Raider continues with the reboot’s theme. You play as Lara Croft in a third person view and you have to battle through enemies and solve puzzles with a good amount of platforming involved too.  Much like the previous game, there is also a crafting system, allowing you to create medi-packs, upgrades for your weapons, different ammunition along the way as you collect materials.  What I wasn’t too keen on in the previous release was that a lot of the game play was focused on the “all guns blazing” aspect, whereas Rise gives you a lot more option to play stealthily. You can of course go with route one and go gung-ho, but if you want to sit back and plan your attacks meticulously without being spotted, you can do that too.  The weaponry in the game is almost the same as the previous game too; with my favourite returning, Lara’s bow.  There is now the addition of throwing items such as tin cans and Molotov’s at the enemies to either act as a distraction or just for damage.  The platforming has had some interesting additions, such as being able to scramble up walls that are a little too high for Lara’s regular jump. This makes traversing the environments a little bit easier than normal.\n\nI played Rise of the Tomb Raider on 4k, with all of the graphics turned up to max, and sweet baby Jesus this is one gorgeous looking release. The facial animations on every single character are finished to perfection. It is almost like you are sitting straight in front of Lara, so much detail and effort has gone into making everything look just gorgeous! I find myself saying this every couple of weeks, but the animation has seriously blown everything out of the water in my opinion. Not to mention the stellar voice acting throughout the game too, with Camilla Luddington returning to play Lara Croft.\n\nI can’t say that Rise was a very difficult game to complete; there are a lot of puzzles to complete throughout the play through, but none of them are so hard I had to refer to a walkthrough. You simply have to study your surroundings for a second before taking any action. The combat scenes are probably the trickiest part of the game, especially in the later stages of the game when you are pretty much forced into using your bow against hordes of enemies instead of being able to rip them to shreds with your sub machine guns.\n\nThroughout your play through of the game, you will find artefacts in abundance. These upgrade certain skills for Lara when finding them and you can even be rewarded with regular experience points if you choose that talent when you level up. They add a lot of extra plot and lore to the story with a lot of it revolving around a lot of the main characters. You will also find that there are hundreds of items to collect, whether it be scavenging for materials to make an upgrade for a weapon, or finding the collectables, you will never find a section of a level empty with nothing for you to want to explore and find.  A new addition for Rise is side quests. Throughout the game you will find a handful of side missions that you can complete which will reward you with either a new weapon or piece of equipment to help you on your travels. Whilst you can complete the game without any of the rewards, they are simply there as an additional resource for skills and experience.\n\nI finished my play through of Rise in just over 12 hours. Whilst this is still fairly short, it is certainly an improvement over the previous game which only took me about 7 hours to complete.  There are a few additional game modes you can play when finishing the game. You can firstly go back and replay older chapters in order to finish collecting and finding items. You can replay the chapters but on an elite difficulty whilst also keeping all of your equipment and skills from your previous save though.  Score attack, which means trying to complete a chapter as quickly as possible but with a new set of rules in place, such as chaining together different attacks.  This means you can probably get about 20 hours of content out of the game, maybe more if you are really into it.  There is a season pass available for the game which promises a couple things, such as extending the single player experience in the story, and will also add a multiplayer mode.\n\nAs I said above, I played the game on 4K with all my settings ramped up to max. I was able to play the game perfectly fine with 60 FPS. The game was installed on an SSD so loading times were almost none existent. I played the game with keyboard and mouse due to the need to be quite precise when it comes to aiming and jumping etc.\n\nThe latest release of from the Tomb Raider series really does it self-proud in my opinion. Whilst some may consider this game bad due to the poor sales figures it received when releasing, a lot of that was due to another extremely popular title being released on the same day. Now the game has come to the proper gaming platform, it is truly an experience everyone needs to take for themselves.  The price of £35,99 on Steam is OK. I personally don’t ever tend to buy games for full price but this game was one that I actually pre-purchased just for my love of the series and I am more than happy with my purchase with this game.  As we’ve seen with the last game in the series, it will go on sale fairly quickly, so you may want to wait a few months to get it for at least half off.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

READ BELOW.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider is better at everything Tomb Raider (2013) did, which was a pretty good game. Rise is as good of an action adventure game of this type I've played. If you're into these types of games, this is one of the best ones, plain and simple.\n\nSome minor complaints are that it starts to narrow to an action oriented game only in the last couple of hours. Throughout the game there is a healthy medium between exploring and combat. The last couple of area's of the game look very cool but basically cannot be explored at all. First of all, there is nothing noteworthy to find in them and secondly you're 'forced' into combat constantly. It's not that the main game lets you avoid combat, but you can engage with it when you are ready for the most part. In the final hours it's all: 'nope, more combat, go!'\n\nIt makes sense narratively, but I'd rather they would've come up with a way for it to make sense to still explore and be stealthy if you choose.\n\nThe very final hours are combat overload and keep spawning guys against you. It's not the greatest, but unlike most other games, it doesn't feel ridiculous. You are plenty powerful at that point and even playing on the highest difficulty setting I had no problem disposing of everyone. And the combat is fun. So it was still a fun section, just not as good as the rest of the game.\n\nNow as for DLC...\n\nDO NOT ♥♥♥♥ING BUY ENDURANCE MODE. It is a shell of a game mode. Survival? Nope. Here's the thing, it has a Hunger Meter and a Warmth meter. Kind of like Don't Starve. Shoot one deer, loot it, whoop! Hunger is full again. No food preperation, no setting up camp, nothing. There is also no crafting or camp creation. It's just a bunch of fires spread around the map and you can light them for 5 wood. Clothing has zero influence on all of it. You can wear a tanktop if you want. Stand near the fire, it's full again.\n\nAll meaningless survival stats. Start the game up, 2 minutes in you have a bunch of wood for fires and you shot a couple deer. Congratiolations! You've beaten Endurance Mode!\n\nYeah... it's bad. There is nothing to do to actually make survival matter. I was expecting skinning bears for better clothing or having to craft camp fires and build a shelter. Nope, none of that.\n\nDon't. Buy. Endurance. Mode.\n\nIt's a waste of 10 bucks.","January 31","true","21.9"," 118 of 154 people (77%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","77","118","154","12","4"

The world feels more natural as it's full of different types of collectibles and puzzles. Unlike the first game, crafting different ammo types and weapons require a variety of materials. You need to scavenge for wood for arrows, herbs and cloth for medkits and so on.\n\nYou've got a "Survival vision" mode that highlights many objects throughout the environment, although it isn't necessary to use if you don't want to.\n\nAs you discover different relics, Lara will learn how to read languages, which then gives you the ability to read more complex artifacts with said languages. It's a pretty interesting system, and although it isn't much, it just adds to the feeling that you're progressing.\n\nThe exploration and platforming is the same for the most part. You can hook into walls, do a bit of a scurry/wall jump thing to grab ledges. Most importantly, it feels very tight, and if you die, it's your fault for missing the jump.\n\nThe combat has gotten more interesting.\nStealth has much more to it. You can distract enemies by throwing objects such as glass bottles, or hide on branches above them.\n\nLoud combat also gives you more options. You can throw lanterns or gas cans to light people on fire, or craft poison arrows that stun enemies in its radius.\n\nCrafting is very easy, as it just requires you to hold one button. Even while you're fighting, Lara can just craft up some arrows, as long as you have the required resources.\n\nSitting at a campfire gives you the ability to unlock perks that may come in handy. Explosive damage resistance, or chance to loot an arrow off an enemy after you've shot them with it. These add variety, and compliment your feeling of improving alongside your weapon upgrades. You can also change your outfit. Some are purely cosmetic, while others add small bonus stats.\n\nYou also have the option to fast travel to previous campfires if you want to go back and find all collectibles in an area. Secret tombs wield useful upgrades, and environments might have loot that could help you out, so it's a nice option to have.\n\nThe beginning of the game is a bit too linear, but I guess they were trying to make an action packed intro. It's still enjoyable, but the game gets much better after you really get into it around 1 hour.\n\nThe PC port seems to be pretty good. My computer is decent, although far from amazing, however, I can still run the game on high graphics with almost a constant 60fps.\n\nOverall, it's a really immersive, and well-crafted experience. It's fun and action-packed. If you enjoy third person platforming adventure games, or cover shooters, then you'll probably have fun with this.

If you rush through the path the game indicates, you can finish this game in a couple hours.\n\n- Eventhough you are climbing and jumping over cliffs most of the time, it's really hard to fall, like, you must put a lot of effort to achieve such feat, because the game is dumbed down so much, that it refuses to let you die. If you step over a cliff Lara automatically grabs the edge and etc.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall a good game, I wish it was not so dumbed down, at least on the hardest difficulties it shouldn't be so fricking easy.

Nothing comes even close, especially in 3D Vision, and the devs keeps adding more stuff like the new ambient occlusion called VXAO, that surpasses the already very good HBAO+, among other things. Gameplay is very enjoyable and it never gets boring, at least I didn't felt bored at any point while playing (some of my friends said it was so good that they rushed to the ending, and the game felt short due to this). Story is the usual hollywood cliche but that's not game breaking, it suits Lara Croft universe pretty well infact. The voiceover is very well done, like in the first of the franchise reboot (2013), and there is a brazilian voiceover option now that's above the standards.\n\nPSA: The engine is a huge step up from the TR 2013, and it's also very GPU heavy, but it has so many options to mess with that even if you don't have a very powerfull highend PC, you still can enjoy the game with a relentless presentation. So there is no excuse to not play the game, unless you are the kind of PC player that buys a GPU at a given time and expects it to run all games at 60FPS maximum settings ad eternum, it's just silly. So don't expect to have top notch graphics with your GPU forever, 'cos that's not how it works. The engine is very flexible, so the player must to be flexible too. In other words: Don't be delusional.\n\nI highly recommend this game for the ones that wants a very good single player gaming experience. Lara Croft has never looked so good.\n\n*Portuguese*\n\nEm relação de fidelidade gráfica, é o mais avançado que eu já vi até o dia de hoje, a maioria das pessoas concordaria com isso. Nada chega perto, especialmente em 3D Vision, e os devs continua a adicionar mais coisas como a nova técnica de oclusão de ambiente chamada VXAO, que ultrapassa o já muito bom HBAO+, dentre outras coisas. A jogabilidade é muito agradável e ela nunca fica chata, pelo menos eu não senti entediado em qualquer ponto durante a jogatina (alguns dos meus amigos disseram que era tão bom que eles rusharam para o final, e o jogo pareceu ser curto devido a isso). História é o habitual clichê de Hollywood, mas isso não estraga o jogo, ele combina com o universo Lara Croft muito bem na verdade. A dublagem é muito bem feita, como no reboot da franquia (TR 2013), e agora há uma opção de dublagem brasileira que é acima dos padrões.\n\nPSA: O motor gráfico é um grande avanço baseado no mesmo motor do TR 2013, e também é muito pesado no lado da  GPU, mas tem tantas opções para mexer nele que, mesmo se você não tem um PC high-end muito potente, você ainda pode desfrutar do jogo com uma apresentação implacável. Portanto, não há desculpa para não jogar o jogo, a menos que você seja do tipo de jogador de PC que compra uma GPU em um determinado momento e espera que ela seja capaz de executar todos os jogos em configurações máximas a 60FPS ad eternum, isso é bobagem. Portanto, não espere ter  gráficos topo de linha com o sua GPU para sempre (como muitos infelizmente pensam), pois não é assim que a coisa funciona. O motor gráfico é muito flexível, de modo que o jogador deve ser flexível também. Em outras palavras: Não seja delirante.\n\nEu recomendo este jogo para aquele que quer uma experiência single player muito boa no gênero que o jogo se propôe.  Lara Croft nunca esteve tão bem.","March 24","true","58.0"," 57 of 69 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","57","69","9","4"

For fans of the first one, expect a lot more of the same overall gameplay. For those who were wary or had some complaints about the first, ths second installment may have addressed some of those issues.\n\nAt the heart, it's still very much an action-adventure ala the Uncharted series. Many of the same mechanics seen in the first TR are still here: wall climbing, upgrades to weapons, stealth kills, etc. However, these systems go somewhat deeper, allowing for a more varied and advanced crafting system, as well as outfits. The various areas of exploration proivde a wealth of materials, and many of the fights have opportunities for multiple solutions, be it straight up brawls, using moltov cocktails, or stealthily moving about. QTE's are kept to a minimum and used mostly in obvious locations. The addition of the Marketplace and Expedition system also add a good deal of replay to the game that fell flat in the first game, unlocking new gear, outfits, and customized challenges to certain areas of the game.\n\nAs you explore and fight, the game also has a plethora of hidden areas, tombs, achievement items, and so on. The tombs are more robust this time around, and there seem to be many more of them to go through. While not overly difficult, most of them also provide direct upgrades to your talents and weapons, giving players motivation to solve them. Plus, they are created in beautifully rendered environments that fully immerse players in the game world.\n\nIf there are any drawbacks, those graphics are still a bit of an issue. I'm using a somewhat older system with an HD 7750. The game runs, for the most part, fine. The hair effects in particular do not give me the same problems the original did at first. However, there is still noticeable slowdown in areas with large amounts of water effects, as well as the start of most cutscenes, which is frustrating. It's a gorgeous game, to be sure, but without an option to adjust draw distance, it can be quite hefty for lower-end systems.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a similar step up to the ones the Batman series had after Arkam Asylum: a great game that takes most of the template of the first installment and expands upon it in a largely positive way. They clearly took a lot of the feedback of the first game to heart and did their best to make one of Lara's best games yet. It might not win fans who want strict reliance on the original 1990's games, but I'm having a blast.","April 19","true","11.7"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","43","50","3","0"

There's some nice scenic areas that are nearly as nice as witcher 3, nearly.\n- There are some nice semi-open areas which are really nice, it's not sandbox though.\n- The gameplay as far as tomb raiding is pretty good.\n\nCons: (Most of these are only a little annoying)\n- most of the combat scenes are very linear, with very restricted ways to approach enemies and this can get boring and frustrating when you want to be creative. The distraction techniques only work so well.\n- The combat areas are very scripted, often enemies coming from another room, with no possible way to see where Lara is, will know instantly where you are and immediately start firing exactly where you are.\n- The AI is both stupid and omnipotent at the same time e.g. I've taken down a whole room of soldiers standing near each other but slightly off from directly in front of each other, just with my bow, and none noticed their friends dropping like flies. Other times you can throw a molotov near an enemy and none of them were looking anywhere to see where you threw it from, but they instantly knew exactly where I was.\n- I've found times I've thrown a molotov, then hidden behind a wall, and all the while out of sight then moved to a different area and found the enemy to come straight to where I'm now hiding.\n- The combat mechanics are really clunky. you can't block, you can't go crouch or prone unless it's scripted for you too. When near enemies, Lara often stands bolt upright when she should be crouched, there's limited way to move between cover in any stealthy way.\n- The stealth mechanics are crap, I'm sorry, they just suck.\n- Enemies being able to see through thick smock to shoot accurately at Lara, despite not being able to see them on the other side, and no, they didn't have thermal vision goggles.\n- The camera often misbehaves, showing us what it thinks we want to look at. It would be nice to have more control over it, It also doesn't handle well when you move through a doorway whilst aiming a weapon, good luck seeing anyway but the wall.\n- Maybe I'm just picky, but the "tomb raiding" is too easy and too scripted.\n- Want to jump over a knee high barricade? Nope, not allowed there, oh there's a spot you can crawl through, nope again.\n- The arrows are not realistic, in any way, physics just doesn't seem to apply to them.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a fun game and I'm enjoying it for the most part, but I didn't have to think much to find all those little problems that seriously shouldn't exist in a game like this, and the sad thing is, the main problems are with gameplay, the game looks beautiful, but there's lots of gameplay issues that could have been addressed, this really feels like it was dumbed down from what it should have been, sad thing is, the dumbing down is probably deliberate.","February 2","true","19.7"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","42","52","2","2"

Rise of the Tomb Raider improves on its predecessor in almost every way, with better gameplay, better graphics, better sound design, better pacing and most importantly, more actual tombs to exploreI i was dazzled by the size and scope of the island, the fast paced cinematic "escape" sequences, the simple yet captivating shooting mechanics and the boldness of delving so frankly into supernatural territory. Rise of the Tomb Raider just came out a few weeks ago here and I nabbed it as soon as I was able. It delivered everything I expected it would, a decent story with Lara's first encounter with Trinity and the race to find the "Divine source", an object that grants those that gaze upon it immortality before it falls into Trinity's fanatical hands. The combat remains fun, fast paced and somewhat easier with less need to take cover and instead allowing the run and gun approach. The traversal is more detailed this time around, with Lara having more tools at her disposal which unlocks areas previously inaccessible to her, like the Rebreather, Broadhead climbing arrows, and the ability to throw her pickaxe as a grapple hook. The crafting system has been overhauled, with Lara being able to craft bigger ammo and resource storage pouches as well as innumerous upgrades for each variant of pistol, shotgun, machine gun and bow. Most of these upgrades requires special animal hides, which Lara can acquire by finding hidden caches or through good old fashioned hunting. Bears and feral felines make an appearance this time as potential hunts for rare skins, but they won't go down without one hell of a fight... Lara can craft special ammunition on the go and accept side quests from allies who reward her with otherwise unobtainable rewards like new gear or attire. The tombs this time are more numerous and a lot more complicated to solve, at least the first time around. Completing them rewards Lara with unique skills like faster climbing, triple arrow shots and the ability to mine for rare metals required for the best weapon upgrades. There are also crypts in which Lara may find weapon parts and coin caches she can dig up to trade for weapon attachments and unique weapons. Unlike the previous game, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to acquire every skill and upgrade before the end, unless of course you enjoy grinding the same groups of enemies for hours, and so skill and upgrade choices need to be selected more thoughtfully and resources spared for the weapons you enjoy using most. The areas Lara visits are not as numerous as the previous game, but they are unquestionably larger, some maps may take hours and hours to complete while the transition areas usually take about an hour. Not every NPC is hostile towards Lara and there is one particular area that is home to a village filled with friendlies who Lara must help defend against Trinity\n\nPros\n1) The game looks and plays amazingly well.\n2) Gameplay\n3) Graphics\n4) Sound design\n\nCons\n1) Major FPS drops, especially during the cut scenes\n2) Very High Texture settings have lot of issues\n3) Game got stuck a couple of times, and i had to 'end-task' it\n\nHopefully they fix it soon.\n\n","February 3","true","704.4"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","37","45","5","0"

And was I judging the game on face value the review would be much more positive. However I can't, because the decision to include Denuvo DRM absolutely ruins what otherwise would be a very great gaming experience.\n\nDenuvo is inrusive, needlessly affects performance, installs unwanted software that remains on your PC even after the game is removed, and most importantly is totally  unnessecary.\n\nThey seem to feel combatting piracy is a more important priority than giving the paying customers a good experience. Hindering framerate and installing intrusive software is anti consumer and is only going to punish the honest. The truth is pirates will pirate, honest customers will pay. That's how it is and always will be. And it's pretty debateable whether piracy even affects sales.\n\nThe truth is most pirates aren't going to buy the game anyway, hence the reason they are pirates. So in reality the "sales lost" argument falls apart.But by god lets spend tons of money and resources combatting them anyway, even if it means taking advantage of the loyal honest customers.\n\nThey haven't released a game using Denuvo yet that has performed well. The heavy handed DRM is more important than giving us a quality experience.\n\nMeanwhile Witcher 3 is selling like hot cakes AND gaining goodwill by not forcing knee jerk, over reactionary, framerate crippling software in an attempt to combat the phantom piracy "threat", and good for them. I'll gladly give them my money for their product.\n\nThough I bought this game out of sheer appreciation of the game itself this is the LAST time I will purchase a game from Square Enix as long as they keep using this type of DRM that puts performance and the customer last. Which means it's probably the last time I buy a game from them period since they seem to think Denuvo is fantastic, and the inconvenience to customers unimportant","January 29","false","2.2"," 386 of 628 people (61%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","61","386","628","27","30"

I played for 36 hours to end the campaign and 90% of extra content. Dispending 40 hours you can make 100% of the game. Very good, but not consistent with the information of the producers 'would take 35 hours just for the campaign'. I estimate that the campaign can be completed in about 15-20 hours.\n\n- The voice acting is great. Lara's voice with an English accent is beautiful. The sound effects are perfect. The soundtrack is almost imperceptible, with no memorable melodies, and only those ambient sounds, a little disappointing.\n\n- Visually, it is one of the most beautiful games ever created. The optimization is reasonable, and fails in the shadow effects (very demanding and even at maximum quality are pixelated, Skyrim type). In open areas the frame rate drops significantly. The internal areas are much more beautiful, and you will find yourself often admiring every detail and forgetting to play. Lara's movement  is impeccable, interacting with the environment and the situation (cold, fear, danger, stealth, etc). Her modeling is awasome, many polygons and without any "square curves", leaving Lara more beautiful than ever.\n\n- The story is interesting, but like most games of the genre, are simple, short and predictable. The theme comes to religious fanaticism, that doctrine the faithful and leaves susceptible to manupulaion by people and nefarious corporations.\n\n- The optional tombs are the best thing in all game, in my opinion. Pure exploration, puzzles and beautiful scenery based on the Byzantine era. The game has more exploration than the previous one and the Uncharted series, which is great. There are still many exaggerated action scenes, such as the common clichés: walkway breaks during the passage, you fall and be safe in a wall of ice that break too, will roll to the edge of a cliff and clings on the edge, one helicopter launches a missile at you, breaks the platform and luckily you fall into a pit. I personally do not like these impossible sequences, and I think the studios could use their resources in more areas of exploration.\n\n- There are various clothes available for Lara, but without much variety, perhaps due to the cold environment. They are all coats and long sweaters and pants only. I could not pick a really cool outfit, and ended up leaving the less boring one.\n\n- The enemy AI is weak, getting too exposed all the time. I have killed more than 90% of them with head shots. It's frustrating because several improvements available for weapons and skills to show themselves useless. Only with the initial makeshift bow you can finish the game without difficulty. You do not feel any need to improve your weapons.\n\n- The expansion packs coming in the season pass are ABSOLUTELY DISPENSABLES. Strongly recommend that you do not spend your money on it. Only an additional mission, which is boring, some clothes, and two game modes that you will probably never play.\n\nRate 8.5 / 10 - Recommended (no season pass)","April 17","true","48.4"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

I'm dead serious. The facial animations are AMAZING.\nThat's all you gotta know about the graphics. If you're looking for an eye candy then this is it.\n\nAlright. The "important" graphics are out of the way so let's talk about the actual game itself.\nRise of The Tomb Raider is the first big triple A title to hit PCs in 2016 and it hit us hard.\nThe half-arsed, unnessecary and unwanted multiplayer got removed and replaced by more fitting Remnant Resistance and Score Attack modes.\nRemnant Resistance is much like contracts mode in Hitman: Absolution. You can pick a level, create your own challenges with your own terms and then share it with the world...Or you can just try to complete challenges other people have created.\nScore Attack, like the title says, is a mode where you try to get the best score you can in a singleplayer map/level.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as in the previous game but the setting took a quick 180.\nInstead of being on an exotic and mystical island you're now located in a more known place...A place noone really wants to visit - Siberia.\nYou'll be doing lots of climbing, gathering materials for weapon upgrades and healing and you'll unlock new gadgets to progress into different areas. You'll also face another crazy cult. So in that sense Siberia really isn't that different from the previous island...Except there's A LOT of snow and in reality you would freeze to death...\n\nThe last title was all about Lara being an ordinary girl just trying to survive, adapt and become a warrior. Well she has been through that transformation, she's more confident in herself now and she's here to hunt and kill. Watch out 'cus she's dangerous!\nYou're not a scared little girl anymore. This time you'll be facing a crazy cult head on while helping locals to survive. You can even take side-quests from the locals which can turn out to be quite rewarding.\nI also have to mention that all characters in RoTTR are very well written. Especially the villains who are just so amazingly done. They're not your typical video game villains. The game actually kind of explains you why the villains are doing what they're doing. It's nice to see villains who actually have reasonable motives.\nIn most games the villains just kill for the sake of killing.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth, graphics are amazing, voice acting is top notch and i didn't encounter any bugs or glitches during my time in the game so i'd say that Rise of The Tomb Raider is worth your hard earned money.\nIf you liked the first game then this one should be a no-brainer for you.\n\nGame on!","February 19","true","12.0"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","32","40","4","3"

What the hell? It's like the developers thought unless every 5 minutes Lara slides off a cliff and grabs on to the edge at the last milisecond then players will get bored with the game. Well, they thought wrong, because it's the repetitiveness that is boring. As far as raiding tombs go, every time you think you're about to start exploring some ruins you get attacked by a 100 mercenaries. In this installment Lara being an adventurer/explorer is no longer the central point of the game. Instead exploring has been abandoned for the sake of shooting bad guys. Which in my eyes makes this game a non-Tomb Raider game, especially when tombs are now officially 'optional'. At best this is a third person shooter with Lara Croft.\n\nPros:\n- Good graphics, gorgeous detailed environments.\n- Smooth gameplay, smooth controls.\n\nCons:\n- Narrow escape every 5 minutes.\n- Horribly written dialogue. The kind that you would see in a mediocre fantasy movie.\n- Lara does the dumbest sh*t and is incredibly lucky to be alive at all. She will climb any structure that is obviously about to fall apart. What kind of survival instinct is this? After a few bad decisions you lose any sympathy you had for Lara. She's not brave or wise or skilful anymore, she's just stupid and lucky.\n- Like I said before, can't explore anything, have to keep shooting enemies. I suspect this is an effort by the developers to sell Lara to the GTA and Call of Duty crowd.\n- Optional tombs are a joke and have no contribution to the story.\n- As always some rich a**hole is after the same thing as Lara and has to stalk her relentlessly. Needless to say they have access to better equipment, better transportation, infinite number of mercenaries and so on. How many times do we have to see this story in a TR game/movie?\n- Impossible to keep track of Lara's abilities. A new random ability is acquired every 10 seconds, with its own keyboard/mouse combination. And to use these you have to collect a ton of random sh*t and 'craft' things. Who has time for this? I for one don't.\n- Native people of Syberia speak perfect English with various accents, including British and American. What?\n- Where the hell is Putin when you need him? Trinity is bombing the crap out of Syberia in a modern day Russia and the only resistance they're getting is from Lara and some hillbillies.\n- Seriously the plot is BS. It's the kind of story you'd expect to see in a Twilight grade movie. It's extremely hard to get invested in the story. Every cutscene contains at least 10 movie cliches.\n\nHere's something for you to think about. Angel of Darkness is a better game than Rise of the Tomb Raider.\n\nUPDATE (After finishing the game):\nI was right, the game is r**arded, the writing is r**arded, Lara... is r**arded. If this was a movie, it would bomb hard. It would have like a rating 4 on imdb or something, max. Up to the very last cutscene they milk every Hollywood movie cliche any movie has ever suffered from. They made Lara the most boring character ever. Not because there's lack of action or anything like that. But because she is so perfect in every way that she comes across as pretentious, condescending and full of herself. At the end I found myself rooting more for the villains than Lara. At least they had a goal and a personal investment. Meanwhile Lara's goal was to show how better than everyone else she is, how noble and kind she is, while at the same time not having a problem killing a thousand people in the process. Thousand is an understatement, by the way. I feel like I killed more people in this game than I have killed in my 2000+ hours of Counter-Strike. In conclusion, I'm not writing off TR completely, but this is probably the last time I will pay to play TR. Also this will probably end up becoming the only TR game that I don't have any interest in replaying.","February 15","false","9.8"," 145 of 233 people (62%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","62","145","233","24","14"

It's a bigger and a longer game than the first one. The game brings you to various huge and gorgeous environments, filled with (optional) tombs to explore and many treasures/relics to find. The level designs were improved as well from the first game, as the level are usually big and you can choose to stealth or go run and gun into battle where you can use the surroundings to your advantage, such as climbing trees, and crafting things from stuffs you pick up (even new outifts for Lara! Wow!).\n\nThe story is just fine, nothing too special, as it also brings you to Lara's dark past as well as the current events of trying to unearth the lost city of Kitezh and she faces a lot of difficulties to get there.\nThere are more tombs in the game than before and they are optional and you have to find the secret entrance to the tomb, which are usually not that secret anyway.

Instead of building upon the strengths of the last Tomb Raider game and pushing this maybe a little further towards Uncharted with its intrepid action, compelling story, challenging puzzles and shooting sequences, they of course had to go a different road the with Rise of the Tomb Raider to appeal to the masses.\n\nIt appears that games no longer sell unless they get «openworldified» and filled with boring fetch quests where you need to collect X tons of garbage at some random location and need to help dozens of insignificant NPCs that don’t even get a proper introduction to begin with. This game feels like Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry combined with all their tower climbing, radio-tower-deactivating and animal skinning glory. To add insult to injury, the puzzles in this game have been simplified as much as possible.\n\nThe openworldish areas in the game lack credibility like in the last Tomb Raider game. They are filled with zip lines and seem like a show-jumping course in an amusement park. Due to all the nonsense I’m coerced to do or collect in these hubs I’m constantly being reminded that I’m actually playing a video game that ultimately just lacks immersion and builds upon empty time fillers and skinner box mechanisms instead. A lot of times it feels like I’m doing chores instead of having fun.\n\nOf course the game isn’t without strengths. It’s beautiful to look at for example, but the performance is weak even on fast systems. The story feels generic and uninspired, but I’ve seen worse overall. The combat is supposed to have gotten better since the last game, but there is very little challenge in it due to how dumb the AI is, and the clunky controls don't exactly make up for it...","February 4","false","21.5"," 118 of 190 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","118","190","8","8"

I don't think I need to tell you about the game because everyone is knows already who is Lara Croft and what the story is about, because always it's going to be a one scared girl that becomes brutal and always near death, but somehow survives and kill everybody – Good old Tomb Raider.

Lara croft becomes spider man and now she can raise her climbing axe with a rope and fly from building to building. The only minus of the game that if you fall down to death the main character falls with a little buggy way, speaking of deaths, if she falls on thorns or you let someone kill you in action there will be a 5 second movie about her death.\nI think it's all i had to say about this game :) now its up to you!","February 3","true","16.9"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","35","47","9","0"

If yes, you should buy Rise of the Tomb Raider.  When playing TR2013, did you think "This was the worst decision I made since I tried to lick that opossum"?  If so, don't buy Rise.  If you never played TR2013, go buy that instead -- it gets down to like $5 these days on sales.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider is an improved take on the 2013 game.  As noted, the QTEs that plagued the first hours of TR2013 are gone, the pacing moves better and there's the usual improvements in tricks of the trade.  The story is nothing special: Lara has found a lead on an artifact her father ruined his life and career trying to find and so now she plans to redeem his legacy by acquiring the Divine Source.  The game is set mainly in Siberia with you traversing numerous forests, caves, lost settlements and abandoned Soviet installations under varying degrees of snow and ice.  For the most part, game play is straight forward and you likely won't get stuck on what to do next for long; objects you can interact with are either splashed with white paint or glow when you use your Tomb Raider Spider-sense.  Puzzles are better than in TR2013 but still nothing difficult -- I completed all with minimal issue and I'm pretty poor at physics puzzles.  Combat in the game usually seems to favor stealth (you'll silently fire your bow a lot) but only in terms of killing enemies.  It usually isn't practical or possible to sneak through and you'll be expected to bloody your hands often.\n\nAs a rollicking and action-filled archeological adventure, Rise of the Tomb Raider was a fun time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacobPriceChloePrice/recommended/391220/","JacobPriceChloePrice","X_[Jacob_[Chloe]_Price]_X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacobPriceChloePrice/","49 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider which is the sequel of Tomb Raider series is becoming the most attractive and wanted game for mostly it's fascinating dynamic GFX, interesting story and brilliant gameplay. I am impressed with the great story it tells. There is much more adventures than Tomb Raider 2013. It has more than my expectations. This title definitely worth 59.99$ as Tomb Raider worth 19.99$. You can't even guess how much amazing and fabulous is it. Though i completed the story with much time to feel the every moment of this game. I already can say it's gonna be awarded for Game of the Year 2016. Because it deserves something great and massive. Well, now i am gonna share my opinion and experience about this title.\n\nStory\nAs we have experienced the story of Tomb Raider 2013 which was mind blowing. But i have to say Rise of the Tomb Raider got far better story then ever. It's like reaching Lara's destination to discover divine source and uncover the truth what her father couldn't made it before his death. So it was Lara's destination to know the reason of the death of her father. So still there are so much barricades to stop Lara and find the Divine Source before her. She have to face something terrible with betrayal and conspiracy. So it was quiet attractive to live the story of Lara Croft in Rise of the Tomb Raider. I hope you are not gonna be disappointed.\n\nGraphics Quality\nI just stopped to take breathing when i watched the GFX of this game. It's seems so amazing and great. Never saw that sun light effect and skyline in other games. I took more than 100+ snapshots when i was in the top of the mountain. I thought The Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Syndicate got the most attractive GFX ever. But Rise of the Tomb Raider failed me this time, that just crossed all other renowned games and became the most incredible. Developers really worked hard to polish facial work in this game. I can see they applied few numbers of facial layers on the face to make it more and more realistic. That was quiet more than my expectations for GFX of this title. Finally i got something like my taste.\n\nPros :\n1. Remarkably Optimized Game\n2. Stunning Dynamic Graphics Quality (GFX)\n3. Adventurous and Brilliant Story\n4. Detailed and Fascinating Gameplay\n5. Interesting and Useful New Features\n6. Enjoyable Combating and Actions\n\nNew Features and Gameplay\nI found few new features in this one. Like Expedition. Expedition allows us to reply any of the chapters with Score Attack or Chapter Reply or Chapter Reply Elite. We can earn credits by completing their given objectives by replying those chapters. We can upgrade ourselves to reach a bit higher in the leaderboards. Also there is Play Card which we can use through chapters. I also got few new outfits, some of them were gonna be unlocked by progressing on story mode and some of them were gonna be unlocked by completing their given tasks. But i just loving her Leather Jacket and Grey T-Shirt, these two suits her amazingly and She looks so beautiful and innocent. Well, that's what she is, too innocent and determined. There are few more upgrades available for Bow, Pistol, AK-47, Shotgun and Axe. Now i am gonna say about the Grappling Axe which helps us to grapple ledge if we fall from it or if we have to reach somewhere quickly. We can still use Axe to make finisher or melee attack as always. You can choose four types of difficulty in game like Adventurer, Tomb Raider, Survivor. I completed the game on adventurer difficulty because i had to feel it's story amazingly. Not just wanna die again and again for hard difficulty. I got many puzzles to be done to progress story more then Tomb Raider 2013.\n\nOptimization\nI have to say this is one of the best optimized games ever. They optimized it so brilliantly. Really loved it. i played this game with Very High settings and 1920X1080 resolution. Everything were maxed out, Even i maxed out Anti-Aliasing for best experience. My FPS crossed 135+ when i reached Syria. But averagely FPS stays between 60-80. My configuration : Intel Core i5 4690K, RAM 8GB DDR3, R9 290 Vapor-X 290 4GB GDDR5 OC Version with S2240L 1080P display. Well that's all happened with me, so don't know about your experience. Just said my opinion about it's brilliant optimization.\n\nError, Crashes, Bug, Stuttering\nWell, my gameplay experience was so smooth as hell, there was no error or crashes like Assassin's Creed Syndicate, no bugs, no stuttering. They made it just remarkable. There was no unexpected shut downs what bothers you the most of all. Just stunning as hell.\n\nMy Opinion and Ratings on this masterpiece :\nStory : 8/10\nGraphics Quality (GFX) : 10/10\nGameplay : 8/10\nOptimization : 10/10\nCombats and Actions : 8/10\nNew Features : 9/10\nOVERALL : 9.3/10\n\nSo i hope you are not gonna be regreted if you have planned to purchase this masterpiece. Remember, Rise of the Tomb Raider worth more than 59.99$. Highly recommending so try it if you can.(CROFT)","February 7","true","127.9"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","32","42","4","5"

Once again you take control of Lara Croft in third person as you go about the unknown, discover conspiracy plots and face dangers of nature and man alike. Who can you trust? Who will betray you, and why? These are things you will need to figure out as you play this game.\n\nUnlike the first game, you'll be playing the majority of this game in frozen Siberia, it's cold and Lara is freezing. The conditions are even harsher than the first game. There is more exploration to be had, more caves, more tombs, more secrets... just more of everything in general and that's a good thing. Not only is the campaign bigger, the locales are more open and there is a larger sense of freedom. The levels seem less linear as well, which is great for people to get more creative.\n\nWhile the 2013 game acted as a pilot to the series, Rise Of The Tomb Raider refines that foundation and builds upon it. It basically sets the bar higher in any imaginable way. Is it classic Tomb Raider? No, but it is a whole outher beast, a force to be reckoned with in the action/adventure genre. As Lara, you'll learn even more than tricks to help you survive in the wild against your foes, you'll continue to collect salvage an upgrade weapons and keep warm near fires but there is plenty of new things as well.\n\nThe high octane has been pushed to the 11 in this fluid action/adventure game. Everything has made more accessible from the plot to the graphics, giving the player more clarity to the world around Lara. It's not just all about running and gunning or climbing, the game has a great atmosphere and story and that's one of the many things that make me like it better than the first.\n\nPros  Amazing graphics\nGreat storyline told very well with nicely voice acting\nRefined game mechanics\nThe game has alot more tombs and treasures\nDiverse locales\nFull controller support\nCons  May not have enough differences from the 2013 game besides the locale and upped graphics\nHardcore classic Tomb Raider fans will be unsatisfied\nA.I can be a bit clumsy\nQTE's turn some people off\nLara's appearance has changed dramatically\nInsane DLC... $9.99 for endurance mode just to give you an idea\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis is a great continuation of the 2013 Reboot, it's worth the price of admission. It's solid in all areas and lacks very little. It's a blockbuster action title that holds its own against other well-known giants such as Uncharted. The adrenaline pumping heroine is back and ready to plan her next attack.\n\nRating (9.3 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 23","true","4.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/391220/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","You often hear how AAA games don’t have the kind of pre-production time you’d expect, with projects often going into full production before anyone has a clear idea of what they’re making. Rise of the Tomb Raider feels like one of those games, as most of its story is thin and poorly thought out.\n\nI was excited to play Rise of the Tomb Raider, being a fan not just of the last game, but the series as a whole. With the last game the devs raised the bar, creating a very interesting jumping off point for future installments. Unfortunately they don’t seem to have had any good idea for where the series is supposed to go. What you end up with here is a hodgepodge of ideas from Uncharted and Assassin’s Creed, with most of what happened in the last game completely forgotten.\n\nWhen you’re in control of Lara, the game feels just as good as the last game. The feeling of climbing, sliding, shooting etc is all very well done, and it’s no problem at all that this basically plays exactly the same as last time. They haven’t run this system into the ground just yet. The way the game is paced feels perfect, with all the different elements getting just enough screen time for maximum effect. In general this feels like a better game to play than the last one, and is a big part of why I enjoyed this game despite the story being disappointing.\n\nYou just can’t make the exact same game a second time, wrap a different story around the systems, and expect it to come out the other end in a coherent manner. In Rise of the Tomb Raider I couldn’t buy into the villains, or Lara, or her allies, or the setting, or almost anything that was going on in the story. I liked the ideas on kind of an abstract level. But the way the story plays out is borderline incomprehensible. Events seem to happen out of order, and characters are as thinly developed as it’s possible, with audio logs acting as an emergency measure to add motivation and depth (in a way that does NOT work btw).\n\nIn the last game, Lara made sense to me. As the violence escalated, her willingness to go along with it made sense, as she was turning more feral, looking less and less like a normal person. In cutscenes the contrast between her wildness and her companions became more and more extreme. In Rise of the Tomb Raider that Lara seems to be gone. In every scene she seems kind of normal, even in later parts of the game. She doesn’t go through any kind of journey like last time, nor does she seem to have any baggage left from the previous game, which is strange. Much of the her motivation this time is around her father’s legacy, and the things he left undone before his death. Remember that father figure mentor guy from the last game? Because this game didn’t. The more I think about the details in the story, the less it all makes sense. Like doesn’t she love historic artifacts? Then why are many of the challenges designed around destroying them? I didn’t do some of them because it felt like sacrilege. One moment the native villagers directly say to Lara that she’s a friend, just before she goes off and robs their ancient tombs within eyesight of the village. Is she just pulling the wool over their eyes? Is this some allusion to how the British empire managed to spread back in the days? She tricks everyone into thinking she’s a friend, all while robbing them of their historic artifacts and leaving the rest in a pile of dust. The story doesn’t acknowledge this aspect at all.\n\nPart of the appeal of the Tomb Raider series is getting to explore old mysterious ruins in exotic locations. They kind of botched part of that here, as you visit old soviet era factories and interact with locals who somehow all speak English without an accent. One of my favorite moments of Uncharted 2 was when you’re in Tibet and is led by a guide who doesn’t know a word of English. The environments in Rise of the Tomb Raider are very similar, but they for some reason decided that the people of North Asia should just look exactly like the island dwellers in the last game. Feels like they’re wasting the potential of the setting and kind of missing the point of making a game like this. They might as well have set the game in Canada instead if they weren’t interested in presenting other cultures to the player. Instead you get a strange contrast between the ruins & artifacts right next to the supposed descendants of those cultures still living there, not displaying any resemblance to those cultures in any way whatsoever. I’m just guessing this stems from the project being so poorly thought out before they started making it. If they knew in advance where the story was going to take place, they probably wouldn’t have made them like this.\n\nBut for all my complaints, I still had a great time playing Rise of the Tomb Raider. The way the exploration and combat feels is about as good as you can get from the genre right now. Just being in the world, looking at it, moving through it, hearing it, are all critical aspects for a game. And this game nails all that. Some of the set pieces feel overindulgent, throwing in more explosions than the story had earned. But when the finale rolled around, the way it built up to a crescendo of everything exploding and falling apart was very nicely done. I was hoping for more, but even so this is an easy recommendation. It’s highly unlikely you’ll have a bad time with this. It just doesn't inspire any confidence that the series will ever top the last one.","March 7","true","14.8"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","25","31","3","2"

He's a lovestruck fool who follows this crazed chick called Lara across the world, enabling her destructive, often callously vandalistic behaviour. Jonah's a bit of a mystery to me, but my best guess is that he'd like to get in Lara's pants - she'll never let him, though. She's a descendant of snooty british aristocracy and he's from the West Indes, so there's that.

(GTX980TI)\nCrashes due to "Not enough RAM". Since when are 16GB not enough?\nThe performance of the Game is clearly terrible.\n\nWe already know that the developers get cheaper and cheaper and instead of giving us a good performance they just say "buy better equipment".\n\nBugs:\nAlready in the first hour of playing this game there have been lot's of bugs.\nAt one point Lara even had a stone attached to her body, which was stuck there for about 15 minutes.\nEven though these small bugs are not very annoying or game breaking, they exist and there are not just a few.\nTherefore they have to be mentioned. Bugs like that aren't acceptable in a full price game.\n\nThe game itself:\nThere has been alot of recycling in this game. I didn't see any big new features or ideas in this game. Even parts of the design and story have been ripped out of earlier games or even the movies.\nOf course people like it when there are things in the game that remembers them of something they know, but if the whole game is made out of those things, it's just annoying.\n\nThe really bad thing about this game though is that they just use the name of the Tomb Raider franchise. It's not really Tomb Raider anymore. Not even Lara's looks are how they used to be.\nLara's background story is messed up as well.\nThe puzzles are too easy.\nThe game is too short\nThe performance is too bad.\nAll things that used to be way better in the earlier games of the Tomb Raider franchise.\n\nDon't understand me wrong. It's not a bad game, it's just not Tomb Raider anymore. With any other name, character and story it would be more than just acceptable, but this is just a cheap use of the name of the franchise.\n\nI still prefer Tomb Raider I - IV above all the others. Those were the original ones and not those action bound games that have nothing to do with Tomb Raider but using the name.\n\nIn conclusion: Alot of game magazines already state at the beginning of each year that it's "the best game of the year". I can already tell that this is one of the most disappointing games 2016.\nI highly recommend not to buy it and not to help them destroy the franchise even more. Just buy the first few Tomb Raiders for much less money and have a way longer and bigger game.\n\nEDIT: This is a review about the game and how it was programmed. I got alot of comments about how to improve the performance. I deleted all of them and will continue so since this is not a help forum and simply about the game. The end-user shouldn't be responsible for fixing any kind of issues or bugs.","January 29","false","15.4"," 116 of 194 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","116","194","8","30"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matezzz/recommended/391220/","matezzz","NA Salt King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matezzz/","43 products in account","Tomb Raider series have always been able to find their fans, who were looking forward to a new game. The main character Lara Croft's seeking adventures throughout the world and reveals unknown mysteries, explores tombs and caves.\nThe series were indeed popular, so there were 2 Tomb Raider movies released in 2001 and 2003. Lara Croft was portrayed by beautiful Angelina Jolie, who was following trails left by her father. To be honest, potential of Tomb Raider franchise could have been used way better. Everything was fine, but not exciting at all. More climbing, more tombs were missing, basically we know Lara Croft in a better light.\n\nBack to videogames. In 2013, Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics took this title into a whole different level. In collaboration with Nvidia they managed to improve the graphical side of the game. They’ve begun with a brand new story. Improved gameplay. We’re getting more detailed Lara. She’s leaving her known Dual Pistols and places more importance on a bow and stealth. Playthrough is way easier with the new Survival Instinct. Tomb Raider was definitely surprising and many of us were looking forward to continuing.\n\nAnd now, here is the sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider. It may sound a bit unbelievable, but the developers improved the already amazing graphics from 2013. The game looks insane even on lowest video settings, and Very High is a heaven for screenshoters. Characters look very realistic with sick voices and communication, the environment is breathtaking and you might stop at a view to take a screenshot so many times.\n\nDespite the fact that the game works on the same basics as the previous one, there are few new details making the gameplay more enjoyable. One of the most important news are resources, which can be gathered throughout the world and further used for crafting arrows, equipment, upgrades etc. Of course the ammunition can be picked up directly, but you should barely run out of ammo during combat thanks to the crafting ability.\n\nThe story is quite good, although I have to say it takes after a regular FPS. From adventurous Lara Croft seeking for historical artifacts becomes a woman seeking for revenge, anyway, let’s see what the next sequel will bring us. Unlike the first game, there are more optional tombs, some of them are easier, some of them more difficult. In fact if you’re going for 100% game completion, you have to collect all relics, documents, caches and go through every single tomb and cave. Should take about 30 hours of playtime.\n\nBack in Main Menu I recommend trying Extra Game Modes, thanks to which you’re able to replay earlier chapters of the story, or play any mission of your own volition.  The game is enriched by Expedition Cards, which can be bought for credits. Credits are earned for completing challenges, exploring the world or completing Game Modes mentioned above. These Expedition Cards further modify your missions, either they become an advantage or disadvantage and in combination with high difficulty can give you a really hard time.\n\nFor current price of 50€ Rise of the Tomb Raider offers an unforgettable gaming experience. If you fell in love with 2013’s Tomb Raider, there is really nothing to wait for. The game will pay off and you’re going to wish it’d never end.\n\nEnjoy the game!\nMatezz","February 16","true","27.2"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","32","46","3","0"

I would recommend playing on High instead of Very High to save about 20 fps, with small differences.)\n\nThe game runs at around 40-45 Fps with max setting (except shadows turned off, V-synch set to double instead of triple buffer and msaa at x2 instead of x4 - this includes HBAO+ on and textures on very high etc. This seems to be a good port, but a demanding one all the same. I'd recommended anyone with a lower system than me, or people with a similar set up looking to get 60fps, to turn the hair effects off as I have heard they are demanding. HBAO+ is supposed to also be demanding too. Especially to those with AMD set ups. If you own an AMD system I can't confirm how this game runs with AMD, but Tomb Raider (2013) was pretty well optimised for AMD aswell as NVidia so hopefully this is the case with the sequel too. (Minus all the Gameworks NVidia features).\n\nOverall seems like a solid port.

I wasn't sure whether i'd get this game or not due to the fact that they made it Xbox exclusive (Timed exclusive, releasing later this year for the PS4) which was a big 'FokkYou' to the fans that played on PC and or PS. It was definitely something i do not support. With many people claiming they wouldn't buy the game because of that. Hopefully the people at Crystal have learned to not do this again.\nAnyway.\nI love this game, i really do.\nBut lets get right into the pros and cons.\nPros:\n+ Decent story, definitely better than the first game IMO and a very intriguing after credits scene.\n+ Fantastic graphics with Lara's hair looking beautiful with Purehair on.\n+ Semi open areas, semi big open spaces to explore, not a sandbox/open world though.\n+ Actual tombs to raid. But are completely optional. With challenging puzzles from time to time.\n+ Improves on everything from the first game.\n+ Great gameplay, works great with an Xbox One controller.\n+ Crafting adds fun to the game.\n\nCons:\n- Way too easy, played on the second hardest difficulty and died about 5 times from AI.\n- Dumb AI\n- Even with different weapons and explosives. Combat stays pretty much the same.\n- There is stealth in the game, but its awful. Only went stealth once and ended up rushing the last guy.\n- Mouse and Keyboard during some puzzles can be troublesome (Played with an Xbox One Controller though)\n\ntl;dr: It's a great game that improves on everything the previous game did. Definitely worth it and i highly encourage anyone to go pick it up now despite its problems which are very minor.\n9/10 without a doubt :))","February 3","true","17.5"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","22","30","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/recommended/391220/","athravan","Athravan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/","863 products in account","This is a visually stunning story driven adventure that takes everything that was good about the 2013 game and enhances it. Graphically realistic with a smooth PC-port that has a couple of glitches, but great performance overall. The amount of detail in the background and setting is impressive and immersive whilst seamless integration between cutscenes and action really pulls you into the environment. In short, it looks flippin' awesome.\n\nThe controls are smoother than before, with even more climbing, jumping and in my case, excessive falling. Combat is reactive, and the bow a viable weapon choice - so much better than previously, with added stealth and distractions like a ton of different types of arrows and explosives. The upgrade and crafting system is relatively simple, but gives a feeling of growing power as you progress and makes it worth hunting down those extra resources. Puzzles are complicated enough to make me feel smart, whilst not so challenging as to leave me frustrated, and there are an absolute ton of collectibles for the trophy hunters. It starts off incredibly linear, but branches out more after the first 60 minutes of gameplay, giving you the option to take on side quests, hunt for collectibles, tackle optional challenges and puzzle tombs, or progress through the main story. Of course, a game like this is always going to be fairly linear overall, but there are enough optional things to make it feel like you have an element of choice and discovery. Oh, and remember those QTE events that were everywhere and annoying as hell? Yeah, they're gone!\n\nThe story is decent. It's not breaking any boundaries - but I wouldn't expect it to. It's the origin story of the most famous bad-♥♥♥ adventuring lady in the gaming world, who seems destined to save the world and grab some loot along the way. It's what you would expect, a mix match of legend and history and it works really well. Some of the dialogue and voice acting is top notch, and some of it leaves a lot to be desired, but even when I'm groaning at the lines or yelling at Lara to stop being so dumb it's still a super fun action adventure to play, and that's the important bit.\n\nOverall it's a well crafted balance between story, exploration, brains and action. For me, it's been a thoroughly enjoyable  journey, but hell, if for some reason you hate Lara, you can enjoy the visceral entertainment of even more death scenes, over and over.

I'd like to see where the story is going somewhat, and I'm still kind of miffed Lara's iconic dual pistol thing isn't at least an upgrade in this since it was so perfectly built up in TR2013. I still like Lara's aggressive attitude and how she explains artifact lore.\nWhy are there two games to establish her starting character arc? That's a little much. A lot much. It is almost as if they made this alongside TR2013 and both are separate reboots. I say that when talking about mechanics and story both.\nI can see the dev’ meetings are dry on ideas and hitting on popular tropes and cliche for TV. I see Jonah becoming a love interest immediately in the next game and that kills me inside. No one involved with Trinity is a compelling antagonist at all.\n\nUpgrades are terribly paced, with backtracking and/or grinding to get most of the needed ones or ones that were in TR2013. This includes things such as the grenade launcher, pistol silencer (Now un-toggleable?), and rope ascender. This also ties to the tacked on side-quests, three of which were directly related to the main story, all others were backtracking for certain gear upgrades that you never needed and could pass by on accident as you had to actually go back to know you had these quests available. Weapons were overpowered on every difficulty regardless. Once you get any shotgun you'll go from powerful to being untouchable.\nCombat is easy, stealth is too hard to manage but not unreasonable. Throwable/craftable objects added nothing but clutter to the game and made looting and stealth frustrating. Forced backtracking for some of the fun explorable side areas. PC port interface bugs forced me to restart the program several times, specifically I couldn't interact with the game at all once a tutorial prompt for certain skills appeared. Crashed once. Artifact and document side lore was very gripping, but choice in voice actors was limited to maybe two or three and ruined immersion. (Same as the enemy voice actors too.) No interesting music at all.\n\nRuns like Hell on my PC for a few jarring seconds but then is suddenly smooth. This happens when it loads, but it also happens sometimes during set-pieces and every time I change weapons after fast-traveling, plus some others. I don't understand why it runs at 60fps and then suddenly drops to 3 seconds of a single frame. Seems to run more on my CPU than my GPU for reasons I can't begin to understand. This game looks almost live action (Which is impressive) at max settings and when it isn't stuttering. Can't seem to get the performance to be any different from min to max settings. I don't use NVidia hardware at the moment which the game seems to be more made for. It might somehow be my PC, but I really doubt it as I run other games just fine without these issues.\n\nOne of the big things to note is the additional content beyond the main game is unnecessarily convoluted. It's not set up very well to start with but then there's a micro-transaction store for other modes, where the fun New Game+ stuff should be. Replaying chapters with "Big head mode" and "Bodies sometimes explode when looted" but stuff like that is incentivized to be payed for, with a random card pack mechanic on cards that can only be used once.\nThere's also permanent cards which are gear and costumes and there is a way to use the gear that you've collected in the main game for these other modes. This applies to some DLC and stretches somewhat into the costumes. You can still get the main game costumes and the card packs with some good grind time for free, minus the main game weapon skins.\nThere's some sort of online score attack thing connected to this where you're supposed to compete with your friends on a scoreboard.\nIt's a..."Multiplayer experience" with "Optional" micro-transactions. I usually don't mind this when the game is otherwise perfect, but in this title I can't let this slide because it gets in the way.\nThis was a pain to explain and is also a pain to wrap your head around in game, I probably missed something because there's so many stipulations to it. It feels like it's trying to compromise with both the players and corporate and it does a poor job.\n\nAll in all, I feel like I should really like this. A lot of performance, design, writing, and micro-transaction backsteps keep me away from that opinion.","February 4","false","20.6"," 61 of 101 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","61","101","7","11"

I personally enjoyed going off the set path hunting animals for exp and crafting materials or simply looking for collectibles and caches: most actions and kills will reward you with exp that you can then spend on one of the three skill trees helping you tailor Lara to your chosen playstyle.\n\nA few downsides are enemy AI which is ok on Survivor but still somewhat exploitable, a few bugs (the one making the map appear blank being the most annoying) and a few glitches with jumping or using your grappling tools: all the issues are easy to forgive though as they don't impact gameplay too much and even a bad jump will see you back at a checkpoint very near your starting position.\n\nWhile you won't find an huge amount of innnovation in it the game is an absolute blast to play and will provide you with a lengthy, enjoyable experience through its story mode and (for those so inclined) through its score attack mode and DLC. I personally enjoyed every minute I've spent in it and heartily recommend it.","February 1","true","22.2"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","0"

I have not gotten so absorbed into a game for a long time.\nI immediately started to collect all of the collectibles in the zones as I started and really enjoyed running through the open world to find all these items and figure out how to get to some of them. The beautiful environment and the stunning graphics reallly helped in that regard as well.\n\nFor gameplay I felt the game had everything. A wide array of different arrows like poison arrows for those nasty guys with shields, fire arrows for either objects or your enemies, even explosive arrows to bring down a group of enemies! There were 4 different weapons (bow, pistol, rifle and shotgun) with several different choices for each one. All weapons had lots of upgrades as well, which made collecting resources in order to upgrade them quite fun.\nLeaping from trees and roof tops to assassinate targets, or doing a stealth kill from a bush felt really awesome, reminded me quite a lot of Assassins Creed. :p  And the stealth in general was really good. Could distract enemies with bottles and things to help you in that regard.\n\nThe exploration and platforming had quite a lot of variety as well how to reach items and places. You start off with the basic climbing axes, then get rope arrows, climbing arrows and some other stuff. And you unlock them at different points in the story, which makes exploration and collecting feel sort of fresh throughout the game as you get that new stuff.\nThe puzzles in Tombs and other places wasn't very hard, but I guess that is a preference how hard you want that to be. So even if they were not terribly hard on their own, I think there is plenty of those small puzzles or places you have to stop and think about how to proceed to keep it interesting.\n\nThe story was great and kept me interested throughout the game and the ending did not disappoint either. Plenty of documents that tell the story from different peoples perspectives, from different sides and from different times. So you gather small pieces of clues all over that adds to the mystery.\n\nI think I spent 50+ hours before I completed the story, but that was with doing 100% completion in all zones (besides the last one I have a few things left) and doing every achivement I could.\nAlso has Score Attack and Endurance mode (Endurance is from DLC) to keep you busy as well. So now I just need to pick up the last achivements I got in story mode, then I need to get all the achivements from Endurance and Score Attack, which means getting Gold Medals on all levels.. so should be very many hours of game time left for me.  :)","February 14","true","128.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","21","30","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/391220/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider's opening is pretty great. It starts out with a tutorial in Siberia to teach you the basic navigation controls, then you're moved into a beautiful green landscape with a decently large tomb with a few puzzles, a few texts to read, and a few artifacts to nab. For these brief moments, the game feels like they really did listen to peoples' comments about the first game, and were actually working to make the game feel more in line with the original games. Then the first of many explosions kicks off, and you realize that isn't the case.\n\nThe primary theme of Tomb Raider 2013 was survival, and in that sense the primary theme for this game is also "survival" because Rise of the Tomb Raider is essentially just a rehash of a reboot. It brings back all the obligatory cookie cutter modern survival game mechanics; you'll hunt a few deer, craft a few handbags, and scavenge a few glowing plants. They don't go much further than the bare minimum in mechanics despite most of the game taking place in frozen wilderness, so outside of having to gather firewood a single time you never have to worry about heat or hunger and are free to remove your winter clothes entirely and explore the frozen wastes in an ordinary shirt and pants if you so desire. The game retains both the stealth encounters and the explosive shooter encounters, each with AI bad enough that on the default difficulty you don't even really have to bother with things like cover or healing. The game was said to have more optional tombs than TR 2013, but I didn't notice, and if it did they're still to few and far between to feel like the game is actually about tomb raiding and not shooting up a private army. And of course, the Uncharted influences are as strong as ever, so you can expect plenty of thrilling "hold forward to not die" sequences and that one setpiece where lara slides down a slippery surface that they did like 50 times in the first game.\n\nThe problem with this game isn't that it's bad, it's just that it's incredibly uninspired. None of the gameplay mechanics really work together with each other, and even though each bit has had slight additions since 2013 it's not enough to actually make me care. The story is noticeably less interesting than the previous game, with very few characters to actually care about. Even though the game still poses itself as a survival game you never get any real sense of danger, and your survival throughout the entire game feels overly scripted. It quickly begins to feel less like exploring and searching for rare artifacts and more like running around with the map open collecting dots that lead to more dots, as if you're just doing Indiana Jones's grocery list instead of playing a video game.\n\nIf you loved TR 2013 and are okay with more of the same, this game might be worth it on a sale. If you weren't  a fan and were hoping this one would change your mind or if you're just a fan hoping they've made a fresh new game, I don't know that I could recommend it at all unless it goes to $10 or $15 eventually. Rise of the Tomb Raider is the most boring game I've played in at least several months, and even though these tricks might've worked in the first game they're going to have to think up some new ways to excite me if they plan on going through with the obvious sequel hook they placed.","January 30","false","18.7"," 290 of 526 people (55%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","55","290","526","35","16"

Lara translates: "Night won't prevent us from working". Dog tag with "Ж-897169" written on it, Lara reads a name and a surname. Really?..\n\nYou can clearly see how much effort and dedication went into perfecting the main character. The way Lara squeezes out her ponytail, the way her hair color changes depending on the lighting, all those small girly movements that were only possible thanks to motion capture... I bet she'll leave an empty feeling for a lot of gamers after you'll pass the game to full completion. She is one of the most realistic game characters I've seen, if not THE most.\n\nAt the same time, there are some downsides, and the perfect protagonist makes them stand out even more. The ones that disappoint me most are optimization issues, shallow secondary characters and the lack of new game mechanics. I'll expand on these a bit when I'll finish the game.\n\nMaybe Rise won't offer the most thrilling plot in the industry, but I'm pretty sure I'll be coming back for a replay or two, at least for all the sights and landscapes.\n\nFOR THE MAP GLITCH, until it's patched: the map will sometimes appear blank, especially if you are close to the egde of a level.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/391220/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Let’s get right down to it, Rise of the Tomb Raider (RoTR) is undoubtedly a gorgeous game, graphically pushing the envelope offering richly detailed environments, quality character animations & visual effects. Everything you look at is superbly crafted together, from the camera direction, animal animations to the smallest plants or rocks. This really brings the locations to life. Going hand-in-hand with this is the competent narrative that is always well voiced & engaging cut-scenes from the main story arc that seamlessly bend into the gameplay. RoTR's well-polished presentation is an entertaining experience.\n\nYet by the end of my play through, there were some elements of the game I found disappointing; such as, finding the plot a bit predictable after the main reveal or that there was some grindy gameplay mechanics.\n\nOne of the big things I was looking forward to in this sequel was the 'Return to Tomb Raiding' with bigger & better tombs. The nine optional tombs on offer in RoTR had some crafty puzzles, but regrettably they are relatively short & quick to complete. They primarily centre on an entrance/discovery section followed by a main room with a short series of puzzle steps to get to your prize. Not as elaborate or engaging as I was hoping for.\n\nThe same can be said for the open world exploration sections where I found most easy to figure out how to navigate around or find hidden locations. There were a few tricky bits that took me some time to find, but overall not too difficult to progress. Everything you need is always put right where you need it, and shown on the map so you rarely need to actually hunt around for much. There are some open sections such as Soviet Installation or Geothermal Valley where you have some freedom to do missions or challenges, and go Easter Egg hunting, ahem, farming to upgrade your kit, but much of the game levels are more linear or scripted in nature.\n\nI did get the feeling there was less combat in this verses the first reboot, which I prefer, but would have liked to see more mission/tomb/challenge content instead of the massive amount of collectibles (murals, strongbox, documents, coin cache etc.) you need to track down if you want to 100% complete the game. Hunting & gathering is also required for some crafting, so you get lots to do, but does become a bit mundane after a while. Much of this is optional content so can be avoided though if you just want to progress the story.\n\nAs with the previous instalment the controls are forgiving and controlling Lara's wide range of abilities is intuitive. It’s situational based so it’s easy to traverse a cliff face or square off in a gun fight. The further you progress the game will add more moves, weapons & abilities. Some are useful like larger storage space, but others like show all traps do make an easy game even easier.\n\nThe AI ‘Henchmen’ are not the brightest bunch still (not sure if they improve on hardest difficulty or just are tougher to take down). Seem to be prone to line of sight issues allowing Lara to get away with a lot before being discovered, and in combat tend to follow the same attack patterns, making most fights feel fairly generic. Although there is stealth Lara can deploy in most locations to varying degrees, I would have liked to see better utilisation. There are also places that it seems you cannot avoid a fight using stealth.\n\nMultiplayer has been dropped in this sequel, but a new replayable system has been introduced called Expeditions. These have various challenges like Score Attack & Chapter Replay. Each challenge can be modified with up to five Expedition Cards. Cards are unlocked by playing the campaign, coins can be converted into card packs & also cards are unlocked in Expedition mode itself. Cards can offer all manner of buffs/debuffs to change up your gameplay, from Big Head mode, to weapons/gear, to other game mechanic modifiers. Certainly more appealing than multiplayer was to me, but I am not sure how many times I would find replaying the same levels fun. Regardless, for those wanting further replayability it a nice addition.\n\nRoTR ticks a lot of the right boxes that kept me wanting to play it through to the end, it’s an enjoyable ride for the most but over time the lack of challenge & overall casual nature of the game mechanics and level design left me feeling it was a bit lacklustre. Story was a tad predictable, linear, puzzle tombs were a bit of a letdown & collectibles system is a little excessive. Still .. I find myself recommending RoTR. I had a lot of fun in my play through, entertaining, despite some dislikes in the gameplay department it is one slick action-adventure game.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","February 4","true","39.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","3"

The system is now completely broken and everyone should pound at steam to fix it up.\n\nVideo review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plpwSPVKQKk\n\nPros\n+ Mostly improved version of the same formula but better, bigger and more exciting.\n\n+ Great storyline and flow of story.\n\n+ Great sound effects from environments adding immersion, voice acting and music also well done.\n\n+ Graphics and attention to detail, from Lara's wound, blood and sweat to even the snow sticking to her hair, deer leaving blood trails when shot etc The little details are surprising and those small animations you can catch her doing such as swimming out on water and wringing her hair out.\n\n+ Environments from desert, to snow and more snow and dangerous caves and ancient tombs galore\n+ Everything crumbling around Lara (Reminds me of Uncharted) but not above that level but still good.\n+ Good amount of open areas with hidden tombs and caves to explore and items to find.\n\n\n+ Emphasis on the crafting system in this game to upgrade items, weapons and skills.\n\n+ Bonus tombs for upgrading skills which is worth if for more efficient killing\n\nCons\n- Difficulty scaling, even on the hardest difficulty it was still a bit easy but you can only heal via herbs\nand harvested materials.\n\n- Fxaa film grain setting is very ugly, only performance problem is when I set SSAA x 4 on which of course impact performance but SSAA x2 works fine for me\n\n- Optimization problems for folks\n\n- Specs can be quite heft for those who ran tomb raider before and expect the same, it isn't and the requirements are much higher.\n\n- Spamming survivor vision can be quite tedious because it can only be used while standing still to know what can be interacted with.\n\n- Some guns could use better sound effects and handling it felt a bit weak at first but improves later on as you upgrade them but you'll find other guns which makes the other one feels a bit obselete even upgraded fully so you never go back.\n\n- Lara changing her looks again  (Got use to it this is a preference but still, I perfer 2013 Lara)\n\n- Expedition is the only replayability in the game, running through the maps you've done already to see who scored the highest points no other multiplayer options, replayability is low.","February 1","true","11.7"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","28","46","0","10"

We have great time together playing this game.\nThe game looks great, feels great and the gameplay is somehow rewarding even if a Swan Dive has no tutorial and nobody on internet knows how to perform one. I totaly recommend buying it and playing it.\n\nI do have some critics to make about this one though:\n1. Being unable to loot weapons from enemies. You have a chance to get 2 pistols so you can fight a bear, but instead you go into the fight with a bow, armed with some arrows poisoned with mushrooms that you do not know if will have any effect. She clearly knows how to handle a pistol, previously she had one with infinite ammo in Syria. But let's all jump with joy when we find part 1/4 of a pistol in an ancient tomb.\n2. In game micro transactions: You can flip some cards that can give you some changes when you try to replay the levels . A Challenge, a perk, an outfit. Normaly you can buy the pack of cards using the credits you get in game, or you can pay 2euro to buy a pack. Very unnecessary feature. (to be ignored)\n3. Day 1 DLCs and season pass: 3 outfits (3 euro each), 1 extra mission with a Baba Yaga that costs 10 euro and will take 1h or so to finish. (to be ignored)  But look, they have a 10% discount, so clearly they are not greedy.\n4. No game+ mode, once you have finished the main story, you can return to the areas to find rest of collectable items and eventualy unlock some outfits, but there is no point in having that because when you start a new game everything resets. (You can use your character progress in the Expeditions.)\n5. Steam Community manager with 91 games on her list and zero played time. That explains why this game was launched in the same day as Fallout 4 before the PC Launch. Some people are just not into gaming.\n\nI will not go in depth with the story and the clichees and the absurdities, this is still fictional character with fictional story and i did have a laugh at some of the finds.\n\nDespite all the aspects mentioned, i still recommend this game. I feel that those that are working in the development team did a brilliant job and deserve 11/10 for their work. I recommend they take some time off to play Witcher 3 and get inspired for next Tomb Raider. And maybe some Dying Light. You get the point :)","February 1","true","32.9"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","21","33","0","1"

With a simple 2 minute SLI profile update, a set of two GTX 980 Ti cards in SLI can run this game at 4k resolution with absolutely everything maxed out (beyond "very high" in game), and it never dips below 60 fps.\n\nGo here and follow the simple instructions if you're using an SLI setup:\nhttp://www.dsogaming.com/news/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-sli-fix-found-offering-95-sli-scaling-on-two-nvidia-gpus/\n\n____\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nWhile this is basically an updated rehash of Tomb Raider 2013, that is not at all a bad thing. If you liked the previous installment, you'll like this one for the same reasons. In other words, RofTR offers great game play, great visuals, a suitable story, and an overall great experience that's quite different from most of the other open-world games on Steam.\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that it requires a beast PC to run maxed out at high res. With a heavily overclocked 2x 980ti SLI and 5 GHz 6-core Haswell-E i7 5930k setup, I can't quite run max settings at 4k resolution. I either have to turn down the quality or go down to 1440p to maintain a stable 60+ fps. A single GTX 980ti can't even max out 1440p and always stay above 60 fps!

It feels like a playable movie at times (in a good way), but the cinematic aspect does not overshadow gameplay. It's pretty much a perfect balance.\n\n- Superb graphics. And I'm not just talking textures, particles, lighting, and shadows. The facial expressions Lara and others give while talking are hands down amazing. The way Lara's hair blows in the wind, or just jiggles ever so slightly as she talks blows me away. It's almost to the point where I can forget that these characters are nothing more than CGI. Futhermore, the way snow gives way at your feet and your legs leave dents, it's remarkable!\n\n- Fast paced gameplay with respect to exploration, combat, and puzzles. It's really wonderfully paced all around.\n\n- The amount of content is spot on. There is plenty to do: side quests, resource gathering, crafting, hidden tomb exploration, etc. Also, to expand a bit on tomb exploration, unlike Tomb Raider 2013, there are A) more tombs, and B) the rewards are MUCH more lucrative; so much so that it is worth finding and exploring every tomb you can.","January 28","true","30.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Why did Crystal Dynamics turn Lara into a total pshycopath? She is a killing machine more than an adventurer now and I think it is entirely the wrong direction for the character and games.\n\nTomb Raider Anniversary will remain my favourite because it was a remake of the first and both were mainly about solving puszzles in tombs - a lone character exploring the mysterious unknown, not some Hollywood style action fest.\n\nStill, like the Tomb Raider reboot, this is a fun game to play.  The mechanics are great.\n\nThe graphics this time around are impressive but not enough of an improvement over the last game to justify such steep system requirements. And the last game had amazing stereoscopic 3d, which this one lacks.\n\nSome of the supernatural elements of the story feel like a copy paste of the last game, which is a bit dissapointing.\n\nI debated whether to vote yes or no on this game and decided on no because of it's price. The campaign just doesn't feel long enough and the ending is stilted and rushed. At half this price, it would be a definate yes - at the current price I suggest that interested players that haven't jumped in yet hold off.","February 9","false","35.4"," 120 of 222 people (54%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","54","120","222","14","20"

It certainly doesn't disappoint. Rise of the Tomb Raider improves in most, if not all, of the areas that players wanted improvement from Tomb Raider (2013) including more actual tombs! I'll get to that in a bit.\n\nPROS\n\n- Beautiful environments. Graphics were really good generally.\n\n- Voice acting was good, It definitely helps the game.\n\n- The story, overall, is immersive and enjoyable.\n\n- Side quests are a welcome addition that add a bit more length to the game and include some interesting rewards\n\n- Tombs are definitely improved on the 2013 version, there are more of them and they're suitably challenging.\n\n- Character progession offers choice to players. 3 different skill trees with a wide variety of skills that will help personalise your playing experience and augment your play style.\n\n- Plenty of collectibles for people like myself who like that kind of thing. It provides a great reason to explore more of the world as well, which is well worth doing. It's not open world, but it's still fairly expansive in some areas.\n\n- Level design, especially toward the latter stages, is very impressive.\n\nNEUTRAL\n\n- I personally found key bindings on keyboard to be a little awkward, you'll probably want to rebind them.\n\n- The story, although really enjoyable overall, gets a bit cliche toward the end and I found myself beginning to pick holes in it, which ruined the immersion somewhat.\n\nCONS\n\n- Enemy AI just isn't that bright at times.\n\n- Controls when playing with a mouse and keyboard seem a little clumsy. Sometimes you'll randomly miss zip wires and jumps for no reason. I feel like this is a product of the game being exclusive to Xbox initially.\n\n- Definitely some bugs around. I found one type of craftable explosive to be paticularly buggy. As one example, n the final boss battle, it exploded next to the boss, who then just disappeared through the floor meaning I had to reload.\n\n\n","February 1","true","23.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

So if you liked the predecessor then you will like this game too.\n\nNow the downsides:\n\n- The "AI" is not just stupid... this is advanced stupidity, Enemies are only a threat when in great numbers, but not even then....\n- The difficulty is a joke, the game is far too easy. Even on the higher diffulty settings\n- The puzzles in the tombs and other parts are also too easy... how stupid do the designers think we are Oo (It is worth mentioning that the puzzles are more elaborate than in the predecessor)\n- The focus is too heavy on shooting than on exploring (of course this strongly depends on your preferences)\n- The jumping and climbing passages are not well done, it is always plain obvious what you have to do\n\nI didnt finished the game yet, the game says I have completed more then the half content. Since this is also counting collection optional stuff i assume I am at the last third of the story. Thus, I think the price is too high, because most of the play time goes into completing collections and gather crafting materials.\nIf you are unsure maybe wait for a sale.

Be careful where you tread.\n\nCrafting is now introduced, allowing you to craft special ammunition with resources you have gathered throughout the enviroment - great incentive to explore and gather what you can.\n\nCut scenes, motion capture and voice acting are some of the best I've ever seen in a game\n\nBig effort went into the level design, levels are beautiful with great variation. From the cold, icy Siberia to the deserts of Syria.\n\nGraphics are really big step up. Definately a treat to look at if you have a higher end setup.\n\nQuite a few new mechanics are introduced giving multiple new ways to engage enemies as well as adding replay value.\n\nTombs and puzzles are definately more challenging than the 2013 reboot and require a bit more thought, but they are not nearly as difficult as some of the earlier games.\n\nStory is great. There is always that feeling that you want to see what happens around the next corner.\n\nNew characters definately add to the Tomb Raider universe while giving great possibilities for a sequel\n\nCons:\n\nOverpriced DLC. The DLC for this game is really over priced. Pick the extra content up on a sale if you really want to try it out.\n\nAI can act in strange ways sometimes.\n\nAnti aliasing isn't that great.\n\n\n\nOverall a great game, definately pick it up if you are a fan of the franchise.

So as a  TR game I really enjoyed this game a lot! It has the feel and the exploration and platforming of a TR game that I love.\nThe graphics are spectacular with great effects and immersive beautiful environments everywhere! Its really very very well done visually.\n\nWhat I didn't like though is the difficulty of the game. I played it on the hardest difficulty and it was far to easy! Compared to the last game the combat was just a cakewalk. In fact it was so easy to headsshot every enemy that I  NEVER even saw the close combat dodge/quick kill mechanic till the VERY END OF THE GAME when the final boss fight forced you into it as part of the battle. Because of this I had no idea wtf to do LOL like seriously I had no idea wtf was going on since I never saw that screen the ENTIRE game due to the enemies being so easy to headshot with the bow. Even when the enemies get armor and helmets its still a cakewalk.\nI remember when they introduced the harder enemies/mercenaries. They play a small clip where they walk out and look all badass.....2 poison arrows later they are dead.... I seriously thought I was being trolled it was so easy.\nYou will not run out of ammo unless you try to waste it and run out.\nNow Im not saying combat isn't fun, cause it is fun...but It just isn't satisfying when you see a room setup for you to use all these perches and such to take out enemies but there is no point in doing all that when you can end a fight in 5 seconds against 10-20 enemies so easily.\n\nThe previous games combat was MUCH more satisfying and felt like you earned every victory in battle. People complained so much about the combat that the devs dumbed it down tremendously in this new game. To me I would rather just play a game without the combat if its going to be this easy...just Saying.\nEither make a TR game with proper combat or just make a TR game without it entirely next time.\n\nOverall the game is WORTH playing 100%. Just be prepared for easy peezy fights if you are the least bit skilled at shooting games at all!\n\nAlso I didn't bother with the endurance or survival modes or whatever they are called.

Lip movement and facial expressions are spot on. Couple those with the great voice acting of Camilla Luddington and you got yourself a very believable character. This allows the player to really feel Lara's emotions as she is forced to face all kinds of difficult situations and attempt to overcome them.\nThose seamless cutscenes that blend nicely with the storytelling. No wonder the description on Steam includes the phrase "cinematic survival action adventure".\nI also loved how the environment affects Lara and vice versa. Snow accumulates on her jacket and hair. Her breath is visible in the cold and she shivers. She gets blood and wounds on her skin after a nasty fight with a beast or human foes. Lara makes footprints in the snow. Her clothes gets dirty over time but you can always change to clean ones at camps.\n\n\nWhat I liked :)\n\nAdditions to types of upgrades from the previous game for weapons and skills. It's quite satisfying to acquire a skill and using it like performing a jumping kill from above.\nMore tombs! It's Tomb Raider after all, right? While the puzzles are not too challenging, it is fun to discover tombs and complete the raid which will unlock a new skill.\nMany outfits to unlock. And they actually look well-designed and practical (who wears a tanktop and shorts for climbing in the icy cold?) or just cool like those ancient outfits.\nCombat can be intense especially with a bear, a pack of wolves or multiple armed human enemies.\nLara looks really, really good! Your screenshot button will be abused!\n\n\nWhat I didn't really like :/\n\nLooting in order to upgrade your weapons and equipment feels tedious towards the end of the game.\nSide missions/challenges which I felt more compelled to do rather than willingly. If I want to do a side mission, I need good reason like perhaps a small backstory of the person I'm supposed to help which will convince me to lend a hand.\nMost NPCs are not very memorable.\nAction is at times too dramatic. I cannot count the number of close calls like how Lara finds purchase at the last second and preventing a fall to her demise, or how everything collapses right after Lara passes the area. Well, some may argue that's what makes the game exciting. Oh well :P\nHow come in every Tomb Raider game there are ramps or bars conveniently set up in some ancient tomb that is supposed to be undiscovered for like a thousand years? Just for once I wish they make it in such a way that there is no obvious way to progress and players must really study the area for a climbing path or to use tools or objects to create a path.\n\n\nSo... to summarize:\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nWhat you would expect from a Tomb Raider game. Lots of climbing, exploration, fighting and surviving.\n\nStory: 7/10\nGood story.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nImpressive graphics. Excellent detail on characters.\n\nSound Effects & Music: 8/10\nOverall good especially during suspense scenarios but I wish they make it feel more uncomfortable in tombs. Adding creepy music and sound effects for tombs could have made it awesome.\n\nVoice Acting: 9/10\nI feel voice acting is a lot better compared to the previous game\n\nOverall Score: And... I guess that makes it 8.2/10! But hey, I've been a TR fan for quite some time. Never missed a TR game since Legend so I have higher expectations. Others may very well give this game a 9 or 10!\n\n\nRecommendation:\nI strongly recommend Rise of the Tomb Raider to anyone who likes action adventure games with a good story, gameplay and graphics.","February 23","true","22.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I just got the credits, and the steam time counter says 15 hours. In the beginning I did a lot of collecting, but after about the half way point I couldn't really be bothered, so take the length of the game as you will.\n\nMain reason I can't say yes to the recommendation is the writing.\nFrom start to finish I couldn't really care less about the situation Lara was in, who she was fighting and what she was doing.\nThey did a really poor job of introducing the situation and giving you reasonsto be engaged in the story. Which was nearly opposite in the first game. You wanted to find your friends and know what was going on, it was mysterious in a very good way.\nIn this one, you're just told Trinity are the bad guys, they're really bad, and your father knew something so you should know it too.\n\nThe second main part is the feel of the platforming. Lara seems to constantly jump whereever she feels like, quite often to her death. Which really drags the game down since you feel frustrated at the technical aspect of playing the game, and not a challenge in the game itself. (counter point would be the Rocksteady Batman games, which usually feel really fluid and in control)\nAdmittedly I did play with a keyboard and mouse, which could be part of the problem. Not having an analog direction to push to might cause issues for the game to know what to do.\n\nI was such a fan of the first game that this feels like a major step down, which is a shame.\nIf you can get it for half price or some such at a sale, I'd say it'd be worth it just to fool around and shoot bad guys, and to see what little there is of the story.\nOne example is that at the end credits, the writing team was shoved pretty much at the end.\nWhen the User Interface Art  people are before the writers, you have some serious issues to deal with in terms of priority.\n\nWhich brings us finally to "Do I wish for another game?" If they could just give the writing team more time, or whatever they need to make it a good game. Then yes. I definitely would like to see Lara have some proper adventures again.\n\nninjaedit:\nThe actual "tomb raiding" can be fun, though the puzzles are either way too easy or require some incredibly annoying physics bs, which combined with the bad controls makes it frustrating at times.","February 9","false","15.3"," 56 of 104 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","56","104","4","5"

Others, like me, won't.\n\nSensationally, this game is extremely well done. The visuals are beautiful in a realistic sort of way, animations are mostly smooth and life-like, and the sound/music complements the adventure-outside-of-civilization really well. The exception to all of those rules is the gunplay. Shooting a bow feels great. Shooting a gun feels lightweight and flat, and the gunfire sound effects are nowhere even close to realistic.\n\nNow, for the material shortcomings. The game is dumb. It's stupid, and it wants to believe you are, too. Lara will literally tell you what she needs to do to get through a puzzle. The region's natives speak in that pseudo-Queen's-English that Hollywood swears sounds sophisticated, even though these natives have lived in isolation in the Siberian mountains for thousands of years. Every character over pronounces every word and avoids contractions like leprosy in that way that the worst Sci Fi movies try to make characters sound noble. "We must not fail!" says the military grunt from the US, instead "Don't ♥♥♥♥ this up," or "We can't lose!" or something else more natural-sounding. Good guys are unflinchingly righteous, virtuous and self-sacrificial. Bad guys are unflinchingly selfish, short-sighted and viscious.\n\nAll of that amounts to a story/game that's not fooling anyone. Lara's character is a piece of baloney that couldn't possibly exist in real life. Even if she did, she'd be someone you'd want to tell to crawl out of her own ♥♥♥ as soon as she's able. The same goes for the villains. Puzzles aren't puzzles in Rise--they're scripted adventure setpieces. Platforming is the same. Follow the onscreen prompt and look for the inexplicably white edges or the bafflingly placed ziplines (in the middle of a Siberian mountain range!) and press either "A" or "X" to use the appropriate contextual animation trigger.\n\nI'd recommend this game if you were someone looking for setpieces, explosions and visual beauty. If you're looking for something intellectually worthwhile, or a story that even resembles something novel, then don't bother.","February 14","false","16.7"," 56 of 104 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","56","104","7","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willywoo/recommended/391220/","willywoo","Willywoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willywoo/","97 products in account","I have a mixed feeling about this game. On one hand, it's extremely beautiful and the combat and climb-mechanics are very well done. On the other hand, it's plagued by performance issues and a shallow, cliché story.\n\nLet me eleborate on those points. Just like Tomb Raider 2013, the game is visually stunning. The Byzantine ruins, the tombs and the ice looks fantastic. When you discover a new place, you really are in awe and get that mysterious treasure feeling (for want of a better word). Also, the mechanics are intuitive and the controls are context sensitive, i.e. in different situations, the controls have a different result. For example, right click is aim, but also dive. "C" is dodge when attacked, but also letting go of a wall if you are climbing.  You can get very much done with just a few controls.\n\nHowever, what displeased me is that the story is essentially the same as the previous part: Lara searches for an artefact; the bad guys search for it as well. But Lara and the baddies discover first hand that the artefact is guarded by undead warriors from centuries ago. Mayhem ensues. Then when everything explodes, you have to fight the boss of the bad guys and kill him, end of story. The dialogues are also very cliché. "I can't leave you here Lara! No, I must go on, alone!" The emotional engegement is low; I really don't care if some of the cardboard characters die. I don't get the feels, as they say :p. A game like this must be very expensive. Too bad there wasn't any money left for a good story. It could have been so good, and a good story hasn't to be expensive at all.\n\nThen the performance issues. Granted, I don't play this on the latest and greatest, but I feel I should play modern games reasonably well. I play with an 3870K APU at 3,3 Ghz and a Radeon 7870 Black Edition. Even on lowest quality I  experience stuttering. Still, I heard AMD would patch the driver for this game. The previous game was smooth as butter however.\n\nAll in all a nice experience, really really beautiful game. Too bad of the story and performance. Would I pay 44 euro for it again? No. I would just wait until the summer sale and grab a cheap copy.","February 4","false","20.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","0"

It was OK, not something which could throw you of your chair with an OMG effect. Wasn't also sure to place it in the negative side. But the story in the 2013 game was slightly better and could stuck better in your mind.\n\n● Game performance 🚀The game runs really bad on an I7 and a GTX 680 - (I'm aware that the GTX 680 is already out of date, but the grafical beauty isn't as much better as the 2013 game.)\nHeard that it has also problems with a GTX 970 which is recommended for the game.\n\n● Weather ☁Lara is going through rough temperatures below -40°C most of the time.\nSnow, some rain here and there and that's all.\nMissed the +35°C from the syria mission for the whole part of the game.\n\n● Price € £ ¢It came out with a fixed price of 50€. It's a lot, even tho the game came out 2 months earlier on the Xbox one. Spoilers could be found anywhere on the internet before the release on PC.\nAfter the release the gameprice dropped on 45€, which was not a really good move by the devs.\n\nPositive side:\n● Environment 🌅The bigger open world!\nThere is way much more to do and to explore.\n\n● Bigger and more complicated tombs\n\n● Lara's look (Ofcourse dependent by your preference.)\nThe 2013 version of Lara was too young looking. Now we have an older looking Lara. 😍\n\n● More clothes (Mostly clothes for cold/rough temperatures) - Tank Top is unlocked by the end of the story.\n\n● Slightly better graphics\n\n● The purehair (better known as Tressfx 1.0 on PC) is now better optimized.\nHaven't seen big performance drops, even with set on very high.\n\n● More weapons, modifications, skills etc .. 🔫\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a really good game, especially if you're a Tomb Raider / Lara Croft Fan.\nI liked the design of the open world and the story of the 2013 game more.

Most fun I've had since Wolfenstein: The New Order.\n\n✓ Good story\nThe story isn't exactly amazing, but it's definitely engaging and there's a decent amount of character development and plot twists. Be warned though: the ending is inconclusive.\n\n✓ Great gameplay\nRotTR is a delightful mix of guns, puzzles, explosions, and a true sense of exploration. Even though the story is linear, the maps are quite nice and you can go back any time, explore some more and find new stuff. Enemies respawn randomly as you revisit maps, so no place is ever empty.\n\n✓ Visually stunning\nI know we're only in february, but so far this is the prettiest game I've played in 2016. It's as gorgeous as it is demanding. The "recommended specs" aren't wrong at all! Keep that in mind before buying or you might end up like the poor fellows in the negative reviews.\n\n✓ Way better than the last one\nBetter maps, more replayability, new mechanics, more tombs, better gunplay, more weapon/enemy/environment variety, and unlockable outfits! And of course, action-packed from start to finish.\n\n\n✗ It holds your hand a little too much\nYou can disable items from glowing when you use your survival instinct, but you can't disable the annoying on-screen tutorials. There is no way to silence Lara from telling you hints to solve puzzles either. It'd be really cool if all of this filthy casual-friendly stuff was automatically disabled on higher difficulty modes.\n\n✗ Pre-order cancer\nSquare Enix, being the money-hungry c***s they are, pushed their s***ty business practices into RotTR, infecting an otherwise perfect game. These practices include: Day 1 DLC, pre-order bonuses that can't be obtained anywhere else, microtransactions, and the worst part: Crystal Dynamics being forced to cut off the Baba Yaga campaign from the main game to sell it separately in the incredibly unnecessary season pass. 28€ for a 3 hour campaign, a difficulty mode an 3 skins? What are you smoking, Square Enix? CD Projekt Red charges LESS than that for 30 hours of gameplay. THIRTY.\n\nVerdictA must-have if you like: adventure, scavenging, third person shooters and puzzles. It took me 45hrs to achieve 100% completion.\n\nThere's a number of unobtainable skins (pre-order bonuses) that will probably be available later in a bundled/GOTY edition, so unless you're really on the fence to play RotTR, I recommend you to wait for it.","February 3","true","54.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

Its every flaw of the first game magnified by 10 in a severe case of sequilitis minus any character growth for Lara or any sort of decent plot ( The story is basically Tomb Raiders of the Lost Ark. ).\n\nAs opposed to continuing the first game's arc of Lara going from naive college student to seasoned veteran; You start the game as a remorseless superhuman killing machine and end the game as a remorseless superhuman killing machine that can climb a bit faster. Unless its a cutscence or scripted sequence, then Lara becomes a clumsy, bumbling idiot. Things will explode around you to give a false sense of urgency but there's no actual threat from them. Half of all the surfaces you touch will dramatically crack, crumble or give way. ♥♥♥♥ so overused and predicatable there is no suspense or excitement involved whatsoever.\n\nOn top of that the game will yell at you constantly about things being nearby ( OPTIONAL things it stresses ) and about items you don't have yet ( there's no surprises, it will yell at you exactly what item you need that you don't have yet. ). Every surface you can scamper up inexplicably has white paint on it even if its a centuries old tomb. Everything you can find is eventually marked on your map. So there's no real point in exploration and no sense of discovery. Just walking to map markers and pressing x.\n\nInvesting in skills actually makes the game worse as the majority are convenience options or things that add even more indicators the game can yell at you with. Or make the gunplay and press Y to instantly win easier.\n\nYour gameplay boils down to thus:\n\nPress X to not die.\nPress Y to win every fight.\nCollect a cynical amount of pointless things with no purpose but to pad out the game.\nRun through a sequence where everything around you falls apart like its made of paper mache.\nPress x to not die.\nKill critically endangered wildlife because Lara needs a new purse.\nCollect a huge variety of pointless weapons you will never use.\nPress x to not die.\nPress RB to turn any random piece of garbage into an IED.\nRun some more as everything comically crumbles around you.\nFall and slide into water several times.\nDrown a couple of times.\nSuffer at least two concussions.\nPress x to not die.\nGet waylaid, incapacitated, caught off guard or otherwise taken down because the plot says so.\nRun some more.\nPress Y to kill the end boss.\nUninstall game.\n\nAnd yes, you kill the end boss with a quick time event. Don't expect any sort of epic battle. Just press Y and win the game. Its a dissappointingly low note to end the game on. There's basically no real finale. You just go through another extended run/climb panic sequence then press Y to win the game. Woo. Every plot twist is telegraphed a mile away and half the plot is lifted from Raiders of the Lost Ark, so don't bet on a gripping story to carry you through the game.\n\nAlso, Lara did not bring a knife or a compass and at one point she willingly drinks 50 year old insecticide. Lara is a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n","February 23","false","31.4"," 66 of 124 people (53%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","53","66","124","21","8"

Short version:\n\nThe game should have focused more around the design of the optional tombs. Instead, most of the game is running, grabbing onto ledges, and climbing....over and over again without too much increase in challenge. Puzzle elements are few, but at least some of them are well done. The materials and crafting mechanic that was expanded for this game is underwhelming aside from the creation of throwable weapons while in combat. Stealth combat is fun but gets mostly thrown out the door near the end of the game. So. Much. Just. Running. Around.\n\nI'd reccomend this game if you catch it on sale in the future.

Because from these two options... sorry, but "No".\n\nFirst (2013) TR was more emotional. You really worry about Lara - always badly injured, always in danger, always breathing, screaming, crying. More lively.\nNew RoTR is... a shooter. "Lara. please, let's dive into war against bad people!" "OK! Why not?!" And after that you start playing Hitman or Splinter Cell. 5 enemies? 10 enemies? Why not? Take shotgun and kill them all! But it isn't "Lara Croft and Many Puzzles and Sometimes Stealth Killing" or something like that. It is third person shooter. In the TR I use only a bow because it was only opportunity to break through the game. Right now bow in general only for open doors, knot ropes and jumping.\nI think this is story writers fault and this is, for me, big huge mistake. Very detailed graphics, good level design, updated animations... and shooter.\nWaiting for the next part with more emotional, inexperienced in killing, deep breathing, solving puzzles, hurting, screaming, crying bad Lara.","February 6","false","22.4"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","27","49","3","3"

Crafting is much more enhanced and there are now many resources available to collect and farm, really enhances the survial aspect of the game. The tombs are also MUCH MUCH better than the reboot, more complex,  challenging and worth exploring. The game actually deserves to be called Tomb Raider now.\n- Graphics...OMG\n- replayability. The reboot suffered from a lack of replayability IMO. Instead of giving us a mediocre multiplayer, CD made the right call by giving us several new SP modes that greatly enhanced replayability. I really love the "card" features of the game that allow you to replay the game or just a chapter with modifiers, for example you can replay a chapter with maxed out gears and try it on the highest difficulty. There are also player created missions with different objectives.\n- Finally there is the Endurance mode (which, unfortunately, is sold separately for 10$). If you like a survival type of game mode that desperately tries to get you killed you will love this (Frostfall in Skyrim anyone?). The game basically gives you a small openworld to roam around, but different from the main game, Lara has a warmth and hunger meter that will decrease with time. You need to hunt and create/find fire to keep yourself alive, while trying to find relics in ruins and crypts and fight off/elude enemies. The slogan of "woman vs the wild" truly comes to life and shines in this mode.\n\ncons\n- the game is VERY VERY demanding. If you enjoy playing games on high/max settings with smooth performance, but doesn't have a high end PC, FORGET ABOUT PLAYING THE GAME, at least for now.  You would be better off playing this on XBONE. The game seems to be very unoptimized for PC, or just unusually demanding. So many people with 980 and even 980Ti are complaning of FPS dips. The game consumes a whooping 6.1 GB of VRAM in 1080P at max settings!\nI'm NOT saying that you shouldn't buy the game if you don't have the high-end gears. The game will be playable on even lower-end PC, but just note that you WILL suffer performance issues. You've been warned!\n- Apparently a lot of people are experiencing stability and crashing issue. So beware of that...\n- microtransactions for the expedition cards. It's pretty slow to earn in-game credits that are used to buy the cards that modify the game. The game is still perfectly playable without the cards. But it's clear that the devs intentionally made earning $ a lot harder so people will feel enticed by the microtransactions.","January 30","true","58.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This time round Lara Croft is driven by obsession, not survival, and for the first time we see her in shades of grey. Unlike 2013’s Tomb Raider, Instead Lara has learnt how to handle pain, command an arsenal of weapons and kill droves of enemies. She’s now a formidable fighter who inflicts more than she takes - but I did see the cracks in her moral compass.\n\n\nStory  NO SPOILER, only the story key.\nIn 2013's Tomb Raider reboot, developer Crystal Dynamics puts Lara into danger against her will, straying her on a strange island with even stranger secrets. But she's since gained agency. In Rise of the Tomb Raider, she's running headlong into the fray at her own pace, seeking the key to eternal life.\n\n\nGameplay  This isn't a sandbox, though--subsequent areas are gated by ability unlocks. Now more than ever, you have territory worth exploring. By going back to older environments, you can venture off the beaten path in search of useful abilities. Several of Rise of the Tomb Raider's areas are open hub zones, hidden environmental challenge, replete with resources, NPC side missions, and secret passageways.\n\nBacktracking to old areas is rewarding, too. Especially if you are a perfectionist—gamer who likes to finish game in 100% progress. It is rewarding because in Rise of Tomb Raider, every single collection/findings (mural, document, relics, etc) will boost your XP to upgrade your skills and coin caches to buy equipment and outfit. I knew exactly where that cave was I couldn't enter without the rope arrows. Unlike scavenging, scavenging does not reward you XP but worth to modify your weapon and craft your arrows and bullets.\n\nThe way the combat combines evolving weaponry and a choice of gameplay styles – you always have the option to go in loud or stealth and cover tactics – means that sequences are always tense. If you’ve forgotten to pick up some more wood, you’ll run out of arrows mid-fight and curse your laziness.\n\nAnd as the traversal becomes more varied and complex with your increased abilities, the world becomes your playground and more like the Tomb Raider games I’ve always cherished.\n\nIn the interest of building Lara to fit your unique playstyle, Rise of the Tomb Raider incorporates three skill trees: hunting, brawling, and survival. Each contributes to their respective fields in disparate ways, by making certain aspects of the game less challenging or more rewarding. One allows Lara to shoot two arrows at a time, for instance. Another grants her more ammo when looting enemy corpses. The wide array of skills works well because each feels worthwhile. Pursuing them adds another layer in an already nuanced system.\n\nThe most fun parts are finishing the Secret Tomb. It boosts your XP a lot and rewards you with one Lara’s skill. Unfortunately, most of the Tomb puzzle is easy to solve but hard to find the entrance door. It feels like, finding the hidden Secret Tomb is harder rather than solving the puzzle.\n\nFinishing the challenges, rewards you points to buy cards as well as to achieve 100% progress. Challenges in Rise of Tomb Raider are just like side activity to do to boost up fun. Burn the propaganda poster, cut the flags, find dark areas, etc.\n\nFor me the gameplay in Rise of Tomb Raider is very fun because it always keep you busy. You have so many things to do and touch up. If you enjoy the game and want to finish it in 100% progress, you will feel the same way as me. Anywhere you go, you find things to collect, finding new hidden map to reveal the hidden area or collection stuffs, finding new documents to follow the story plot, scavenging, fight with enemies or animals, find a new hidden areas, learning new languages continue main missions and do side missions and many more. You will even come back to previous place just to collect and finish up things you miss out.\n\n\nWhat is new    The New Crafting System   – Makes Lara’s scavenging and hunting in flora and fauna more intuitive. It enables Lara to craft or to upgrade her weapons which will help her a lot along her journey.\n\nCombat has also been revamped  - There’s now a much greater element of stealth so now, as well as engaging in close quarters combat, Lara can creep up and kill the bad guys using her new hunting knife, or even avoid combat altogether by diving into water or climbing up into trees and across rooftops. She can even create explosives with which to create chaos.\n\nNo longer will plants and animal carcasses  - Instead you’ll be gathering feathers from birds’ nests, poison from specific mushrooms, hide from a deer partially digested by a pack of wolves, and of course wood from saplings. These are just examples, but you’ll need them all if you want to be well-stocked for each mission.\n\nThere’s no multiplayer option this time around, instead you’ve got Expeditions  - Accessible via the main title menu, Expeditions let you replay missions within the campaign without affecting your main save game. They also let you tackle each mission in a variety of ways. This new single-player option allows you to replay chapters, jump into hub areas with new objectives or just go for a classic score chase. Each of these challenges can be modified in interesting ways.\nAs you progress through the story, you'll earn points that can be spent to purchase card packs. Cards can have gear or upgrades for Lara, or they can have other modifiers — tweaks that make enemies harder to take down or turn Lara into an unstoppable killing machine. Each modifier can have a major impact on how any one run through expedition mode plays out.\nNote:  Packs of cards can also be purchased with real money. However, just playing expedition mode earns more points with which you can purchase more packs, so it doesn't seem like people will be forced to spend real money at any point.\n\nGraphic  As for the graphics, the majority of the game takes place in Siberia, where the weather veers from fierce snowstorms and avalanches to bright, clear days. And regardless of the weather conditions, the world of Rise of the Tomb Raider is never less than stunning. The environments are often breathtaking, with some of the best snow and running water effects I’ve ever seen. Honestly, it is one of the best graphic video game. The detail of the character design is remarkable. Lara Croft's hair dancing smoothly, her facial expression is so believeable and cute, her skin feels alive, and her movement gives an impact.\n\n\nConclusion  Once again it’s Lara herself, however, who steals the show, her complex ambitions and hardened resolve showing new sides to a character who has well and truly grown from survivor to the most fascinating action hero in video games today.\n\nIf you love adventure, full of danger story, stealth, guerilla combat, acrobatic move, crafting weapon, upgrading weapon, bow, scavenging, collecting mysterious items, discovery, deadly land, wildlife, unique mechanism, exotic theme, challenging tomb puzzle, breathtaking view, woman, detail of Lara Croft that can make you c.u.m within 5 seconds. Buy this game!

Not a bad game not a Superb game. I had some really high expectations for this game mostly sorrounding the exclusivity issue. Made me think this game was going to be a gem. Meh, not so much. Don't get me wrong. The TR reboot was nicely done, superb and this is an extension of that creation. It's more of the same and that's not a bad thing but excitement and innovation thickens. There are some great addtions here and there that refine the experience but it's nothing substancial.\n\nThe saving leash I was hoping for this game was it's story. A great story compliments the game as a whole and Rise of the Tomb Raider starts off promising only to go nowhere as you progress. You suddenly lose track of the characters and their motivations. At some point you get a decent plot twist only to be delivered in a weak way with characters that have no development whatsoever.\n\nIn anecdote, Where things kinda shifted for me was when Lara escapes the prison cell, goes rambo on everyone in an eventual enemy stationed area. When you clear the area you have to climb insde the building right next to where Lara caused death to all the enemies; those very LOUDDD deaths and LOUDDD guns would have obviously be heard but you're only to be greeted by a cutscene of the villains plotting their objctive. "Wutttt, you mean you didnt hear all the commotion 5 feet away from you!? It is there when I knew the direction and story was not going to deliver and it didn't. It's not horrible but it's not good either."\n\nGameplay is fun. Platforming is fun aswell. There are also great set pieces as the game goes on that are impressive. Final act ends on a high note for me too.\nAll in all, the game did not meet my expectations but it's deff not a bad game. I will recommend for gameplay and the great action alone. It continues the mark of a reboot that was fresh and exciting but if the next game rests on that same strategy then I don't know... Will recommend. It's a good 8.0/10.0 from me","May 22","true","34.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I enjoyed a lot, but the game is kinda easy, even on hard the 2013 one was a lot more challeging. But this one got me addicted as well. Lara has charisma and thats almost all that matters xD\nFollowing the tomb raider saga, this one is also very short. Finished in 20 hours, even exploring. Expected a bit more for the price.\nBut anyway, its a good game that worth playing.

I'll be honest. All its gameplay mechanisms have been already shown to us in other games with a lot more depth, but in this creation you will find a positive attribute that is lacking even from games that are objectively masterpieces. This attribute is called Pacing. Every mechanic, cinematic or narrative asset is set in this game with almost surgical precision and dosages to keep gamer's interest at high levels from the first to the last minute. We deal with a sequel that is more "down to earth" in comparison with Tomb Raider 2013, without so many not needed extremities. There is a better connection between story and gameplay and tomb raiding is back with more complicated tombs. If you are a fan of Action/Adventure genre, you may give a shot in this game.","May 25","true","27.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atilex/recommended/391220/","atilex","Atilex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atilex/","713 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider is an improvement over the previous game on almost every aspect and should not be missed by fans of the series.\nThe story takes place one year after your adventures in Yamatai (previous Tomb Raider). This time, the opening level is in Siria with the rest of the action taking place in Siberia. Although most of the levels are set on a winter background, there is a lot of variation throughout the game, so it is not all cold and snow. I found the story to be more engaging with great cut-scenes and voice-acting to complement it. Characters are also well-written with back-stories and details that can be discovered by reading the documents found in the game.\n\nGraphics are a strong point for this game and it shoes that Crystal Dynamics collaborated with Nvidia to bring the best visuals and optimisation for PC. The nice graphics also require a lot of horsepower, so no wonder that this title has been bundled with the latest GPU's from Nvidia.\n\nGameplay is very similar to the previous title, but the animation quality is better especially with the stealth movement and sneaky attacks. I disliked how Lara's stealth movement is auto-triggered whenever enemies are close. I would prefer a button to toggle this behaviour and discover the next enemy location on my own.There is more emphasis on exploration and hunting, as you need crafting materials to upgrade your equipment and weapons. Optional tombs are part of the game and unlock some of your best skills after completion. Unfortunately the tomb puzzles are very easy (same as in the previous title).\n\nLevel design is liniar in most zones with the exception of 3 areas that are more open and can be approached in different ways. Range combat still feels better than melee, but this time the levels provide more opportunities for stealth attacks. Expect some level sections that just throw waves of enemies at you and some sections in which you just run and jump for your life. However, I like that quick time events are fewer now and Lara is still in your control most of the time. There are lots of collectibles and challenges to be discovered, but please note that some can only be found after you finish and return to that level.\n\nThere is no multiplayer, but some replaybility is offered with Expeditions. This mode is basically a scenario creator where your enemies, objectives and character modifiers are represented in the form of cards. Load any level with your custom cards and play it or share it with the community. Upon completing an Expedition, you receive coins used to unlock different cards.\n\nOverall: Rise of the Tomb Raider is a nice looking game and I can recommend it to anyone who likes 3rd person action/adventure. Offers good pacing between story, exploration and combat so that you don't get bored or overwhelmed at any time. It takes about 12h to complete if you rush the story or over 30h for No Stone Unturned (100% achievement).","March 4","true","34.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Yes it can run it , quite well too, while playing & not recording I can run it on high settings at 1080pp with a steady 50 to 55 fps. When recording I have lowered the settings (check my Videos below) with a steady 45 fps it still looks great IMO.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider, the sequel to the 2013 reboot of the TR franchise is it a good game to play?\nAnswer : Yes\nI was expecting Rise to pick up where TR left off - that didn't happen but yet again Lara is thrown into another action packed start to her new story. Lara's appearance has changed a lot from the March 5 2013 launch, not too happy with that but she is very pretty & alot shorter in stature lol\nPros\n1. The main story is good not great but it is enjoyable.\n2. There is so much to do on the map itself - this is where ROTTR really shines.\n3. The optional Tombs are better puzzle wise and fun with a reward at the end, better than just "a gasp of awe" or "a slight gasp" !\n4. Lara can now sprint & swim .\n5. lots of new equipment & weapons to have fun with.\n6.  A new crafting system.\n7. Side quests that give rewards once completed.\nCons\n1. Really no need to play TR 2013 before playing this.\n2. Tomb Puzzles are too easy & are optional again.\n3. AI are so stupid -but do have the ability to spawn beside you and attack lol.\n4. Equipment from TR 2013 only available by collecting coins and buying from an ingame shop.\n5. A new crafting system - the amount of hides needed for a tiny ammo pouch or an outfit is ridiculous - but whatever floats your boat!\n6. Lara has so many ways to kill she would put a serial killer to shame :D\nI loved playing this game so many hours of fun and still having fun with the PC version extremely enjoyable .\n\nMy Laptop SATELLITE P70-A-104\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUP201sSWcw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7abivbENFs","January 31","true","36.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/391220/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","If you didn't know already, I'm actually a pretty big fan of the Tomb Raider games. Not as much as other people, but I do have fond memories of playing it when I was much younger. The 2013 reboot, although flawed, made me remember and relive some of those memories, and as a result, I was excited for the release of this game. After playing through this game, I feel like that this game was pretty much the same as the last game, except more refined and far more exciting in my eyes.\n\nGraphics\nOkay, I'm going to keep this as straightforward as possible: this is one of the prettiest games I've played in years. Everything looks absolutely gorgeous, and from the first second to the end, my jaw was on the floor with the visuals. You might think that the graphics are "bland" because you're spending most of your time in Siberia, but trust me, this game is far more pretty than it seems, and besides, you'll be at other places, too.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay, more or less, is the same as the previous game. Shoot bad guys, do the occasional puzzle, climb over to this place, raid that tomb, whatever. You get the point I'm trying to make here. However, in most aspects of the things I listed, Rise of the Tomb Raider polishes these. The combat is entertaining, climbing from point A to point B has had my heart racing a few times (especially at the beginning) and there are more tombs in this game than in the last. However, here's where the problem is: There are a lacking of puzzles to the game, which isn't a good thing for a game like this. When there are puzzles, they're usually very simple and also anticlimatic. Uh oh, the bad guys are after you are very close to your position! You're cornered by another evil that lurks below you, bows in hand, and it's a race against the clock! BLAM. Puzzle. Oh, you're trying to run away from that helicopter? Here, let me give you a puzzle. And as I said before, these puzzles are usually pretty simple, so as a result, you can get back to that epic chase scene or whatever, but in that short period of time, I was just thinking "Oh, no, the bad guys are back. Yipee." after I finished it. What rush of fear I may have had beforehand would be immediately killed when one of these anticlimatic puzzles popped up. Plus there's some bugs that really got in my away, and a few of which crashed my game. But, the non-crashing bugs were actually pretty funny. I did get a good laugh out of one guy that was trying to grapple from one side to the other, and I watched his body stretch and teleport to my position. Not only that, but the game is still really fun to play. Like, really really fun.\n\nStory\nThe story was much better in this one than the last in my opinion. Trinity has a lot of potential to become really awesome in the next game, and I really enjoyed Konstantin, although it felt like he did borrow some cliché villain tropes. I won't spoil the story, but it kept me hooked from start to finish. While the 2013 reboot dragged out towards the end, I felt that this one told their story and didn't overstay its welcome. There were the anticlimatic puzzles, of course, but when the game wasn't at one of those parts, I was on the edge of my seat, cheering Lara on. Also, don't get me started on how AWESOME that opening sequence was. I think I almost had a heart attack a few times during it, and that alone told me I was in for a wild ride. Overall, Rise of the Tomb Raider feels like an action movie with an interesting storyline that sets up for the next game. If you like action movies, you'll probably love this game.\n\nAudio\nFinally, some good voice acting. Camilla Luddington was awesome as Lara Croft (again) and I was also a fan of Charles Halford, who played Konstantin. When he was around, he felt like a terrifying villain, and he nailed his role. The others were also pretty solid, but those two stuck out for me. As for the soundtrack, it was exciting. I critcized the 2013 reboot's soundtrack for not being very fitting, saying it felt more like something you'd see in a horror movie. However, Rise of the Tomb Raider is not like the last, and I loved the soundtrack, especially at times where my heart was pounding and ready to leap out of my chest.\n\nReplayability\nActually, the replayability for this game is much higher compared to the last. There's more content to it, and with some extra expansions to keep things interesting, you'll be playing this for a little while longer. I would guess that the main storyline is about 10-15 hours (depending on how much time you take doing other quests or going through tombs) but you should be able to get about 20-30 hours with the DLC probably. That was more of a guess, as I don't own the DLCs, but you might be able to get some fun out of it.\n\nVerdict\nI think the best way to view Rise of the Tomb Raider is that its a sequel to that one really awesome and polished action movie. It might not do much different, but it's still incredibly entertaining and has improved on many aspects compared to the last. Rise of the Tomb Raider is incredibly pretty to look at, has a very exciting storyline, a fitting soundtrack, and much more. If you enjoyed the 2013 reboot, then you will love this game.\n\nGraphics - 10/10\nGameplay - 8.5/10\nStory - 9.5/10\nAudio - 8.5/10\nReplayability - 7.0/10\n\n.:8.7/10:.\n\n+Gorgeous visuals\n+Incredibly enjoyable gameplay\n+Interesting storyline\n+Great voice acting\n+Awesome soundtrack\n\n-Lack of challenging puzzles\n-Placement of puzzles can kill the atmosphere\n-Some annoying and (very rarely) game breaking bugs","April 10","true","10.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It's a fantastic, visually awesome game that pushes Hardware and your wit to the limit.\n\nThis time it tries to get back to some basics where the Franchise started, Tombs, Crypts, exploring. However I feel that the puzzles sometimes arn't instantly logically solveable, it takes a bit to figure out, which in itself is a good thing, but it can jarr  the immersion.\n\nCombat is what we are used to. Arrows? Guns? Stealth? You have the choice. However, the only way to gain substancial XP is through Stealth clearing many areas. Basic kills still net you small XP.\n\nAudio cues are on point and you do get the feeling you are one with the area you are in.\n\nI recommend the usage of a gamepad, the keyboard can be finnicky but alas, the old bugs return. Look at ledge but slightly flick the view? Dead. I wish they could fix that.\n\nSo far this year, this game is my choice (well, until The Division comes out anyway).","February 14","true","30.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Lara has changed a lot from her first Survival timeline game, Tomb Raider 2k13. TR13's Lara was vulnerable and somewhat weak, but after the series of events in Yamatai (even revisitng Yamatai if you read the comics), it shaped her to become more stronger than before. The difference between TR Lara and ROTTR Lara are pretty noticeable. You no longer have to mash a button to stealth kill someone; Lara's more brutal and decisive.\n\nIf you loved TR13, you'll definitely enjoy ROTTR. The Baba Yaga DLC is also worth getting. Extra hours of gameplay and a pretty cool outfit.","February 14","true","35.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a good game in its own way for people who don't know or aren't as knowledgeable of Lara Croft's journey in the game industry, but imo it's not quite what it could be for diehard fans. Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed ROTR more than the reboot; it's just still lacking in certain areas that - based on the improvement thus far - I'm mostly confident they'll, well, fix for a lack of better words.\n\nFor starters, they captured the sense of adventure better than the reboot by providing better incentives to explore the land as well as expanding said area. Aside from collecting resources, collectibles (ugh), and challenges (double ugh), there's the bonus of a group of people you can interact with who give you missions to carry out. This, on top of the newly designed challenge tombs, makes the world feel more alive through the past and the present. It definitely helps that the entire game is more colorful and vivid than the dull colored maps of the reboot.\n\nAs for the action, they added a few more mechanics to spice up the combat a bit. There's an array of weapons to choose from rather than one weapon that's either swapped for a better one or upgraded to look different, and most of the weapons now have specially crafted ammo. In addition to this, they've added on the move crafting to allow different approaches to combat encounters; you can now craft throwables to either damage or distract, both of which can also be upgraded to do more damage or add damage respectively. There are more skills as well, but quite a few of them were hit or miss for me. All this combined with an enhanced survival instinct that allows you to see when an enemy is in view of another gives way for better stealth tactics if that tickles your fancy. I mostly played the game in this manner on the seasoned raider difficulty, so I don't know if that affects my opinion differently, but I'm almost tempted to say that the game seems to push for stealth more than guns blazing - which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe game unfortunately still went with the endless amount of men trying to kill one female, and I'll never understand why. This isn't a SJW or feminist point, this is from the standpoint of a longtime fan who wishes to see more adventure and puzzle solving than an illogical one woman army. It literally kills me inside when even the game acknowledges this with its "oh so witty" comments from said men who can't believe they're getting their asses kicked by Lara Croft. Yes, Lara Croft is a badass but she's a badass because of her intellect more than her ability to kill someone or something. In all the TR games she has killed to survive, but this just feels so forced.\n\nThat being said, the puzzles could use more difficulty still. I remember reading an article about how the devs were going to bring back nested puzzles, which they did for the most part, but then they turned around and said they didn't want to make them but so difficult that it would turn players away. I could understand that mentality back when Tomb Raider was first established because players still relied on physical guides or perseverance to get by, but in today's world where in less than a minute you can google the solution if you get stuck, I will never buy that as an excuse to not make your players think. I think there was only one puzzle that took me a second to figure out, and that was only because I got confused about one of the objects and how it was used. I also wish the puzzles existed outside of the challenge tombs.\n\nQuick note about said tombs, I can't express enough how much better they are visually. They're just grand and take the appearance of settings from the likes of Tomb Raider I-III with today's graphics. Though they could use some diversity of the physical secret discovered, they did a superb job nevertheless. The rewards gained are actually worth the raid even if the tombs are still optional.\n\nLast but certainly not least - the plot. It was certainly more compelling than the reboot in that the main enemy is more than a title; there's a backstory, there's emotion, there's a reason why that unfolds and intertwines with Lara's story. I can't say anything was truly shocking, but at least it's not Mathias...a potato is better than Mathias as an enemy. If it wasn't for my need to explore everything, the game would probably be short, so I guess that's a bit of a problem. I long for the days of, as another reviewer put it, globetrotting; I'm pretty sure if there were multiple countries with these kinds of maps the game would be much longer and have more depth but it doesn't seem Crystal Dynamics wants to put that kind of effort into it. The fact that they pretty much recycled the supernatural enemies (yay more undead men /s) and the final climb from the reboot speaks volumes of what kind of effort they put into the plot. I've seen some minor complaints about the overarching enemy, but since I grew up with Natla constantly having a vendetta against Lara it doesn't bother me as long as it's planned out well.\n\nPerformance wise, the game worked fine for me. My recent boot up of the game, during a loading screen, it crashed for the first time. There's a few moments where my fps will drop from the 60's-50's to the 30's and one time even 15 fps, other than that the game ran smooth. I have a gtx 780, a locked i5, and 16gb of ram so most of my settings were set to high/very high, and I refused to compromise on the pure hair at least being on because it looked weird off.\n\nAs I said, overall it's a good game.

This is now the sixth Tomb Raider game that I've played from start to finish, including Legend, Underworld, Anniversary and Guardian of Light (I also played, but didn't finish, Last Revelation), so its fair to say this has become one of my favourite game franchises.\n\nRise is probably my second favourite, behind Anniversary. It improves on the reboot (I really wish they'd given that game a sub title instead of just calling it "Tomb Raider") in every way, and its a strong contender to be in my top 3 games of 2016.\n\nThe good\n\n•	The story is very entertaining. Lara is searching for the "Divine Source", which could hold the key to immortality, but is also being pursued by a sinister organisation known as "Trinity". There are strong supernatural and mythical themes which have always been a signature of Tomb Raider.\n•	Lara's dialogue is very well written. She's one of the most interesting characters in gaming, intelligent, determined, with just the right mixture of badassitude and vulnerability. All of this is brought to life through top quality voice acting from Camilla Luddington.\n•	Better balance between puzzle solving/exploration and combat. Even though I enjoyed the reboot, I thought it had too much combat and not enough puzzles. Anniversary is my favourite Tomb Raider game because the puzzles are the primary focus. Rise is closer to a 50/50 split, except for the last couple of hours when it turns into a straight up shooter.\n•	The "optional" tombs are exactly what I enjoy most in Tomb Raider. Elaborate machines built by ancient civilizations, slowly piece together the solution, feel really smart afterwards.\n•	Having said that, the combat mechanics are pretty good. Getting stealth kills by headshotting guys with the bow and arrow feels great, and the assault rifle, shotgun and pistol are useful too against tougher enemies.\n•	Level design is fantastic. Most areas have multiple different routes you can take to progress, and the wide open areas encourage exploration.\n•	Controls work great with mouse and keyboard and are fully rebindable.\n•	I took 18 hours to finish the main story and all of the optional tombs, which probably makes Rise one of the longest Tomb Raider games.\n•	I didn't suffer any crashes or major bugs.\n\nThe bad\n\n•	Treasure hunting is a big part of Tomb Raider, but in this game (and the reboot) its just kinda dull. One of my favourite parts of Anniversary, Legend and Underworld was walking into a room and immediately seeing a gold, silver or bronze artefact up on a ledge or behind a trap, and then thinking "okay, how do I get there?". But in these modern games its more like you're just wandering around and suddenly see a box on the floor or on a table, and I just feel like "okay, I found a thing. Yay?" It just doesn't feel special.\n•	Likewise, the rewards for completing the optional tombs are boring. You don't get cool pieces of treasure, but instead you get abilities that aren't actually that useful. (Why do I need to fire a second arrow quickly after the first, when most enemies die from a single headshot? Does anybody get excited about unlocking "faster wall climbing"?). What I'd love to see in the next game is 1) bring back Lara's mansion as a hub/training area and then 2) have a trophy room where you can display all the cool treasures that you collect during the game, and finally 3) put some cool treasures in the game.\n\nThe recommendation\n\nOverall, Rise is a great video game, and its a good Tomb Raider game. Definitely worth playing whether you're a fan of the franchise or not. I paid full price and in my opinion it was worth every penny.","March 28","true","18.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Even if that seems like a pretty low bar to clear, Crystal Dynamics' writing clears that bar by a very wide margin, and sets less of a benchmark than they do write the book on how to do good characters and character development in gaming.\n\nThe thing I have enjoyed about both titles in the Tomb Raider reboot is that more than any other Triple-A titles their character stories carry the game through more than any single element of the graphics or gameplay. Lara Croft is strong, determined, and single-minded, but she is by no means perfect or indeed unaffected by her previous trials because by the same turns she is proving to be obsessed, brooding, and also reckless.\n\nThe beauty of all of Lara's character nuances lie in the subtleties. She has survived the Dragon's Triangle, but not without being changed. Lara's view of the world has been tilted, the illusions that everyone carries around with them are sliding away from her, and this comes out in her growing obsession with her Father's research, which is driving a wedge between her and everyone else she knows. This is a character story that is heading for a huge confrontation with the demons Lara keeps accumulating, and that story is going to be one hell of a battle.\n\nWhen Lara washed up on Yamatai she suffered through her ordeal as any of us would: fearfully, desperately and at times through tears and hysteria. This time around I was expecting a more mature Lara, I got it. I was expecting a tougher Lara, I got that too. I was expecting a Lara that was a little more suspicious, more attuned to threats, and I even got that. What I wasn't really expecting was a Lara who had gone past the point of confidence and in the other direction. I was expecting the stakes to be higher, and they are to an extent, but Crystal Dynamics have managed to largely sidestep this potential pitfall in the way the story of Lara's search is told through her father's old audio logs and Lara's own fireside diaries.\n\nLara Croft: survivor, archaeologist, Jill of all trades. She is still out her depth, but this time it's not the environment or the crazy cultists who have her overwhelmed. This time Lara Croft is overwhelmed by Lara Croft. Held hostage and pulled ever onward by an obession she may not be able to handle. This is how Rise of the Tomb Raider succeeds at avoiding the standard escalation trope through making the story about Lara, rather than simply about its gorgeous vistas, paramilitary groups, and ancient conspiracies. All the standard fare that has been part of the Tomb Raider cannon for two decades is there, but the element of realism that comes from placing the ideas of mental toughness and psychological/emotional vulnerability on separate scales adds so much extra depth to the storytelling without crowding out the current game's plot.\n\nThe core gameplay vis-a-vis Lara's movement and actions hasn't really changed from the reboot, but if you've played the original the storytelling makes this feel exactly like slipping into the same old patterns, so from the getgo Lara is ready to outrun black helicopters, tidal waves, crumbling temples and even collapsing mountainsides. The opening scenes recall all of the expertise Lara had accumulated by the end of her trial by fire on Yamatai, and the landscape and pacing also recall Lara's final panicked scrabble up the temple mountain to rescue Sam from Matthias. A walk down memory lane has never been so subtle, so visceral, and so accessible. Without a single black and white vignette, followers of Lara's previous adventure will find all of their memories being triggered, all while newcomers are getting their feet wet.\n\nAll the gameplay updates take place in the weapons, apparel, traps, and crafting mechanics and this too adds more weight to the story: Lara has been busy since Yamatai, she's refined her bushcraft and her jury-rigging skills, and become more proficient at living off the land. Her climbing axe, a firesteel, a length of rope, is all Lara needs to survive. I was worried that I would be taken back to square one in terms of Lara's skills, there is still a difficulty tree to climb after all. But rather than simply take us back to square one in terms of abilities, Lara gets a few extras from the getgo that she didn't have before. Being able to 'death-from-above' enemies or ambush them from the bushes from the very beginning, reminds us that Lara is a well-heeled adventurer, and the skills she is still to develop are a level above her current expertise. So all in all, the gameplay changes make sense.\n\nI was a little worried that all the resources and crafting would be overwhelming and time-consuming, but after a half hour getting to grips with accumulating resources I found it quite simple. Crystal Dynamics have taken the highlighting element that illuminates useful objects from their first offering and simply expanded on the number of different items one can collect, moreover most of the resources stick out normally anyhow, and there are enough of them on your way from A to B without feeling like you're being sidetracked. The amount of complexity is just right and unlike other titles with similar elements, I have yet to feel as though I am dividing my time between crafting and advancing the story. Once again Crystal Dynamics are writing the book on how to do things right.\n\nIf you like good character stories, but every once in a while you like to play a run-and-gun-hack-and-slash game to unwind with, Rise of the Tomb Raider manages to cram in the best of both of these worlds without sacrificing on either, and the story really does leave its fingerprints on everything. Do yourself a favour and buy this game, dive right in and get lost in it.","February 5","true","26.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jippalippa/recommended/391220/","jippalippa","jippalippa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jippalippa/","314 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider is a perfect sequel to the 2013 reboot of the saga; every single element that made the first game good has been enhanched and the whole experience is much more cohesive and organic.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider plays exactly like its predecessor, with a linear path to follow and some miniature "open worlds" inbetween where you can carry on secondary quest, search for resources and seek the collectables. The thing that makes this game different from other brilliant adventure titles (like uncharted) is the exploration factor itself. The game can be played following a straight path, but that would be a crime, because the developers really made some insanely intricate stages that require lots of exploration to be fully uncovered. The other great thing is that doing so is rewarded by the game, with some very useful gear and some resources that can be used in the more than satisfying crafting system. There are less spectacular set-pieces (unlike Uncharted), but here the player feels more in control and the environment really feels like a miniature world, rather than an amazingly decorated corridor.\n\nThe feel of the game has gotten closer to the original titles, with a Lara Croft finally acting like a true adventurer and an archeologist; there are murals to translate, coin caches to uncover and Lara herself is more skilled and ruthless than ever, while still mantaining her humanity.This time the violence in the game is more gounded and it feels less like a 20 year old girl which causes massacres without questioning her actions just 5 minutes after getting her hands on her first gun. The settings themselves are also very nice in this chapter of the franchise; we have slightly less variety than the first game (2013), but the platforming, the combat, and most of it all the puzzle solving feel much more fun to play.\n\nRise Of The Tomb Raider finally features that puzzle solving the fans were asking so much for; i'm not talking about the tombs, which are spectacular to look at and fun to play (although very short and very easy), but rather about the ambient puzzles which are very very easy but also fun to dig into. Weapons also got quite a nice boost, with a greater variety of arrows to choose from and a satisfying selection of firearms, for such a game.\n\nThe graphics deserve a separate chapter in the review. Rise Of The Tomb Raider is a technical marvel! This is one of the very few games that honestly look "Current-Gen" and in some parts the overall detail very closely resembles Uncharted 4. It has been years since i have seen such level of detail on a videogame and there are moments where it's hard to distinguish it from a movie. Cutscenes look like short films, and they feature the very best facial expressions and character models i have ever seen in a game that has actually been released. It's also nice to point out that the PC port is very well done and the performance are great; only a small note though: If you don't have a Titan or a Titan X (or any card with at least 6GBs of V-Ram) don't set textures to "very high"! The "high" level looks almost excactly the same (look for yourself if you don't believe me) and even if you have a GTX 980, Very High textures will saturate around 5GB of V-Ram (resulting in very low performance for 4GB cards).\n\nThe only think i didn't like about this game is the story; it doesn't remove the enjoyment from the experience, but it's quite dull, filled with cliches and not as epic as the first game's one. Even the supernatural factor has been turned down...\nYou don't care about any of the characters, except from Lara of course, and you can forsee every single thing that happens throughout the game. Again, it doesn't make the game less enjoyable to play, but be aware that you won't find a very engaging story in Rise Of The Tomb Raider.\n\nIn the end Crystal Dynamic's newest effort is a blast to play and highly recommended to all players. The newcomers will probably like it and the fans of the first one will adore it! The only people who shouldn't play this game are the ones who didn't like the first one...you probably won't enjoy this one as well.","February 7","true","20.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

It's the same type of gameplay with less quicktime events but with the same action packed, everything-is-falling-apart-around-me feeling you get during the whole duration of your exploration with Lara.\n\nEven though RotTR requires a bit beefier rig, it still runs perfectly smooth even with all the eyecandy turned on. Also - the new hair physics look awesome and natural with no bugs or random clipping like the TressFX had back in TR2013.\n\nThe game takes you on a journey to find an artifact of power that grants immortality. The same artefact Lara's father was searching for, and in the end - died for. Driven by her father's last words you take Lara on her first journey through the snowy areas of RotTR.\n\nYou get the same, a bit upgraded, arsenal of weapons and skills that you unlock through gameplay as before - but this time you can do extra side missions and optional tombs to unlock special skills and abilities otherwise unavailable.\n\nThe only bad side of the game is the usual half-dumb AI of the guards Lara encounters (although I was surprised to notice how the shielded guards actually move the shield up/down depending on your aiming), and the fact that you will spend most of the game in a snowy area. A bit of diversity would be nice.\n\nOne other thing that kinda stood out was occasional situations where Lara goes into Rambo mode. I understood her killing rampage outburst in TR2013 (being all alone and inexperienced on an island full of lunatics), but in RotTR she does the same thing once or twice when she could easily do it stealthy...\n\nApart from that - the game is bug free and pretty much a perfect sequel to the TR reboot.\n\nAlso - the game ends in a cliffhanger obviously suggesting a new TR that will directly continue Lara's story from RotTR!","February 4","true","20.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Story advanced away from the original series by the decisions made in this game, even if the mythical stuff remains. The game itself looks amazing, the sound design is great and Lara feels very real. Only thing that still bugs me are the optional tombs, which could somehow be better connected to the game itself. They are just simple puzzles you do not have to do, but when climbing trough old ruins they could be a much bigger part of the game and help to continue the story. Leave the special upgrades in the graves, for explorers.\n\nLara improved, she is not a little man-slaughtering baby anymore that cries about everything. She has become a man-slaughtering woman, a goddess with the bow and she is really fond of it. Oliver Queen got nothing on her!\n\nDefinitly worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jueis/recommended/391220/","jueis","eou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jueis/","385 products in account","This is truly everything that Tomb Raider (that is, the 2013 version) failed to be. It's not a spectacular game, but it's a huge step up from the previous entry in the series.\n\nWhen the previous game was released, it was showered with praise, particularly toward the evolution of the main character, Lara Croft. Having played Tomb Raider, I think such praise is quite odd. It was blatantly bad, consisting of bland gameplay, level designs, story, graphics, and an unbelievably lifeless cast. Worst of all, the title "Tomb Raider" appeared to have no significance, as the tombs were 100% optional, and were as relevant as the bleach bottles tossed at you as "puzzles".\n\nFortunately, Rise of the Tomb Raider is completely different. This time around, the game does indeed center itself upon a tomb, and all the areas the predecessor lacked in it shines. For example, the formerly laughable writing has turned into something more solid. Although still nothing groundbreaking, the dialogue flows smoothly and the characters are all very fleshed out and intelligible. We even manage to better understand just how important Lara and the Endurance crew's relationship with each other, or at the very least, her and Jonah's.\n\nThe gameplay of the game has also been improved quite a bit. Although still featuring the inane "Survival Instincts" button and unnecessary character skills, it's not as stupidly simple as Tomb Raider's, whereas you could just right trigger through enemies' bodies. Unlike the predecessor, I actually found myself enjoying and making use of the alternate forms combat, as well as the need to preserve certain items in order to make sure I would stay alive incombat. The stealth system also feels quite improved, with there being more to it than just "shoot everyone in the head from afar".\n\nFinally, the most important part of Tomb Raider is the "adventure" of it, which does indeed exist in Rise of the Tomb Raider. Every area feels very fresh, and all colored very vividly and beautifully, and every moment where you are on the run actually feels like an action sequence, rather than a five second QTE.\n\nOf course, all of that doesn't mean to say that there aren't flaws to this game that existed in the previous. The enemies still know your location at every moment, the game is still focused on telling a story rather than being a game, many of the tombs in the game are still 100% optional, and the ridiculous, waste-of-time collectibles are still here. There's even a "language skill" that you improve by collecting some of those collectibles, but even that just feels completely unnecessary. Alongside those collectibles is the collection of natural and man-made resources, which may or may not hinder your enjoyment of the game, seeing as those resources are mandatory to your "survival" throughout the game.\n\nAll-in-all, it's quite easy to say that Rise of the Tomb Raider isn't a great game, and probably isn't even the the best in its genre, yet it manages to be a very complete one, regardless of the somewhat-short length of 12-15 hours. It may not be perfect, but at the very least, it has definitely "risen" out of its predecessor's mediocrity and become something of its own. It's a very enjoyable game, and I recommend checking it out, especially if you haven't played the original.","April 30","true","15.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

I just got lucky with that, but that should never affect someone's review of the game.\nAs for performance the game has minor issues here and there, but I'm playing with most settings maxed out with a solid 60 FPS.\nI'm playing an ASUS ROG laptop.\nNvidia GTX 970m graphics (3gig VRAM laptop card compared to the 4 gig desktop 970)\ni7 4th gen 2.5 GHz processors\n24 gigs of RAM\n\nMy build is less than other people who are complaining of serious performance issues, so all I can say is they must be doing something wrong. Maybe one of the more demanding options turned on that they don't need or something. It's a great game and runs really well. It plays smooth and really draws you into the element of trying to survive. So far things are well paced and the story is definitely keeping me hooked.\n\nIf you are getting persisting performance issues, turn some settings down.

Maybe better than the older one.. or not.\n\nI especially like dat new outfit.. ' Immortal Guardian '? I played the game in my native language and I eventually don't know the exact name of it. Plz tell me if you do.\n\nBigger scale, bigger maps, bigger adventure and bigger story.

The feel of the game is very similar to the previous one. One difference is that it is more demanding on your hardware. For example the area with the soviet base is very large and I would get framerates dropping to around 30 fps with an AMD R9 Fury X with all settings maxxed and SMAA at 1080p 144Hz. This was using the latest 16.11 crimson driver. I wasnt happy with this so I decided to rollback to driver version 15.11.1 and I gained about 20fps in almost every part of the game. Not sure whats different about the newest crimson driver, but it does impede performance quite a bit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maveron/recommended/391220/","maveron","ㄨ.Maveron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maveron/","67 products in account","A solid third-person-action game, but with little tomb raider identity and heavy performance issues.\n\nTechnical:\nThe game looks stunningly good and the background design is georgus. However, as soon as i translated to the wide open areas, big framerate drops occured. Especially in the valley during the stormy rain time. Im talking about going from solid 60-85fps down to 15-25fps. i played the game with a Strix GTX 970 stock clocked at 1080p. changing grahpic settings had little to no impact, even going from all topped out to medium, always got the same fps. Also, during the beautiful realistic setting and graphics, i suddenly encountered the worst looking avalanche...ever..in a video game, a animation, a movie...no idea who goofed this one up.\n\nGameplay:\nJust as the first reboot title, it has good controls, nice climbing sections with diverse climbing mechanics, good gunplay but too much over-the-top-action sequences and so many collectibles, that is was most times just disctracing from the game.\n\nWhat it does better from the precessor, is that they included 9 Optional Tombs with nice riddles. However, its only exactly 1 riddle per Tomb, completed in about 3-10 Minutes each. As if this wasn't dissapointing enough, Lara keeps talking, not just giving hints, but telling you almost exactly what you have to do, taking out every challange of the puzzles whatsoever\n\nIf the hole game was like this, than i would call it a great Tomb Raider game, but unfortunately the main story, is just a linear movie like third person action game. Thanks to the good diverse climbing and well done stealth passages, this game can somewhat hold up to the fanbase. If it weren't for those two things, this game would have gone the completly same route as modern Resident Evil titles, leaving all identity behind, going from a puzzle game to a action-movie like expirience.\n\nThe game features great weapon upgrade and customization system, as well hidden strongboxes, wich grant you different weapons models with different mechanics, like a full-auto-shotgun instead of a pump-action one.\nThe strongboxes are sometimes pretty obvious, and sometimes well hidden. As you progress, secrets are getting revealed on the map. Combined with the possiblities to fast travel back to earlier areas of the game, it is absolutely possible to get 100% collectibles in the game.\nHowever, it's almost impossible to get every weapon upgrade in the game, as some parts are dropping off enemy soldiers. Some of them respawn, but it would take dozen of hours to get enough materials for alle the upgrades.\n(I played on the hardest difficulty, wich makes upgrading require more parts)\n\nHowever, there is one problem with the huge amount of collectibles. They are very distracting since there are so many. If you want to get them all, you will find yourself activiting the survival instinct mechanic every 5 steps, which got myself so annyoing, i wished there was nothing to find, so i don't get this flashy sound anymore.\n\nBeside that, the over-the-top action in the games, was way too much. Starting from the first minute in the game, i kept aking myself "how the hell would Lara survive that" ever 10 minutes. This game just trys way too hard to be entertaining like a michael bay movie.\n\nAlso, this game features the most usless attack helicopter in history.\n\nTL;DR:\nA very solid third-person action game (7/10) with nice climbing, stealth and climbing mechanics.\nHeavy Technical issues in certain open areas (don't trust reviews that only feature the first hour of the Game)\nGreat voice acting, fluent diverse gameplay and cutscenes.\nStill lacks heavily of Tomb Raider identity, having only 9 greater Puzzles to solve. Fans of the original series will be dissapointed, as the new inclued "Tombs" are just an optional sidekick.\nBut still, a very enjoyable single player game.\n\n..also, the worst, pathetic attack helicopter...ever","February 4","true","20.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Something seems less fun about the combat from 2013 I'm not sure what it is.\n\n-A few areas the frame rate just plummets. These are bigger areas and a ton of detail went into the world so it's tolerable.\n\n-Forced back tracking to explore some areas and collect relics and weapons. Gear is acquired level by level, which opens tombs and crypts from previous levels which were unavailable due to missing gear.\n\n-Short story. Not that short, but if you just play the game for the story without doing anything off the beaten path, I can guess this game can be completed under 15 hours. I have over 40 hours and I'm 50% roughly. It's worth taking your time.","February 14","true","59.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The game looks absolutely stunning, especially in the cutscenes but also while normal gameplay. Thanks to motion capturing, insanely high end models and highres textures the characters look very lifelike and feel beyond real. The areas each have an unique feel to them and are very detailed. Only downside are the resulting fps, especially in some outside areas.\n\nI also really enjoyed the story since it's solid, fun to follow and the characters feel authentic. Scattered around the map are countless letters and audiologs to find which tell tales of long gone individuals, like the man who chased the prophet. It felt very rewarding finding a new part of his story every now and then, since it also gives you more insight into the current storyline itself.\n\nThe gameplay recieved some upgrades as well, so it's even more fun to explore the relatively open maps, climb mountains, hunt for animal loot and decide for yourself which quests you want to do next. The game rewards you for exploring the area by finding weapon parts to unlock new weapons, single weapon accessories and so on. Gathering ressources enables you to modify weapons, improving their respective stats. By leveling up while playing and collecting stuff you can unlock skills which improve various general and weapon specific aspects of Lara, which is also rewarding.\n\nThe game offers at least 20 hours of gameplay without looking for all the collectibles. At this point I played it 25 hours and reached overall progress of 86%, so there are many more collectibles to find\n\nI highly recommend Rise of the Tomb Raider.

I was a huge fan of the first game where you get stranded on an island and you discover all of its secrets and you find weapons. Rise of the Tomb Raider is different with new weapons,outfits,map and a general storyline. The plot is very firm and everything is organized. The fighting is harder and I think the story is a bit longer than the first game. This series became one of my favorite series because it doesnt fail to bring you excitement and adventure.The game does not include multiplayer which might have been a nice addition with a different map but still loads of fun. The series sort of reminds me of the batman series which is probably my favorite series. Now the ending, is a cliffhanger which definitely implies a direct sequel. Some people may not like that because it makes people want to spend money but it was definitely a good way to end the game.

Less gruesome deaths for our lady protagonist (there is still some, and still just as cringe-worthy), really nice plot (while keeping it as realistic as possible), beautiful graphics, and Lara Croft's character development is nice. I like how the game is focused on puzzle-solving and exploration (which I personally enjoy in games), with some elements of stealth/shoot-em-down at certain points of the game. This variety of activities to do in-game prevents the game from getting too dull. The story's pace is nice, and the maps have many hidden caves and activities to do, living up to the name of "Tomb Raider". Lastly, I like how Lara Croft is not some buxom lady with revealing clothes, but instead a young adult whose adventures I really want to follow. The game does not try to give her a love interest, which I really appreciate. They keep the focus on the exciting challenges and good plot, while giving Lara Croft enough character to like, and yet not using sex appeal or unnecessary romance to keep us interested in the game!!\n\nIf I am to rate this game, I'll give it 9.5/10. that missing 0.5 point is because I still can't figure out how to multi-shoot with my bow.haha","February 12","true","30.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","1"

It's a great adventure, which is able to convey the feeling of loneliness and anxiety to survive in an environment completly free of any comfort and full of big treats.\nAll of this is surely about the excellent work done by the technical sector, which has made every details in the best ways, enabling the succes of the title.\n\nFirst of all you have to admire the addictive Lara's expression, which is able to express every mood. Another point in favor is given to the movements, which can perfectly delineate every situation, it's a indoor climbing, a race in the midst of deep snow, or a gunfight. All this is surrounded by a scene worthy of note, with the shots that make perfectly the climate.\nAlmost all of the game concentrates in Siberia; the deep snow, the wind, the thick icy mountains generate an ambient that is at the boundary between game and reality, also the perfection of film shoots, giving a further touch of class.\n\nThe sequences less hectic are excellent too, especially the one linked to the Tomb. All the puzzles are designed in a very perfect way and they make the game free od monotony.\nUnfortunately some flaw has to be assigned to the storyline, even it is to admit that improves compared to the previous title. The premises are very attractive; after the death of his father, Lara follows the footsteps of his father,she is looking for an ancient artifact that, according to legend, would give eternal life. Unfortunately, despite a dynamic and interesting start, the story gives way to the action part of the title. It is certain to say that if you don't like the first chapter, TR2013, perhaps you don't like this too, but in any case I think it is a great and funny adventure title.\n\n\nPro:\n\n- Better story than the previous title, but not the best story ever\n\n- Fantastic graphics, even better after the patch\n\n- Excellent cinematic impact\n\n- Excellent playability\n\n- Big areas and true Tomb to raid\n\n- Good crafting system\n\n- Several levels of difficulty and challenge\n\nCons:\n\n- The combat are not excellent\n\n- Small difficulties using a mouse + keyboard in some places","February 7","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The game looks absolutely stunning, especially in the cutscenes but also while normal gameplay. Thanks to motion capturing, insanely high end models and highres textures the characters look very lifelike and feel beyond real. The areas each have an unique feel to them and are very detailed. Only downside are the resulting fps, especially in some outside areas.\n\nI also really enjoyed the story since it's solid, fun to follow and the characters feel authentic. Scattered around the map are countless letters and audiologs to find which tell tales of long gone individuals, like the man who chased the prophet. It felt very rewarding finding a new part of his story every now and then, since it also gives you more insight into the current storyline itself.\n\nThe gameplay recieved some upgrades as well, so it's even more fun to explore the relatively open maps, climb mountains, hunt for animal loot and decide for yourself which quests you want to do next. The game rewards you for exploring the area by finding weapon parts to unlock new weapons, single weapon accessories and so on. Gathering ressources enables you to modify weapons, improving their respective stats. By leveling up while playing and collecting stuff you can unlock skills which improve various general and weapon specific aspects of Lara, which is also rewarding.\n\nThe game offers at least 20 hours of gameplay without looking for all the collectibles. At this point I played it 25 hours and reached overall progress of 86%, so there are many more collectibles to find\n\nI highly recommend Rise of the Tomb Raider. It's a must buy!","February 28","true","25.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The Story, them Graphics, the Tombs, the Challanges, the Maps, they are bigger and better in every way. Not sure how long is the story mode itself, but it took me around 30+ hours to 100% the game. Great balance between action, exploring and Tomb Raiding. This is...a truly...a must play title.\nLot of ppl reported problems with frames droping, stuttering and even freezes on high-end computers. Sadly, I have to say that I had similar problems but nothing that extreme. Stuttering was fixes simply by lowering textures on HIGH (even tho i run two OverClocked 970s) and everything else on Very High. FPS drops where still present, especially on huge maps like Soviet Installation or Geotermal Valley, but it didn't stopped me from enjoying the hell out of game. Go. Now.

I was more impressed with Baba Yaga instead of the main villain\n-The ending to me was somewhat disappointing, for obvious reasons not going to explain why but it was a tad anti-climactic\n-The game feels a bit too easy even when played on Survivor (which is the hardest mode)\n-The season pass is very barebones for what you pay for: Baba Yaga (which is like 3 hours, 4 if you stretch it with 100% completion), a horde mode & a survival mode. I'd rather have them make more 'story' content than tacked-in survival or horde mode stuff which is, lets be honest, pretty boring in nearly every game and serves as pure filler for the pass.\nRegardless I bought the season pass knowing what was in it to support the developers for creating this game but it really is not worth the money asked for - Baba Yaga is good but short and also the only content that really interests me\n\nRegardless of the cons, this game is fantastic and should be played by anyone interested in the genre or the IP (scratch that, everyone should play this, period), this game brings the new standard and it will be immensely hard to be knocked off its throne.","February 6","true","27.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I play at my native res of 1440p with no vysnc so framerates are uncapped and the above is just an average. All settings accept AA are maxed or enable (including Pure Hair ) .\nSo if you have a similar system thats a pretty good idea of what you can expect performance wise as of the posting of this reveiw.\n\nGamePlay:\nSimilar to TR 2013 in that its action focused around big set pieces and intense up close interactions (like a Giant Grizzly popping out on you!)  It takes 2013's formula and pumps it up on steroids, better graphics. More intricate ruins/tombs to explore.  The crafting/upgrade system offers a ton more. Now instead of just  collecting scrap you will find actual resources, such as wood,berries,minerals,cloth and animal hides just to name a few. You can make different types of arrows, as well as upgrading your stuff. The collectables have a cool progression to them too, you will need to find artifacts releating to different ancient cultures to increase your proficieny in reading stuff (ie learning greek,mongolian etc) which helps to unlock the games more powerfull upgrades.  Laura's costumes come with different stat bonuses, giving you an excuse to wear a variety of them for more than just aesthetic value.\n\nThis game offers a real globe trotting feel compared to TR2013, which took place on one large island. In RotTR you will be zipping around to Syria, Siberia along with cutscenes that show life back in London. The main search is for some artifact that grants immortality, which was the undoing of Laura's father who was obsessed with the subject.  Very Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade like, but thats not bad imo you can have worse things to base you game plot around.\n\nControls:  Much like TR2013 controls are tight allowing for easy switching from ranged to melee in combat. This is enhanced by upgrades to have more melee or better shooting/bow skills.  There is a greater focus on allowing stealth gameplay which opens up how you attack a level.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you liked TR 2013 you will love RotTR because it follows the previous game's modis of operation, but it bigger, better and more intricate in just about every way. Just make sure you have the HW to run it first and take the time to find the right settings in the graphics menu that will be appropriate to your hardware.","February 2","true","33.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a great adventure, which is able to convey the feeling of loneliness and anxiety to survive in an environment completly free of any comfort and full of big treats.\nAll of this is surely about the excellent work done by the technical sector, which has made every details in the best ways, enabling the succes of the title.\n\nFirst of all you have to admire the addictive Lara's expression, which is able to express every mood. Another point in favor is given to the movements, which can perfectly delineate every situation, it's a indoor climbing, a race in the midst of deep snow, or a gunfight. All this is surrounded by a scene worthy of note, with the shots that make perfectly the climate.\nAlmost all of the game concentrates in Siberia; the deep snow, the wind, the thick icy mountains generate an ambient that is at the boundary between game and reality, also the perfection of film shoots, giving a further touch of class.\n\nThe sequences less hectic are excellent too, especially the one linked to the Tomb. All the puzzles are designed in a very perfect way and they make the game free od monotony.\nUnfortunately some flaw has to be assigned to the storyline, even it is to admit that improves compared to the previous title. The premises are very attractive; after the death of his father, Lara follows the footsteps of his father,she is looking for an ancient artifact that, according to legend, would give eternal life. Unfortunately, despite a dynamic and interesting start, the story gives way to the action part of the title. It is certain to say that if you don't like the first chapter, TR2013, perhaps you don't like this too, but in any case I think it is a great and funny adventure title.\n\n\nPro:\n\n- Better story than the previous title, but not the best story ever\n\n- Fantastic graphics, even better after the patch\n\n- Excellent cinematic impact\n\n- Excellent playability\n\n- Big areas and true Tomb to raid\n\n- Good crafting system\n\n- Several levels of difficulty and challenge\n\nCons:\n\n- The combat are not excellent\n\n- Small difficulties using a mouse + keyboard in some places","February 7","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Exploring tombs feels very fun as completing their puzzles reward you with really good power ups you would not be able to obtain otherwise.  One of the best single-player experiences since Alien: Isolation.","February 6","true","23.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Less gruesome deaths for our lady protagonist (there is still some, and still just as cringe-worthy), really nice plot (while keeping it as realistic as possible), beautiful graphics, and Lara Croft's character development is nice. I like how the game is focused on puzzle-solving and exploration (which I personally enjoy in games), with some elements of stealth/shoot-em-down at certain points of the game. This variety of activities to do in-game prevents the game from getting too dull. The story's pace is nice, and the maps have many hidden caves and activities to do, living up to the name of "Tomb Raider". Lastly, I like how Lara Croft is not some buxom lady with revealing clothes, but instead a young adult whose adventures I really want to follow. The game does not try to give her a love interest, which I really appreciate. They keep the focus on the exciting challenges and good plot, while giving Lara Croft enough character to like, and yet not using sex appeal or unnecessary romance to keep us interested in the game!!\n\nIf I am to rate this game, I'll give it 9.5/10. that missing 0.5 point is because I still can't figure out how to multi-shoot with my bow.haha","February 12","true","30.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","1"

I play at my native res of 1440p with no vysnc so framerates are uncapped and the above is just an average. All settings accept AA are maxed or enable (including Pure Hair ) .\nSo if you have a similar system thats a pretty good idea of what you can expect performance wise as of the posting of this reveiw.\n\nGamePlay:\nSimilar to TR 2013 in that its action focused around big set pieces and intense up close interactions (like a Giant Grizzly popping out on you!)  It takes 2013's formula and pumps it up on steroids, better graphics. More intricate ruins/tombs to explore.  The crafting/upgrade system offers a ton more. Now instead of just  collecting scrap you will find actual resources, such as wood,berries,minerals,cloth and animal hides just to name a few. You can make different types of arrows, as well as upgrading your stuff. The collectables have a cool progression to them too, you will need to find artifacts releating to different ancient cultures to increase your proficieny in reading stuff (ie learning greek,mongolian etc) which helps to unlock the games more powerfull upgrades.  Laura's costumes come with different stat bonuses, giving you an excuse to wear a variety of them for more than just aesthetic value.\n\nThis game offers a real globe trotting feel compared to TR2013, which took place on one large island. In RotTR you will be zipping around to Syria, Siberia along with cutscenes that show life back in London. The main search is for some artifact that grants immortality, which was the undoing of Laura's father who was obsessed with the subject.  Very Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade like, but thats not bad imo you can have worse things to base you game plot around.\n\nControls:  Much like TR2013 controls are tight allowing for easy switching from ranged to melee in combat. This is enhanced by upgrades to have more melee or better shooting/bow skills.  There is a greater focus on allowing stealth gameplay which opens up how you attack a level.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you liked TR 2013 you will love RotTR because it follows the previous game's modis of operation, but it bigger, better and more intricate in just about every way. Just make sure you have the HW to run it first and take the time to find the right settings in the graphics menu that will be appropriate to your hardware.","February 2","true","33.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Something seems less fun about the combat from 2013 I'm not sure what it is.\n\n-A few areas the frame rate just plummets. These are bigger areas and a ton of detail went into the world so it's tolerable.\n\n-Forced back tracking to explore some areas and collect relics and weapons. Gear is acquired level by level, which opens tombs and crypts from previous levels which were unavailable due to missing gear.\n\n-Short story. Not that short, but if you just play the game for the story without doing anything off the beaten path, I can guess this game can be completed under 15 hours. I have over 40 hours and I'm 50% roughly.

I was a huge fan of the first game where you get stranded on an island and you discover all of its secrets and you find weapons. Rise of the Tomb Raider is different with new weapons,outfits,map and a general storyline. The plot is very firm and everything is organized. The fighting is harder and I think the story is a bit longer than the first game. This series became one of my favorite series because it doesnt fail to bring you excitement and adventure.The game does not include multiplayer which might have been a nice addition with a different map but still loads of fun. The series sort of reminds me of the batman series which is probably my favorite series. Now the ending, is a cliffhanger which definitely implies a direct sequel. Some people may not like that because it makes people want to spend money but it was definitely a good way to end the game.

But of course I tried not to be hyped since the last years many games were overhyped - when you played them or saw actual gameplay footage they were just bad or not close to what trailers showed.\nBut this title just surprised me. First, I was overwhelmed by the graphics (I didnt play too many new AAA Titles the last year, but if you did, i guess you'll still find it pretty). Then I saw how big some of the areas are and again was surprised. Beautiful landscapes and if you look close enough, they are full with collectables. As you may want to know, I played the game on 100%, got all of the collectables. And I was never really bored by searching the map. Gameplay was really good - Mechanics worked well and control input felt natural. I don't want to spoil the mechanics, which are augmented during the game. It's hard to describe, but I really loved the experience I had playing this game.  The story however is ok, a little bit flat and predictable (No trash plot  though).\n\nConclusion\nIf you played Tomb Raider 2013, you'll love that game. Some things are similar, but Rise of the Tomb Raider is better in many ways. I highly recommend this game to everybody who enjoys adventures, singleplayer, nicely designed game worlds and collecting (Also recommend the game when you don't like the last aspect since you can play it without searching for all the little things and sidequesting).

The graphics have had a major upgrade (this is one of the best looking games currently available...it will definitely put your CPU & video card through their paces as the cutscenes seamlessly transition into gameplay sequences and massive, highly detailed set pieces fill your monitor with spectacle and wonder) and the gameplay has been tweaked and refined here and there, but the plot progression, writing, variety of locales and level design, character development, and general level of quality didn't quite live up to my expectations. It is a much denser game - there are more interactive environmental factors, the areas are larger (though not as numerous, which works against the game as the plot is constantly progressing forward while you’re revisiting many of the same areas), and you have more hunting and combat options at your disposal - but the pacing and the manner in which the plot and settings unfold are uneven and streamlined to a fault. The campaign is very short...while I completed it in 30 hours, I spent much of that time collecting optional items and going on side quests completely tangential to the main storyline. The story missions themselves can be finished in around 15 hours that pass very quickly. While this is not a flaw in and of itself, the story contained in that short time is very flat and predictable (with a particularly mediocre ending), filled with one-dimensional characters we're never given much reason to feel much of anything toward. Much more could've been done with Lara Croft's backstory in particular, as she has the potential to be a very strong character (which is crucial as there are far too few portrayals of complex female characters in videogames) but her motivation is generic and never truly explored beyond a few rather forced flashbacks.\n\nDon't get me wrong – I very much enjoyed playing this and plan on going back to revisit earlier sections with tools acquired later in the game to explore the world more thoroughly (Metroidvania style, much like the 2013 Tomb Raider). I just never felt as though this surpassed the original in any way apart from the graphical upgrades. Beneath its brilliant sheen lays an emptier, more uneven and less memorable experience by comparison; regardless, it's superior to many of its peers and a high quality title well worth playing, though I would recommend waiting for a sale (I was lucky enough to find a discounted pre-purchase). Also, don't expect to run this at higher settings unless you have a powerful PC, as it is one of the most graphic-intensive games currently available (at the very least, Lara Croft has the most graphic-intensive hair currently available)...it's just too bad that is its biggest improvement over its predecessor.","January 31","true","64.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It generally relies on the same mechanics with new twists here and there, improved progression, more varied and more challenging combat etc. etc... The result is unsurprisngly a very good game, and if you have enjoyed the 2013 Tomb Raider, you will certainly enjoy this one even more. For your money you'll be getting around 35 hours of singleplayer gameplay for one complete playthrough, and then of course you can enjoy the multiplayer which is geared towards playing in a smaller group of friends. Over all I'd say the purchase is well worth it.\n\nI'll elaborate on a few things below if you're interested:\n\nPUZZLES: People say they're too easy. In my opinion, yes and no. They're not gonna send you looking for a youtube guide, that's for sure, but on the other hand, they're not gonna send you looking for a youtube guide. You're faced with solid, multi-stage puzzless you can solve yourself in 10-20 minutes and have all the sense of accomplishment for yourself. I rate that as a good thing, it's a nice middle ground. Although I would have preferred if these kinds were confined to the main story so as not to hinder progress where everyone has to go through them, and then the optional tombs should perhaps be a head scratcher.\n\nTHE WORLD: It isn't really open as is often said, it's handled the same way it was done in the previous game, a series of areas, some very big, some very small. But none that would take more than a couple minutes to traverse from side to side. There is of course collectibles and little climbing sequences and what have you scattered all about and I have actually much enjoyed doing them. part of this has to do with the fact that they're often blocked off until you acquire specific gear to access them by progressing the main story. I wasn't too sure about this, in the end deciding it's a good thing, since it forces you to do portions of scurrying about and doing missions, thus giving you a balnced portion of both, and preventing either from becoming mundane. The downside of course being that you have to come back to areas you've already been to multiple times.\n\nTHE STORY: Not much to be said about that, nothing stellar, but decent enough to keep you wanting to learn more, though the characters often lacked depth and unless you go through the trouble of collecting and reading the documents scattered around the world it might even feel a bit lackluster and bare bones. But seeing as I did, I have no real complaints.\n\nTHE SEQUEL: This to me is my biggest fear. RotTR was nodoubt a good game. But you could feel they were afraid to experiment. They polished and improved, carefully put in a new idea here and there, but all in all not that much has really changed. The Assassins Creed is an excellent comparison here. We've had AC 1, and now an AC 2, so let's hope to god the next TR game the devs will be allowed some creativity and we won't have an AC 3.\n","May 23","true","31.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

All those ancient flavours are present here. I feel like a kid playing this game, and is ♥♥♥♥ing great.\n\nWhat a game!! The game is an improvement of all the things its predecesor had in every single way possible, so if you like the first one this will blow up your mind. Like the first one is more Lara Croft meets Sam Fisher in the wilderness. Lara feels more grown-up, the story is far more interesting and it's very well written (will catch you). The game is more dark and violent (even gruesome sometimes). Now the characters are really interesting too. nice exploration, in fact now exploring is really interesting because it rewards you with weapon upgrades, skills... a better narrative, bigger escenarios, puzzles, tombs (great ones and more well designed. The tombs are really big, you even forget that are optional), the combat is very fun and well made, better stealth moments (with specific skills), crafting (make ammo, new equipment, outfits, different stuff...), a lot of weapon (four different categories) with different stats and improvements, new skills, there are sidequest now, those missions reward you with special upgrades... and the game is visually astonishing. Evocative, amazing, beautiful and incredibly dynamic. Best action-adventure in a very long time.\n\nAs a final note, the character of Lara is amazing, strong, capable, determined and tenacious. Her evolution over previous game was amazing, and even more in this one. We need stronger and   REAL  women in video games, and not those stereotyped who always need a man to rescue them.","March 27","true","14.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Combine the stealth approaches with either the seasoned raider or survivor difficultly levels, and the game should be very appealing.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610443306\n\nThe main story line isn't that challenging, but the optional tombs do provide relief towards the game feeling like a cake walk. I couldn't see myself playing with the difficulty set below seasoned raider.\n\nOne improvement from the 2013 game is that there are a lot more options as to customization and crafting. There are more items to craft, and more items used in crafting.\n\nAnother would be the very optional quests you can do. These would be familiar territory for any RPG players who are also looking to play Rise of the Tomb Raider.\n\nWhile there isn't much for the simple plot and limited game play time (about 15 hours), the graphics are leading edge. I've told a lot of people that this title is clearly a milestone as to computer graphics. We are getting closer and closer to being able to have movie quality graphics rendered in real time. On my system with a GTX 980Ti, it was very obvious when there were sadly still a few pre-rendered video cut scenes.\n\nFor some reason, these pre-rendered cut scene videos were not even 60fps, but rather 30. No idea why that was, because a few of the scenes my system would have been more than capable of handling the rendering them.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612452475\n\nThe main reasons you are going to end up playing Rise of the Tomb Raider are really going to be: you like the action of the latest Tomb Raider games, you like the graphics, and maybe you even enjoy Lara.","February 27","true","15.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","2"

Combine the stealth approaches with either the seasoned raider or survivor difficultly levels, and the game should be very appealing.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610443306\n\nThe main story line isn't that challenging, but the optional tombs do provide relief towards the game feeling like a cake walk. I couldn't see myself playing with the difficulty set below seasoned raider.\n\nOne improvement from the 2013 game is that there are a lot more options as to customization and crafting. There are more items to craft, and more items used in crafting.\n\nAnother would be the very optional quests you can do. These would be familiar territory for any RPG players who are also looking to play Rise of the Tomb Raider.\n\nWhile there isn't much for the simple plot and limited game play time (about 15 hours), the graphics are leading edge. I've told a lot of people that this title is clearly a milestone as to computer graphics. We are getting closer and closer to being able to have movie quality graphics rendered in real time. On my system with a GTX 980Ti, it was very obvious when there were sadly still a few pre-rendered video cut scenes.\n\nFor some reason, these pre-rendered cut scene videos were not even 60fps, but rather 30. No idea why that was, because a few of the scenes my system would have been more than capable of handling the rendering them.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612452475\n\nThe main reasons you are going to end up playing Rise of the Tomb Raider are really going to be: you like the action of the latest Tomb Raider games, you like the graphics, and maybe you even enjoy Lara.","February 27","true","15.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","2"

Where the caves of the first game had you actually thinking about where to cling on to, this one feels like a walking simulator..... grappling walls are perfectly placed,  There is always a climbing board right where you need it, and why the heck are there so many gadgets.....\n\nThere are a few side missions in the game, but they are laughable.... There is one part where you have to carry supplies to a lower part of the map, then instructed to return to the upper part of the map to get more, then back to the lower, then once again back to the upper to turn in the quest..... I almost threw up at how padded that was designed...\n\nThe first one's story was really intense and interesting, but this one it feels so pointeless and selfish.... really wish I wasnt so disappointed in this game... The story does pick up and the last 2 hours are really fun, but you have to go through 10 hours just to get interesting.....

The graphics are beuatiful and realistic! I only dropped below 60fps on loading screens. running hihest settings. I have a i7 47k gtx980ti 32gb ram and some other goodies on board but still this game is stunning. The story line is rather short for a 60$ game but it is packed full of action and parkour challenges. I have completed this game on tomb raided difficulty and I must say it wasnt easy and was perfectly balanced for my stlye of play. If you are unsure about buying this game for full price. Dont be cause its 10% off lol. But for real even if you want to wait for it to drop below 30$ YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME!\n\nWondering what games its like? Well its a tomb raider so you are going to be searching caverns and old dig sites. But it has parkour simialar to dying light(also a great game). Late game feels a little like assasins creed with all the special abilities going around performing stealth takedowns. Has the guns down pat. Its got csgo quallity of shooting, with added features of course. Honestly if they made this game multiplayer with its mechanics it would be 10000x the recently call of duties. However there are some non-gamebreaking bugs such as shaking cut scenes and teleporting through walls. A little slugish system for the parkour mechanics at times, as it tries its best to go where your mouse is,\n\nOverall I r8 8/8 Would r8 again m8. But for real 10000/10 game I cant wait for the dlc as they leave you on a good foot is all im going to say :)","January 31","true","14.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Honestly, the game itself Tomb Raider has been out for soo long with multiple sequels, but if anyone of you who love playing Tomb Raider like I do, would highly recommend it because of it's graphics performance as well as you get over 60FPS while playing it on ultra resolution (Depending on PC and Graphics Card). I really enjoy the story behind it, the challenges that you have to go through, there are multiple puzzles to solve and a lot more. I would also recommend buying a season pass for this game since you get extra modes and an expansion to the gameplay which is really interesting. But the only thing about the season pass is that you get outfits for Lara that you can already craft in the game. So, instead of purchasing the entire season pass, I'd recommend getting the expansion or the endurance mode.\n\nPurchasing this game was a satisfaction for me since I really love playing Tomb Raider, but you'll enjoy the most out of this game by, high resolution gameplay, challenges that Lara goes through and a really interesting story of the game as well.\n\nWould definitely give it a 10/10.

I admit I've never been a huge fan of tomb raider games. I'm not heavily into the story of them and I disliked the game before this one.\n\nFrom the second the game started, I was hooked. The opening sequence and movements felt right. The story has progressed smoothly and fluently. Not divulging too much or too little information. I'm intrigued with the history so far and it has given me that feeling that you never want the game to end. I want to stay up all night and explore every crevice and object.\n\nGraphics are beautiful and I don't get bothered by the camera changes. Sometimes things like that can turn a great scene into an annoyance. The combat has been fun and so has the gathering. I'm not yet tired of scoping out new animals to scavenge from. I like the levelling up system and crafting. All in all, I think this is well worth the buy and I will be recommending to my fellow adventurers.","January 29","true","9.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

First are the visuals, which at times, even on high settings, can be breath taking.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and the combat is fierce and quick.  Lara has many weapons at her disposal to dispach her foes; from a bow and arrow, to homemade grenades to an assortment of pistols, rifles and even a shotgun or two.  All of which are upgradable to deal extra damage, have a faster fire rate, or be more accurate.\n\nAction sequences are brutal and intense.  Enemies attempt to outflank the player while a team member provides covering fire, pinning the player down.  Lara is able to use stealth to overcome many enemies, but can also craft homemade grenades, molotovs and smoke bombs when the right items are nearby.\n\nThe sounds are well produced with each weapon having a different report that lends accuracy and immersion to the game. Voicework is well acted, albeit unrealistic with virtually an entirly American sounding cast for many Russian, Greek and other voiced characters.\n\nMostly, Im pleased with the new tombs.  They are very nicely done, giving the player simple, yet vast puzzles to solve through each tomb.  This was sadly underdone in the 2013 reboot and its a welcome addition to this sequel.\n\nThe game runs well for my modest AMD system, though some users are reporting studdering and frame drops.  Once a patch (or new drivers) are released the game should be near flawless.\n\nHigh recommendations, but not perfect due to some voicework and some techinical issues.\n8/10 Overall, fix the techinal issues and its a solid 9.\nJan 31, 2016","January 31","true","12.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

I mean,first of all,Lara is SEXYYYY as hell. The sound when Lara is hurt is so deep and f***ing HOT,this for me is the best "premium subscription".\n--------------\nStory:\nWhen i started this game i was like: Jonaaaah! Ana!!! Woah,those are the same characters from the Tomb Raider 2013 and i thought that the story will continue,but nope,the story is totally new from the 2013 title. And,speaking of story,that's how a game should be made. The story is well written,with happy and dramatic moments,but sometimes it felt more like a movie for me. I would love to see that I can choose what I want to do,not what the game wants me to do.(you can,but there are so few choices you can make that I can counter those on my right hand fingers).Overall,the story is great,well done Crystal Dynamics!\n--------------\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is awesome.I played this game entirely on Seasoned Raider difficulty,and it was a little hard,I'm not complaining but when you play the entire game with an x 360 controller and than you switch on the keyboard and mouse you will see a big difference,because those higher difficulties will disable the "aim assist" options. But,for me,this game was right to challange me sometimes with the combat. The combat is well built,you have 3 fire weapons,1 bow and 1 axe that can help you in any situations. This game will challange you.You will need to search the map for special chests in order to unlock new wepons,that you can customize to fit your combat style. You will find "tombs",that will make your abilities better,containers that contains materials that you can use for crafting,and a different type of chests that contains some "old" objects that you can inspect. That's cool! Also,in some parts you can be stealthy,in some parts you better not be stealthy,that's up to you. And the cool fact about the combat is that it will make you think. In combat areas there are often placed "strategickly" some objects that you can interact with to make your combat easyer.\nThe puzzels are satisfying,they will make you feel like James Bond,and after solving them you will be so proud of you. :)\n--------------\nGraphics:\nThis game looks amazing,that's for sure. Even on "medium mixed with high" settings on 1080p,this game is a masterpiece. The characters,the environment,the animals and the whole f***ing world looks amazing.\n--------------\nConclusion:\nThis game should be owned by almost every "Action-Adventure" and well written story fans. Well,what are you waiting for? Buy this game! Well,right now you don't have another choice if you want to play this game,because Denuvooooo! Muhaahaha. Well...even if this game could be cracked I think I have bought it. :)\n-----------------------\nBoring review is shutting down.\nBoring review is installing updates.

It improves upon the fantastic formula from the previous game and adds some fun stuff to do on the side. The only downside is that there is no multiplayer. I rather enjoyed that in the previous one. There is a lot of value in this product. Even at full price it's worth every penny.\n\nTLDR: Just add it to your cart and buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ezah11/recommended/391220/","ezah11","Ezah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ezah11/","114 products in account","As Among Thieves was to Drake's Fortune, so this game is to the rebooted Tomb Raider.\n\nThere are just so many small things that I love about this game that, when put together, create a fantastic game. Perhaps my personal favorite is the introduction of resources and the crafting of crucial components, from a larger backpack to poison arrows to bring down a bear to weapon upgrades. I really disliked that hunting in the first game was useful for a grand total of maybe 20 minutes and then tossed aside, but this time they outdid themselves. Hunting anything from deer to bears to birds and rabbits is useful, and hides are in high demand. It also doesn't feel like a chore, but is actually a fun mechanic in the game. Resources are abundant if you are vigilant enough (and not just heedlessly sprinting through the game), and hunting is easy if you are patient enough to use a vantage point to snipe an unaware buck.\n\nCombat is more or less the same as the first Tomb Raider. You really don't want to end up in melee combat, but you do have the dodge counter available through skills, which can be quite useful. The ability to craft molotovs is extremely useful, as you can snipe somebody from a safe distance by grabbing a random whiskey bottle, lighting it on fire, and tossing it at him. The heal mechanic is incredibly nice, especially on the upper difficulties where there is no in-combat regen, as it allows you to manually heal yourself instead of relying on the *I just got shot, let me sit here for 5 seconds and pretend like nothing happened* method. It's still prudent to stealthily take out enemies, as Lara can be fairly easily overwhelmed.\n\nI can't put my finger on specifically why, but I like the collectibles (including tombs) in this game quite a bit more than the predecessor. For one thing, there are a bazillion of them, but they also seem to make more sense. The challenges for sure are better, while the tomb puzzles are fairly simple to solve, but also quite rewarding as you get a new skill for completing each tomb that is extremely useful (e.g. survival instincts will show trap placements). There are also coins that can be exchanged at a merchant (damn Russian sellout just wants his vodka), but anything that is worth purchasing is extremely expensive, even if you manage to get all of the coin caches as each cache has 7 coins and the important stuff costs around 150.\n\nSo far the story has been a lot better in this game. We get to learn about Lara's relationship with her father and what drives her in her quest for the Divine Source. The supporting cast of characters actually feel somewhat fleshed out, but they never overshadow Lara. This is, first and foremost, a game about Lara Croft (which the first game seemed to emphasize to the point of excluding any character development for the other characters), but you can actually come to understand both the villains and your allies.\n\nI seem to keep talking about this point despite claiming to put no stock in it as far as making or breaking a game, but the graphics in this game are just fantastic. Just watch Lara, whether in a cinematic or during actual gameplay. Her face shows so much emotion, her outfit glistens with snow or water depending on the weather conditions, her hair is detailed down to individual strands of hair. This game really is a pleasure to just look at, even though it definitely feels like they removed a lot of the sex appeal shots for Lara (she actually wears several layers while trudging through the snow covered mountains of Siberia... Who would have ever guessed?)\n\nA small thing that I am not entirely happy about is that the game still has some feaux linearity in the form of campfire fast travel. It feels like the game would go wonderfully with an open world scheme a la Far Cry 3, but it's still a great deal better than the Uncharted series as far as linearity is concerned.\n\nA side note outside of the game itself: I preordered the game, and as soon as it released, the price dropped by 10% for more or less the same content, and this Endurance mode, which sounds like something that should be released with the game, is instead $10 DLC. I wanted to support the developer by preordering the game, as i know that their sales have not been great despite the original game being fantastic as well as reviews for the Xbone version being high, but I feel like i was punished for doing so. I would advise against pre ordering, and just purchasing it on day 1. Even the pre-loading benefit was not much as it took about an hour to unpack after launch.\n\nOverall, this game has far exceeded my expectations. Tomb Raider was already a very solid game, but the improvements in this game have put it over that edge from a fun, solid game to a must play experience for me. I give this game a 9.5/10, and look forward to Crystal Dynamics' next game.","January 31","true","19.4"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","15","29","2","0"

Lara is now in search of the Divine Source, the relic of immortality, as is the illuminati-like group Trinity. The game is very similar in mechanics and playstyle, being a linear driven story with open world exploration with an almost absurd amount of collectibles, however being Tomb Raider that is part of the fun, exploring.\n\nThe combat is extremely similar with a new mechanic being introduced, the on the fly crafting and resource gathering for offensive and healing purposes. The similarities are not only in the gameplay and combat, but also in the tombs and puzzles, the only difference being the puzzles seem to have gotten easier to a point where figuring this optional tombs puzzle is as simple as shooting a rope arrow and turning a crank, congrats! you figured out how to use the controls.\n\nThe downsides being the overly simplified puzzles and the DLC is not great, an hr long story DLC, and two challenge  modes that arn't particular spectacular.\n\nOverall the game is amazing, fun gameplay and exploration, amazing combat finishers and the return of the brutal Lara deaths. Extremely cinematic with amazing visuals and extremely fun running sequences where everything is falling apart as you leap from crumbling collums to a swinging peice of scaffolding to land onto a cable, only after sustaining wounds that would kill any normal human, as Lara does. 9/10.","April 24","true","33.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Ill be making a list of pros and cons and then finally give it a rating.\n\nPros:\n-Awesome parkour\n-Dense map\n-Finding weapon parts is fun usually\n-There are good graphics enhancers for those who dont like the washed out look (I used one and personally it made the game feel much more alive)\n-The crafting and looting system is relatively good\n-The plot is somewhat interesting but not enough to make me feel emotionally attached\n-It isn't trying to replicate another games mechanics (in terms of parkour)\n-animations look bloody awesome\n-weather affects characters attire (snow can get caught in her hair and fall on her clothes)\n-Mouse and keyboard are well mapped\n\nCons:\n-Game seems short lived even after taking time to listen to audio tapes and watch cutscenes etc\n-Map is small\n-Side missions didnt give me any motivation after finishing the main story\n-The story missions arent long enough for you to unlock everything while focusing on it.\n-many outfits so little time\n-Poor optimization (but bearable unlike ac unity)\n-Without reshading this game lacks effects and a nice color palet. its also somewhat more blurry\n-This doesnt apply to everyone but in the sequel I'd like the game to be more open and long with a more gripping plot and add more character development (crafting new tools, more unique weapons, side quests that dont apply to the main story or anyone related to the group/village.) But by far what I needed the most is a bigger map with areas of different climates (Id love to go back to Syria and explore more do more missions etc)4\n\nOverall I rate this game 8.5/10\nId buy this game when its on sale unless you really want to play it","February 22","true","18.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I liked Tomb Raider 2013 and praised both the smoothness of the character's movement through the game and how, while there was much to collect, it isn't overly burdensome for completionists. Yes, I do use guides for a few hard-to-find pieces (my rule of thumb is when it's not fun, break out the Gamefaqs or IGN guides...), but you can get most things yourself with a little extra effort, and it's not a complete pain in the butt.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider just smoothed out the rough edges from 2013. So, if you like 2013, you're going to find more to like in Rise. They also toned down the death animations (there's less torture-porn, as I call it), and really let Lara into her own.\n\nI'm also a sucker for the outfit changes (some functional variations, yes, but mostly aesthetics and immersion), and I was pleased to see that there was virtually no fan-service. Yes, her butt looks good in everything, but there's nothing overly showy or sexualized, which is always nice to see with female game characters. Everything else, however, was absolutely eye-candy. Roaming the map was simply beautiful, and the fluid animation of character movement was a joy.\n\nWhole-hearted recommendation from me.","February 28","true","30.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But this game just smashes it. The only reason I bought Rise of Tomb Raider was because I loved Tomb Raider so much.\n\nI managed to 100% complete it, in just under 24 hours total. A very good, decent amount of time. This was only 1 play through, as I will probably play it again but on the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe look and graphics of this game are gorgeous and stunning, one of the best. The detail is really good of all objects, characters, animals and terrain. Looks life-like. The sounds, music and lighting are what makes it an aswesome game too.\n\nThe story, again was really good. Somehow better than Tomb Raider (2013)'s, and I like how we have a returning character from the previous game too. There some really emotional moments too, which are shown greatly in all characters.\n\nThe best thing I love about this game is the world map size, there are several differet regions that are all unique in some way, and there are hundreds of collectibles to discover, which some rerqure set skills and patience (which I like).\n\nThis game has set an extrealy high standard for Tomb Raider games, so the next one has alot to compete with. Especially if they want to make it (somehow) evern better.\n\nGo buy this game, wether in a sale or not. And go buy Tomb Radier (2013) too!\n\n12/10 - Lara's more hot (also dat ♥♥♥)","April 2","true","44.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

They changes very little about the game play, so don't expect a lot of new ideas there. It workes out though because it's actually a very well thought through game play that makes playing Rise of the Tomb Raider a very immersive and fluid experience.\n\nA minus if definitely the story. It's "fine" but really not much more than that. I had hoped for a little more, to be honest, but it wasn't so bad as to take anything away from the fun gameplay experience.\n\nWhat was nice was the fact that the open world element was much more incoroprated this time around and felt much more natural than in Tomd Raider. The addiational challanges and missions also added quite a bit of additional fun and gave you a solid reason to venture out and explore the area instead of blindly going through the missions.\n\nFor me personally, "kill all the animals to get stuff" is starting to feel a little old and tedious though. I get that it's bascially the only way to add this component to a game in such a setting, it's a personal dislike of mine though. I appreciate the journal of the huntress, giving additional insight into the art of hunting and thereby adding some meaning.\n\nAbsolutely recommend the game for a a few days of great fun!","February 10","true","27.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

(75% completion for finishing the main story)\n\nFor a game that released in 2016. (xbox one on late 2015) Graphic looks decent and runing around 25-30 FPS on med high setting on my 5 years old desktop. Gameplay itself has several improvment over the the predecessor. I didnt find an major bug during the gameplay.\n\nChallenge mode is one of the biggest improvment and complete optional during the main story and it involved some basic puzzle solving  which takes a little bit of time to figure out. (otherwise the game feel like thrid person shooter) Side quest is a bit boring due to its game mode (either kill or get something) but it gives u some reward other than coins or resources.\n\nLandscapes stick with snowmountains, deep undergournd ruins and villages in Siberia for 90% of the game. Desert and oasis in Syria appear in the second chapter which only takes no more than 30 mins gameplay. Sad thing is the predecessor already has too much snow and i personal seek different environment. But the good part is the game has large amount of scret tomb location (include challenge mode) compare to the predecessor, and it actually gives u bonus such as weapon parts or skills instead of just exploring.\n\nI assume the game will take between 15 to 25 hours depend on ur play style. I played under survival difficulty and complete all challenge mode on the way through. Might take 30 hours or more to collect all the relic and other stuff.\n\nOverall the game is decent, and much like the first Tomb Raider reboot, with few enhancement. Especially the Challenge mode makes the game more like a "Tomb Raider" after all.","January 29","true","18.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","2","4","3","6"

There's a bunch of characters that are introduced and we get little to no character development. And the base plot is a literal copy of Uncharted 2. I finished this game in one sitting (10 hours, and that's including tomb hunting). The game gives you a lot to do in the beginning stages and then once you reach the downfall of the game it begins to get linear, which really isn't a bad thing. The game promotes you to grind to prepare for the endgame which is cool. Besides the lacking story, the gameplay is awesome and better than the reboot.

Quite similar to the 2013 release gameplay-wise. If you loved it then, you'll love it again.\n\nPros:\n+ a couple of original tombs to discover\n+ great start\n+ fun bow/arrow gameplay\n+ a few very cool puzzles\n+ some great locations\n+ exploring\n+ a bit Uncharted feeling\n+ a few boss fights, that require a tad bit of strategy\n+ DLC: Baba Yaga, Temple of the Witch is a cool and a bit different DLC. Has some exploring, puzzling, collecting and IMO the most interesting boss fight. Adds maybe an hour tops.\n\nCons:\n- dull, predictable story\n- some forced Call of Duty style passages\n- mediocre skills, quite some useless in it (dodge kill)\n- the landscape is not very diverse. Usually it's snowy and dark, sadly they didn't make much of the level in Syria\n- general gunfights are tedious and not much fun. Enemies are boring\n\nIf you're new to the restarted franchise, I'd recommend picking up the 2013 version and play that first. It introduces Lara Croft and the whole franchise and has a bit more diverse level set. And it's much cheaper.\n\nStory is really not much to speak of, especially if you played Indiana Jones, Uncharted and the likes.\n\nStill, it's a solid game.","February 7","true","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The same niggles are still there such as occasionally patchy collision detection when making an awkward jump, and the constant respawning of wolves after you kill them 30 times as you run past an arbitrary point but that is more of a mechanic in games in general I think.\n\nOverall, very pleased with it and am only 20% through the game (like taking my time to look around). Graphics are excellent as hoped for. Much was made of the hair tech and the difference between lara and the rather solid NPCs is evident. Perhaps in future versions the tech will be optimised to run on more than one character (at least it appears that way to me).\n\nGameplay is largely unchanged so far but have yet to come across many boss fight scenarios. The '3 times' rule where you effectively had to beat the boss 3 times using some stupid combination has hopefully been dropped but i will no doubt find that out at a later point in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jd641/recommended/391220/","jd641","Killing Floor 2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jd641/","112 products in account","Rise is one of those games that you know you will enjoy if you liked the first game in the rebooted Tomb Raider series. This time the graphics have been improved to the point that I can safely say that Rise is the nicest looking game that I have ever played, it's not only the environments, it's the facial animations and expressions that Lara emotes throughout the game. Faces and emotional expressions have always given emotionally driven video game characters issues but CD really nailed it this time, Lara looks like a person and it's amazing to see in motion.\n\nThe game play imho has been improved quite a bit since the first game: combat is smoother and using stealth to attack entire groups is now much more intuitive and rewarding. Gunplay is improved with better overal handling of weapons and the addition of several types of weapons per class brings a lot of needed variety.\n\nIf you're expecting the game to be more than 50% tombs you're unfortunately going to be disappointed. There's a lot more raiding of ancient tombs/caves in this second game but a lot of them aren't nesassary to explore at all to finish the main story line and if you're a fan of some of the older TR games you may find the ones with puzzles to be a bit easy. With that said, there's a lot of exploring to do both in and out of the main plot and plenty of ancient artifacts to collect on your way throug the game.\n\nIf you get a bit tired of the main plot there's several options to pass the time outside of your saves, you have four replay modes which allow you to go back to completed chapters and get high scores to earn credits for cards and compete with your friends for the best scores. My favorite mode is Endurance mode which isn't included in the base game but it's available in the season pass and as a separate dlc for $9.99. Endurance is really self explanatory, you get dropped off at a location where you will need to hunt for food, keep your body warm, ward off enemies and explore ganerated tombs that are full of traps. If you die that's it, it's game over and you'll have to start again... this mode is extremely addicting and you can go a single session as long or as little as you'd like. If you don't want the season pass and the Baba Yaga dlc doesn't sound interesting to you, I highly recommend this mode.\n\nAs a side note, the extra outfits that are being sold as DLC can be crafted in the game if you don't have the season pass, you won't get the additional card packs for the replay and Endurance modes but if you don't care about those then save yourself some money and just craft them.\n\nThis game is hardware resource heavy and to enjoy maximum details you're going to need a modern and very beefy system.  My current hardware is a 3.5 ghz Xeon 1246 V3 with 32GB ram and a GTX 970 with settings maxed out I average 20 fps in some places, the lowest I get in other games at max settings  is 80 - 90 so it was a bit of a shock to see my system slow to a crawl like that. For Win10 users, DX12 support has recently been added in and for nvidia customers an exclusive Ambient Occlusion mode has been added in as another AO option that so far looks to be the most accurate I've ever used in a game.\n\nI definitely recommend Rise to anyone who's a fan of the new reboot franchise, I've already put in 70+ hours into this game and I'm not even close to not being amazed.","March 21","true","110.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","2"

I've been a Tomb Raider fan for a long time, puzzle solving games are especially my favorite. I was, in all honesty, super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I had to wait for this game to come out on PC, but in the end is was worth the wait. Here is my pros/cons list of the 2015 Rise of the Tomb Raider:\n\nPros:\n1) The story is smooth. Really great character development\n2) Replay value is high. You can just flow through the story and then do all that extra things (finding all the relics/etc) after\n3) Amazing Graphics\n\nCons\n1) I've had some glitches during combat (the enemy will just dissapear)\n2) The puzzles are easier than the previous game (There's even a skill that lets you see what the challenges for that zone are)\n3) The whole content of the game feels less than the previous title\n\nOther than that, the game is really great.

The gameplay is relatively the same, which is not a bad thing since it already was really great, and in ROTTR they've added new movements and abilities to this already great gameplay. Graphics wise.... it's jaw-dropping, this game looks so good ( maxed out atleist ), it's the best graphics i've ever seen in a video game and it runs great ( apart from the texture quality settings, if you have anything less than 4 Gb of VRam, don't bother going ''very high'' you'll stutter ) and there's a lot of options here as well. Story now, it's great. I mean, it's Lara's first Tomb, following her dad's footsteps and showing her determination... it's just really well made. My only complain is the game's length, being really short. i was expecting it to be atleist a little longer than Tomb Raider 2013, but both games took me exactly 10 hours each to beat on ''Tomb Raider'' difficulty ( normal i guess ), which is a little sad to be honest... But hey, it's not the end of the world, replayability is there, though i don't think it's really something that i'll do. Great game, definitly buy it if you've played the 2013, or even if it's your first TR game.","March 6","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

Quite similar to the 2013 release gameplay-wise. If you loved it then, you'll love it again.\n\nPros:\n+ a couple of original tombs to discover\n+ great start\n+ fun bow/arrow gameplay\n+ a few very cool puzzles\n+ some great locations\n+ exploring\n+ a bit Uncharted feeling\n+ a few boss fights, that require a tad bit of strategy\n+ DLC: Baba Yaga, Temple of the Witch is a cool and a bit different DLC. Has some exploring, puzzling, collecting and IMO the most interesting boss fight. Adds maybe an hour tops.\n\nCons:\n- dull, predictable story\n- some forced Call of Duty style passages\n- mediocre skills, quite some useless in it (dodge kill)\n- the landscape is not very diverse. Usually it's snowy and dark, sadly they didn't make much of the level in Syria\n- general gunfights are tedious and not much fun. Enemies are boring\n\nIf you're new to the restarted franchise, I'd recommend picking up the 2013 version and play that first. It introduces Lara Croft and the whole franchise and has a bit more diverse level set. And it's much cheaper.\n\nStory is really not much to speak of, especially if you played Indiana Jones, Uncharted and the likes.\n\nStill, it's a solid game.","February 7","true","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Or the inability to use any of the enemies weapons, even though their ammo is perfectly useful for the weapons you do get, again when you have shown you are worthy. If you're looking for game mechanics that make sense, this is not the game for you.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game looks great, and aside from one too many game/progress breaking bugs that somehow made it through QA, RotTR is actually a pretty good game. Even if the final boss fight is a horrible QTE trope, and whomever made it up should have been fired for dragging us back into the stupidity of "You must do this 3 times, even though any amount of common sense would tell you that once should have been plenty"\n\nBut I digress, I really did like this game, ignoring some UI issues that seem to have been kept from the 2013 game, and new issues added with KB&M, wrong key prompts and so on.\n\nBut really though, it's a good game... a good game... yeah... a good...\n\nOh, also, it's been Square'ified, so it's a singleplayer game with online leaderboards and "replayablity" in the form of "compete with your friends for a better score!" - so that's great.

I was dead wrong, and Square Enix surprised me yet again.\n\nI'm going to try to divide this review into several parts, to explain each aspect carefully.\n\n-----------------Combat--------------------\n\nThe combat is just as great as it always was, if not better and smoother. The pick, bow, and firearms feel like they have some real impact behind them, and each hit feels brutal. Lara controls like a dream, and the fact you can go for stealth for almost every encounter if you so choose, or go in guns blazing (if you have a death wish) is great and I really appreciate that fact.you can use the environment to your advantage and attack enemies with exploding gas, lanterns, bottles, and probably much more (Have not finished game yet). Said bottles can also be used as a distraction to lure enemies away from groups.\n\n\n--------------Map--------------------\n\n\nThe areas to explore are enormous, if not triple the size of 2013, and every location is beautiful to behold. there are tons of places to explore that are off the beaten path, tons of materials and relics to collect, numerous wildlife to farm for furs, caves and ziplines galore, and plenty of writings to translate. Exploring is very rewarding, as you will always find a little something in every corner. Don't be afraid to comb every area over! It is worth it!\n\n\n-----------------Tombs------------------\n\n\nTombs are huge and well-hidden. No longer are they just one big "room" like they were in 2013, but they are huge areas with connecting areas you need to use together to solve the connected puzzle. There's also plenty of salvage and relics here, and the reward for completing  a tomb is more than just some little item, you receive skills and ancient weapon parts. Very much worth doing.\n\n\n-----------Visuals-----------------------\n\nThis game is absolutely beautiful. One of the best looking games I have seen in a while. Not a surprise, Square is pretty well known to make some good-looking games.\n\n---------Enemy AI--------------\n\nThese enemies are smart. They will flank yyou, flush you out with grenades, bumrush you if they vastly outnumber you, they can be a pain, and I love that.  Except wolves. ♥♥♥♥ wolves, I hate them, little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, good luck meleeing them, you have to shoot them while they run all over the place. In packs.\n\n-----------Side quests----------\n\nYes, this game even has side quests! You can do side quests you receive from friendly NPCs/Items that net you cool rewards like weapon upgrades and tools like the lockpick. 100% worth completing these.\n\nAll in all I would say that this is the best game I have played this year so far. Even though it's only been about a month in 2016 at the time of this review, but whatever.\n\n\nIt is worth every penny. I am looking forward to the third installment, maybe they would do something like what was done with MGSV, open world? That would be interesting for sure.\n\nThanks for reading.","January 29","true","18.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The boss battles executed differently but it felt like the same action ending and it bugs me.\n\nWas it worth the $40 I paid for it?  16.3 hours to complete the main story with minor deviations to break up a speed run and kinda explore so yeah? I guess? I have a bit of animosity because of the ending but I think I can get over it. The graphics were amazing, the glacier as a back drop to some cold tundra and muddy living areas was pretty stellar. The audio drew me into the game like none other. When ♥♥♥♥ started breaking under you as you're running across certain things the sound was impressive, scary. The gameplay was what I expected, action adventure game with a bit of RPG elements (perks/weapon upgrades). The story was kinda meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It was kinda campy on the eternal life bit just seems like thats all that comes out of archaeologist fantasy.\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nAudio - 10/10\nGameplay - 7/10\nStory - 5/10","February 6","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Well, it’s a drama riddled glitché-fest episoode of CSI Miami  featuring Oprah Croft – a little girl with daddy issues.\n\nSquare Enix has done something right though. You can now disable any aiding feature of the game which turns it into quite a challenge which I enjoyed very much.\n\nVisually the game is a stunning journey through variations of scenery and side-quests and raidable tombs never felt repetitive.

Well, this is more of the same - or rather more of the good things of the reboot. Less QTE's, more tombs and caves and exploration. Still some silly problems with bining keys to mouse on PC. It shows to press the [] button for various actions, but if you have two thumbbuttons used - you won't know which ones until you tried - and most likely died a few times.\n\nThe story is slightly tighter this time around, more focused - and that is both good and bad. If you're a completionist than it will feel like you leave people to die to be able to go off the beaten path to explore and find treasure. You also have to leave certain tombs and treasures behind since you will lack certain gear and features that you lock up later on in the story line.\n\nThe expeditions are fun DLC and really should come in more flavours since this is what most will be doing after they beat the game - or well only be doing since this is the real challenge.\n\nThe game has some technical flaws and hickups. There is a hguge FPS drop in expeditions that occurs with a few minutes regualr intervention that makes it feel like something is going on that shouldn't be happening. The single player part runs with most things on on my spec flawlessly. I don't use occular and lens flaires and depth of field - but other than that - I have most things on except the hair. And I have a steady 80-110 FPS regardless of fights in firelit places.\nGameplay issues range from minor nitpicks as to how the camera works and you have little control meaning that forward moves your character sideways end vice versa in some parts of the game. Sometimes you can't see where you are going, meaning that you have to die to your death hoping you are on the right track and then redo some climbing/jumping routines - I had rather seen more difficult pathfinding as an obstacle than the camera itself as your biggest problem.\n\nHopefully coming patches will make the expeditions better optimized since that is really something nice - oh and that's were most of your pre-order and DLC extras will come into play.\n\nThe card system is to beef out and tweak your expeditions adventures.\n\nEDIT notes: after finishing the game and Baba Yaga DLC.\nSo, the game is ended and for that I have to give cred. I don't finish all my games but this one I did. The game gets slightly tedious at the end, trying to sweep the areas looking for missing documents, loot and item chests. But all in all - a nice game. Baba Yaga wasn't a hit though - if you think you're missing out due to this one - rest easy - it is not worth the time. I got a bit disapointed here with the season pass so far. Hopefully something that adds to replayability will come out because I have no intention of playing this again on other difficulties etc. In the end, you do get more of the tedious fights from the first game. This time around it is easier to either sneak past - or have some cat and mouse game out of the fights - but still, a few too many to my liking.","February 1","true","32.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Ill be making a list of pros and cons and then finally give it a rating.\n\nPros:\n-Awesome parkour\n-Dense map\n-Finding weapon parts is fun usually\n-There are good graphics enhancers for those who dont like the washed out look (I used one and personally it made the game feel much more alive)\n-The crafting and looting system is relatively good\n-The plot is somewhat interesting but not enough to make me feel emotionally attached\n-It isn't trying to replicate another games mechanics (in terms of parkour)\n-animations look bloody awesome\n-weather affects characters attire (snow can get caught in her hair and fall on her clothes)\n-Mouse and keyboard are well mapped\n\nCons:\n-Game seems short lived even after taking time to listen to audio tapes and watch cutscenes etc\n-Map is small\n-Side missions didnt give me any motivation after finishing the main story\n-The story missions arent long enough for you to unlock everything while focusing on it.\n-many outfits so little time\n-Poor optimization (but bearable unlike ac unity)\n-Without reshading this game lacks effects and a nice color palet. its also somewhat more blurry\n-This doesnt apply to everyone but in the sequel I'd like the game to be more open and long with a more gripping plot and add more character development (crafting new tools, more unique weapons, side quests that dont apply to the main story or anyone related to the group/village.) But by far what I needed the most is a bigger map with areas of different climates (Id love to go back to Syria and explore more do more missions etc)4\n\nOverall I rate this game 8.5/10\nId buy this game when its on sale unless you really want to play it","February 22","true","18.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

And it's weird because I'll be climbing along a cliff side, and the rock I'm clinging to will crumble away and fall along with me, and In the midst of my fall I will wonder not whether or not I'm going to survive the fall, but how in the world am I going to get back because there only seems to be one path available to any given place in this game. And the reason I tolerate this, I think, is because the sacrifice of logic is made to be worth it with exhilerating moments of engagement in the story. I feel what Lara is feeling when something goes wrong with my only plan, and I'm left with no apparent options, I feel trapped even though I'm not, but Lara is, and suddenly I find a solution, and it feels like a miracle. Experiencing the miracles are what redeems the logical falacies, and trapping nature of linear games. Just based on this I would recommend this game, but there are some things that may make some of you hesitate in buying it, and I'd like to warn you of those.\nThe most noteworthy is the grinding required to aquire certain things. This warning is only for those of you who happen to not want to perform genocide on wildlife that is nearly equatable in magnitude to the holocaust in order to attain the best bow, rifle, pistol, or shotgun upgrades for any or all of the variants of these weapons. I say this because the crafting requirements for weapon upgrades often requires many resources from animals. To be fair you can go through the game without destroying local ecosystems because the weapon upgrades are not entirely necessary, but if you are a perfectionest with a conscience you may be putting yourself into a terrible predicament by playing this game.\nThe other reason you may not want to buy this game is because you won't get much time out of it. Like I said it's a linear game so there's not much replayability to be had, and all the game has to offer to keep you engaged after you have finished the story is a thing called expeditions, which basically allows you to repeat specific parts of the story with arcade-like challenges. I find these boring, and I don't think they are good enough to maintain my interest in the game. I finished the story in about 19 hours, but you may finish the game in less if you don't get caught up in slaughtering the wildlife, so if you think <19 hours of a great story is worth 60 dollars minus 1 cent then I recommend you get this game, if not wait for a sale, or just don't buy it.","March 16","true","25.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

And I can safely say that the people at Crystal Dynamics have succeeded in this endeavor. Rise of the Tomb Raider is just as good as its predecesor, if not better.\nIn this new adventure we follow Lara as she tries to clean her father's name. The story is filled with fantasy and adventure, and is supported by the usual document collectibles that you find throughout the game. Learning how people felt and how they survived is a thrilling journey that will make you want to find all of them so you can learn the whole story.\nFrom the gameplay point of view, there are no complaints what so ever. It is as good as the previous game and there are some new mechanics that make it compelling to go back to previous areas just to kill some enemies in various creative ways. And also there's the threat of nature, as wild animals will fight you as you trespass into their natural habitat. Everything feels smooth and not forced upon you, and this is rare to find in a AAA game these days.\nNow, from the graphical point of view, let me say that if you assume you can run this game with a rig that could manage the previous one, then you are mistaken. The environments look gorgeous and every detail is breath taking. But if your PC is not prepared for a highly demanding game, then you won't be able to enjoy said environments because you will barely be able to run the game. Specially if your graphics card is AMD. The folks at NVIDIA made sure that any AMD user that plays this game does not get to enjoy it at its full capacity. The optimization is terrible, and even the newest AMD cards can't handle some of these options without dropping frames like hot potatoes. Be aware before you buy this game: you need a powerful processor, lots of RAM and an NVIDIA graphics card to play it without DPS issues. You can still play it with an AMD card just fine if you don't care about the sudden frame drops in big places and the occasional crash. That's about the only negative thing I have to say about this game. And it seems to be happening with every game powered by NVIDIA these days. It's annoying as hell.\nTL;DR: This game is amazing in every aspect except its graphical optimization. If you can run it, buy it. You won't regret it.","March 6","true","31.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

When I finished, I had completed roughly 70% of the content.  I missed a few of the tombs, but saw enough to know what they were like, and some of the weapon components.\n\nAll in all, this was a solid game, but not something I would recommend buying at full price for two reasons: 1) There isn't all that much gameplay to be had and 2) Though it's well done, there's nothing life-changing here.  The most I'd pay, if I could do it again, is 40 dollars.\n\nThis is a nonexhaustive review, I listed the things that I've most commonly seen commented on and anything that jumped out at me.\n\nTLDR: Good graphics, but mundane setting.  Decent story, but a bit short.  Average overall mechanics (crafting, combat).  Enjoyed my time played, but less than the former title.  Though i recommend it, I would not pay more than 40 dollars.\n\nPros:\n\n- Graphics.  The graphics are extremely well done.  There is a lot of polish, nothing too clunky (the occasional visual glitch)\n\n- Tombs.  Tombs were pretty solid; simple enough that they wouldn't totally frustrate you, but not so mindlessly easy that they had no value.\n\n- Story.  This would probably be more appropriately listed in the "neutral" category.  I didn't find the story particularly thrilling.  It was extremely straightforward, there were not any exciting twists.  However, it was good enough to keep me playing and did not detract from my experience at all.  Given that I wanted to see how it ended, even though the end was predictable, I suppose I have to consider it a "pro".  Though, I'll finish a terrible book just to validate my own opinion, so this might not be a legitimate criterion to use.\n\nNeutral:\n\n- I found the gathering/crafting to be fairly mundane.  There are a lot of different supplies to collect throughout your journey, but all recipes are standard: X, Y, Z, press button, new item.  It did not detract from my experience, but - other than the weapons - it did not add much either.  Given that the crafting felt like an afterthought, the game could have benefitted from fewer crafting components (I cannot believe I'm typing this).  I spent a fair amount of time collecting things and killing random animals, but still could not craft a lot of items because I was frequently missing a component.  Again, this did not hurt the experience, but it did not improve it either; it's possible I would have felt a greater sense of achievement if I were able to craft some of the items more easily.  Either way, it probably does not really matter.\n\n- Combat was average to me.  I have read a lot of reviews that think it was better than the last Tomb Raider, but I don't understand why.  The combat itself played the same, with a few minor changes.  There was significantly less of it, which seems to be why people prefer combat in this game more than in the last.  The reason I disliked it is because it was so damn scripted.  Maybe a tomb raider game shouldn't have a lot of combat, but the reduction resulted in a gameplay style of: explore for awhile, cut scene, scripted encounter; explore for awhile, cut scene, scripted encounter.  For me, it felt entirely too forced.\n\nCons:\n\n- The setting.  Graphically, I found the game mesmerizing.  Unfortunately, the setting rarely gives the graphical depth a chance to shine.  Most of your time is spent in a colorless, snowy scenery.  Don't get me wrong, I love the snow, but there are only so many shades of white before it all just looks the same.  When I finally made it to a setting with color, I was blown away.  Sadly, very little of your time is spent in areas where the graphics truly get to show off.\n\n- Linear.  This might not be the best way to describe this, because there is definitely room for exploration.  However, much of this game just felt too linearly scripted for me.  You frequently bump into "gates" (ie haven't unlocked an item that you gain access to later) that break up immersion.  Initially, it did not bother me much.  I figured, "well, that's realistic, I guess".  Unfortunately, it happened so frequently while I randomly explored that eventually it dissuaded me from continuing to explore.  Not necessarily the game's fault as some of that is of my own volition.  The game doesn't do itself any favors in this category, though.","March 14","true","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","3"

The gameplay is relatively the same, which is not a bad thing since it already was really great, and in ROTTR they've added new movements and abilities to this already great gameplay. Graphics wise.... it's jaw-dropping, this game looks so good ( maxed out atleist ), it's the best graphics i've ever seen in a video game and it runs great ( apart from the texture quality settings, if you have anything less than 4 Gb of VRam, don't bother going ''very high'' you'll stutter ) and there's a lot of options here as well. Story now, it's great. I mean, it's Lara's first Tomb, following her dad's footsteps and showing her determination... it's just really well made. My only complain is the game's length, being really short. i was expecting it to be atleist a little longer than Tomb Raider 2013, but both games took me exactly 10 hours each to beat on ''Tomb Raider'' difficulty ( normal i guess ), which is a little sad to be honest... But hey, it's not the end of the world, replayability is there, though i don't think it's really something that i'll do. Great game, definitly buy it if you've played the 2013, or even if it's your first TR game.","March 6","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

This game takes the formula set by the previous game and adds a few flourishes but ultimately plays out the same.\nGraphically one of the best looking games ive seen its a visual treat to see Lara running and exploring her way across forgotten corners of Syria, and later Russia.\nThe level design is great with huge open areas with multiple routes to reach a goal, and often side quests can be obtained to further reward additional backtracking/exploration.\nStory wise, its a solid entry - Lara is searching for an artifact that is rumoured to grant immortality with a shadowy cult also trying to get the artifact for more nefarious reasons .\nThe gameplay is solid, and the levelling up process straight forward. Crafting gets more of a heads up this time round and parts need to be collected and created in order to make new weapons and ammo to further assist Lara on her journey.\nIf you enjoyed the last Lara Croft outing this will also appeal but ne thing the game developers need to get their heads around is the fact that Lara Croft is known for raiding Tombs and very little of that happens in this game and indeed the last game. You could swap Lara out for Nathan Drake and call this Uncharted and noone would question it as they are both now very similar games.

I got this game for free with my graphics card, and hoping that they would have improved on TR2013 I decided to play it to see if they made any improvements to the reboot (instead of giving the code to someone that acutally wanted to play the game), but there was nothing new to be found. It felt like it could very well have been an expansion pack to the original TR2013. The shooting is still bad. The guns still sound like BB guns, and the controls are as bad and unresponsive as they were in TR2013. I can not comment too much on the story since I only played three hours of it, but what I got was boring and not very original. The one improvement I found was that they had cut down on the QTE's, but they still used them to much for my taste.\n\nGraphics wise the game is great. Nothing more to say really. The game went for a photo-realistic look instead of having an unique artsyle, which means the game will look old in an year or two. I always prefer when a game chooses to have a nice artstyle instead of going for photo-realistic graphics, since games that have a nice artstyle age way better. Just look at Wind waker. That game still looks great to this day.\n\nAnd tombs. Tombs where boring. I got trough two of them before I decided to uninstall the game, and they were both way too easy. The game holds your hand way too much. If you are presented with even the simplest of puzzles, the game will have Lara comment on what she needs to do to solve it, which completely ruins the whole point of having a puzzle. This segment will represent the process of getting trough a tomb in this game:\n\n''Hmm, I wonder what I need to do to get past this part?'' I wondered as I was presented with a puzzle.\n\n''Why not do that and then that to solve it?'' Lara then said and the puzzle had solved itself for me.\n\nI hate when games treat their players as if they are two years old, and this game does it exceptionally well.\n\nThis is very subjective, but I don't Laras' voice actor. I don't know what it is, but I find it unbearable to listen to her for more than 5 seconds at a time.\n\nIf you liked the original TR2013, you will like this. But if you did not, you should pass on this glorified expansion.","February 11","false","3.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It feels like half the game time, if you were to do everything, is just boring side stuff. The Tombs are still only optional and not part of the story, geez. It's called Tomb Raider. The graphics looks good, but the game is horribly optimized. The cutscenes are stepping way too deep into the uncanny valley and the dialogs are horrible. The voice acting and directing for Lara is so cringy and just out right bad. Her characters is anything but likeable aswell. The gun/bow play is improved and you now have a crafting system, TLOU-style but much faster. It speeds up the killing and it all feels a bit to easy. As before everything is made of graham crackers and kids glue and gets destroyed just from having Lara lookt at it.\n\nI only recommend this game if you have a beast of a computer (980Ti or better) or can settle with capping at 30fps. Still, look up vids about how well your system would do. Because damn, this game is dropping framerate all over the place in big areas. About the price. I feel like spending 45 bucks, which I did, was way too much for this experience. I'd say wait til winter 2016 and buy it sub 20 bucks.\n\nCheers!","February 7","false","12.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has been removed and I thank the devs for that decision. Graphics are awesome, and the sounds & music is astonishing.

(75% completion for finishing the main story)\n\nFor a game that released in 2016. (xbox one on late 2015) Graphic looks decent and runing around 25-30 FPS on med high setting on my 5 years old desktop. Gameplay itself has several improvment over the the predecessor. I didnt find an major bug during the gameplay.\n\nChallenge mode is one of the biggest improvment and complete optional during the main story and it involved some basic puzzle solving  which takes a little bit of time to figure out. (otherwise the game feel like thrid person shooter) Side quest is a bit boring due to its game mode (either kill or get something) but it gives u some reward other than coins or resources.\n\nLandscapes stick with snowmountains, deep undergournd ruins and villages in Siberia for 90% of the game. Desert and oasis in Syria appear in the second chapter which only takes no more than 30 mins gameplay. Sad thing is the predecessor already has too much snow and i personal seek different environment. But the good part is the game has large amount of scret tomb location (include challenge mode) compare to the predecessor, and it actually gives u bonus such as weapon parts or skills instead of just exploring.\n\nI assume the game will take between 15 to 25 hours depend on ur play style. I played under survival difficulty and complete all challenge mode on the way through. Might take 30 hours or more to collect all the relic and other stuff.\n\nOverall the game is decent, and much like the first Tomb Raider reboot, with few enhancement. Especially the Challenge mode makes the game more like a "Tomb Raider" after all.","January 29","true","18.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","2","4","3","6"

It successfully builds off Crystal Dynamics' excellent reboot, but it doesn't introduce any massive changes; the scope is greater but still in spitting distance of the previous game. But successfully regaining the feeling created in an extremely good game is no small feat. This is the inauguration of Tomb Raider as a formula once more, but for now, it's a formula I'm happy revisiting.\n\n9.5/10","February 5","true","32.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The story of Tomb Raider 2013 was already REALLY bad and had nothing but forgettable characters. Rise of the Tomb Raider also has nothing but forgettable characters, the story is also really bad, but what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most is how extremely serious this game is. There is NO humour AT ALL, even though the topics and the story of this game are extremely silly things.\nBecause of this the Uncharted series will always be better.\nAfter the boring prologue I had a lot of fun with RotTR and I thought this might be a strong contender for GOTY, but the more I continued the more I got dissapointed and the terrible story just left me with a dissapointed feeling at the end. Still, the game has a lot of good things about it, which could easily make it a 9/10 just by have LESS story, because it is SO bad.\nWhat I liked the most about this game is how much bigger the areas are, how much more encouraged you are to explore and how much more puzzles you can do. This also makes this game feel much more like the first generation of Tomb Raider games. Combat is also improved, but not by much. Unlike TR2013 though, you don't get thrown into a combat situation and then get attacked by waves of enemies. Here in most situations the enemies won't know that you are there, so you can always plan your attack first and go stealthy. Problem is that the game is so ♥♥♥♥ing easy even on the highest difficulty, actually it's simply broken. You get waay to much ammo and resources for everything which allows you to craft as much poison/fire/explosive arrows as you want, which are by far the most overpowered weapons in the game. With 1 poison arrow you can take down a group of the most armored enemies in the game. Not only that, but you will have millions of healing material, so you can always heal yourself in combat. Especially because of the level design there is always cover which you can use and quickly heal yourself. It gets even more ridiculous when you upgrade your healing ability, which they added because apparently it wasn't easy enough already. With the healing upgrade you can heal yourself almost instantly. I actually didn't die a single time in combat in this game on the highest difficulty. The combat was still fun, and the good thing is there wasn't THAT much combat as in TR2013.\nWhat dissapointed me about the second half of the game is that there weren't these big hub areas anymore, where you can freely explore, do side missions and stuff like that. The second half was completely rushed and you were always attacked by enemies. I completed the game in 12 hours and I did almost all side missions and all tombs except one. 12 hours is really short.\nVisually the game was really impressive, it had some really nice places, good variety and panoramas. But I had some frame drops in some places on my GTX 970 which was annoying (without AA, textures no high).\n\nI think if the story and ending wasn't so bad, I wouldn't be left with such a dissapointed feeling and like the game much more. I don't recommend buying at full price, because the game is too short.","February 5","true","15.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was dead wrong, and Square Enix surprised me yet again.\n\nI'm going to try to divide this review into several parts, to explain each aspect carefully.\n\n-----------------Combat--------------------\n\nThe combat is just as great as it always was, if not better and smoother. The pick, bow, and firearms feel like they have some real impact behind them, and each hit feels brutal. Lara controls like a dream, and the fact you can go for stealth for almost every encounter if you so choose, or go in guns blazing (if you have a death wish) is great and I really appreciate that fact.you can use the environment to your advantage and attack enemies with exploding gas, lanterns, bottles, and probably much more (Have not finished game yet). Said bottles can also be used as a distraction to lure enemies away from groups.\n\n\n--------------Map--------------------\n\n\nThe areas to explore are enormous, if not triple the size of 2013, and every location is beautiful to behold. there are tons of places to explore that are off the beaten path, tons of materials and relics to collect, numerous wildlife to farm for furs, caves and ziplines galore, and plenty of writings to translate. Exploring is very rewarding, as you will always find a little something in every corner. Don't be afraid to comb every area over! It is worth it!\n\n\n-----------------Tombs------------------\n\n\nTombs are huge and well-hidden. No longer are they just one big "room" like they were in 2013, but they are huge areas with connecting areas you need to use together to solve the connected puzzle. There's also plenty of salvage and relics here, and the reward for completing  a tomb is more than just some little item, you receive skills and ancient weapon parts. Very much worth doing.\n\n\n-----------Visuals-----------------------\n\nThis game is absolutely beautiful. One of the best looking games I have seen in a while. Not a surprise, Square is pretty well known to make some good-looking games.\n\n---------Enemy AI--------------\n\nThese enemies are smart. They will flank yyou, flush you out with grenades, bumrush you if they vastly outnumber you, they can be a pain, and I love that.  Except wolves. ♥♥♥♥ wolves, I hate them, little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, good luck meleeing them, you have to shoot them while they run all over the place. In packs.\n\n-----------Side quests----------\n\nYes, this game even has side quests! You can do side quests you receive from friendly NPCs/Items that net you cool rewards like weapon upgrades and tools like the lockpick. 100% worth completing these.\n\nAll in all I would say that this is the best game I have played this year so far. Even though it's only been about a month in 2016 at the time of this review, but whatever.\n\n\nIt is worth every penny. I am looking forward to the third installment, maybe they would do something like what was done with MGSV, open world? That would be interesting for sure.\n\nThanks for reading.","January 29","true","18.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

And it's weird because I'll be climbing along a cliff side, and the rock I'm clinging to will crumble away and fall along with me, and In the midst of my fall I will wonder not whether or not I'm going to survive the fall, but how in the world am I going to get back because there only seems to be one path available to any given place in this game. And the reason I tolerate this, I think, is because the sacrifice of logic is made to be worth it with exhilerating moments of engagement in the story. I feel what Lara is feeling when something goes wrong with my only plan, and I'm left with no apparent options, I feel trapped even though I'm not, but Lara is, and suddenly I find a solution, and it feels like a miracle. Experiencing the miracles are what redeems the logical falacies, and trapping nature of linear games. Just based on this I would recommend this game, but there are some things that may make some of you hesitate in buying it, and I'd like to warn you of those.\nThe most noteworthy is the grinding required to aquire certain things. This warning is only for those of you who happen to not want to perform genocide on wildlife that is nearly equatable in magnitude to the holocaust in order to attain the best bow, rifle, pistol, or shotgun upgrades for any or all of the variants of these weapons. I say this because the crafting requirements for weapon upgrades often requires many resources from animals. To be fair you can go through the game without destroying local ecosystems because the weapon upgrades are not entirely necessary, but if you are a perfectionest with a conscience you may be putting yourself into a terrible predicament by playing this game.\nThe other reason you may not want to buy this game is because you won't get much time out of it. Like I said it's a linear game so there's not much replayability to be had, and all the game has to offer to keep you engaged after you have finished the story is a thing called expeditions, which basically allows you to repeat specific parts of the story with arcade-like challenges. I find these boring, and I don't think they are good enough to maintain my interest in the game. I finished the story in about 19 hours, but you may finish the game in less if you don't get caught up in slaughtering the wildlife, so if you think <19 hours of a great story is worth 60 dollars minus 1 cent then I recommend you get this game, if not wait for a sale, or just don't buy it.","March 16","true","25.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

On the higher difficulties it's actually a challenge now, the firefights are very strategic and satisfying and plenty of tombs to uncover. Be warned though it's like Crysis, you need an incredibly powerful rig to run it once you get to the lost city stages. My frame rate on an r290 fluctuates wildly from 60fps down to the teens on the high setting and tessellation set to 8x in crimson control panel, playing only 1080p. This is with the latest beta driver. I thoroughly disagree with the reviewers who say there's not much difference between the quality settings, there is a gulf. If you have the rig to run this congrats, I thought meeting the recommended specs was enough but it's sadly not at least on AMD. A g-sync or free-sync monitor is recommended to address the frame rate fluctuations. I am hoping they can add further optimisations to the frame rate because it really struggles in parts. Can consume up to 7gb of video ram on highest texture settings, even on high it's saturated my r290 4GB buffer. But boy it can look beautiful.\n\nUpdate: I have updated this section now that I have tested the latest AMD Driver 15.3.1 and the new Patch which both support DirectX 12. This game is incredibly single core heavy in DirectX 11 mode, even an overclocked FX processor (my 8320 is running @ 4.7Ghz) is not fast enough to smoothly run this game. However with the DirectX12 support now added, the game spreads the load evenly across all the cores eliminating the large frame rate fluctuations. Coupled with AMD's optimisations and the game can easily hold 50fps just about all the time and closes in on the golden 60fps on the default High game setting at 1080p. There are still a few demanding areas but these drop to the 40s instead of the teens now so they aren't are noticable unless you are looking for them.\n\nThe future of AMD and DirectX 12 looks quite rosy ;)","February 3","true","48.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Square Enix does it again with astonishing graphics. Lara is smoking hot and beautifully modelled. If you loved the last game "Tomb Raider" and the way the reboot went then you will love this game too.\n\nShame it's gamesworks this time around which, as usual, screws people's performance on the highest settings. This game needs optimisation still for when it is loading from the drive but most people's performance will be tanking because of Nvidia's usual BS.\n\nSo turn tessellation right down in your driver settings and turn off the HBAO+ to restore most of the performance dips. You will still get some stuttering when it is loading in this version 1.0 early build. This is because I only have 8GB of RAM and it is using the windows pagefile. Make sure you have your pagefile on an SSD, if you have one, when you are running less than 16GB of RAM. Otherwise do as I suggest and your performance will be mostly fine with everything else on max.\n\nI am running an FX-8120 and a 7950 and I am getting a pretty solid 40-50 fps from the steam counter.\n\nEDIT: Ok so I got to the 3rd part called "Soviet Installation" and my frame rate tanked. I had to drop from "very high" to "high" texture detail. I'm guessing I ran out of VRAM cause that's all it took to bump my frame rate right back up again and I couldn't notice any difference at all at 1080p. I suspect "v high" textures are just badly compressed.

For example there aren't really any puzzles, and when there is more to think about than pressing a button Lara will tell you what to do anyway "Looks like I might be able to shoot an arrow into that lever" which can be incredibly tedious when you actually want to solve tombs by yourself. Voice acting is the worst in any game for years. Did nobody coach the actress that voiced Lara? "It's a fishing line with 'leed' weights". Never heard of how to pronounce lead? It's a fairly common metal. There are other examples that kind of destroy the illusion that Lara knows what she's talking about, but hey ho, nevermind.\n\nSo why am I recommending it? Well, it's FUN. It's great to see tombs come back into Tomb Raider, the focus is on story and adventure more than simply killing loads of enemies  and it looks great and makes you want to collect every collectible. I can see myself playing it again in the future, but I really hope they add more traps and puzzles to the tombs and have an option to turn off the stupid hand holding. Bring back the days when you'd stare at a room for an hour trying to work out how to solve it.","March 3","true","52.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Playing on an i5-4690k and GTX 750Ti, and it still looks very, very good. Yes, there are a few drops here and there, but nothing major that could ruin the gameplay.\n\nThe story, ooh sweet story. Rise of the Tomb Raider is better in every aspect than its reboot in 2013. More interesting story, more tombs, larger map, more collectibles etc.\n\nI have been a fan of Tomb Raider games since I was a child, and at some point, the Tomb Raider games just didn't feel good anymore, they were boring, but time passed, and they made Tomb Raider (2013), which was a masterpiece, a game that everyone just have to have in their library at some point, honestly I didn't think they would make a better Tomb Raider game than the one released in 2013, oh how wrong I was.\n\nRise of The Tomb Raider is a technical masterpiece that will consume you, if you're a fan of adventure games with some puzzles and action. It's like that one student at the back of the class getting all the answers right while others just scream and fool around. If you call yourself a gamer, you NEED to buy this right now! Hands down one of the best games in 2016 that came to PC.\n\nOh, and Lara's ♥♥♥ looks nice in this, too.","March 3","true","28.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

You have a breathtaking graphic, insanely fluid movements, wonderful voiced characters and of course the cutest and sexiest girl in the gaming world: Lara Croft.\n\nThe game is linear, even tho you are kinda allowed to roam around and do stuff, you basically wanna follow the red string of the story. You will occasionally encounter some special hidden quests which are fun to do and give you a good reward. You solve everything in typical Lara Croft style, climbing walls and jumping off roofs. And all of that doesnt only ♥♥♥♥ing feel awesome, it also looks awesome.\n\nYour character can level up, and you can invest points per Level into abilities, which are divided into 3 main groups. It allows you to customize the way you wanna finish the game. Do you prefer shooting around, stealthing around or building traps? It's all up to you.\nYour Weapons can also be upgraded, in the same way as your character.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Maybe because I have a huge thing for British girls. Or, and thats what I think, because this game just combines some of the core elements of some good games and brings us a wonderful next gen Lara Croft!\n\n","February 12","true","11.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

This game takes the best aspects from the last game and adds things we all missed from the original games... RAIDING TOMBS!\n\nPROS\n-Great Graphics\n-Amazing gameplay. Especially the crafting system when in combat\n-Pretty solid story that keeps you intrigued\n-You can finish the entire game with the Bow. The weapons found later on in the story were not automatically superior\n\nCONS\n-Constant hunting in areas for things like coins or strongboxes tends to get boring\n-Combat was never really challanging. Bears were more of a challange than 10 or more Trinity Soldiers\n-Framerate drops in movies (under 20fps for me in some places)\n\nAs a Tomb Raider fan since I was just out of nappies, who started his first Tomb Raider experience by being allowed to sit on my brothers lap and press the space bar to draw Lara's weapons when she needed to them, I Definitely think this game is a game worthy of the Tomb Raider name and any one who is a fan of the originals or just the newer ones should give it a playthrough.\n\nOVERALL SCORE 9/10","February 10","true","28.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

They are called "challenge tombs" for some unknown reason, as they are as difficult as making toast (quite hard if you don't have a grill or toaster, granted). Again, don't bother playing unless on the hardest level, as it is way too easy, and overkill as usual with the weapons. You can easily get through the whole game with stock weaps and ammo. Story is lol, but it tells you small snippets about the Crofts. Combat is silly and AI even sillier.\nThankfully, you can switch off on screen clues/prompts, because with it on, in the age of hand-holding computer games, it takes all the thought out of any puzzles in the game, (which are few and far between and simple).\nGreat for a blast, bad for Tomb Raider die hard fans expecting much improvement. As i said about the last outing, can only get better, it has, and i hold hope for any others, but maybe next time, like our good 'ole Tomb Raidings of old, let's have some more global locales to explore, as one large "open world" area is not in the vein of Lara's adventures overall, really, oh and some vehicles wouldn't go amiss either.\nEnjoy it at a lower price, but worth playing, especially if you like a mix of Far Cry, Asscreed, TR. Quite low on combat tho', it comes in bouts that are yawn, and by the time i got to The Lost City, i was just crying for it to end.\nAll in all, a fair attempt, but again, room for improvement.","February 7","true","51.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are outstanding and, despite the FPS drops experienced in the larger outdoor areas the game, the engine seems well optimized and makes quality use of the available hardware.\nThe story however is weak and mostly fails in its attempt to mix "The Descent"-inspired aesthetics & violence from the reboot with the kind of cheesy narratives found in the earlier games from the series.\nOnce again, there are not that many Tombs, but what is there is ambitiously executed and a lot of fun to play through.\nA lot of the Expeditions content is disposable, but the Endurance mode DLC is probably the single best way to play the game, so you definitely want to get that.\nOverall it is a very solid game, but as it is overly careful to replicate everything that was good about the previous title, it is somewhat disappointing too.","February 14","true","64.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/recommended/391220/","specialneedsforces","Special Needs Forces","http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/","245 products in account","This game does not give off a good first impression. The beginning is heavily scripted. Walk forwards, watch something bad happen, press X to not die, etc. Follow the linear path, watch the cutscenes. Please, give me gameplay already. Fortunately, after a short attempt to impress players with gee whiz cutscene action, it does start delivering the goods.\n\nThe gameplay mixes platforming, traversal (climbing and the like), combat of both the direct and stealth variety, puzzle solving, and exploration and discovery. There's a lot of good to be found in these elements.\n\nLara's jumping is fluid and fun to control. You can actually aim her jumps a little bit in mid-air, and her climbing is also quite fluid. She can "double jump" up walls, climb trees, launch herself off walls, and can climb icy and rocky walls with her pickaxe. You have a ton of control over these elements, as opposed to the stiff movement of the later Uncharted games, and combining these moves together is a lot of fun.\n\nCombat tends to allow for many options. For example, at one point I was hiding in water and I grabbed an enemy who was unaware, and drowned him. Then I snuck up behind another enemy, strangled him, and then planted a poison gas bomb on his body, then hid. Another enemy examined the corpse, and got a face full of poison gas for his trouble. Three enemies down, still not spotted yet. I knew I was going to have to inevitably fight, so I lit a fire arrow and ignited two enemies at once, and that blew my cover. Well, almost. The enemies started searching for me, and I was able to surprise one more before everyone spotted me and it basically turned into a standard cover shooter at that point.\n\nOne problem, as I see it, is that there's too much open combat in the game that just takes place in linear areas. I think the game is at its best when you have many options at your disposal, but sometimes, you're just forced into standard shooty setpieces before you can move on.\n\nThe level design is a mixture of open areas, and linear setpieces. Open areas are sometimes huge, and loaded with things to do: characters to talk to (such as villagers or rebels in hiding), wild animals hanging around their turf, caves to explore, trees to climb, hidden stuff to find, and your eventual goal that takes you to the next area. These areas are fantastic, and I really wish there were more of them.\n\nThe pacing changes up a lot; sometimes you're progressing through a linear area and fighting through enemies, then you have to climb and move through to the next area, then solve a minor puzzle, and eventually you're out in the open where you're hit with tons of things to do.\n\nSometimes, though, the pacing doesn't quite work out. One area of the game had a village full of people preparing for a huge battle against invaders. There was a lot to do there, and their upcoming battle was played up as if it was going to be epic. I was really excited about the idea of fighting enemies in such a massive, open forest with trees, towers, caves and houses... but when it came time for the battle, it was just a linear cover shooter segment. When it was all over, the villagers were talking about the heavy losses they suffered over the past 10 minutes. I was left thinking, "That's it?!" It could have been epic, but it failed.\n\nYou'll encounter some brutally tough puzzles, many of which are optional (the "challenge tombs"), some of which are required to progress. They involve things like transporting an explosive to its destination, moving a boat around a rapidly flowing river with the help of ropes and pulleys - some puzzles require timing, while others don't.\n\nThe game provides hints in several ways, such as music that changes depending on how close you are to solving the puzzle, remarks Lara makes to herself, and the ability to "examine" things using "survival instincts" (which makes important and interactive things glow, while also revealing objectives).\n\nThere's also tons of hidden secrets to find. The game outright alerts you to nearby "challenge tombs", with the sound of wind chimes playing when you're in their general area. The tombs are essentially multiple puzzles: first you have to find them, then you have to enter them, then you have to solve the puzzle inside. Successfully raiding the tombs earns you special abilities, such as the ability to detect animals' hearts and kill them in one hit if you shoot them there (animals are very nasty and harder to kill than most humans, so this helps a lot in encounters with them).\n\nYou can backtrack to find secrets and hidden things in locations you've been to before, using your new abilities. Any campfire you've previously visited serves as a place to upgrade weapons and spend experience points (obtained via collecting items or killing in special ways) on skills, as well as warp to any previously visited campfire, so you can backtrack that way.\n\nThe skills you can obtain are things like the ability to turn gas cans into bombs, the ability to craft certain kinds of new weapons (such as explosive arrows), and more. Some of these skills really open up your combat options, and there are also special abilities that can be obtained only by completing challenge tombs.\n\nThat said, this game has some things that hold it back quite a bit. A lot of the cover-based combat just feels, to me, mostly like it's just there for the sake of being there, and isn't well thought out, while stealth combat is a lot more fun but doesn't quite go on for as long as I'd like at times. There are scripted moments that are just really unnecessary, but at least it's not as bad as the previous game when it comes to that (save for that awful beginning).\n\nAnd the ending feels rushed and generic. Lots of ghost-like enemies shooting at me with blue fire arrows that are just easier to kill and do way less damage than you'd expect. I felt like I didn't have much opportunity to do much creative fighting, and it just felt like a waste of time. And the final area even goes for that annoying orange/blue color scheme Hollywood is obsessed with (Google it to see what I mean if you haven't noticed that trend already). Indeed, rushed endings are a problem I've noticed in other games I've really enjoyed lately, such as Axiom Verge and Life is Strange. It's like companies just feel the need to make their game end on a big note, but don't know how to do it in a way that paces well.\n\nFinally, and this is more of a mild complaint, enemies can be total morons at times. At one point, I was hiding behind cover, and there was a fire burning next to me. An enemy was walking towards my hiding spot, about to turn the corner to where I was hiding, and he walked right into the fire, ignited, and died seconds later. I've seen other behavior that's not quite that stupid, but still really dumb.\n\nStill, other than some issues with pacing and scripting, overall I think this game is pretty good, and a major improvement over Tomb Raider 2013. If you're looking for an adventure with a lot of different types of gameplay, I'd recommend this one, since I think the good outweighs the bad.\n\n(Finally, ignore my number of hours on record. I tend to leave games running the entire time I do other things)","February 15","true","925.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

However, once you get over how weird Lara's face looks, the horrendous mouth animations during dialogue both in and out of cinematic, that's when the game actually has a new sort of charm.\nIt might take a few tries to get your grpahics to where your sweet-spot is, but a lot of the issues reported have not happened to me and I always fine tune my settings instead of assuming one-size fits all. I'd describe it as VERY HIGH settings with the exception of one or two parameters.\nThis game comes into its own where the alst one failed miserably: multiplayer. You don't play against others on the same map, no. But you do have an arcade style leaderboard and expeditions menu which offers huge amounts of customizations via cards. It's incredibly addicting and I've spent too much time trying to get the high scores and I will spend more.","February 7","true","64.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiyabear/recommended/391220/","fiyabear","The Russian Mob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiyabear/","1769 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider's level design and pacing make it a masterpiece among action-adventure games. The levels are built to be replayable but doesn't make it obvious the first time through. This makes it feel like everything you do will constantly drive the game forward but never closes you off from collectibles or going back to take screenshots after the action is through, which the jaw-dropping art will make you want to do. The pacing conveys the sense of urgency mirrored in the story but speeds up and slows down effectively. Characters are developed in audio logs as well as in cinematics and interactions with Lara. This teired approach allows you to get a feeling about the characters without being overbearing. This game also brings Tomb Raider closer to it's roots after the 2013's origin story, Lara is back to treasure hunting fiend she used to be. The length of the game hit the sweet spot of ~30 hours for 100% completion run, including the Baba Yaga dlc, and can be extended through the Replay and Endurance gamemodes. Thank you to developers for such an amazing and bug-free experience. (well worth noting in this era of releasing unfinished games) I think this game is a big win for everyone involved and probably the best Tomb Raider game ever. Well worth the launch price.","February 7","true","29.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I loved those early games, but the sequels got stale over the years.\n\nThe 2013 Reboot was a breath of fresh air, and one of the best reboots of all time, alongside J.J. Abrahms 2009 Star Trek.  I immensely enjoyed Tomb Raider, and after owning it on PS3 (multiple playthroughs) I purchased it on a Steam sale and completed another playthrough.\n\nThis game is even better in my opinion than the 2013 Tomb Raider.  In the first game, Lara was constantly on the brink of death, always running and seemingly fighting a neverending uphill battle.  This time, it really feels like she is where she wants to be, and much more in control than in the first game.\n\nThe controls are wonderful, I use a xbox controller and it feels very nice.  The Tomb puzzles are not too tough and are completed fairly quickly, which is very good as it doesn't bog down the gameplay and keeps up the pace.  The combat is nice, and there are more weapons and options in this game than it's direct predecessor.\n\nThe combat is well paced, with very well directed set pieces throughout.  The game doesn't slow down too much, even when I take a break to hunt more deer or rabbits for the next crafting upgrade.\n\nThe Graphics.  Oh God the graphics.  This game is absolutely beautiful.  I wish I could post a screenshot in this review.  My specs aren't bleeding edge or top-end (FX8350 + GTX 970), but Geforce Experience optimised this to the High/Ultra settings and I am enjoying a very smooth 50-60FPS and every effect just looks wonderful.  The scenery is very lifelike, but what really sets the graphics apart from the pack is the lighting.  Every shaft of light and shadow is very realistic and adds a lot to the immersion of the game.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I have played about 23 hours of this game, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes adventure games.  You do not need to play the 2013 Tomb Raider (or any of the others for that matter) to get the story of this one, but I would recommend it just to see what Lara went through in the first game.  You will see what changed her from a naive and idealistic college student to a cold hearted pregmatist who will do whatever it takes to survive.\n\nPlay this game.

The story of Tomb Raider 2013 was already REALLY bad and had nothing but forgettable characters. Rise of the Tomb Raider also has nothing but forgettable characters, the story is also really bad, but what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most is how extremely serious this game is. There is NO humour AT ALL, even though the topics and the story of this game are extremely silly things.\nBecause of this the Uncharted series will always be better.\nAfter the boring prologue I had a lot of fun with RotTR and I thought this might be a strong contender for GOTY, but the more I continued the more I got dissapointed and the terrible story just left me with a dissapointed feeling at the end. Still, the game has a lot of good things about it, which could easily make it a 9/10 just by have LESS story, because it is SO bad.\nWhat I liked the most about this game is how much bigger the areas are, how much more encouraged you are to explore and how much more puzzles you can do. This also makes this game feel much more like the first generation of Tomb Raider games. Combat is also improved, but not by much. Unlike TR2013 though, you don't get thrown into a combat situation and then get attacked by waves of enemies. Here in most situations the enemies won't know that you are there, so you can always plan your attack first and go stealthy. Problem is that the game is so ♥♥♥♥ing easy even on the highest difficulty, actually it's simply broken. You get waay to much ammo and resources for everything which allows you to craft as much poison/fire/explosive arrows as you want, which are by far the most overpowered weapons in the game. With 1 poison arrow you can take down a group of the most armored enemies in the game. Not only that, but you will have millions of healing material, so you can always heal yourself in combat. Especially because of the level design there is always cover which you can use and quickly heal yourself. It gets even more ridiculous when you upgrade your healing ability, which they added because apparently it wasn't easy enough already. With the healing upgrade you can heal yourself almost instantly. I actually didn't die a single time in combat in this game on the highest difficulty. The combat was still fun, and the good thing is there wasn't THAT much combat as in TR2013.\nWhat dissapointed me about the second half of the game is that there weren't these big hub areas anymore, where you can freely explore, do side missions and stuff like that. The second half was completely rushed and you were always attacked by enemies. I completed the game in 12 hours and I did almost all side missions and all tombs except one. 12 hours is really short.\nVisually the game was really impressive, it had some really nice places, good variety and panoramas. But I had some frame drops in some places on my GTX 970 which was annoying (without AA, textures no high).\n\nI think if the story and ending wasn't so bad, I wouldn't be left with such a dissapointed feeling and like the game much more. I don't recommend buying at full price, because the game is too short.","February 5","true","15.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I cannot fathom ONE thing that the developers did not improve upon. On the contrary, they UPed the ante. Visuals are top notch, level design and setting as well. Larger, better sandboxy areas, beautiful tombs (and much improved upon), excellent lighting..I could go on and on. The game is worth every penny for any proper Tomb Raider fan!\nBut boy is the game taxing on the highest settings! I do not recommend setting up very high textures unless you have quite the beast of a GPU, it really is a fps killer, in comparison to basically every other setting (maybe HBAO+).

The boss battles executed differently but it felt like the same action ending and it bugs me.\n\nWas it worth the $40 I paid for it?  16.3 hours to complete the main story with minor deviations to break up a speed run and kinda explore so yeah? I guess? I have a bit of animosity because of the ending but I think I can get over it. The graphics were amazing, the glacier as a back drop to some cold tundra and muddy living areas was pretty stellar. The audio drew me into the game like none other. When ♥♥♥♥ started breaking under you as you're running across certain things the sound was impressive, scary. The gameplay was what I expected, action adventure game with a bit of RPG elements (perks/weapon upgrades). The story was kinda meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It was kinda campy on the eternal life bit just seems like thats all that comes out of archaeologist fantasy.\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nAudio - 10/10\nGameplay - 7/10\nStory - 5/10","February 6","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Last game feels like a legendary story of how lara survived but this feels more like wanna be 'Uncharted'ish. I wish they bring old Tomb raider back now.\n->The levels are boring need more innovative way or atleast make Tombs a part of the story like old tomb raider games (1,2,3,4,5).\nI honestly tried to enjoy this game but for some reason it felt like i was playing a DLC to the last reboot but not that interesting one.\nI still recommend it since it has a promising plot for further Tomb raider games.","February 8","true","16.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Square Enix does it again with astonishing graphics. Lara is smoking hot and beautifully modelled. If you loved the last game "Tomb Raider" and the way the reboot went then you will love this game too.\n\nShame it's gamesworks this time around which, as usual, screws people's performance on the highest settings. This game needs optimisation still for when it is loading from the drive but most people's performance will be tanking because of Nvidia's usual BS.\n\nSo turn tessellation right down in your driver settings and turn off the HBAO+ to restore most of the performance dips. You will still get some stuttering when it is loading in this version 1.0 early build. This is because I only have 8GB of RAM and it is using the windows pagefile. Make sure you have your pagefile on an SSD, if you have one, when you are running less than 16GB of RAM. Otherwise do as I suggest and your performance will be mostly fine with everything else on max.\n\nI am running an FX-8120 and a 7950 and I am getting a pretty solid 40-50 fps from the steam counter.\n\nEDIT: Ok so I got to the 3rd part called "Soviet Installation" and my frame rate tanked. I had to drop from "very high" to "high" texture detail. I'm guessing I ran out of VRAM cause that's all it took to bump my frame rate right back up again and I couldn't notice any difference at all at 1080p. I suspect "v high" textures are just badly compressed.

The environments are gorgeous, the character models are very well detailed and the pure hair technology looks great. The effects such as the snow reacting to player and to npc is a very nice touch to the game.\n\nSequences:\nMost of the sequences which mainly involve escaping a collapsing cave etc in game are exhilarating.\n\nCustomization:\nThe able to make and wear more outfits is the main improvement in the customization. The alternate weapons and more unique skills also improve customization.\n\nStory:\nThe story is good but not great though, there are some twist that are interesting but that is all.\n\nTombs:\nOne of the letdowns in the previous game(reboot) is that they weren't enough tombs. Rise of the tomb raider improves this aspect and rewards players with very useful rewards for completing each tomb.\n\nCons:\n\nFramerate\nFor me, frame rate was very inconsistent. Most of the time it averages at 45fps, sometimes rise to 60, drops to 30,22 and in some cases 15 or even 1fps. The game also crashed in one instance.\n\nIm running on GTX 960, i7-4790 , 8gb Ram and one high preset with some settings at med with tessellation unticked.\n\nI feel the game should be more consistent in terms of framerate\n\n\nMore or less the same:\nIf you feel the previous reboot was easy, well Rise of The Tomb Raider would also be easy. The same tactics in the previous entry could still be used again, weapons are similar to previous game, not many new tools and they also hardly make a difference.\n\n\n\nThe framerate was the most frustrating thing about the game as it was inconsistent , this also played a major role in my final score. Despite this its still a got game so i would still recommend it, but make sure you have a powerful rig to support the game and your desired settings.\n\n","February 2","true","22.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/recommended/391220/","specialneedsforces","Special Needs Forces","http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/","245 products in account","This game does not give off a good first impression. The beginning is heavily scripted. Walk forwards, watch something bad happen, press X to not die, etc. Follow the linear path, watch the cutscenes. Please, give me gameplay already. Fortunately, after a short attempt to impress players with gee whiz cutscene action, it does start delivering the goods.\n\nThe gameplay mixes platforming, traversal (climbing and the like), combat of both the direct and stealth variety, puzzle solving, and exploration and discovery. There's a lot of good to be found in these elements.\n\nLara's jumping is fluid and fun to control. You can actually aim her jumps a little bit in mid-air, and her climbing is also quite fluid. She can "double jump" up walls, climb trees, launch herself off walls, and can climb icy and rocky walls with her pickaxe. You have a ton of control over these elements, as opposed to the stiff movement of the later Uncharted games, and combining these moves together is a lot of fun.\n\nCombat tends to allow for many options. For example, at one point I was hiding in water and I grabbed an enemy who was unaware, and drowned him. Then I snuck up behind another enemy, strangled him, and then planted a poison gas bomb on his body, then hid. Another enemy examined the corpse, and got a face full of poison gas for his trouble. Three enemies down, still not spotted yet. I knew I was going to have to inevitably fight, so I lit a fire arrow and ignited two enemies at once, and that blew my cover. Well, almost. The enemies started searching for me, and I was able to surprise one more before everyone spotted me and it basically turned into a standard cover shooter at that point.\n\nOne problem, as I see it, is that there's too much open combat in the game that just takes place in linear areas. I think the game is at its best when you have many options at your disposal, but sometimes, you're just forced into standard shooty setpieces before you can move on.\n\nThe level design is a mixture of open areas, and linear setpieces. Open areas are sometimes huge, and loaded with things to do: characters to talk to (such as villagers or rebels in hiding), wild animals hanging around their turf, caves to explore, trees to climb, hidden stuff to find, and your eventual goal that takes you to the next area. These areas are fantastic, and I really wish there were more of them.\n\nThe pacing changes up a lot; sometimes you're progressing through a linear area and fighting through enemies, then you have to climb and move through to the next area, then solve a minor puzzle, and eventually you're out in the open where you're hit with tons of things to do.\n\nSometimes, though, the pacing doesn't quite work out. One area of the game had a village full of people preparing for a huge battle against invaders. There was a lot to do there, and their upcoming battle was played up as if it was going to be epic. I was really excited about the idea of fighting enemies in such a massive, open forest with trees, towers, caves and houses... but when it came time for the battle, it was just a linear cover shooter segment. When it was all over, the villagers were talking about the heavy losses they suffered over the past 10 minutes. I was left thinking, "That's it?!" It could have been epic, but it failed.\n\nYou'll encounter some brutally tough puzzles, many of which are optional (the "challenge tombs"), some of which are required to progress. They involve things like transporting an explosive to its destination, moving a boat around a rapidly flowing river with the help of ropes and pulleys - some puzzles require timing, while others don't.\n\nThe game provides hints in several ways, such as music that changes depending on how close you are to solving the puzzle, remarks Lara makes to herself, and the ability to "examine" things using "survival instincts" (which makes important and interactive things glow, while also revealing objectives).\n\nThere's also tons of hidden secrets to find. The game outright alerts you to nearby "challenge tombs", with the sound of wind chimes playing when you're in their general area. The tombs are essentially multiple puzzles: first you have to find them, then you have to enter them, then you have to solve the puzzle inside. Successfully raiding the tombs earns you special abilities, such as the ability to detect animals' hearts and kill them in one hit if you shoot them there (animals are very nasty and harder to kill than most humans, so this helps a lot in encounters with them).\n\nYou can backtrack to find secrets and hidden things in locations you've been to before, using your new abilities. Any campfire you've previously visited serves as a place to upgrade weapons and spend experience points (obtained via collecting items or killing in special ways) on skills, as well as warp to any previously visited campfire, so you can backtrack that way.\n\nThe skills you can obtain are things like the ability to turn gas cans into bombs, the ability to craft certain kinds of new weapons (such as explosive arrows), and more. Some of these skills really open up your combat options, and there are also special abilities that can be obtained only by completing challenge tombs.\n\nThat said, this game has some things that hold it back quite a bit. A lot of the cover-based combat just feels, to me, mostly like it's just there for the sake of being there, and isn't well thought out, while stealth combat is a lot more fun but doesn't quite go on for as long as I'd like at times. There are scripted moments that are just really unnecessary, but at least it's not as bad as the previous game when it comes to that (save for that awful beginning).\n\nAnd the ending feels rushed and generic. Lots of ghost-like enemies shooting at me with blue fire arrows that are just easier to kill and do way less damage than you'd expect. I felt like I didn't have much opportunity to do much creative fighting, and it just felt like a waste of time. And the final area even goes for that annoying orange/blue color scheme Hollywood is obsessed with (Google it to see what I mean if you haven't noticed that trend already). Indeed, rushed endings are a problem I've noticed in other games I've really enjoyed lately, such as Axiom Verge and Life is Strange. It's like companies just feel the need to make their game end on a big note, but don't know how to do it in a way that paces well.\n\nFinally, and this is more of a mild complaint, enemies can be total morons at times. At one point, I was hiding behind cover, and there was a fire burning next to me. An enemy was walking towards my hiding spot, about to turn the corner to where I was hiding, and he walked right into the fire, ignited, and died seconds later. I've seen other behavior that's not quite that stupid, but still really dumb.\n\nStill, other than some issues with pacing and scripting, overall I think this game is pretty good, and a major improvement over Tomb Raider 2013. If you're looking for an adventure with a lot of different types of gameplay, I'd recommend this one, since I think the good outweighs the bad.\n\n(Finally, ignore my number of hours on record. I tend to leave games running the entire time I do other things)","February 15","true","925.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It's hard for me to understand why the graphic engine has such a big performance drop without having a huge progress in graphics quality. But when you run the game you can see Nvidia logo... this says something...\n-Main story is not as strong and captivating as in previous game.\n\n\nStrong points:\n-The backstory is great, the world is filled with recordings from multiple parts of history that I enjoyed listening to, i found them more captivating the game's main story.\n-Lots of weapon and gear customization options\n-Lots of collectibles and multiple side-missions that made me spend time outside main story missions\n-Amazing gameplay and well-made animations combined with beautiful and easy to understand levels... this is probably what makes Tomb Raider pretty unique.\n\nAlso worths mentioning:\nThe game has no multiplayer, but even if it had, would not be a big +, it's not that kind of gameplay I'd want for online.

This game takes the best aspects from the last game and adds things we all missed from the original games... RAIDING TOMBS!\n\nPROS\n-Great Graphics\n-Amazing gameplay. Especially the crafting system when in combat\n-Pretty solid story that keeps you intrigued\n-You can finish the entire game with the Bow. The weapons found later on in the story were not automatically superior\n\nCONS\n-Constant hunting in areas for things like coins or strongboxes tends to get boring\n-Combat was never really challanging. Bears were more of a challange than 10 or more Trinity Soldiers\n-Framerate drops in movies (under 20fps for me in some places)\n\nAs a Tomb Raider fan since I was just out of nappies, who started his first Tomb Raider experience by being allowed to sit on my brothers lap and press the space bar to draw Lara's weapons when she needed to them, I Definitely think this game is a game worthy of the Tomb Raider name and any one who is a fan of the originals or just the newer ones should give it a playthrough.\n\nOVERALL SCORE 9/10","February 10","true","28.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Especially the bits in Syria and early on in Serbia on the mountain felt really awesome, great introduction set pieces. The puzzles are a bit too simple honestly but I was fine with it as is.\n\nMy biggest gripe was how several times while far into the game I had to restart it. There are bugs here, nasty ones at that. Probably not everyone experience them but sometimes events weren't triggered, especially towards the end. The trebuchet stuff was downright frustrating, I had to restart the game several times. Not because of death mind you, simply because NPC's would be stuck inside walls and keep throwing stuff at you but you couldn't kill them. Or I couldn't remove debris that was in the way because it didn't get removed even though I was doing what I was supposed to do to progress. So really the last bit was really annoying for me. However these are bugs that will probably be fixed or may not occur for everyone. Though I really hated the trebuchet stuff in general, going back and fourth between these felt like pure filler to try and make the game longer.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, it's quite stunning and has an engaging story. Some pieces are quite cool, where you had three factions fighting each other at the end and you're just trying to make it across to the other side with things blowing up infront of you.\n\nI must admit though I was expecting more, Rise of the Tomb Raider feels like the other Tomb Raider game from 2013. I guess more of the same is good?  But I would have liked to see them open up the world a bit more, I understand that is difficult.  Especially when there are events sometimes in tombs that block off areas as you progress.  It's not a big thing but the only time I really felt like I was exploring was when I found tombs scattered around the map for the side missions. These are done very well and I highly recommend doing these, most of the time they are a lot more engaging than the main mission stuff.\n\nI'll end with that it's a solid sequel that needs some bug fixes and next time around maybe opening the world up more.","February 3","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

A modest sequel and a refinement of Tomb Raider formula, a formula I had a lot of fun revisiting. There are new areas to explore, plenty of side activities to do, myriad of things to collect, and a new group of enemies ready to be headshotted. There is also a brand new story, this time centering around the Divine Source, mythical artefact that supposedly can grant eternal life.\n\nOptional tombs were also improved. They are more memorable, make much more sense in the game world, and no longer award you with experience points but rather teach Lara new abilities. It was a joy to find and clear them all.\n\nMultiplayer was thankfully neutered and replaced by Expeditions - new set of modes, allowing you to replay chapters, play score-attack or return to hub areas with new objectives - all while competing with other players on leaderboards. I'm also happy to report that ridiculously brutal death scenes have been seriously toned down.\n\nMy biggest problem with RoTR is that it is too similar to its predecessor. On the next instalment (and I'm sure there will be one) I'd like some serious game play changes and not just a paint job.","March 25","true","31.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Especially the bits in Syria and early on in Serbia on the mountain felt really awesome, great introduction set pieces. The puzzles are a bit too simple honestly but I was fine with it as is.\n\nMy biggest gripe was how several times while far into the game I had to restart it. There are bugs here, nasty ones at that. Probably not everyone experience them but sometimes events weren't triggered, especially towards the end. The trebuchet stuff was downright frustrating, I had to restart the game several times. Not because of death mind you, simply because NPC's would be stuck inside walls and keep throwing stuff at you but you couldn't kill them. Or I couldn't remove debris that was in the way because it didn't get removed even though I was doing what I was supposed to do to progress. So really the last bit was really annoying for me. However these are bugs that will probably be fixed or may not occur for everyone. Though I really hated the trebuchet stuff in general, going back and fourth between these felt like pure filler to try and make the game longer.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, it's quite stunning and has an engaging story. Some pieces are quite cool, where you had three factions fighting each other at the end and you're just trying to make it across to the other side with things blowing up infront of you.\n\nI must admit though I was expecting more, Rise of the Tomb Raider feels like the other Tomb Raider game from 2013. I guess more of the same is good?  But I would have liked to see them open up the world a bit more, I understand that is difficult.  Especially when there are events sometimes in tombs that block off areas as you progress.  It's not a big thing but the only time I really felt like I was exploring was when I found tombs scattered around the map for the side missions. These are done very well and I highly recommend doing these, most of the time they are a lot more engaging than the main mission stuff.\n\nI'll end with that it's a solid sequel that needs some bug fixes and next time around maybe opening the world up more.","February 3","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Fortunately, it was a good one, with enhanced graphics and thrilling story. Developers went even further and gave us in this title also exploration and survival challenges in harsh Siberian nature. Game, what may calmly aspire to the Game-of-the-Year title. Lets see in detail, what went good and what might be better.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Respect to tradition\n+ Thrilling story\n+ New platforms and puzzles\n+ Good locations allowing non-linear gameplay\n+ Exploration possibility\n+ Completable achievements\n+ DLC serve their purpose, purchasable with in-game earned credits\n+ RPG elements and multiple tactics\no nVidia cooperation\n- Sometime controls are clunky\n- Game is less intuitive\n\nIt is always hard to release a title in such famous series as Tomb Raider. Developers from Crystal Dynamics succeeded to give us a stunning story and yet perserve the spirit of previous titles. Furthermore, we can see, how it all begun, de facto, it is a restart of the whole serie.\n\nRotTR respects platform and puzzle presency and incorporates them well. This features present challenges, without them it would not be possible to enjoy this title. There simply have to be traps in tombs, but they are spottable and you have to try a bit to solve them, after that, the player is rewared with success.\n\nWhat is also positive, that the gameplay is non-linear, gives the player possibility to explore and set own tempo in progressing the game. It is underlined with human vs. nature challenge, your enemies are also beasts and harsh nature, yet resources for weapons, equipment and crafting are taken from vasts of Syria and Siberia.\n\nRPG elements are a great addition, you have three skill trees - Brawler (melee), Hunter (long-range), Survivor (hunting and endurance), which allows you choose your best tactics from plenty available.\n\nAchievements are completable and they serve as another motivation to play the game and advance your limits higher. Here we also go to some negatives.\n\nControls are sometimes clunky and game should be more intuitive and correct minor deviations. E. g. you are facing milimeter to the side, you will fall and challenge might be broken or not completed.\n\nCooperation with nVidia was a perfect idea, game runs with an amazing graphic, but sometimes Steam and graphic overlay were causing unexpected crashes of the game. This should be temporary, so far disabling of this feature helps.\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Lara Croft\n+ Jonah\n+ Jacob\n+ Sofia\n+ Constantin\n+ Ana\no Trinity and Remnant Resistance\n\nMany characters are undergoing a huge transformation in the game. Lara was shy and naive in the beginning, after all of her adventures, she became determind and devoted to do the right thing. Jonah serves as an excellent companion. Mots surprising is Jacob. From the chief of Remnant Resistance forces he became the biggest plottwist, which can surprise even after so many stories told from Lara Croft's universe. Not to forget Sofia, who turned from rebel to person, who might lead the whole resistance.\n\nConstantin and Ana were pefrect opponents, even between them struggles occured. What is sad, the rest of both forces were just to add enemies and allies to give the players immersion of something bigger. Little more improvement and it would be unbeatable.\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Sceneries\n+ Lara's behaviour\n- Minor glitches\n\nSceneries are amazing, either desert Syria or winter Siberia, I could feel the atmosphere in each of my steps. What I like more that after getting from water she did up her hair and when she was cold, she was shivering (not good during the hunt :-D) and holding her arms around her. To sum up this idea, each screenshot might serve as a wallpaper.\n\nThere were several minor glitches, fortunately nothing disturbing, so I did not count them to evaluation.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ Fitting to the game\n+ According to the atmospheree\n\nAnother great composer work, songs are changing accordingly, atmosphere is kept in the level, that player is always amazed. Also, change of music sometimes warns you before you actually encounter enemies or beasts.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nTo sum it up, RotTR is a great game, that might catch even players out of this genre (my example), is really customizable and players are able to enjoy it in their own tempo. Story is perfect, enviroment as well, it is up to you, whether you choose to explore or to progress.\n\nIn case you want to examine your survival activites, try Endurance mode, or uncover the truth behind the myth in Baba Yaga. It is up to the players, which tactic they choose and how they do. Challenges are motivating to go even further, replayability is great.\n\nThe prize might be a bit higher (49,99 EUR + 27,99 EUR for Season Pass), but it is completely worthy. Compared to the content and other games, it is really rich in what to offer.\n\nStrongly recommended, and in my humble opinion, perfect aspirant for the Game of the Year.","March 4","true","399.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I liked Tomb Raider 2013 and praised both the smoothness of the character's movement through the game and how, while there was much to collect, it isn't overly burdensome for completionists. Yes, I do use guides for a few hard-to-find pieces (my rule of thumb is when it's not fun, break out the Gamefaqs or IGN guides...), but you can get most things yourself with a little extra effort, and it's not a complete pain in the butt.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider just smoothed out the rough edges from 2013. So, if you like 2013, you're going to find more to like in Rise. They also toned down the death animations (there's less torture-porn, as I call it), and really let Lara into her own.\n\nI'm also a sucker for the outfit changes (some functional variations, yes, but mostly aesthetics and immersion), and I was pleased to see that there was virtually no fan-service. Yes, her butt looks good in everything, but there's nothing overly showy or sexualized, which is always nice to see with female game characters. Everything else, however, was absolutely eye-candy. Roaming the map was simply beautiful, and the fluid animation of character movement was a joy.\n\nWhole-hearted recommendation from me.","February 28","true","30.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And we all know that we won't be seeing any new TR title in like 3 more years, best. I hope I am wrong\n\n- Fast travel system is more usable than TR 2013 but game is still linear af. Why bother making it sandbox?

There's a bunch of characters that are introduced and we get little to no character development. And the base plot is a literal copy of Uncharted 2. I finished this game in one sitting (10 hours, and that's including tomb hunting). The game gives you a lot to do in the beginning stages and then once you reach the downfall of the game it begins to get linear, which really isn't a bad thing. The game promotes you to grind to prepare for the endgame which is cool. Besides the lacking story, the gameplay is awesome and better than the reboot.

It's hard for me to understand why the graphic engine has such a big performance drop without having a huge progress in graphics quality. But when you run the game you can see Nvidia logo... this says something...\n-Main story is not as strong and captivating as in previous game.\n\n\nStrong points:\n-The backstory is great, the world is filled with recordings from multiple parts of history that I enjoyed listening to, i found them more captivating the game's main story.\n-Lots of weapon and gear customization options\n-Lots of collectibles and multiple side-missions that made me spend time outside main story missions\n-Amazing gameplay and well-made animations combined with beautiful and easy to understand levels... this is probably what makes Tomb Raider pretty unique.\n\nAlso worths mentioning:\nThe game has no multiplayer, but even if it had, would not be a big +, it's not that kind of gameplay I'd want for online.

I got this game for free with my graphics card, and hoping that they would have improved on TR2013 I decided to play it to see if they made any improvements to the reboot (instead of giving the code to someone that acutally wanted to play the game), but there was nothing new to be found. It felt like it could very well have been an expansion pack to the original TR2013. The shooting is still bad. The guns still sound like BB guns, and the controls are as bad and unresponsive as they were in TR2013. I can not comment too much on the story since I only played three hours of it, but what I got was boring and not very original. The one improvement I found was that they had cut down on the QTE's, but they still used them to much for my taste.\n\nGraphics wise the game is great. Nothing more to say really. The game went for a photo-realistic look instead of having an unique artsyle, which means the game will look old in an year or two. I always prefer when a game chooses to have a nice artstyle instead of going for photo-realistic graphics, since games that have a nice artstyle age way better. Just look at Wind waker. That game still looks great to this day.\n\nAnd tombs. Tombs where boring. I got trough two of them before I decided to uninstall the game, and they were both way too easy. The game holds your hand way too much. If you are presented with even the simplest of puzzles, the game will have Lara comment on what she needs to do to solve it, which completely ruins the whole point of having a puzzle. This segment will represent the process of getting trough a tomb in this game:\n\n''Hmm, I wonder what I need to do to get past this part?'' I wondered as I was presented with a puzzle.\n\n''Why not do that and then that to solve it?'' Lara then said and the puzzle had solved itself for me.\n\nI hate when games treat their players as if they are two years old, and this game does it exceptionally well.\n\nThis is very subjective, but I don't Laras' voice actor. I don't know what it is, but I find it unbearable to listen to her for more than 5 seconds at a time.\n\nIf you liked the original TR2013, you will like this.

On the surface, It is the sequel to the 2013 VG title "Tomb Raider" - a reboot to the popular action-adventure series. In truth, "Rise of the Tomb Raider" is an artful take on a 90s manga "Ichi the Killer".\n\nLara Croft is the main character in the game. She is psychologically and emotionally disturbed after gruesome events of the first game, where she was forced to commit endless murder. When faced with a confrontation, Lara bursts into tears and breaks down emotionally. Even with her cowardly personality, Lara has trained extensively in the martial arts. With this training, even a pair of climbing axes could become lethal weapons in her hands. During the events of the "Rise of the Tomb Raider", Lara turns into a ruthless killer, silently hunting down mercs of an international organization "The Order of Trinity". With a bit of a sadism, that is. Lategame allows for the most brutal of kills, a.k.a. executions, with all of her weaponry.\n\nThe main mistery, though: who is the puppetmaster behind Lara's actions. Who honed her into the weapon she is? My bets are on "Jonah Maiava", who is a recurring character in both games, who accepted Lara's inhuman brutality with unexpected ease (in the first game); and suddenly decided to stick along with her in her journeys during the events of the second one.","February 8","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Amazing scenery and dramatic playable cutscenes are abundant throughout the campaign, but never leave you feeling like the gameplay is bogged down or linear. Explosions and lascerations abound, and really make you feel the resilliance and determination of Lara Croft as she attempts to outwit her hostile surroundings.\n\nThe narative of Lara Croft, although at times a bit too emotional for a character that has long been a silent badass, leads well into the story of the games that would follow. This game is great as a standalone entity, or even coupled with it's 2013 predecessor, however for a real fan of the series it makes Lara feel far too soft and under-confident at times.\n\nThe combat is smooth, and the control scheme is seemlessly meshed into a few buttons, making the player feel the power of all the tools at ones disposal without an overcomplicated control scheme. It does not, however, do anything to improve or innovate on the standard 3rd person "over the shoulder" shooter that we've come to know. In that sense it falls short of the rest of the overwhelming accomplishments this game makes, and feels more like an "if you've played one..." scenario.\n\nThe graphic demands of this game are high, a fact that was not lost on me when it (surprisingly) defaulted to "High" settings on my pc. I was very pleased to find out that my somewhat dated machine could run this game at reasonable specs. However early into the first cutscenes I realized that the game had made a bit of an over-estimation, and my frame rate became more of a series of still shots. This isn't the games fault, except for the fact that after seeing just how pretty the game COULD look, I was forced to lower the quality and settle for how it should look. It's my opinion that, had the game defaulted to "Medium" instead, I would have been pleasantly surprised with how far up I could push it, rather than being dissapointed at having to drop it lower.\n\nLastly, my biggest grievance with Tomb Raider 2013 was the difficulty. Even on hard mode the game was little challenge, and didn't offer an achievment for completion on a more difficult setting. Rise of the Tomb Raider has absolutely fixed this problem. Even on normal, the combat presented significant challenge at times, and the puzzles in the game are far improved, which goes even further if you turn off survival instincts leaving you to figure out all the maps and interactable objects for yourself. The bad part is that, you have to FORCE the game into not helping so much, which made me feel as though the developers assumed I'd be needing so much help. But solving the puzzles with all the help can make one feel lazy, like you could've done more, had the game allowed you the time to think before showing you the way. The tutorials that will occasionally pop up on the screen, telling you how to use equipment or dodge attacks, somehow never go away, and can telegraph the solution to a puzzle without warning or warrant.\n\nOverall, Rise of the Tomb Raider does in fact rise above its predescessor. There are several clear improvements over the last game, which are immediately apparent, and last throughout the campaign. But with a dusty combat system, and a babysitting tutorial system that makes thinking almost unneccesary, I'm left wanting a little bit more. A great game nonetheless, I'm giving Rise of the Tomb Raider a solid 8/10.","February 7","true","24.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Also, still only 25% into the game. Will update the review as I progress further if required.\n\nPros:\n1. Beautiful graphics if your system can handle it, especially in areas without Sunlight (see first point under cons below).\n2. A somewhat difficult game as it throws many enemies at you in spurts. Note that I am not used to shooting or FPS games so this might not be valid for you.\n3. Interesting story line.\n4. Tombs with nice puzzles.\n5. Voice acting is nice but even though the setting is Siberian/Russian, voice acting is in English with what feels like American accent to my untrained ears.\n6. The Skill tree seems interesting and it does not look like you will acquire everything by end game. So its a question of "which" rather than "when" which is good.\n\nCons:\n1. In areas with sunlight and shadows (parts of Soviet Installation in the early game), things are not optimized and actually the game doesn't look particularly good as well in those areas.\n2. Few bugs which should be sorted in the first few patches.\n3. A high end PC required as the game is graphically demanding and not exceptionally optimized.\n4. The game gave me 0 credits for completing the first tomb instead of 10000 credits I should have earned. Actually, got a popup saying "Earned 0 credits" :).

I'd describe it as VERY HIGH settings with the exception of one or two parameters.\nThis game comes into its own where the alst one failed miserably: multiplayer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiyabear/recommended/391220/","fiyabear","The Russian Mob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiyabear/","1769 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider's level design and pacing make it a masterpiece among action-adventure games. The levels are built to be replayable but doesn't make it obvious the first time through. This makes it feel like everything you do will constantly drive the game forward but never closes you off from collectibles or going back to take screenshots after the action is through, which the jaw-dropping art will make you want to do. The pacing conveys the sense of urgency mirrored in the story but speeds up and slows down effectively. Characters are developed in audio logs as well as in cinematics and interactions with Lara. This teired approach allows you to get a feeling about the characters without being overbearing. This game also brings Tomb Raider closer to it's roots after the 2013's origin story, Lara is back to treasure hunting fiend she used to be. The length of the game hit the sweet spot of ~30 hours for 100% completion run, including the Baba Yaga dlc, and can be extended through the Replay and Endurance gamemodes. Thank you to developers for such an amazing and bug-free experience. (well worth noting in this era of releasing unfinished games) I think this game is a big win for everyone involved and probably the best Tomb Raider game ever.

I loved those early games, but the sequels got stale over the years.\n\nThe 2013 Reboot was a breath of fresh air, and one of the best reboots of all time, alongside J.J. Abrahms 2009 Star Trek.  I immensely enjoyed Tomb Raider, and after owning it on PS3 (multiple playthroughs) I purchased it on a Steam sale and completed another playthrough.\n\nThis game is even better in my opinion than the 2013 Tomb Raider.  In the first game, Lara was constantly on the brink of death, always running and seemingly fighting a neverending uphill battle.  This time, it really feels like she is where she wants to be, and much more in control than in the first game.\n\nThe controls are wonderful, I use a xbox controller and it feels very nice.  The Tomb puzzles are not too tough and are completed fairly quickly, which is very good as it doesn't bog down the gameplay and keeps up the pace.  The combat is nice, and there are more weapons and options in this game than it's direct predecessor.\n\nThe combat is well paced, with very well directed set pieces throughout.  The game doesn't slow down too much, even when I take a break to hunt more deer or rabbits for the next crafting upgrade.\n\nThe Graphics.  Oh God the graphics.  This game is absolutely beautiful.  I wish I could post a screenshot in this review.  My specs aren't bleeding edge or top-end (FX8350 + GTX 970), but Geforce Experience optimised this to the High/Ultra settings and I am enjoying a very smooth 50-60FPS and every effect just looks wonderful.  The scenery is very lifelike, but what really sets the graphics apart from the pack is the lighting.  Every shaft of light and shadow is very realistic and adds a lot to the immersion of the game.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I have played about 23 hours of this game, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes adventure games.  You do not need to play the 2013 Tomb Raider (or any of the others for that matter) to get the story of this one, but I would recommend it just to see what Lara went through in the first game.  You will see what changed her from a naive and idealistic college student to a cold hearted pregmatist who will do whatever it takes to survive.\n\nPlay this game.  Now.","February 9","true","25.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It's basically more of the same as that game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since why fix what wasn't broken?  Lara's competence is established from the first game and you get to enjoy the benefits of that, as she steadily proves to allies that she can be relied on and - more importantly - to enemies that she should never be underestimated and always be feared.\n\nGraphically it looks great, the setpieces are exhilarating, the setting is interesting and it manages to hit the sweet spot when it comes to collectibles/exploration/upgrading equipment etc.  Here's to more of more of the same for some time to come.","February 10","true","34.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I would have to give it 7/10 but would still recommend it.  I had lots of fun playing it, but the more I played the more glaring issues came to light.  While they aren't game breaking they are there.\n\nPros:\n\n-Graphics are amazing\n-polished gameplay\n-great voice acting\n\nNeutral:\n-Story is a typical tomb raider.  While interesting it is sort of underwhelming.  The villains are very well done and well acted but I have issues with Lara's motivations which make no sense at some points and ridiculously selfish.  The twist with one of the charaters is seen hours before it is revealed.\n\nCons:\n- Way to easy.  I played on the second hardest difficulty and Lara is a roiling death machine.  While fun every now and then I breezed through the campaign.  The only time I really died was my own fault when I missed a jump or screwed up a quick time event.\n- The last act of the game is very similar to the final act of the first game.  Both involve fights on very similar arenas and levels.  A force of undead that sound very similar even while speaking different languages.  A long climb up a fortress.\n\nAll in all I would still recommend but I don't agree with other online reviews that gave it stellar reviews.","May 22","true","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

The new gameplay and item additions are fun to utilise, the main problem is experiencing glitches when climbing or trying to interact with certain items but these aren't game-breaking - just frustrating! The controls are otherwise simple.\n\nThe game does, however, feel super long. Compared to Tomb Raider 2013, there seems to be a lot more to do in regards to challenges, things to collect, optional missions etc, so the 100% can be tedious to some. I liked the story, but it does seem to feel less 'Tomb Raider-y' than its predecessor, built largely around conflict and not exploration. The 'evil organisation mercenary group' enemy also feels recycled from the last game.\n\nI also recommend the Endurance DLC if you like the survival-type tactics for a quick game, the score attack replays are also nice as they give you new objectives to complete - some extra stuff to play until the next game!\n\nOverall, great game. My only complaint is 'what happened to Lara's face?' ;.;","May 22","true","45.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The story wasn't bland and boring "get loot get out" like I feard it was going to be. I felt there was a purpose. The acting also was on point. I actually felt for the characters, their emotions pulled me in and breathed life into this game.\n\nAnd this game doesn't get boring or repettitive which i feel like most games recently suffer. The large map makes up for the different land scapes. One minute im in a tundra. The next im in a desert. Then into a luscious forest. Plus the bonus dungeons you can explore was the most fun and exciting part in my opinion. I loved discovering a new dungeon to explore and solve puzzles that were actually quite mind boggling at times. Then i get an ACTUAL reward for my hard work. Not some collectible that means zilch (unless you're a collector). No. I got upgrades for an arsenal of weapons.\n\nThe game play was probably my biggest (and pretty much my only complaint) i felt as though the combat was kinda meh. Hide behind cover, pop up, gun down a few baddies, rinse and repeat. And i constantly ran out of ammo in the middle of fights and had to run around like a mad man to collect some more WHILE im being shot at. Coulda been me not being efficient with my ammo, but i felt like there was nothing i could of done to improve that. Not only that, the parkour part of this game where i can run/climb up walls and use rope to scale down the terrain was pretty buggy. There was WAY too many times where i can't climb up a wall cause i wasn't pixel perfect on the climbable part of the wall. Or when i jump to slide down rope onto another platform and i completely miss the rope cause again, i wasn't pixel perfect with the jump.\n\nOverall i thoroughly enjoyed this game. Much more than i did to the first one and i LOVED that game. Easily one of the most fun games i played in years with a breath of fresh air for gameplay and captivating story. I can easily give this game a 9/10 and would recommend to both fans of the series and newcomers!","April 7","true","31.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

They got rid of that and just let her become a ragdoll.\n\nBut here is why I give it a thumbs up. It's still a fun game. The tombs, caves, puzzles are always nice to come across. It's still an ok game.\n\nDo I think it's worth full price? No. I would tell you to wait for a really huge discount. This game is probably worth maybe $25.","March 26","true","24.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Great graphics and a crazy ride of a story. The game has enough content to go around with plaenty of side missions and cards to change up the experience, while the game can be beat in just a few hours there is just a nice environment to go and explore, and no need to rush when you can just do a side mission and go kill some animals. This game is easily a 9/10 because it was a very fun single player experience and performs well on my system.

It's greatly improved from the first game while adding in great addictions that make it feel fun but not too new.\nPROS-\nLara Croft is now just a badass! Action happens pretty quickly in comparison to the first game, which doesn't make the game feel like it's repeating the same routine.\nTombs actually matter! You get perks for completing tombs, which I can't actually remember if it was a thing in Tomb Raider 1, but it definitely made raiding tombs feel a lot more necessary than before.\nHunting is actually fun, what with more types of animals and it being rewarding with crafting.\nSpeaking of which, crafting is oddly extensive and cool. You can make multiple different sets of clothes, ammuniciation, and other cool things.\nLooting is still fun.\nGun play is still exciting and somewhat tactical. I always prefer using the bow and arrow over everything else\nThis game is absolutely gorgeous. One of the best looking games of the year, easily.\n\nCons-\nThe game is extremely graphically demanding. 980's are still having trouble running this at a stable 60 max at 1080p. I'm running a mid range rig, so I had to scale the graphics down to high and lower the res. Game still looks amazing regardless.\nThe regular difficulty of this game is insanely easy so far. Way easier than it was in the original tomb raider.\nThe assault rifle/semi seems kinda bad compared to your trusty bow and arrow, shotgun, and pistol/revolver. I hardly bother with it compared to every other weapon.\n\nOverall, I'm really enjoying Rise of the Tomb Raider. It's a great sequel to a awesome game. Hopefully there's more patches in the future that'll give this game even better optimization, as I feel this game should be playable at 1080p with even mid range rigs. Regardless, I highly recommend this game.\n8.5 out of 10.","February 1","true","17.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And i had had information about this game before release. Thought it would release in late 2016 for PC. But thanks to Nixxes Team, they released it far earlier.\nThis game is like sequel to previous Tomb Raider 2013 reboot. I have played both games, but overall i love this one much more. I loved overall graphics, and visuals were just amazing. And oppositely to others, Lara's voice acting in the game was pleasure to hear.\nDuring gameplay, i didn't miss any tombs, relics, documents and etc. though i knew i would investigate them later. I tried to prevent myself from playing it too much, because i knew i was getting closer to finish this well-done story/campaign. But unfortunately, I finished it today. The End in this game when Jacob died as a mortal, was one of the episodes made a deep impression me. For me, overall score for this magnificent game is 10/10.\nLooking forward to release of new Tomb Raider, where it is expected to take place in Mexico (If you have watched the end carefully, you will understand what i am talking about).\nThaks for reading.","January 31","true","23.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Lara's face change. I mean, come on. TR 2013's face was so much better. I don't like the new round-face Lara one bit.\n3. Instead of $70, I would recommend to pay $40. For the short storyline, $70 is a bit steep.\n4. AMD's TressFX in TR 2013 is a lot better than HairWorks in this one. A lot more of a resource hog is HairWorks.\n5. The story, no matter how long it is, is a little cliched. We've seen it all before.\n6. The best parts of the game is post-campaign when you're trying to 100% it.\n\nAnyway, I recommend this game.

The story is a little predictable but it is incredibly enjoyable and extremely consistent throughout. There's some tense moments in there though and the ending is awesome, phew.

I would have to give it 7/10 but would still recommend it.  I had lots of fun playing it, but the more I played the more glaring issues came to light.  While they aren't game breaking they are there.\n\nPros:\n\n-Graphics are amazing\n-polished gameplay\n-great voice acting\n\nNeutral:\n-Story is a typical tomb raider.  While interesting it is sort of underwhelming.  The villains are very well done and well acted but I have issues with Lara's motivations which make no sense at some points and ridiculously selfish.  The twist with one of the charaters is seen hours before it is revealed.\n\nCons:\n- Way to easy.  I played on the second hardest difficulty and Lara is a roiling death machine.  While fun every now and then I breezed through the campaign.  The only time I really died was my own fault when I missed a jump or screwed up a quick time event.\n- The last act of the game is very similar to the final act of the first game.  Both involve fights on very similar arenas and levels.  A force of undead that sound very similar even while speaking different languages.  A long climb up a fortress.\n\nAll in all I would still recommend but I don't agree with other online reviews that gave it stellar reviews.","May 22","true","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

The new gameplay and item additions are fun to utilise, the main problem is experiencing glitches when climbing or trying to interact with certain items but these aren't game-breaking - just frustrating! The controls are otherwise simple.\n\nThe game does, however, feel super long. Compared to Tomb Raider 2013, there seems to be a lot more to do in regards to challenges, things to collect, optional missions etc, so the 100% can be tedious to some. I liked the story, but it does seem to feel less 'Tomb Raider-y' than its predecessor, built largely around conflict and not exploration. The 'evil organisation mercenary group' enemy also feels recycled from the last game.\n\nI also recommend the Endurance DLC if you like the survival-type tactics for a quick game, the score attack replays are also nice as they give you new objectives to complete - some extra stuff to play until the next game!\n\nOverall, great game. My only complaint is 'what happened to Lara's face?' ;.;","May 22","true","45.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Lara is now in search of the Divine Source, the relic of immortality, as is the illuminati-like group Trinity. The game is very similar in mechanics and playstyle, being a linear driven story with open world exploration with an almost absurd amount of collectibles, however being Tomb Raider that is part of the fun, exploring.\n\nThe combat is extremely similar with a new mechanic being introduced, the on the fly crafting and resource gathering for offensive and healing purposes. The similarities are not only in the gameplay and combat, but also in the tombs and puzzles, the only difference being the puzzles seem to have gotten easier to a point where figuring this optional tombs puzzle is as simple as shooting a rope arrow and turning a crank, congrats! you figured out how to use the controls.\n\nThe downsides being the overly simplified puzzles and the DLC is not great, an hr long story DLC, and two challenge  modes that arn't particular spectacular.\n\nOverall the game is amazing, fun gameplay and exploration, amazing combat finishers and the return of the brutal Lara deaths. Extremely cinematic with amazing visuals and extremely fun running sequences where everything is falling apart as you leap from crumbling collums to a swinging peice of scaffolding to land onto a cable, only after sustaining wounds that would kill any normal human, as Lara does. 9/10.","April 24","true","33.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I like you but I don't "like you" like you.\n\nThe game is visually stunning. But being the sequel to the 2013 Tomb Raider, that's all it has improved on. The story is very cliche. You will feel like you've been down this adventure before if you've played any games like this or watched any movies. The exploration, doesn't feel as much fun as it did for me in the original.\n\nOne of the things I loved about the original, the death animations when Lara died from falling off a cliff or something. They got rid of that and just let her become a ragdoll.\n\nBut here is why I give it a thumbs up. It's still a fun game. The tombs, caves, puzzles are always nice to come across. It's still an ok game.\n\nDo I think it's worth full price? No. I would tell you to wait for a really huge discount.

It's greatly improved from the first game while adding in great addictions that make it feel fun but not too new.\nPROS-\nLara Croft is now just a badass! Action happens pretty quickly in comparison to the first game, which doesn't make the game feel like it's repeating the same routine.\nTombs actually matter! You get perks for completing tombs, which I can't actually remember if it was a thing in Tomb Raider 1, but it definitely made raiding tombs feel a lot more necessary than before.\nHunting is actually fun, what with more types of animals and it being rewarding with crafting.\nSpeaking of which, crafting is oddly extensive and cool. You can make multiple different sets of clothes, ammuniciation, and other cool things.\nLooting is still fun.\nGun play is still exciting and somewhat tactical. I always prefer using the bow and arrow over everything else\nThis game is absolutely gorgeous. One of the best looking games of the year, easily.\n\nCons-\nThe game is extremely graphically demanding. 980's are still having trouble running this at a stable 60 max at 1080p. I'm running a mid range rig, so I had to scale the graphics down to high and lower the res. Game still looks amazing regardless.\nThe regular difficulty of this game is insanely easy so far. Way easier than it was in the original tomb raider.\nThe assault rifle/semi seems kinda bad compared to your trusty bow and arrow, shotgun, and pistol/revolver. I hardly bother with it compared to every other weapon.\n\nOverall, I'm really enjoying Rise of the Tomb Raider. It's a great sequel to a awesome game. Hopefully there's more patches in the future that'll give this game even better optimization, as I feel this game should be playable at 1080p with even mid range rigs. Regardless, I highly recommend this game.\n8.5 out of 10.","February 1","true","17.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only problem I had with that game was that it gave the impression of survival, while also wanting to be a high adrealine action game - so in the early game, it was survival, then it quickly ramped up to action movie.\n\nThis game has the same problem - however I can look past it because we have already been through the first game, So Lara should be, as is a bit more hardened.\n\nSo - gameplay. What do I think? Well I honestly think that this game improves upon everything that Tomb Raider had. You now get to be sneaky in most combat situations, so you feel a bit more free in how you approach things. The optional dungeons are massive - and it generarily feels a lot more like a Tomb Raider experience.\nThe story feels  a bit dull - not exactly amazing. I really enjoy the whole "Language" thing - "You can't read this until you've learned more about the language".. Nice to see language play a role in a game.\n\nMy only downside really so far is that you can't change up the difficulty, at least not from Seasoned raider (the second hardest) to survival. Which is dumb; So if you're uncertain, start the game in the highest diffuclty, and then go down if it's too hard.","January 30","true","19.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Anyone who knows me knows I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and rage at games very easily and this is probably the least I've raged at a game. It's not that it's absurdly easy - it is, for the record. It's that the puzzles and tombs and platforming in this game were all very organic and logical and there is never a moment where you're wondering where the hell to go.\n\nCD seems to have taken a lot of inspiration from other games like Last of Us with the realtime crafting of explosives and ammo, and all of the new game mechanics mesh wonderfully with the old without feeling like they were added just for the sake of not trying to repeat TR2013 again. For example you collect magnesite to craft exploding arrows, or you can craft them with grenades, and the generic supply system of 2013 has been replaced with one that actually requires specific items from the environment/animals to make certain items or upgrades.\n\nStory is about as good as it gets with a Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones storyline and again Crystal Dynamics has put some work into making Lara feel like a relatable, actual person as opposed to the original Tomb Raider franchise.\n\nThe graphics are spectacular, on par with Witcher 3 if not better - especially when it comes to the effects. The hair physics is still completely borked though. You'll randomly see Lara's hair fly off to one side for no reason when there isn't even that much wind, for example, or it will just start moving around at weird angles. It's not much more than a hilarious little detail.\n\nThe weapon arsenal isn't much to talk about but you get about 4 weapons per category and they can all be customized with multiple tiers of upgrades, to better kick ♥♥♥ with.  Skill trees from the last game are back too with some slight changes, overall it feels like the same game but with a lot less time spent whining and crying around an island, and more time getting to the action.\n\nThis time around the awesome CG intro has been swapped out for a playable prologue that has some of the best visuals in the game, and everything stays entertaining from there until the end.\n\nMy only realy complaint is that they said there would be more tombs in this game. The only way that statement is true is if you count every tiny little alcove and cave as a tomb, because I can't remember any of them being longer than any tomb in the previous game, or harder, except the part where you are climbing on the moving observatory parts. There weren't more tombs, it's that simple, but they at least shifted the focus off of murdering everything that breathes and back towards the story and exploring the environment. To the extent that they could.\n\nWould buy again.","February 6","true","39.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For example, there are more weapons, gadgets, larger map, varried enemies including wildlife, varried ways to defeat enemies, and a great number of things to do aside from the main quest including Tomb Raiding (finally) and one dimensional side quests, and by one dimensional I mean one tier under Bethesda-level quests given that as of late Bethesda\'s quests have been rather inadequate by RPG standards.\n\nThere is great freedom to complete objectives in a many number of ways however the player sees fit. For example, when faced with a puzzle, the player can complete it in several ways (i.e there is no single way the puzzle can be completed, but there is a single correct answer, which is understandably limiting but still a touch of liberty on the developer\'s part). Another example is the player\'s choice to complete objectives stealthily by assassinating enemies, avoiding enemies, or slaughter anything that moves, while still mainitaing Lara\'s vulnerability and feminine stature, while not using her as a sex toy.\n\nThe only limitations is slight stuttering or framrate drop in some areas/cutscenes which detract from the brilliant story campaign, and a limited number of other modes aside from exploration (there is a challenge mode, but its rather repetitive)  but other than that it is a must play for adventure gamers.\n\n8.5/10","May 31","true","41.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

You can craft ammo from junk that you forage in the middle of a firefight.  This is neither fun nor realistic.  I have no idea why they added this feature.\n\nMy main criticisms remain:  The game is \"casualized\" and almost never offers a situation that needs either skill or creativity to master.  I am playing through the 2nd hardest difficulty including challenge tombs without ever having any difficulties anywhere -- I am 3/4th of the way through now, and my motivation to keep playing is diminishing.\n\n\nIf you have not played the original reboot, and you want a pretty but still relatively \"weak sauce\" Uncharted for PC, play that one first -- it is a bit better.\n\n(Disclaimer: I am not a journalist but I was gifted the key from a colleague for free.)","June 1","true","16.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I disagree. Yes it has one of the most stunning graphics ever made in a game but doesn't go much further.\n\nThe story is SO much worse. It's predictable with little to no mistery and the development has little pace differences. To make things worse, the scenarios and dangers that Lara goes through feels all the same: insane elevated areas that keep falling apart and too much shooting. I miss the intriguing puzzles from older tomb raiders. This scenario would be perfect for a lot of good puzzles.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty similar but actually got worse because they added so many scattered items all over. I usually enjoy crafting mechanics but the gather and craft gameplay feels like it doesn't belong in this fast paced adventure making it feeling like a chore.

The story is highly derivative of pretty much any adventure movie that has ever been made; from Lara's daddy issues to the absolute rip off of Lost Ark style ending and just doesn't do anything worthwhile.  I can't say the narrative promotes character growth for Lara either because there is a massive disconnect between the gameplay and the narrative.  The story wants you to see the Rise of the Tomb Raider, but Lara pretty much from start to finish is girl-Rambo.  She has sacrificed all of her distinctive style from the previous games to become a Call of Duty soldier, who without any real experience or training, can demolish entire armies on her own.  As an example, there is a historical depiction where the assassin sent by Trinity and chasing the prophet details how he managed to kill one of the deathless of Kitezh but barely survived it, however this comes after Lara has killed at least a half dozen of the "deathless" already.  So the story wasn't very good, and the gameplay didn't back up the story. Lara at no point struggled with becoming a mass murdering eff-head as the narrative wanted to depict.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics were also too loose and not well designed enough.  Often for no reason Lara would fall off of a ledge or wall she was hanging on to, or just not catch or grapple axe the target.  Combat was sloppy, with dodge counters appearing somewhat randomly when dodging instead of consistantly, but none of it really mattered as there was almost no real challenge in the combat anyway.  On a totally subjective scale, I didn't really find any of the combat mechanics; not stealth, not melee, not shooting, to be much fun in this game.  The stealth was very rudimentary.  Also the extreme overuse of set piece battles and overly specific ways of defeating anything except the basic footsoldiers just sucked all the creativity and fun out of combat.  As much as the game tried to feel sandboxy, it was railroaded in all aspects. The skill trees weren't even decisions, just check boxes, since you could get pretty much everyhting you wanted from all of them. The final battle was essentially a cutscene QTE against Konstantin.\n\nI don't usually care much about graphic stuff, almost everything these days I find to be good enough for my tastes, but there was something seriously wrong with the optimization, if there was any done, on the PC.  The game was in a near constant state of frame rate drop the entire time.\n\nThe game on the whole was just not very good.  There was a ton of hype about it, likely because female protagonist Lara Croft is super appealing with SJW's and liberal PC politics right now, which is cool, but not without a solid game backing it up, which just isn't present here.  Tomb Raider and Lara Croft have lost something of what made them both unique and interesting in this new series, I can only hope the devs can find there way back to making these properties great again.","February 14","false","63.0"," 27 of 55 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","27","55","2","0"

Infact, I think this game went a step backwards or two. The combat is still somewhat solid but the game is quite easy even on Seasoned Raider difficulty (Second-hardest difficulty in the game by the way). The story is bland and boring and the tombs are still ♥♥♥♥ing optional though they did improve them a little in this game.\n\nThe graphics when maxed out look absolutely gorgeous. Sadly, Nixxes (The ones who did the excellent PC ports of Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Tomb Raider 2013) dropped the ball for this pc port. Even when lowering it down to medium-low graphics, the game ran like ♥♥♥♥ for the most part. There's also two specific areas in the game that are so badly optimized that my FPS dropped down to the low 20s and stayed there and to be honest, the areas in this game aren't that much more detailed than in the 2013 game.\n\nSpeaking of the areas, Siberia was not as interesting as the island in the first game and wears out its welcome in the first few hours in the game. I honestly thought the prologue chapter starts off a little promising but then starts to lose it slowly when you get to Siberia. In this game, there are NPCs that give you quests but they are mainly just bland fetch-quests which give you some decent rewards that you might need if you're gonna get certain weapon upgrades and stuff. These quests also bog down the pacing greatly and makes the game a slog at times. Honestly, they should cut the metroidvania stuff since it doesn't work very well in these games and they should go back to the variety of different locations in the previous games.\n\nThankfully, they heavily toned down the QTEs in this game as there are only a few in the very beginning of the game and the very end and they finally fixed the button prompts so that you can actually see which button you are supposed to press. There's also much less combat this time around for the most part until the end which then they just drag on and ♥♥♥♥ing on and you just want it to end. Like the previous game, the combat is just your standard over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter that you've seen in the last couple of years.\n\nThere is still hand-holding even when you turn off survival instints and that show game prompts option or whatever its called. Lara doesn't shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and gives you hints while you're doing the puzzles and the puzzles themselves are not any harder than the ones in the 2013 game. The tombs themselves are slightly better designed this time around but most of them are still easy to do for the most part.\n\nThe platforming is still as simplified as the one in the 2013 game aside from a new tool or two that spices up the platforming a bit. There is quite a bit more exploration this time around but the areas themselves as I said before, are not that interesting to explore in the first place. Also, why are there no dual-pistol badass old-school Lara moments like they promised at the end of the first game? They just rehash the whole Lara becoming a survivor theme all over again but with no "OH MAH GOD, I KILLED SOMEONE" dialogue (Thankfully).\n\nOverall, Rise of the Tomb Raider is a disappointing sequel that doesn't really improve all that much from the first game. If you want more of the same stuff, this game will give you some enjoyment out of it but if you were expecting this game to go back to its roots and see Lara become the Tomb Raider we all know and love, then you will be pretty disappointed.","February 10","false","23.5"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","17","35","4","5"

READ THE TITLE OF THE GAME, IT IS.\n\n\nLet's start placing the game: we've a 80% snow adventure and a 20% of enviroment variation but we've to say that that's totally normal because we are in Syberia, Russia.\n\nWhat are we going to find? Our expected secuel? Yes, we are going to find an adventorous Lara SPOILER: 	looking for his father reason to "commit suicide" (F*CK YOU ANNA), that's the thing that Lara's to discover\n\nDoes this story has any kind of sense? Yes, totally yes. I'm agree with the fact of "Tomb Raider 2013 has a veeery stupid history, it's not bad but it's not great" but this story is different. Why? Because it's a perfect story to continue our actual storyline from the young Lara and then, become the classic and iconic Lara. There's no reason to hate this story because it has a lot of sense and it is very deep and fully of flashbacks that will help us understand the mind of Lara during the story. Also, I've to say that the characters are simply great and friendly, you're going to fall in love (or hate them) with them for sure.\n\nGraphics? I've played the game in custom settings but with a medium-graphic preset so yes, I've played it on mediums and dear reader, it's such a masterpiece. It looks simply great with all those INSANE character models and ilumination, also, you feel like you're in the middle of Syberia.\n\nIs still Lara inmoral? Yes, expected question. Sometimes you see an Idiana Jones or a Nathan Drake but guys, we know that Lara is better than those two c*nts (fanboy opinion :P)\n\nDoes it work fine? The game works fine but there's FPS drops in a few cinematics, but this is going to be patched for sure (I'm writting this the 1st of January 2016)\n\nIs it hard? For me it was easier than Tomb Raider 2013 and that's a little disgusting. If you were an active Tomb Raider fan in PS2, ... you're going to find it very easy.\n\nWhat about microtransactions? To everyone who says that you have to spend extra money on the game: you are a lier. You don't have to pay an extra money in order to play the game correctly, you'll only have to buy those two DLCs if you want to complete all the archievements on the game (bad aspect) but it won't interfere in the main storyline of the game. Also, you can buy cards in the extra gamemode (free gamemode, it's part of the game, not a DLC) with real money or CREDITS FROM THE GAME WHICH ARE RECEIVED JUST BY PLAYING THE GAME (there's also card that you get if you own, for example, Life Is Strange, another Crystal Dinamics game)\n\nHow long is it? I've spent 11'2 hours to complete the game with a 61% in one run. Now it's time to get all the archievements which are not easy as they look. It's not short but it's not as long as a game like Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain but we can't compare these two games.\nIt's long enough and, if you want to buy the Baba Yaga DLC, you'll have 3 more hours of game.\n\nFINAL NOTE: As a good Tomb Raider fan I'm going to give a 9'75 and consider it a must-play game in the videogame history because it's the continue of the reborn from the ashes of a mithic and an iconic saga.\n\nGood stuff:\nHistory\nGeneral optimization\nGraphics\nGame mechanics\nCharacters\nMap\nLong enough\nBad stuff:\nBad optimization only in a few parts of the game (most of them cinematics)\nDifficult?

But with a lot more adrenaline. You (a younger Lara Croft) are climbing snowy siberian mountains, dive into long forgotten ancient sewers (yikes) collect old relicts and fight competing mercenary-vault hunters in the search of eternal life. All the while it is mixed with some ( not too many ) quick time events. And if normal or hard difficulty is way to easy for you ...go try the survival mode. Yes, it's exactly what you think it is. Hunt deer and make shelters to survive. The controls are well designed and feel almost natural.\n\nGraphics 9 of 10\n\nThis makes the game really really shine. They are simply breathtaking, from the blazing sun in the desert in Syria to the glistening snow in Siberia. Old murky water actually looks exactly the way it should look. The rays of light, the little animals that surround you in Syria..it's just unbelievable how good and smooth it actually looks. Oh and by the way, it's absolutely bug and glitch free (at least it was to me). Ahem ...I'm not looking at you Batman: Arkham Knight\n\nSound  8.5 of 10\n\nThe Sound was okay. Typical Tomb Raider stuff, nicely integrated into the game, without distracting from the game. Yet, slightly less important than the other categories. Solid work though.\n\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nDefinitely a must-buy. Even if you are not a real fan of the series. This game deserves to be bought or at least rented. I can guarantee you will have a ton of fun with the game, wether it's puzzle solving, treasure hunting, or else.

The environments of Siberia aren't as beautiful or interesting to explore as the exotic japanese island, the difficulty feels toned down as you get quicker access to weapons with which to devastate your enemies, and several of the plot developments feel a little lame ("my long-lost friend! You just showed up in time to be kidnapped!") or very telegraphed ("this NPC is getting a lot of screentime, I wonder if he's plot important!").\n\nMore importantly, though, the concept and charm of seeing Lara grow up in the first game is gone. She's no longer an innocent archaeologist coming to terms with how brutal the world is: after the events of the first game she's already a veteran killer. Worse, what moves her is an obsession with her dead father rather than something that the player can easily empathize with, like surviving and escaping a cursed island.\n\nAfter over 20 hours of play I simply got bored and gave up.","May 9","false","24.1"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

If you're okay with spending $60 for a 12 hour game, this game would be perfect for you, 8.5/10.\n\n\n\n\nThe game itself is great, however as for other single player games, this would be a hard fought victory to consider it worth your money. I played the game on the default difficulty, fully taking my time and completing some of the optional challenge tombs, and the game only took me 11 1/2 hours to complete. Hours may vary depending on the difficulty, however I do not see it exceeding 16 hours for the main story on even the highest difficulty.\n\nThere also isn't much to do in the post game to extend playtime. There are a few other side quests and challenge tombs to be completed, however the challenge tombs arent interesting enough to keep my attention and the quests are a bit tedious.\n\nI personally bought the game for $40 and thought that was an aboslute steal of a deal, however after calculating it myself, I conclude that although even that being 33% cheaper than the list price, it still isn't worth it, unless of course you plan on 100%-ing the game.\n\n\nMain story: 11 hours (plus extras 15-20 hours (100% 30 hours))\nGraphics: 9/10 (Feb 2016)\nStory: 8\nGameplay: 9/10\nBugs/glitches: -2 (can be retracted as bugs are fixed)\n\nMain Story: $11\nGraphics: $4\nStory: $4.5\nGameplay: $4.25\nBugs/glitches: -$2 (can be retracted as bugs are fixed)\n\nTotal: Worth $21.75 ($26-$41 based off hours)","February 5","false","14.0"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

I was somewhat disappointed after playing the game myself. While they point out the high ratings from IGN and Game informer, I myself cannot believe that these ratings were legit.\n\nThe story was decent, but I miss the danger that was thrown at you frequently in Tomb Raider (2013), Yet it doesn't really connect with each other, and it would've made more sense if you ask me. What even happened with the crew from the first game? The only one that seemed to return is Jonah, but where is the rest? Lara's immortality already gifted her for not freezing to death or surviving a dozen gunshots to the face. While in The first one you could easily die after being injured.\n\nThe upgrades and tools that have been added are fun to use, but I wish that there were more interesting ways to achieve them.\nThe game's ending was also very disappointing, and even after the credits, it just looks as if they are hinting towards another sequel. Whether or not this is real - I leave up to the others...\n\nBut again, the game's ending felt like a flop, not even an intense boss battle, oh no. Instead, you face off against a helicopter which is way too easy to destroy. While in the reboot you had to fight off a stormgarurd that was eager to smash your face in.\n\nThe open world is beautiful and it contains a lot of detail. But as luck would take it, graphic card only for the ultimate are able to enjoy the full extend. While we are forced to lower our settings for a stable fps, with no luck. Forcing me to play at a rough 50 fps, with a resolution of 1024x720. so if a GTX 750 TI 2GB doesn't help along, then I don't know what is wrong with games these days. Weird, cause Tomb Raider Reboot ran smooth as butter on high quality settings, but whatever, this is up to the developers.\n\nI guess I can say that I enjoyed playing, but at the same time I wished for a more challenging experience, instead of repeating the same things over and over again.\n","January 31","false","33.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","2"

However, I want to give the most honest non-biased opinion over the game that I can.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider. Strange title, maybe they were trying to be cool and give it a Christopher Nolan BATMAN title. Lara Croft neither rises or raids that many tombs in this game, so don't be confused by the title.\n\nFans of the original TOMB RAIDER series should feel upset yet satisfied with the direction of the series. The current direction of the game is both good and bad for Lara Croft.\n\nOn one hand we have a new generation of gamers that are very interested in the game now with the impressive graphics and addicting gameplay elements of collecting stuff while playing as a very sexy, yet ridiculously short, hero named Lara Croft.\n\nOn the other hand we have a game that completely alienates the old fans by removing itself almost entirely from the original gameplay that we grew up with and loved. Gone are the days of exploring massive tombs and solving puzzles that required some critical thinking skills. The atmosphere of being lost in an ancient tomb scavenging for survival.\n\nTOMB RAIDER now is a very, VERY casual friendly Easter Egg hunt game with little to no threats. There is ZERO suspense from not wanting to fall to your death from a poorly timed jump and having to revert back to an old checkpoint crystal. Now, you kill Lara just for fun or with lack of concern but you spawn immediately in the same spot. The risk of death is completely zero.\n\nIt doesn't even do the Easter Egg hunt thing very well anyways. Most of the time you're trying to unlock everything the game drops in something that says you don't have the right materials to explore forcing you to back track, if you even remember where the Hell it was to began with. It's not natural or well thought out, the level design is terrible because of this. No matter the fancy graphics, this is frustrating beyond means being forced to back track during natural progression areas with invisible walls.\n\nThey're starting to take the story a bit too seriously. I would really like to see games start to use some comedic relief. The story in Rise of the Tomb Rider starts to become white noise, especially when Lara Croft talks to herself at every camp fire or when you pick up treasure scrolls with story that is usually unremarkable or uninteresting.\n\nThe graphics are  beautiful but is not optimized in the current build.  My GTX 980 stutters in the large map areas like the Soviet Installation. I eventually have to just turn it down to HIGH settings and switch back to VERY HIGH depending on the area I'm in. Sometimes I get 120 FPS on VERY HIGH and strangely for no apparent reason it starts to chug along at 20 FPS for no reason at all.\n\nThe combat is boring and non-challenging. I would rather be fighting large beasts, not dudes with guns. This is Tomb Raider, quit trying to be like Uncharted. Shooting dudes in the early TOMB RAIDER's wasn't fun either.\n\nThe few amount of Tombs are far too easily to figure out and some are short and uninspired. Each tomb treasure is the exact same model of a sliding book thing with some useless ability you really don't need.\n\nYou spend the majority of the game running in circles pressing right-stick in or whatever button you use to that will detect objects in Lara Croft vision. The annoying thing is sometimes it doesn't trigger and you have to spam the button because it turns itself off after you start moving. If I had an ability in this game that will keep Lara Croft vision turned on forever, I'd be one happy dude.\n\nThe outfit selection is boring and I think the community would like to see some original outfits return or a customization option to fine-tune how you want her to look.\n\nLara Croft has a beautiful animated in-game model but that's about the only thing positive I can say about the game. Well I think the ENDURANCE DLC mod has some potential but it still falls pretty flat in its current state.\n\nSadly, I think it's time to reboot TOMB RAIDER again already or bury the franchise.","February 5","false","19.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"
