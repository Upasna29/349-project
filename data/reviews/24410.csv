I bought this game through a Christmas sale one year but didn't play it right away. I finally got around to playing this and I'm extremely glad I did. It's a solid game and it doesn't try to be more than what it is, a great RTS. I thoroughly enjoy the time period in which this takes place and the true history behind the story within the game. It plays really well and I never once had any issues with crashes or glitches. I did also enjoy the option to restart a mission without a penalty against me. I actually "cheated" a little in this game to earn extra gold at the beginning of each mission (editing the .sav file through a hex editor). Even with doing this I fould the game still very challenging but very rewarding. The last mission was diffcult but I feel it really capped off the game well. It was what your army was fighting for throughout the game and it was a very satisfying end to a solid game.\n\n+ Focused on what it does best and didn't try to do to much\n+ For a game that is over 5 years old the graphics weren't that bad\n+ Challenging but rewarding in the same token\n- Enemy sigh seemed to reach further then your own (some missions this was extremely frustrating)\n","December 1, 2014","true","27.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","0"

The gameplay itself is great, but I'd rather just buy Rome Total War and not have to deal with the camera issues. The combat in the game is superior to that of RTW. If the camera is fixed, then this will be more cometitive with RTW.","July 13, 2014","true","1.6"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"
