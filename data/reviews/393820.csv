With the sheer amount of garbage that is classsified under Early Access, saying a game is too early even for Early Access feels pretty damning and yet perfect for At The Mountains Of Madness. There's a lot of jumbled thoughts to put together, so let's break it down into points.\n\n-The actual performance is terrible, sitting at about 22 frames on average. However, when I loaded my game after dying in the middle of talking to an NPC, the game dropped to a stubborn, stable 5 frames for no discernible reason. Turning down the graphics had no effect on the frame rate either time, just made the game look even worse. Of course, this is something that could be fixed in Early Access via optimization, but it leaves the initial impression that the developers have no idea how to go about doing that.\n\n-The voice acting is worse than abysmal. Likely recorded by the devlopers and their friends, all of the spoken dialogue sounds like non-english speakers phonetically reading dialogue off a paper. This could be placeholder dialogue again, but based on the budget it seems unlikely that the developers will be able to replace it with different voice actors more familiar with english. Perhaps it would have been better to record it in the native language with subtitles?\n\n-The gameplay is pretty awful and bland so far. There's no explanation of the health, or what the white flashing that kills you is supposed to mean. I thought it was freezing to death, since you can collect firewood and start fires, but eating a can of beans made it stop so who knows. Once you collect the plot mandatory flashlight and walking stick and get into the main gameplay, you're dumped in a dark, hideous looking ice cave. You need to find a fossil (which was just floating in mid air) and a hammer to extract it (from the air I guess?). This seems like the majority of the entire game, going into increasingly larger caves to find these fossils. It looks like there's eventually combat, but I can't imagine it being much fun at these stuttering frame rates.\n\n-The developers themselves. While this isn't immediately tied to the quality of the game, with Early Access the developers become much more important for determing whether the game will be able to improve. These developers seem a bit over enthusiastic for what was apparently originally a school project, claiming above that they're confident they already have a solid game here. Furthermore, I was banned from the game's forum for pointing out that deleting threads (or creating a Trash section to dump them in) with criticism is a pitiful, cowardly tactic that is frequently employed by indie developers on Steam who can't face criticism of their pet project/money laundering scheme. That's one thing that immediately removes any positivity or leniency for a developer, and the same is true here.\n\n-It's not fun. Ultimately this is the big problem that it boils down to. There was never an enjoyable moment in what I played, never a time when I went "Huh, that's neat." This felt a lot like many of the free Unreal Engine and Unity engine messes that I've tried, cobbled together from a pile of assets without any real design philosophy or concern for coherence. It's a real shame, because I'm always looking forward to a good game based on Lovecraft's works, rather than just inspired by them. But At The Mountains of Madness isn't one of them, and likely won't be for a year or more, or perhaps never. Save your money, wait for The Sinking City for a quality H.P. Lovecraft game.\n\nIt's bad, and it likely won't get better without being a mostly different game from what's here. I'm refunding this, and I suggest you stay far away too.\n\nHere's my first and last time with it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0QuJLp8QHY","March 27","false","0.9"," 67 of 74 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","67","74","4","4"

I originally bought this game in July of last year through Indie Game Stand as their deal of the day and paid one dollar for it. I didn't play it because it was, at the time at least, an early beta build and I figured I'd wait it out a bit and see.\n\nSince it was added to Steam today I went and checked, and was able to get the game key. I've always been a fan of Lovecraftian Horror, so this seemed pretty awesome and I used the key and downloaded the game. My very early first impressions?\n\nIt is not very well put together. The game just begins with a cutscene, and there's a car that has no wheels and just appears to hover: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=653795450\nThe voice acting is VERY foreign, which isn't  bad thing, but it's difficult to understand the broken English. Also...hitting the jump button transports you to the phantom zone.\n\nNo, really. You jump in the game with the controller (Keyboard works fine) and it sends you to this fog-like wasteland where you can't do anything other than restart you game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=653795462\nIt's part of my library now, and I'll idle it for the cards....but it is certainly not worth the price right now. Even though I paid a dollar, this feels like I wasted that money because since July the game is STILL a buggy, unoptimized mess.\n\nI can't recommend it right now. At all. Maybe never. I'll consider a change to the review when (or if) they improve the game. But really...first order is fix the jump button...that's not just a bug, but a glaring game breaking error.\n\nI have no idea how long the game has been in full development, but this current version is just...an embarrassment.","March 25","false","6.5"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","40","49","0","12"

This game doesn't need polishing; it needs to be functional first.\n\nHere are some of the issues I encountered:\n\nDuring my play through my character would progress to Chapter 4 in the story, take a few steps out of a cabin, and suddenly be in Chapter 2 again. Save files won't load, movement controls for keyboard are slow and tank-like, and the flashlight you find barely lights up a wall let alone portions of a hallway. Cut scenes are poorly rendered and make no sense, dialogue boxes won't disappear from the screen unless you reboot the game repeatedly, and several people I streamed this for on twitch complained of motion sickness from the ♥♥♥♥ poor frame rate. After CHapter 4 the frame rate got so bad my game went into the menu screen and froze.\n\nThe list goes on, but if you want to find out more read the discussion forums before committing your cash to this one. Make sure to check the discussion sub forums for feedback too because they are deleting posts and banning people giving negative feedback. I want to see a great HP Lovecraft game as much as the next fan, but trust me when I say it's better to wait and make sure the project can overcome the current crop of issues.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFyif6M_P-o","March 26","false","1.7"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","37","46","3","0"

I am fully aware that this is an Early Access title, but don't lie about its current state (unless this is truly what you consider a "solid enough game"). As a result, I'm unable to give you any proper feedback on the game itself, because the loading times are endless and the framerate is way too low. There's definitely potential in the idea, so don't waste it just to get some quick cash... followed by a bundle of negative reviews and refund requests. That's gonna make it difficult to sell when you DO have a completed game.\n\nIf you're serious about this title, patch it up properly or pull it from Steam until it's stable enough for Early Access.","March 26","false","0.5"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","1"

I usually like to cut a game in EA some slack, but I was under the impression that this game was very early into its development. Apparently, it isn't, and the current state seems to be quite advanced in the view of the developers, and I just don't think that that is a fair assessment.\n\nHere are my issues:\n- The game performs horribly. I am aware that optimization doesn't usually happen until the very late stages of development, and it might improve the performance, but right now, it runs terribly on a system that can run many current or very recent triple A-titles (Division, Witcher 3, GTAV, Hitman etc.) at medium to high settings. Motion blur, horrible framerate.\n- The voice-acting is terrible, and if this is more than a placeholder, is a big minus, as atmosphere is so important in HPL-games IMO, and this ruins any immersion.\n- Load times\n- Invisible walls that kept me from climbing even slight inclines, which felt odd.\n- Floating objects. If you look at, say, a can of beans on a shipping box, it floats.\n- Weird textures... the tents look like some silvery river surface. I guess they're supposed to look wet and frozen, but it just looks like some weird T1000-thingy. Same for a hut close to the starting area, which looks like the ghost of a hut, very unfinished.\n- Lack of explanation for things\n- I am not sure, but I read that the later game will involve quite a lot of fighting, which to me, kills the immersion. Yes, there was a bit of action in MOM (the novella), but it should be only a small aspect, where story, setting and atmosphere should be the focus.\n- Weird animations\n- Save game bug...where saving won't work, and puts you back to the start when you try to load. According to the devs, this is only on the first map, but there are reports of it bugging out later too.\n\nI am sorry, but if this is considered close to being ready for release, it really deserves a downrating, especially at the current prize... I don't mind big problems in an EA game if I know it's the very early stages, but 18 EUR to get into EA for a game that has severe performance issues and other bugs just isn't ok.\n\nI will keep an eye on this, and hope it can get improved a lot, as in another half a year or year of changes to the performance, layout, voice acting, mechanics, UI etc. If it does perform better eventually, I might change my review, but right now, this just isn't worth the money they ask for, and if a game based on such an atmospheric story is turned into a shooter or combat-focused game, I, as a longtime-HPL-fan, will stay away for good.","March 31","false","0.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","2"

Most direction in game is done by dialogue and appearing text boxes, and while in some games this may function, the grammar, pronunciation, and spelling of said text is so laughably bad that the player has no idea what is going on most of the time! As stated in earlier reviews, survival is maintained throughout by occasionally standing near fires, but for some bizarre reason, eating a can of beans immediately saves the player from hypothermia. I can't investigate Lake's camp because after a ride in an invisible plane, I glitched through a mound of snow. Also, the player at times needs items like dynamite in order to progress in the game, but there is no way back on occasion (for some reason) and no way to tell in advance that these things will be needed, forcing the player to restart their game. Items (and planes) tend to appear and disappear when the game is reloaded, and characters like a guy looking exactly like the lead singer from Sabaton (makes sense, considering the voice acting sounds like a Swedish ESL class) will follow the player randomly on occasion, along with various dogs.\n\nAll in all, I think this game would be a lot better with some clearer objective instructions and intelligible dialogue.","April 11","false","1.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"
