At first I let them play until they had discovered what I already knew while I sat quietly and watched them complete 5 endings before trying to press the Red button more than twice (They exploded in laughter when they did it hahaha). Then when they had already discovered all I knew, it was time to get serious, I took out the notes I already had on the things I wasn't able to complete yet. Brainstorming took place. Random sucessful inputs were made. Mindblowing moments. Searching "Ostap Bender" on wikipedia and discovering it was actually a character. Searching numbers as date, getting Red Army related wiki. Translating numbers to words. Both meaningless. We completed the game in 5 hours. Exhausted we hailed that afternoon as one of the best things we could have chosen to do.

There are tons of pop culture references that appeal to the gaming demographic (Illuminati, satanism, Papers Please, and the Stanley Parable to name a few), but if you are looking for any logical explanation why your button presses cause these endings, you are out of luck.\n\nThe UglyThere are hints as to how you reach the endings, some hints are quite easy, others are almost impossible to understand without a guide. Problem is, if you use a guide you lose all feeling of accomplishment, and if you don't use a guide, you will get very frustrated. For example, one ending is only achievable if you do a specific thing exactly at midnight, meaning you need to reset your computer clock for this. How was I ever supposed to guess such a thing? Other endings require a massive commitment of time clicking a button 276 times for one ending, and clicking that same button 666 times for another is just not my idea of fun. God forbid that you missed the hint for this from another ending, or clicked one time too many. In that case you would have to do this all over again.","June 17, 2015","false","1.6"," 132 of 189 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","132","189","5","2"

That's how I would describe Please, Don't Touch Anything. It's really worth your time and nerves.\nDeveloper: Four Quarters\nPublisher: BulkyPix, Plug In Digital\nRelease Date: 26th March, 2015\n\nLet me start of by saying this. There’s so much one could talk about yet so little.\nTo be quite honest you shouldn’t even read any Reviews because reading just a tiny bit ‘bout this wonderfully crafted game would turn into a huge spoiler so … FLY YOU FOOL!\n\nPlease, Don’t Read Anything!\nIn case you’re still here … this game is perfect for someone like you who refuses to listen.\n\nNow let’s get this Review going!\n\nStory...?\nYour Co-Worker left. Claiming he needs to use the bathroom. No big deal’s what you might be thinking so you’re sitting there and looking around the room just to pass time since you’re not supposed to touch anything. But then all of a sudden … you see this big ol’ Red Button. You feel like it’s staring right at you … looking right into your very soul. It knows you. Better than you know yourself. I have to press it … it commands me to press it. I want it. I want to press it.. Your minds racing. Please, Don’t Touch Anything...\n\nWill you give in to your desire? Or are you strong enough to wait for your Co-Worker to return?\n\nGameplay\nPlease, Don’t Touch Anything is a short and easy game. That’s what you might be thinking and you couldn’t be more wrong. It’s a challenging and complex game. Well it is if you’re willing to put time, blood and sweat into it. You might be wondering why so let me explain.\n\nMultiple. Endings. Let that sink in for a minute. Yeah you read that right. The whole game takes place in one room where you’re not supposed to touch anything. So you can either just sit around and stare at whatever you want to stare at the moment or you can go ahead and just … touch everything?\n\nThe game’s challenging. The puzzles and riddles aren’t easy let me tell you that. At the same time though, you have everything you need to know right in front of you. The game’s not just throwing you into it saying Have Fun and Good Luck figuring out what to do well I mean actually it does but it’s giving you hints and clues on what to do.\nMy best advice is: Think outside the box.\n\nLike I said, personally, I find it incredibly hard to give you folks an insight into this complex and really beautiful game without spoiling all the fun but let me just say this. There’s so much to explore and discover. There are so many puzzles and riddles in this game.\nIt all starts with the big ol’ Red Button.\nOkay, okay I’ll say three things which will get you interested. I guarantee it.\n\nBlood. Illuminati. Satan\nRight? You’re interested now! I knew it!\nI suggest you dive into this game and just play it. You’ll get frustrated and annoyed and whatnot but you’ll always come back to it to discover more.\n\nMy jaw literally dropped once in this game. And it takes a lot for that to happen.\n\nI know, I know I haven’t talked too much ‘bout the gameplay but to be honest: I can’t. Not without spoiling all the fun.\n\nAtmosphere\nWell we’ve all been there. Either in someone’s car or at someone’s house. All of a sudden they have to take a call or something and leave you all alone. Remember that feeling? Well so do I and it seriously felt like that once you start the game. You sit there and sure you don’t touch anything … then it happens. You get bored. Booooooring. So you proceed to play around.\n\nNow that’s the beauty of the game. You turn back into a child and you just press and hit and click on whatever you can. Unless you’ve been born as a full grown up having manners and all that well then … Good for you. There’s the door.\nBut for all of us with our inner childs … boy this game is fun.\n\nTo make it short. If I had to describe the Atmosphere I’d say it’s exciting boring.\nDoubt that makes any sense but hey if you’re looking for something logica then I’m afraid you’re ‘bout to play the wrong game.\n\nVisuals and Sound\nWell what can I say? If you’ve read some of my Reviews so far you know that I just love games with a retro look and feeling. I just love me some pixels. The game’s looking beautiful and I really like the few animations it has. Everything works together. There's nothing that I could point at and be like Ah well no this just doesn't feel right. This doesn't sound good. The art is simple and minimalistic but so good.\nEspecially the sounds make it so much better. For every situation there’s just the perfect sound for it. Overall very pleasing.\n\nWhat else can I say?\nI’ve tried the original Ludum Dare version which was called The Second Thought way before Please, Don’t Touch Anything so I knew exactly what I’m getting myself into … or so I thought. The game’s really enjoyable despite it’s difficulty. But then again … You have everything you need to know right in front of you at all times.\nAlso never forget! Think outside the box! Look at every detail. Everything is important and has some function in one way or another.\nBut most importantly. Don’t ask for help. Don’t google how to solve puzzles or how to unlock every ending. You’re just going to ruin the whole game and therefore fun for yourself.\nEnjoy being dumb. Enjoy being frustrated. You’ll enjoy it so much more once you finally solved a puzzle and unlocked an ending after resisting the urge to rip your face into tiny bits and pieces just because you couldn’t figure out what to do.\n\nI can’t recommend this game enough. It will stimulate your brain cells and you have to actually think ‘bout what to do and when. That’s the beauty of it.\n\nLet me end by saying\n\nPlease, Touch Everything","June 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","40","48","9","5"

The larger update did change that, which is good. I still don't like the game, but I absolutely concede that the developer made the game more expansive.\n\nHOWEVER, from my original review, I still have issue with the fact the game has no world building. There is no narrative consistency to the endings. They reveal nothing about anything about the world and almost all result in the city being destroyed in a variety of comepletely unrelated ways.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are fine, but not exactly that difficult. Since the release of the update there are now quite a few puzzles. I know it's only $5, but I can't really recommend the game to a general audience, nor would I recommend it to people who are making the connection to Papers Please.  I made that connection, but it's wrong. If you like puzzles with easyish answers, then yeah this could be your thing.\n\nCaveat: Do you like logic puzzles and clue hunting? Yeah it's probably okay.

There are 16 endings to the game, all of which can be derived in some from by the Instruction panel and pressing the button enough times, most endings bringing some form of end to the city displayed on the monitor.  If you know what you're doing, said endings only take a few minutes to input the right sequence, but of course, the entirety of the game is to learn what to do.\n\nIt's an odd little game, part traditional, lateral-thinking puzzle from trying to derive something from the Instruction poster, and part standard point-and-click "use-everything-with-everything" puzzle.  Whether or not it's worth five bucks is up to you, as previously stated it's fairly short, and puzzle games lack replay value. I will admit, however, that the soundtrack are fairly nice chiptune themes, and worth the little extra on top.\n\nFor what it's worth, I enjoyed it despite it's length, even if I had to look through community discussion to get the remainder of the endings.","March 26, 2015","true","1.8"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Sadly, I'm here to point some downsides for the game.\n\nSomeone asks you to wait before some machine with a big red button - incredibly predictable, just as human nature - and - wait for it - DO NOT TOUCH THE BUTTON until he returns. Catchy, huh? Being a proper example of the human species, you push the button and face a collection of mathematical puzzles to hunt for all the possible outcomes that the machine might present you. There are 22 separate endings, mainly consisting of different apocalyptic ends for the city on the screen of the machine, and some irrelevant endings. The last ending, contains the main joke of the setting. So far, so good.\n\nThe downside is that the game consists of this given scene only. The machine, some puzzles and some endings that you may observe from the screen, flavored with references. That's it. And the price of the game is ridiculous for a 'one scene only' game. I'd love it if I were to stumble it as a free browser game, but for 5 dollars, nope, thank you. If you decide that it's worth your dollar, grab this little brain scratcher. If not, it won't be the most irredeemable miss.","July 21, 2015","false","1.7"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","33","52","0","3"

This is a distinction that Please, Don't Touch Anything fails to grasp. It's a shame because the concept of "console with one button that hides more" is simple enough to provide a framework for a series of interesting puzzles to solve. Instead, the player is required to make random observations and can be cut off from significant portions of the game by failing to do so. There is also no hint system, giving the player no other options but to simply look up solutions - something I had to start doing after about an hour of trying to figure puzzles out and getting nowhere.\n\nThis poor puzzle design combined with minimal rewards for finding the game's different endings ("another animation of the city being transformed - oh joy") made this an unrewarding experience that I would only recommend to puzzle solvers with a high tolerance for puzzles that are designed by their creator with an attitude of "there's no way they'll figure it out."","June 17, 2015","false","2.3"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","26","40","0","1"

The art style is pretty cool with the game being humorous and hard at the same time for the endings.

Well, I'm too stupid. The game legitimately requires some pretty high level reasoning skills and some math knowledge to play. A bunch of the endings also seem pretty arbitrary.\nIf, like me, you're not as observant, you'll find yourself frustrated by being unable to find the next, horrendously hidden clue for another ending.\n\nThat being said, I find that the game's presentation is worth the recommendation, just keep in mind that it's not a game for everyone - You need to like and be decent at solving puzzles.

It's definitely different to other puzzle and point-and-click games, though the art style does remind me of Papers, Please, one of my favourite games in the genre.\n\nPlease, Don't Touch Anything is definitely challenging, at least a little bit, and sometimes requires you to think outside the box, though other times you just aimlessly click about. Nevertheless, the results are always either surprising, funny, interesting, or all of the above. Besides, it truly is satisfying when you finally figure out that *one* puzzle that's been bugging you, plus it really scratches an itch of mine that needs to... well, be scratched.\n\nAlthough I do enjoy this game, I am still unsure at this point about whether you really get your money's worth, since I have definitely played games half the price or even free that offered a lot more than this one.

Also I've shied away from the "retro-looking" games for the most part:  Just because I liked the games back then, doesn't mean I want to play them again.  Let's move on!\n\nSo, why did I play PDTA?     Because while this is very retro-looking, it's a brand new twist on the point-and-click genre.\n\nSo, the point of the game seems to be to find all the ways to blow up, squash, terrorise, vaporise, or imprison the inhabitants of a city, using an enigmatic "machine".   Alternatively, the intro makes me think that it's a set-up, and I'm being surreptitiously "tested" for my intelligence and tenacity...\n\nThis is where the full, FMV cutscenes of other games, spend millions in acting and rendering to establish a plot, while this game achieves exactly the same with about a dozen lines of text.   Testament to the genius of some developers and artists, imho, versus the big corporate machine.\n\nI rattled my way through about 3/4 of PDTA without any real difficulty.  The game is almost fully self-contained clue-wise, and a cup of tea and a digestive are usually the right brain-food, while also taking the right amount of time for you to sit back, think it over, and hit on the solution.\n\nThere do come some points, though, where you just hit a total brick wall.  There's one "Diamond" puzzle which (to me) seems woefully incomplete in the clue department, and I ended up giving up (after many many hours of trying to puzzle it out), and reading a walkthrough.  This, I suspect, is how most people will solve the last few puzzles in PDTA.\n\nI found about 80% of the time I spent playing PDTA immensely satisfying, and I got the same feeling I get when I'm doing a Sudoku, or a crossword... That deep intense "me vs. the puzzle".    For that, I'd happily recommend this to any one of my friends.\n\nIt's a relatively short game, unless you're a massive completist (like me).   I don't think I'll go for the perfectionist badge, though... I don't trust my clicking skills that much, haha..\n\n\n","June 18, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The trailer is probably my favourite part and hastily had my credit card springing from my wallet. However, once you're into the game and curious to start pressing things you shouldn't, you realize that the lack of narrative and logic leaves you with more of a time-wasting guessing game. A few of the endings are found by clever thinking or looking around for clues, a FEW. The rest are long shots or complete guesses into a long serious of combinations which ends up feeling a lot like monotonus work.\n\n"Try every combination until you get it right!" I felt.\n\nI tried for a good hour to figure out more than five endings before watching the walkthrough and fufilling every tedious task in my own game for completion. Most of tasks needed to be performed had me rolling my eyes and the unlikelyness that anyone would put these two things together.\n\nIn short : A good concept, beautiful art, but lacks immersion due to a lack of narrative and lame endings.

It's a single screen puzzle game that is too difficult and not fun enough.\n\nThe game requires a walkthrough - it would take hours to figure out each puzzle, code, and encryption for the game. Each "playthrough" lasts at maximum, 5 minutes, and then you click reset to try again. Watch some gameplay and you've seen the whole game. It is at maximum a 3 hour experience, however, the game doesn't pretend it is triple-A which I respect.\n\nUnlike similar games, there is no challenge, no story, no progression, nothing. It really, truly, is a short toy. And it accomplishly that decently, at best.\n\nYou may be told "Oh, it's cheap", but I'm not looking at price. It just wasn't all that fun. Kongregate honestly is a better use of time, for free.\n\nRead a walkthrough of the game and you'll see what I mean. Clicking a button 275 times exactly isn't very fun.

This is something I rarely do, but I'm glad I risked the five dollars. It is a very entertaining diversion, and is also a lot of fun to share with friends. The art style is sure to draw comparisons to Papers Please (another excellent and original game), but that is where the similarity ends. Please, Don't Touch Anything is a puzzle game, and a rather devious one at that. I would highly recommend playing through it without looking at any forums or guides, as the process of figuring out how to get all the possible endings IS the game. Some take some thought, but the answers to all of the puzzles are in front of you the whole time; you just have to look hard enough. I really enjoyed playing this game.

If you're clever and curious enough, this has a great few hours in it.

You're placed in a single room in front of a large machine and display screen. You initially have just one large red button and are told not to touch anything. However, you will eventually start pressing the button which reveals more things to tinker with. Pretty soon, you have so many panels and buttons and logic puzzles to solve that it gets really complex. I was able to solve some of these on my own, but because I have patience problems, I did use a guide to find most of the endings. I was hoping that the game would get a little creepier or more surprising but that only happens once in a while. All in all, it's worth tinkering around with, especially if you're a bargain hunter and find this during a sale.","June 21, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is silly. But it isn't shallow. (If you don't cheat and look up the endings and how to do them) Some of the obvious endings are easy to get, and good for a laugh, but the harder ones are incredibly difficult to work out. The graphics are very nice, and remind almost anyone of Papers, Please. In fact, one of the endings is a reference to that game! Anyway, the music is great, seriously. It's very, very, good. If you see this game on sale, definately, pick it up! It's worth at its worst, a few hours worth of entertainment.

So please, don't touch anything...\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, but if you're a committed fan of Papers, Please and McPixel, I am more than confident that you'll love this game. It also gives off a Stanley Parable vibe also. (Hidden) achievements, (hidden) objectives give this game plenty of replay factors.

The real draw though is the drive to get all the endings and figure out the odd puzzles. The clues are there, just many of them hidden in plain sight, so to speak. I did have to use a guide to get some of the more difficult endings (I'm not nearly as patient of a gamer as I once used to be) but once you figure out a few of them, you'll start to get the hang of the puzzles.

The other 21 involve you pressing (and breaking) everything. You may stumble on some of the ending, but you will need to carefully look around for clues.\nIts very short, and can be easy to give up on.

Did I get my moneys worth? Maybe... Probably not.\nIt boils down to the fact there really isn't a lot of content in the game. I think I got 2 hours out of it and that's largely because I decided to brute force one of the puzzles because I was tired (which is tedious and not recomended). Theres a good foundation here that could be fleshed out to include a lot more with very little effort from the developer (it's just a case of having clever new ideas to include I guess).\n\nThe puzzles that are present are good (though at least one requires some obscure external knowlege of number sequences and historical figures associated with them, other the that all the information you need to solve them is readily available if you pay attention). The asthetics are niche but the previews above are adaquate for you to know if they'll appeal to you or not. I did like some of the references made by the game.\n\nI'd currently value the current content at about a dollar. If they update it to include more content followin this review it will probably be worth more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/354240/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Having recently finished The Room (it's awesome, go play it), I was really looking forward to trying out another game with a similar play style where I could mess around with a strange device and gleefully revel in seeing how everything on it reacted. Rediscovering this in my Library and loving its premise and presentation, I couldn't wait to get stuck in and unravel its mysteries. But, sadly, it fell pretty short of expectations.\n\nPresented with a large console adorned with a single, big, red button in its centre and a small restart switch at the bottom, you're left alone with it and given one simple instruction - don't touch anything. So, naturally, you immediately start hammering the sh*t out of the big, red button. Various kinds of interactions with it reveal an array of different switches and levers and buttons and even a mini game or two as you find out all the many ways in which you show why you can't have nice things as you completely ruin everything. For each sequence of button presses and such that you complete, you're presented with its consequence on a screen above the console, most of which are very brief little pop culture references or tips of the hat to things the makers clearly love or were inspired by (inevitably including a nod most notably toward Papers, Please which feels like a big influence on its look). And that's basically the name of the game for the hour or two it should take for you to see everything. I enjoyed my first 20 or 30 minutes of this, but the fun dried up pretty quickly after that.\n\nOf the 22 different "endings" you can get, I think I worked my way through the first half or so pretty quickly just by naturally following my curiosity and trying to pick up on the clues around me. But from then on it was a real slog as the hints became increasingly obscure and my trial and error approach yielded diminishing returns. Eventually I had to resort to a guide to get to the bottom of the final few endings as the solutions seemed to become ever more convoluted (having to Google the Fibonacci sequence was a particular low point). But while it isn't really the game's fault if I'm too stupid to figure out what's mostly in front of me, the biggest problem I really had with it was the repetition. Many of the puzzles require multiple steps, maybe about six or seven on average, but the trouble is, for quite a few of these, the first three or four of these steps, or maybe even more, will be exactly the same process, just with a slightly different finish. It made me lose interest pretty quickly as it felt like it was running out of new things to do except present me with a moderately entertaining pay-off as reward, quite a few of which seemed like they were completely unconnected to the puzzle that unlocked them.\n\nAs much as I love the idea, and do actually hope there's a sequel with a greater variety of entirely new and separate things to do with a more cohesive, connected logic to all the actions and their rewards, I just couldn't bring myself to sustain the joy of that initial wonder and potential it suggested from its start. I'm sure many will enjoy briefly dipping their toes into this and get a quick kick out of all the references they know and love, but for me, it all ended up being far too unsubstantial for me to meaningfully latch onto, and not really fun enough for me to be able to recommend.","November 15, 2015","false","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A high production value (if one can use those terms in regards to pixel art and chip-tunes) ultimately doesn't offset the way the game itself is built around achievements to a repulsive degree (being represented persistently in-game), rather than an engaging experience. It might be too much to expect a little novelty-type item as this to be more than a "collect the endings" toy, but it's fair to say other games do it better, for the price and for the time (without making you click buttons for the sheer sake of clicking buttons).","March 8","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And it is 5 bucks. Music is nice, pixel art is neat, gameplay is funny until you realize you have no idea of what to do, i tried a lot to unlock other ending aside from the 3 ones i got, but the puzzles are too difficult, normally this wouldn't be a bad thing since i'm a fan of puzzle games and escape games, but these ones are not intuitive at all, all you got is a piece of paper with VERY vague hints. Anyway, i played only a few minutes of it, for my first impressions it is not really worth the money, maybe i can change this review later, when i finally find out what the hell is that piece of paper on the top left.\n\nEdit 1: Ok, i dig in more into the game and found out another 3 or 4 endings, none of which was really intuitive to find, anyway, depending on the other endings i can still change this review to reccomend, for now i will keep it this way. And yes, i will unlock all endings.\n\nEdit 2: Done, i finished all the endings, some of them i unfornately had to look up on the steam discussions, and holy crap, i could have passed my whole life in that game and wouldn't ever figure it out because some of the endings required knowledge on a determinade area(which i'm not going to directly mention it but for you who alredy finished, the date thing for example) or doing some resource, which is what i have done and it feels a little like cheating. 50% of the game is completely not intuitive and the other 50% lasted 30 minutes.

The best parts of playing this game were just seeing how clever many of the solutions were, and how much thinking and poking around it really takes. You may be asking at this point, if this game is so good, then why don't you recommend it? Pure and simple, some of the solutions are so impossibly out there that it ruins the experience in many ways. $5 may be alot to play a puzzle game with some insanely out there solutions (mainly alot of the later endings). If you're one of the people who love sitting at a computer staring at an unchanging screen until you have eureka moments, I would get this game. If you dont mind paying $5 for a really unique and insanely hard 'puzzle' game, this wont be a bad purchase. Beyond that, I would give this game a wide berth. Its out there, and sometimes nonsensical solutions really started to wear me down and ruin what fun I could have had with this game.\n\nIf you want a sneak peek on some of these solutions, look at the extreme late in the game solutions in the community guide on steam. The author of the guide blacks out any of the spoilers for solutions and provides hints before outright giving the solution.","March 20","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first glance some of the buttons, gadget and levers seem impossible to understand and work, but look around you, the solution to the puzzle may just be in plain sight. Just remember while solving each puzzle to keep an eye out, because the solution to the next one might just be hidden there too!\n\nDone in a pixel-graphic style with a charming chiptune soundtrack reminiscent of the old C64 and Amiga days, it's a retro game that feels right. It's easy to look at, fun to listen to and is full of fun little hidden easter eggs from "papers, please" to "V for Vendetta" and when you find them it's a classic case of: "Aha.

It's a neat concept, that there's this big tempting red button to push that leads down a slippery slope to all kinds of mischief, ranging from silly to bizarre to downright scary (two endings in particular are startling, to say the least).  HOWEVER, the majority of the endings are a bit on the obtuse side (can be worked out EVENTUALLY without help), and after finding them all, there's not a lot of replay value, especially since many of them branch out from the same clue.\n\nGreat soundtrack, though.","January 9","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This felt ironic to me. Both of the aforementioned games were pretty high up on my wishlist for a while. When I finally bought them and played them, neither really stood up to the anticipation I had built up in my mind. This game followed suit with the two aforementioned games. Hence the irony. That's not to say I dislike any of these games. I actually recommend all three games. But there is just something about them that doesn't quite sit right with me. They do make you think outside the box of conventional gaming. But in some ways I don't always feel like thinking outside that box. The Stanley Parable, I believe, is the most successful of the three. This one may be the next in line of... succession?? But only just... I would have rated this game higher, but I had to go to a walkthrough way too much. Maybe that doesn't so much say something about the game as it does about myself. So I guess I'm rating myself here, in accordance with my experience playing this game, of course... Anyways, 6/10.

Not sure it's worth full retail price, for the game is very short (1~3 hours depending on how smart you are), but definetly worth if you get it in a sale. Beautiful pixel art graphics and chiptune music. The illuminati thing really caught me off guard","June 5","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Incredible ride from start to finish. Would recommend most if you love puzzle games. If you hate puzzle games, you won't like this game. This game was a truly unique experience. It is full of creativity. I loved finding the various endings and discovering each individual soundtrack.","June 6","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
