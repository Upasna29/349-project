You're simply thrown into the game and will spend your time clueless on what to do before you ragequit or borequit.\nI've played a whole lot of FS13 and assumed it would be a similar experience (even if from different companies). But I was very wrong.\nHowever, the game is actually a pretty good looking game for something that came out a few years ago. But it's not for everyone, the effects can really bother some people, luckily there are options to turn them off if you don't quite like some of the shaders being used.\nIt would be nice if this game had co-op but unfortunately that is not the case for this game or Agricultural Simulator 2013 either.\nSo if you had to play a farming simulator game, I'd recommend FS13 demo instead due to that being a free trial to see if you like it and if you do, get that instead. It also has co-op so you can play with friends.","November 28, 2013","false","0.5"," 56 of 76 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","56","76","0","0"

According to My Own Rating.\n\nA farming simulator that has better (although laggy) graphics and livestock breeding but is harder to get started, doesn't allow modding and is filled with bugs (couldn't expect any better from the creators of skyscraper simulator).\n\nGot 2 points for the graphics and 1 for the livestock breeding. Even though it's not really fun, the livestock it's much more diverse than the Farming simulator's one so... at least they tried something. Everything else is way worse than Farming simulator.\n\nInterface lag.\nNo modding.\nBugs. Lots of them. Some will make the game crash.\nVERY Stupid AI.\nHard to get started (took me a while to figure out the game had already started).\nNo tutorial.\nNot so intuitive controls.\nNo real brands for machinery (not like I really care though).\nEverything is too damn slow. It may take SEVERAL HOURS to complete a farming cycle (assuming you use the time skip feature to speed up crops' growth. Otherwise it would take days).\nPrices are not balanced and can't be fixed since there's no modding.\n\nYou can go for livestock breeding and make a billion dollars faster than a single crop  cycle (which is worth about 20k).  Although you'll probably get bored and quit before that.\n\nNot worth buying unless it is included in a bundle you're already buying. Don't expect any better from the 2013 version. If you get the demo you'll see the interface lagging got even worse.\n\nBuy Farming Simulator instead.","October 31, 2013","false","0.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Your fields can be cultivated with machines from CLAAS and even your animals have to be taken care of.\n\nThe complete Agricultural Simulator allows you to ride many genuine CLAAS tractors. Choose between many different models of tractors, combines, extensions and hangers. Sell your products and invest in better equipment. More powerful machines will help you farm bigger areas.\n\nAs striving farmer, you have to invest carefully to maximize the crop. Don’t kick over the traces or you won’t be able to upgrade your farm and buy more land. Choose the right seed from different types of grains like barley, rye, or wheat or decide to grow canola or corn. The harvest can be used as animal food, new seed as well as product to be sold on the market. Always have an eye on the market prices so you don’t come out with losses after all the work.\n\nGet another main pillar and breed cattle: cows, horses, sheep, hen, and geese. You may even have game animals on your farm and sell them profitably as food. If everything works well, the animals will prosper and you can sell their offspring on the market. Take care of proper feeding, daily care of the stables, and your animals well-being. Hire workers to balance your workload and invest in their further education.\n\nThe career mode in Agricultural Simulator guarantees a lot of fun. Playing cooperative mode allows you to manage your farm either online or offline with your friends.","December 20, 2013","true","128.9"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","11","28","0","0"

To begin, I'd like to say that ploughing a field was pretty neat. I had another major event happen, but can't recall as it's been a while since I've played.\n\nI could probably, and I say probably, meaning I'd have to have other entertainment playing on screen nearby, thrashing over the stereo or a few beer. Maybe a combo.. Anyway..\n\nMaybe I'll load it up in future. For now, all I can say is I did enjoy try to drive these beasts. Got it in a bundle too, I do believe, so it will be pennies on the hour.\n\nThis is for a select niche. Think you can do it, motherfarmer!? Good luck!","May 10","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
