"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reecebullet/recommended/414730/","Reecebullet","Reecebullet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reecebullet/","3156 products in account","My largest issue with Epic Clicker Journey was, as said below, not being able to go back to the previous difficulty, which trapped you. Thankfully, this has been changed/fixed in the recent patch! Clearly, the dev/s are willing to fix the problems (which is fantastic, and I thank them for it!).\n\nAt the current stage, would I now suggest ECJ? Still, no. Although the game is getting there, there's still some problems that make the game hard to enjoy.\n\nThere's a lot of grind with nothing inbetween. Other clicker games have more substance, idle options and prestige systems to combat the repetitiveness of clicking and repeat. At the moment, ECJ doesn't. It just doesn't give that sense of accomplishment that other clicker games have, that make you want to continue. You're constantly expecting something different, something new (especially with the different "maps"), but it never comes. It's just more of the same until the very end.\nThere's no information at all. You're put into the game, and that's that. Most clicker games have a pretty obvious UI, so explaination isn't needed (yet most still have them). ECJ isn't one with an obvious UI.\nWhat does each item do? You gather after awhile that the hashtag items do something to the hashtaged monsters/mobs, but what exactly? How long do the click-items last? There should be information on all this.\nSome items have one-use then they're gone, some have multiple uses, yet there isn't any distinction between the two.\nDoes the DMG coin upgrade also increase DPS (as there isn't a DPS coin upgrade), or can you only upgrade base-DPS via experience points?\nThere are multiplayer levels, which is a fantastic idea, but there isn't really ever anyone else on them. So you end up just waiting for the multiplayer finding timer to run out so you can finish the level (and is it even beneficial to be in the multiplayer levels? It seems like the stats of the mobs are just x'ed by the amount of players fighting it. May as well just be solo).\nThere seems to be multiple save issues, load issues, crash issues etc.\nI'll keep an eye out on the game and the future updates, as this could be enjoyable. There's just a lot of aspects that clearly haven't be thought through properly, as of yet.\n\n\nREVIEW BEFORE UPDATE:\nThis game intentionally backs you into a corner.\n\nThe first difficulty/"map" is pretty straight forward with no problems at all. This is clearly on purpose as to get you hooked/into the game.\n\nOnce you complete the first difficulty/"map" you're instantly thrown into the next one, which is much harder, and an almost guarantee that you'll die/need to bail out, or you'll just make it through by the skin of your teeth. Now, you need coins/health. You don't make enough coins from the first set on the second "map" to buy the health potions. You can't go back to the previous difficulty/"map", so you're stuck. Here's where they're intentionally backing you into a corner. Your choices here, if you don't have any coins (which is very likely, and at some point will happen), is to either buy coins/their in-game currency, or wait for the health to go up (which takes 10+ minutes real-time).\n\nThey've made it so that the hinge of the game is the health. And the only way to make it balanced is to buy the in-game currency.\n\nThey've made a more sneaky phone-like pay-to-continue game.\n\nNo thanks.","April 22","false","26.5"," 138 of 175 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","138","175","3","7"

The game starts off how all clickers should, a weak enemy that dies with like 4 or 5 clicks, simple, right? But then it becomes worse... the enemies health automatically jumps up by around 50, making you have to click more, most clickers start you off with easy enemies for 1 or two stages then get a little harder. Not this one. the boss for the first stage has around 500 health I think, your click do around 2 or 5 damage per click... I dont even think this game deserves my review. Its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clicker with a extreme amount of grinding, just sitting there and clicking with nothing else to do... and worst thing is, you get HEALTH the enemy can damage you. if your clicking or not, you will take damage, and the multiplayer potion of the game is even worse. You dont get like a shared health bar such as everyones health put to gether and the enemy damages the teams Health not individuals. you randomy get put into match making with random people, you can invite your friends to a lobby and take out the levels together, and the chances of getting in with your friend on a multiplayer stage is slim to none, and if you do, you wont be able to know at all, there is no identification system (choosing a username or using your steam name in game).\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT 4/10\n\nUntil improvements are made, this review will stay the same.","May 8","false","0.2"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","32","44","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawglor/recommended/414730/","rawglor","яawz™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawglor/","389 products in account","First off, I have not finished this game yet. I haven't finished the first map.\n\nHonestly, I don't think this game is too bad, at least considering it's free. I can look past the silly drawn visuals and monsters. It's not a hard game, it starts out extremely easy and gets harder as you go on. You of course need to level up your character, keep items (the item that heals you is one of the best), and possibly buy and level up a "fellow" (although that doesn't seem be that important).\n\nThe biggest complaint I have would be that it turns into a grinder. At first locked areas are quick and easy to get past, requiring one key, then five, etc. But then you will hit one that needs 20, then 40. Each key costs 5,000 coins, so youll need 300,000 coins to beat the map. That takes some time. The problem with it taking time is, unlike, say, clicker heroes, here you are stuck playing the same few areas (or more realisticlly due to the amount of coins each area will give you) the same area over and over again, with the same six monsters over and over again. It gets boring. Nothing happens while the game is not running.\n\nAnother problem is that none of the items have any descriptions, so the only thing telling you what they do (if anything) is the name. Sometimes the name does explain what they do, other times it does not. So for all I know I could have sold some really good items.\n\nLastly, your character obviously looses health. There are health potions, but you only get those by buying them, which I never do because they cost 3,500 coins and you need coins for leveling up your equiptment and (most important) keys. The only other way to heal is to either get lucky getting a healling item or waiting for your character to heal. This is slow, and only works while the game runs. Unlike most clicker games, nothing happens while the game is not running. The higher your level, the slower you heal (the rate is 1 or 2 health healed per second).\n\nIf your tired of playing other clicker games and want something different you could give this a shot. I don't feel that's terrible and not worth playing at all (unless you don't want to mess up your achievement percentage), but it definitely needs improvements. It feels more like a beta and not a finished game.\n\nI kinda wish there was an option between recommended and not recommended.","April 26","true","11.1"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","19","29","3","0"

Gear, Attributes and More!\n\nThis clicker game switches things up a bit. Instead of controlling a troop of heroes it’s just you against the monsters. You upgrade your base stats and gear much like an FPS game which was pretty fun. The characters were entertaining; you really never know what random opponet you will be squaring off against next. (Horror Movie Characters, My Little Pony, Movie Stars and More!)\n\nAlthough I did like this game I can only rate it positive by a hair. My biggest complaint is that there isn't a passive mode to this game. Your character also has hit points which you must closely monitor; this element prevents you from continuously playing or idling regardless of the level you are on. Your hit points do regenerate quickly; but there ends up being too much idle time in between levels. I want to either walk away completely or be able to continuously play.\n\nIt's free; if you enjoy the clicker genre check this one out!

It isn't, oddly enough and that makes it difficult to talk about in a meaningful way.\n\nClicker games are very niche, they appeal to the part of your brain that loves to feel like you outsmarted someone or something and we all have fun finding the most optimum route or making the maximum clicks per second bot. ECJ comes so very close to that but it has 2 fatal flaws that prevent it being a true clicker experience.\n\nFirst of all, you can't idle. You can in the literal sense but not the figurative sense because when you finish a wave, you can never automatically go on to the next wave, ever. So you need to constantly loot a treasure chest and then go back to the world map and then move on or re-do the same map, every time.\n\nSecondly you can only have 1 pet and DPS scales at +1 per level so Lv10 DPS = 10 DPS which is so small its useless and the grind to make it useful is so high that you really need not bother. Click damage all the way for this one.\n\nI don't think ECJ is bad but who do i recommend it too? If you like idle clicker games then maybe you will get something out of it? If you like regular video games or RPGs then why not play something better like just about any actual RPG?\n\nAlso features microtransactions because of course it does but everything you can buy, you can get for free. Yes even those 'exclusive monsters' that cost diamonds, you can obtain for free. Get a pokeball item and use it on any monster in the game to obtain them. May sound a bit borken until you realize you can only have 1 pet and you are stuck with it till it dies, at which point you can revive it for the small fee of real life cash. Not sure why you'd want too really, they don't offer all that much except 0 or 1 or 2 pockets for items and insultingly small DPS.\n\nI don't hate this game but its kind of a shallow experience, kind of disappointing really given all its negative reviews.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","April 23","true","13.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Most of people thinks of it as an idle clicker - that's why it misses potential for them, but the point is that this clicker has kinda plot as well. There are limited locations on this map (20) and 3 levels of difficulty. I guess it allows this clicker to be expanded easily in the future (I' m really wainting for it!). For me it's refreshing that this clicker has an end which can be developed later, for example as new maps and locations - not just repeating the same locations and creatures/minions/whatelse endlessly.\nI like to play RPG games so the feature of getting loot, EXP, and having HP is really cool! I love this idea! But I think loot can be further developed, because it's really missleading right now. It lack some kind of tooltip or other in-game explanation what it actually does.\nIn this game a very important thing is strategy. It's not a clicker where u click and kill mindlessly. You have to think! Am I strong enough to kill this minion? No? I have to run! Or else I will lose my loot! RPG players will like it (well, I liked that).\nOverall, this game has a great potential to be brand new clicker. It has lots of new features which other clickers don't provide. I just hope it will be further developed, map will be expanded, and more epic loot will be added :D","April 22","true","9.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

When I started out I enjoyed the clicker game change of pace this title presented, offering up levels strewn about on a map with various enemies you need to defeat before you can advance. Multiplayer levels offer keys which are needed to advance further until the map is complete. Repeat two more times. However, by the time I got half way through the map the first time, it started to lose its lustre.\n\nA lot of the images look crudely hand drawn, which, again, is a nice change of pace from the norm of stock images or cutesy foes you click on. However, most are just satirical pop culture creations like the xenomorph from Alien being drawn like a cat with a collar, sexy mermaid, Freddy Kreuger, Twilight characters... the list goes on. The levels are somewhat animated at times as well, though for the most part just background things moving about left and right.\n\nYou collect coins to raise your attack, health and how much damage you can block, as well as level up to increase your base stats of DMG, DPS, DEF, and LUCK. There's a lot of grinding involved and I often find myself leaving the game running in the background with the DPS and my "fellow" (which you can buy in the store for additional damage and level up later) attack automatically. There's also random items you get from the chests at the end of each battle you can sell off or equip that confused me a bit at first until the developer put up a guide as to what many of them do (thank you for that by the way).\n\nWhile I found much of this noble at the beginning, the more I was grinding, the more I found myself getting bored with it. The lack of a quick restart bothers the hell out of me, making me feel like I'm wasting my time navigating the map instead of hitting a single mouse click to restart said level. I also would prefer a steady stream of enemies without them broken up upon completing of a map to further help with boosting, something that the aforementioned mouse click to restart would curb a bit for me. The way you progress and replay really just feels clunky and unfinished, putting me off the more I work on it.\n\nTruthfully, the main reason I keep coming back and putting all this time into it is for the easy achievements that I know will continue to take a fair amount of time to get. Sadly, if these didn't exist, I'd have quit a while ago. Then again, I probably wouldn't have even started. Either way, noble attempt, but a bit too demanding of my time to keep me engrossed.","April 25","false","39.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The key also costs 5000 gold.  The second keyed area only requires 5 keys to get past.\n\nStarted playing last night, plowed through the first 3 areas, found some people for the multi area, then did it again for the money and happened to find a key the 2nd time (woo!) but then after I finished the 1 key area, I was at about 40% health and it was regenerating at about 2 per second when I have about 3000 health, got bored of waiting and killed the game to play something else\n\nOverall the game seems unpolished but has really strange artwork, so mixed overall.","April 22","true","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You can't use a macro or auto clicker; which is great because it shows more dedication rather than just afk with an autoclicker. The game in general is just more imerssive and fun. Love all the different enemies and the music is just EPIC. I'm not sure why this game is getting so many negative reviews. I haven't found a single bad thing about it. I'm guessing devs from other clicker games are butthurt that their game isn't as good. Maybe it's the butthurt children that can't use an autoclicker. Regardless, there is no valid reason to why this clicker game is bad and getting negative reviews.\n\n10/10\n\nEdit: To all the people complaining about how you just get forced into the next zone and can't go back. You CAN go back, you just have to click the little skull at the bottom right of your screen.

Damage FTW\n- Cutesie monsters, my little pony in bondage, that sorta thing, really weirdball\n- Decent progression, generally, you're not stuck for too long on any spot\n- They seem active, on the 22nd they made an update so you can go back difficulty levels, yesterday evening they made another one adding explanations when you hover over items of what they do.\n- Music isn't invasive (I rarely notice music too much, so it is in line with the game atleast)\n- Nothing aside from more item slots needs real money (and you don't need those really)\n- it's free\n- You can click the title screen, instead of clicking continue, and the epic and journey will fall off\n\nCons\n- No idling possible\n- The second offhand item of another weapon seems to be useless\n- stats aren't explained\n- little to no story\n- confusing\n- ending? no story, so no ending :S\n\nEnd judgement: It's a nice free game, where at the end, you still have energy/time/desire to get the last boss to not do any damage to you ever again. The lack of story is a little bit offputting, but eventually, this time of mine, probably a bit slow (take off an hour or so if you're great!) is what it takes to finish.\n\nThe tactic to beat this game seems simple enough, just upgrade your armor, until they can't hurt you anymore...","April 28","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
