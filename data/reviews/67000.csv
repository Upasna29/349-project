I HIGHLY recommend this game to someone who is looking for a cool thing to have on one's LED Projector wallscreen while playing phat beats or haunting melodies from one's "altered states of consciousness special music" folder.\nI use Winamp's milkdrop for the beginning of the party, and then when guests are looking to relax and play simple mindless no-consequence gaming in the smoking room we switch to the Polynomial and the music never skips a beat.\nAlso, I understand the game does get more challenging when you crank up the difficulty, and that's the only way to get the higher level achievements, but I don't use this game for gaming.\n\nThe game mechanics are great. You fire your inobtrusive, silent weapon and attempt to hit an enemy this is often impossibly far away, carefully compensating for the great distance by projecting the target's trajectory in your imagination. That's hard to do, so this game is a challenge.\n\nIts best features are the silent weapons fire and the silent seamless transition from getting silently shot to death by nazi robots to silently respawning; your music won't skip a beat, so people in the next room won't go, "Hey, what happened to the music!?"\n\nAlso, this game may cause people on drugs to stop talking and stare for a long time. Get an LED projector is my point.\n\nOn a side note, have any of you other reviewers actually done acid? This game will not cause you to become every person who has ever lived, so it does not feel like an acid trip. That being said, you should smoke the stuff that was recently legalized in your state before playing","January 23, 2014","true","16.8"," 73 of 76 people (96%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","96","73","76","19","4"

Though there is a game hidden here, one that would most easily be described as an aerial combat shooter, a more appropriate term would be "sensory experience". I spent the majority of my time doing nothing more than floating through an endless space, with equal amounts of awe at what was happening before me and curiosity over how certain songs would be represented within the game or how tweaking different settings might transfigure the sky around me (virtually everything can be edited to you liking).\n\nThe neon light show of particles and bloom effects is by itself mesmerizing to look at, but when pared with the proper music it becomes something truly breathtaking. The song playing in the background directly influences how the visualization looks and behaves, and when they mesh together it creates something that is impossible to describe with simple words, nor one screenshots can do any justice.\n\nThe Polynomial has limited appeal to be sure, and after the initial novelty staying power is put into question, but regardless I can't help but urge those even partially interested to give it a few minutes of their time. It is truly unlike anything I've ever played, and something that really must be experienced first hand to comprehend its artistry.","October 5, 2013","true","1.2"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","36","40","0","0"

You're essentially a floating entity in space that shoots giant cannon balls that look like a cross between Pac-Man and Bullet from Mario. You can collect power ups along the way that do a small upgrade for a short amount of time, however I didn't really feel any difference.\n\nThere are other games out there that offer a similar but more frantic experience to Polynomial, however I think Polynomial might be the only one that offers the chilled/relaxed angle on the musicially generated action genre.\n\nIn short, Polynomial isn't really a game, but an app that you can casually relax in while you listen to some of your favourite songs.","November 7, 2014","true","0.2"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","3"

Turn off the enemies.\n2. Turn off the hud (press H 2 or three times).\n2. Switch the "map" every so often manually if the song that's playing isn't spectacularly visualized.\n3. Screw around with the settings (beat/melody) for each song/map to see if you can optimize the experience. You have to be creative and experimental.\n4. Add your own music once you get the hang of it.\n5. Use this as a christmas card for a loved one. The "Christmas" map goes with "Jingle."\n6. If you stay still, it looks like the little friendly beings are crawling across your screen.\n7. Try and find a good view which includes the "Sun" and most of the particle effects.

Seriously, I'm not even gonna lie about it. The visuals are spectacular. Fractal-based landscapes with blazing colours and a handful of presets to change up the mood. As for gameplay, it is simple. You've got allies that look as if they've just arrive from a different plane of existence (the Ancients of Stargate SG-1 come to mind), and enemies that look like pacman. You kill your enemies with a dual gun. But WHILE doing that, you've got some stoner metal blazing in the background, and a visual spectacle that anybody on a good high can appreciate.

The preview video looked interesting, and the gameplay seemed to have some kind of link to my own music (which personally intrigued me, seeing as how "Audiosurf," "Beat Hazard," "Melody's Escape" and "Symphony" are four of my absolute most favorite games of all time), so I got curious and went ahead and bought it.\n\nOn a first impression, the control scheme was a little unusual. I personally found the keyboard layout hard/impossible to use, while the controller setup was drastically easier to play with once adjusted to my own preferences, so I greatly recommend using one when you play this game. Think about how a controller would typically be configured for any flight-based console game, and you should be fine.\n\nNow, onto actual gameplay and such. In a word?\n\n"Magical."\n\nIt is like a flight simulator set in a cybernetic version of space.\n\nThe graphics and effects are absolutely stunning and beautiful.\n\nYou can adjust the enemies up or down to however dangerous you want them to be (so casual and hardcore players can both enjoy this game), or you can turn them off completely and just enjoy and explore the scenery while it pulses and moves along with your music.\n\nThere are wormholes that take you to different areas that you can continue to fight/admire the view in.\n\nYou can set up and save your own music playlist to use in-game (personally, I found trance music to be the best possible match for this game), and you can flip between the tracks at any time that you want to without having to pause first.\n\nThis game is a fun and challenging flight-based shooter for any skill level, and an unrivaled "chill out/relaxation" tool when needed. To be completely honest, if this game had Oculus Rift support, this would be the very first game that I used it on (if I had one).\n\nMoney well-spent here.

This is fine with me though, I'm perfectly happy to fly around and take in the sights and sounds.\n\nThis game is an extremely cool audiovisual experience.","December 28, 2013","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You float around in multi-colored space shooting at 3D pacmen, and if you're lucky the clouds or the stars might shake in time with the music.  If the music influenced anything else I couldn't notice it.\nNothing in the gameplay has any impact.  Both the lazy enemies and power ups simply disappear when you shoot them, and death just teleports you from one indistinguishable section of space to another.  No explosions, no confirmation, nothing to even let you that something has happened.\nThe game reeks of tech test more than finished game.

One of my favorite things in the world is my music and I used to love those music players that would sprial into patterns in sync with the music and upon the description, I learned you could shoot enemys as well.\n\nSo I loaded up the game, did some tinkering to get spotify to work and played my favorite battle soundtracks. I barely noticed a difference in the climax and when I first started, I wouldn't move at all. After restarting the game, it finally started moving and I hid the HUD so I could watch the colors first.  While everything pulsed, it didn't quite seem in time with the music.  So I gave up on spotify and tried to add a song in directly. It added fine but again, I didn't really feel like it moved any faster or slower or there were any big explosions of light when the songs climaxed.\n\nI ended up running through several different options and spend a lot of time trying to fine-tune it thinking it might be possible but to no avail. This game let me down a lot from what I was expecting. If you want to listen to some music and shoot some things. I'd recommend finding another game and playing your music in the background. Otherwise, you'll find yourself listening to your music shooting easy enemies in a boring but pretty universe.","January 22, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I still think it looks amazing and is a pretty sweet concept, but there are just some fatal flaws.\n\nThe music is grinding, although you can upload your own tracks to play to, which is a really sweet thing.  The game's music are altered electronica versions of nursery-rhyme and holiday tunes that--even while having a modern twist--remain as annoying as they always were.\n\nThe visuals are sweet and I think part of the reason my initial review of the game was so good was that i was so high at the time.  (I was working my way through a large pile of medical Marijuana.)  So yeah, if you want to casually burn some time to some great musik and visuals... go for it.\n\nHowever...  As far as gameplay.  I'm still confused as ♥♥♥♥ as to what is going on.  Some people feel the game isn't challenging enough.  I just don't see much of a challenge or a game at all really.

The "world" you are in immediately shows you a list of "what items does what" much like an old arcade game or a flash game, though, I had to load into the game and aim my camera around to read the entire menu. The game worlds have various fractal based visualizations which appear to be various streams of light created by colorful small orbs.\n\nBefore I go into the details of the game, while there are definitely available combat game mechanics, it feels more like a 3D Space Flight simulator edition of the visualizations you would see in something like WinAMP. The game is damn pretty and it is interesting for a little while to see how the steams and balls of light react to the music (including your own injected music). You fly around these visualizations much like a 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) shooter like Descent or Retrovirus. Ghosts around the level can speed you up and heal some of your damage, while pac-man like chompers try to eat said ghosts and also shoot to kill you. You can also shoot in the same fashion in the form of a endless steam of blue orbs. It's week, but its infinite and perfectly accurrate with some bullet travel, so you need to lead targets sometimes. That appears to be the only way to harm these enemies. There are other items that protect you from damage, give you power ups like more speed and damage, and let you travel to other worlds and visulazations. The only true goal it seems to to see how high a score you can get in certain allotted time frames to be compared on the leaderboard. Strangely, the first time I played the game, I didn't have a HUD to show my kills, saves, points and etc on my first play, but on my second loading of the game, i saw a big list in the upper left hand corner of the screen - maybe I changed an option in error. Finally, you can also make and share your own levels by choosing from various Seeds a la Minecraft and messing with a multitude of visualizations and various options. The music you choose is in a separate menu for all players depending on what they imported, so I don't think it matters what music you "choose" for a level - the game is dependent on the music the player has (which there is some of in the game).\n\nIf you're expecting gameplay experience like Beat Hazard or Symphony, then you probably won't be entertained as I found the game the be quite boring and confusing and it felt like it was missing something. It feels as the game was meant to be a "interactive visulization" and the developer felt they had to add game mechanics to make it "playable". That said, it appears to be a potentially interesting way to "fly through your music" - I may give it another chance in easy modes just to "chillax" and soak in the visual experience, but I generally rather "play" my games. Though thanks to the indie scene, there are much more entertaining and rewarding "import your own music titles" from a pure gameplay perspective. However, as made obvious by the screenshots and video, the game is gorgeous.\n\nThis is probably best seen as a love letter to the fractal/math/demoscene/visualization community, so people of those types should potentially enjoy this. This game is a tough recommendation for core gamers and music lovers. I generally watch TotalBiscuits WTF videos of a game if I can find it, though for whatever reason I didn't look for one this time (and somewhat regret that). However, TB has made a video of this to give you an idea of what is going on.","August 5, 2014","false","0.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Also inside the space are wormholes that shift dimensions that change how your song influences the space. (You can change this in the options as well.)

The game also can get really hectic at times, and it's really difficult to understand what's going on. To its credit, I did not experience that many glitches and no crashes, which is (sadly) rare for any titles these day.\n\nI really want to recommend The Polynomial, but I can't. The music is poor (at best), the execution is a little sloppy -- I mean, hang on. Let me rephrase that. The MECHANICS are poor. The way it's laid out is very beautiful, but it's mechanically very clunky. A good number of times I found myself saying "Wait, why am I over here now?

Well, the visuals are awesome. And that's about all this thing has going for it. I'm hesitant to call it a game, as it's pretty much a game engine demonstration platform. There's really no game here -- it's about as bare-bones as a space shooter can get, and there is no progression or anything to keep you playing. You can change levels whenever you want, but they all behave the same way -- they only look different.. There are only three powerups, only one enemy type, and only one ally type. I originally bought this at full price (then $20) with the promise that the developer would be continuing to mold this into a full game. That was several years ago and there have been hardly any updates since then, and all of them were very minor.\n\nSo, if you like eye candy, it might be worth a few bucks. If you like fractals, it has a pretty cool interactive level design mode where you can tweak the parameters of the strange attractor in realtime. But this completely fails at being an interesting game, and it looks like the developer gave up on it. It's really sad.

Also, dying doesn't feel like a bad thing, it just feels like nothing happened.\n\nBut that's really not the point of the whole thing. If you just want to listen to music while flying around in space, occasionally breaking away from your mindless flight to shoot at evil Pac-men and catch snowflakes, this is for you.\n\nAnyway, I liked it.","October 11, 2012","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This can, surprisingly, be a very tense and shoot-and-dodge game of survival,  or an extremely zen-like "Bad guy hunt".\n\nBut the gameplay alone is only half of why you should get this game.\nIf the screenshots on the store page don't convince you, then let me explain.  This game procedurally generates absolutely gorgeous pixel-based effects to your music.\n\nWhile this sounds like a surprisingly simple concept, in practice it makes for absolutely brilliant visuals, in tune with your music and customizable to your liking.\n\nRemove the HUD, and fire off that screenshot key.

Not that The Polynomial is as complex as a game like X3, in fact The Polynomial is pretty simple in it's mechanics. Those being "Oh look, those things over there need shooting!" When you ask The Polynomial why, it simply draws a blank and says "Well if you want we can just turn off the things and let you fly around in the pretty background." So it's not the most complex game to ever come off the shelves, but you'd be hard pressed to find a prettier game at it's price range. Hell, I'd say it's one of the more pretty games out there.
