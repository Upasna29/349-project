It is just broken and will not get past the intro video. If you put the game into Windows 95 compatabilty, you will be able to play the demo, but to play the game you need the CD-ROM\n\nEdit:  Looks like the game just will not play well with Steam.\n\nOriginally posted by Saleck:Here's an update from me:\n\n\nI have requested numerous times to people to get this game down and we're getting there.\n\nAs for the fix, it's impossible right now and here's why.\n\n\nValve's system runs on a level that recognizes what architecture a machine is running on: 32 or 64-bit.\n\nThis gives me a unique problem for Deadlock. Deadlock seems to be a game where, if the user is on a 64-bit machine, it cannot find the registry entries that are put into the user's computer by Steam.\n\n64-bit machines use a Wow6432Node directory in the registry and Steam on 64-bit machines writes to this place by default for everyone. The worse thing about this is that there is no way to get around this. I've discussed this with Valve and they say that there is no way to work around this behaviour. It's just the way it's built.\n\nSo since Deadlock 1 does not and cannot read from this Wow6432Node folder. It is technically impossible at this time for me to provide a fix for the game if you are on a 64-bit machine.\n\nThe thing that makes this worse is that it doesn't matter how many workarounds I try. Everything is run on a level where it will write to the Wow6432Node registry folder, its fullproof.\n\n\nSo whos fault is this?\n\nMine.\n\nThe week and month this game went out was very stressful. I was responsible for porting about 30+ games to Steam (double this if you include Mac versions and Triple this if you include Linux versions) over the course of 1 month or so and, in this case, I ended up missing something that was crucial to the functionality of the game. It shipped and it's all gone wrong. This I am sorry for.\n\nSo what is happening now?\n\nI am trying to get things sorted out. I am going to see about getting your money back and am talking with Valve to see what I can do.\n\nI apologize again for this, there isn't much more I can say but I am trying to get you your money back. Hopefully something will happen in the next week or so.\n\n-Dan","October 25, 2014","false","0.5"," 115 of 126 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","115","126","5","1"

It locks up after the intro cutscenes, rendering the game unplayable.\n\nI can get it to launch in compatibility mode for Win95, but only in demo mode (the game asks for the CD.)  The developer appears to be working on a solution, as evidenced by the presence of two "launch-fix-" betas available in Steam under Deadlock>Properties>Betas.  Neither resolves the launch issue under Windows 8.1 x64.\n\nI'll update this review if the crash bug is fixed.","December 15, 2014","false","0.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

It's a great strategy game where you lead a race into building a colony in a new planet, where you gotta ally or battle other races for its conquer.\n\nI got really happy to see this game here, I've been looking for this online for quite a while, but then I got disappointed as it doesn't run past the intro movie. There's a patch inside the game files, but it makes the game start asking for the CD and directs you to the demo version instead. I'll ask for a refund and drive to my mom's house to look for my old CD copy. I just wasted my time here.\n\nSaddly, I CANNOT recommend this great game as the Steam version is broken somehow (it's not only me, you can see by the amount of complains). I hope they get it fixed because good old games cannot die like this!\n\nORIGINAL GAME 8/10\nSTEAM VERSION 0/10","December 26, 2015","false","0.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

Most reviews are right about this release being bugged (freezes after the opening cutscene), but it is not completely impossible to play and enjoy.\n\nAltough the game is bugged, there are a few tricks to make it possible to play in Windows 7 and 8/8.1 (32/64 bits), even without compatibility mode.\n\nThe easiest workaround to make the game playable is to use a different WAIL32.dll, and, as so, use it to substitute the one that comes shipped trough this Steam release (which may be illegal).\n\nIf you've managed to do this, the game will actualy load to the point that you will be able to start a new game. Do this and after the map loads up you must disable the sound effects (you may let the music on if you want to, but the sound effects are the real issue). If you don't, the game may crash after sometime.\n\nOf course I know this not the best solution, but it may save you some time and frustration if you already enjoyed this game in the past and was happy to see it on Steam.\n\nA few crashes may happen even if you've managed to do all these steps, so be prepared to have autosave as your allie (or save by yourself from time to time).\n\nOne of the things that I missed so much in this release is the lack of network gameplay. Which is not impossible if you use the old CD version.\n\nThe best possible (and legal) solution to play this game in Win7/8/8.1 would be running Steam inside a virtual machine with Win XP.\n\nIf the crashes are something you are considering to workaround with, and have hopes that Retroism/Night Dive Studios (or who else may have the power to) do any proper fix in the future, buy this game.\n\nIf you have patience, and don't want to have headaches because of the possible crashes, don't buy this release yet and wait for a proper solution.","December 24, 2014","true","0.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","0"
