Buy this game.  Right now.  Supports 2-3 players coop mission play, possibly more later. The game falls in the middle between a "Comanche 4" type 3rd person game, and a true simulator like "Janes Longbow 2".   It's like "what if the helicopters in Battlefield 4 were a joy to fly?"\n\nThe developer has found the "sweet spot" between a fun and accessible light sim, and a fairly difficult simulator.  You can tweak the difficulty to your liking.  First off, the controls.  You can turn the flight model all the way up and have a HIND that flies like Flight Simulator X or ARMA 3.  If you just want to fly a UFO, you can turn everything to easy.  Remember the mid-90s when they used to make accessible sim games?  This is a return to that.  Accessible, but not arcade.  You don't have to memorize 100 keys and learn how to operate a radar system.  But, one missile *will* wreck your day, you can wire-guide missiles to their target quite realistically, and I'm satisfied with the accuracy required to get kills and the ability of targets to occasionally survive a hit.\n\nControls:  I've flown it with a full HOTAS, and it's satisfying.  What's amazing is that using a mouse and keyboard I do just as well.  I have to play it on the hardest flight model, because the easier ones are weird after 20 years of flight simming.  The mouse and keyboard controls are superb, and I've never said that about a game before.  I'd pay Rockstar $100 right now if helicopters in GTA 5 flew like this.  I'm not kidding, at all.  It's really that good.\n\nCoop missions:  Currently you can play any of the missions with a friend or two.  Multiplayer "just works" and you host a game, your friends find it, and you take off together.  I'm "that guy" in BF4 that makes people hate helicopters, but my friends are very casual simmers.  I took them up in coop and they did very well at the same difficulty I play it at.  It's just fun, doesn't frustrate the inexperienced, and has so much potential.\n\nCurrently the game is very much EA in the mission department.  The flight stuff is 100% there.  He just needs to put in all the missions.  There are currently as of March 24th, about 10 different ones to test the game in, a few being instant-action and the others are campaign.  None of that is final, and there are a lot more to make.  I have faith that the rest of the game will be as good as what I've got now.","March 24","true","5.4"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","40","51","2","6"

My biggest fear was that it would be like Heleborne but fortunately it's not that arcady. The controls are simplified vs a real helicopter but they still feel enough like the real thing to make you feel like you're flying.\nThe graphics are really nice and the maps well put together.\nThe game runs super smooth, the maps load really fast and the only drop in framerate I experiened was when firing the Yak-B gatling guns over the largest city.\nUsually I'm not a fan of combat in flying games, I just like flying around, however this games battles are really fun, especially the quick mission city attacks. It's actually quite challenging a lot of the time and I am really struggling to get to grips with the guided missles.\nAlthough only one aircraft is modelled it has a lot lof customisation options. It has a nice selection of paint schemes useable from the start and pretty much the real Mi-24's full arsenal can be unlocked in the course of the campaign.\nLooking forward to seeing this game developed, the makers have already expressed interest in adding other helicopters to it which would be really good (An Mi-28 would be much appreciated).\nThe only real critisism I have in the pretty bad English in the mission briefings.","March 21","true","15.3"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","23","28","3","0"

When you start a camping, first this give a small tutorial, where you can learn a basic controls. After when you passed tutorial you will start a real missions. All missions based at fictional conflicts, when you passing them you will meet some areas like a Central Asia or Eastern Europe. After complected mission you will unlock new weapons what you can set up to your helicopter. Before all mission you can easily customize a difficulty level and change your device weapons. This game have a multiplayer and coop feature also, but unfortunately now you will not find to much players online.\nThe game graphic good, looks enough realistic.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+ realistic graphic\n+ good sounds\n+ well detailed helicopters\n+ good helicopter customization\n+ easy to control\n+ easily can set up a difficulty\n+ coop and multiplayer\n+ steam achievements\n+ leaderboards\n\n- some bugs- game undiscovered at this time, so in multiplayer you will find only few players\n- a bit hard to aim\n- no trading cards\n\nThis game now in Early Access and have enough good potential to be a good and enjoyable combat flight simulator game. However this not a big developer studio, they´re already does a good work, because a game at now have enough much advantages like a realistic graphic, good controls, good difficulty customization etc. I easily can recommend for you this game, especially if you like flight games.","April 2","true","1.9"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","1"

It's kinda like those helicopter sections from Ace Combat Assault Horizon, but without the setpieces, scripted events and fancy missile dodges.\nYou control a Mi-24 Hind gunship, one of the meanest sight anyone could ever see in their airspace.\nYou control your war chariot either with keyboard and mouse which I haven't used or a 360/Xbone pad which works surprisingly well and the controls, even on pilot setting, are extremely easy to master and effective. You'll be doing sideways strafing runs on opfor camps like nobodys bussines.\n\nThe game, being in early alpha, is a bit prone to crash here and there. I noticed that if you enable steam overlay while the game is loading, it gets stuck once the game reaches the "press any button to continue" part, meaning you have to forcibly turn off the game from the task manager.\nThere are also a bit of bugs, nothing too major though. For example, if you run out of ammo for a weapon like a gunpod for example, and hold the trigger down, the screen contiues to shake like it was firing.\nAll the enemies look like WWII Americans. This is not a bug really, maybe either a developer hindsight, a place holder or we actually are fighing evil imperialistic Americans trying to invade the motherland.\n\nThe game is loads of fun though, raining down death and hatred from your unstoppable war chariot.\n\nFor the current price of 16 or so dollaridoos, this game was worth it in my opinion if you want some light helicoter combat simulator action without going too techincal or too arcadey, a perfect balance of both. It is kinda short thought, like you can play though the campaign in a hour or two short. There is instant action to keep you occupied too, but at 16 bucks you could ask for a bit more than 2 hours.\n\nNow go forth and become Mors, Mara, Izanami, Hel or whatever for you are become death, the destroyer of worlds.","March 21","true","1.9"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","20","27","4","0"

Helicopter handles horribly, weapons unnecessarily weak, irritating missions (kill X tanks before timer runs out, etc).  Good idea, but too much in the no man's land between arcade and simulator.","June 3","false","2.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Even in it's current alpha state this game has all the base elements you want in a flight game:  Great Physics & Graphics, lots of controller options, a variety of views including a fully rendered cockpit (my preferred view) and gunner seat, FLIR and several external views, great Co-Op, PvP and team PvP, Single Skirmish, Campaign Mode and Free Flight.  Add to that chunky explosions, rag-doll infantry, custom loadouts, and just the right amount of simulation without being over-the-top realism.\n\nI'm not going to dwell on the current lack of content because this is the first public early-release of the game and the missions that are included are a promising snapshot of the direction the content developers are heading.  From what I have seen so far I have complete confidence that the future content will only get better.\n\nI bought this game along with 2 friends and we got to play all multiplayer modes together, all were extremely satisfying.  We all use Logitech 3D Extreme flight sticks that were recognized, configured, and worked almost perfectly by default.  Every feature of the Heli fits neatly on the stick so no need for mouse at all.  Even the menus can be navigated using the hat and a few buttons on the stick... very slick!  If you like to cusomize your controls, no problem, there is a full suite of custom options  including both Primary and Secondary controller recognition that has rudder and throttle-stick pilots in mind.  I also tried the keyboard-mouse controls (in Pilot mode) and found it extremely accessible to the flight-stick challenged, so don't be discouraged mouse-flyers, this game is for you too!\n\nI'm happy to see this genre being properly resurrected and so far so good.  My friends and I are really enjoying replaying the current limited content and looking forward to what this developer will deliver in the coming months.   A sound purchase at $13 US, support these guys.","March 24","true","31.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It's fun to fly, but it can get challenging at times. There are a number of flight modes, suiting novice and expert pilots. It's not a full simulator, but not arcade either, it's a good mix. The graphics are good and everything is very responsive. It's fun to play now and I assume it can only get better. My verdict? This early access game gets a 8 out of 10. It's good, but there is room to improve as well.\n\nMijn conclusie: Houd je van helikopters of vluchtsimulaties, dan is dit een uitstekend spel om te hebben. Een plezier om te vliegen, maar kan wel uitdagend zijn. Er zijn een aantal vluchtmodes, van beginnende piloot tot aan expert. Het is geen volledige simulator, maar ook geen arcade, het is een goede mix van beide. Grafisch is het spel goed en alles reageert prima. Het is nu al leuk om te spelen en zal, naar ik aanneem, alleen maar beter worden. Mijn beoordeling? Dit spel in vroegtijdige toegang krijgt can mij een 8 van de 10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Galileus/recommended/423490/","Galileus","[ShRv] Evil Cat Galileo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Galileus/","172 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far in EA, Air Missions: HIND lacks some polish, needs to change some fonts and get to do some serious work on the campaign aspect. Which is really not that bad for EA - especially since the hard part, flying, is aced. HINDs feel very good to fly. The line between arcade and simulation is set so that it's easy to get into - and yet you still get to enjoy helicopter-specific maneuverability. While you can play it like a "tank in 3d space" on easiest control mode, the highest one gives you enough realism to feel just right.\n\nAs of now (v0.63) the value proposal as-is is lacking - as can be expected in NA obviously. Nevertheless the game has really good prospects - with just a few additions of more "instant-action" missions replay-ability would jump through the roof. A few more options here, a few difficulty settings there, some challenges and new missions - is all the game needs, and the framework is already there and working.\n\nAll in all, while a lot of work and love is still needed, the game shows a very good promise and - more importantly - Dev team seems to be well within the ability to provide.","May 29","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have been flying hardcore, realistic flight sims for decades and thought that this might be too "arcade". It's not! You can adjust the settings to make it as you wish it to be. As a fixed wing guy, helos are strange critters to me but this makes it easy to get on to flying rotors. It's a good deal for the price and the learning curve to get started isn't steep. Great for those who don't have a lot of time to devote to mastering a sim. Even if there are no more updates, it's still a good deal.\n\nThese folks hit the sweet spot between arcade and realistic. Perfect choice of ride because the Hind is the big bad boy of helos. Runs great on Windows 10 without a high end graphics card. You can tweak the eye candy for what looks best and runs most smoothly with your rig.\n\nGo blow stuff up and have FUN!","May 17","true","17.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

I may have no experience with this kind of games as I played only one combat simulator before, but I easily recognize a good game when I play one and this is definitely one of those.\n\nAdvantages\nGraphics are not breathtaking, but still very nicely done and the models are pretty realistic\nBig variety of weapons to customize your helicopter\nDiversity of missions and surrounding makes it very interesting to play and quite hard to get bored of\nSounds are realistic and well done\nSteering is very good, whether it's on the keyboard and mouse or on the XBOX pad. Also the control over the vehicle is precise, it takes a while to master it but it's very rewarding\nMultiplayer has a huge potential, hope I'll get to try it out soon\nDevelopers are active and respond to any kind of feedback, it's always very nice to see it\nDisadvantages\nMusic is in very low quality and it's very repetitive\nMultiplayer is dead for now so there's no option to test out multiplayer or co-op. But the game is still fresh and early access so I think we can "turn a blind eye" to it\nI occurred few crashes, but the reasons are unknown\nSummary\nI'm not really a helicopters nor simulators enthusiast, so it's somehow new experience playing this kind of game and reviewing it, but from my point of view, the game is awesome! Control over chopper is smooth and feels realistic and controls overlay is thought through. Graphics are good, sounds are good, only music could use kind of an upgrade. One thing I can't wait for is multiplayer, I have a feeling that it's going to be big and awesome. Unfortunately, it's dead right now so we will wait a while for it to gain some publicity. The game is on Early Access right now so don't expect miracles and instantly an 3xA content, missions are fun and varied, but lacks any deeper content so there's still a long way full of updates to the finished game. But the good news was that developers are active, bug I occurred yesterday is fixed now, so I'm really looking forward to see how the game will develop soon. If you have 14 euro lying around, go for this game, it's worth for what it offers right now and will be even more worth for the full version of it.\n\nPersonal score\n8 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","March 26","true","4.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Not a hardcore SIM, nor is it totally Arcade. A nice Blend. You are flying the legendary Russian Mi-24 Hind, one of my favorite Birds ever. (The Mi-8 and KA-50 are in this game also, to fly)\n\nIt's still in development (Only 35% finished as of this writing), and it show's great promise already. The Game is stable and reasonably optimized at this development stage. My little i3 6100/GTX 950/Win10 Rig runs it just fine (always above 80Fps with a low's in the 50-60 Range) with no huge lag spikes or crashes. I play Co-op with a friend, and his older Q6700/GT 640/64-Win7 System has no issues as well.\n\nThe Graphics are overall good, but it's obvious the game is a work in progress.  Some texture's are muddy, some structure's are unfinished, Etc., and the HUD Model is an issue with thick green lines with no transparency. There are different Camera views in-flight, and they perfom well enough. This will improve with future patches, no doubt.\n\nPhysics are good.  For example: When fully loaded with Bombs, you can feel the weight affecting your flight performance. The Bird flys pretty much as you expect it should. The Audio quality is decent as well.\n\nThere are currently four modes of play: Single Player, Co-op (Up to three players as of now), Multiplayer, and Campaign.(12 Missions). Progressing in the campaign unlocks different weapons. (Gotta love the AT-6..whoop). I have had a lot of fun so far in Co-op.\n\nHardcore flight SIM Guys and Gals should give an abrupt PASS on this.This isn't DCS World and was never meant to be. DCS has a vertical learning curve, this is FAR more lateral and NOOB (Like me) friendly. It's a simple Rotary Wing combat game, that delivers a good time. I took a chance on it as I love Aviation and Combat games, and, again, the Co-op with a friend option was a big selling point. I wasn't disappointed as you might gather.\n\nCheck it out. Get in. Buckle up. Learn the Bird(s) a bit, and start blowin' S*** up!!  And besides, Steam has a great return policy..so NO excuses!!\n\nOverall: 7.8/10. "Firmly in the 'worth it for $17.00' category.\n\n**Following a twisty River at 220 MPH at 47 Feet altitude..10/10","June 6","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
