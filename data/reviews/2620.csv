Not that i was able at the time, but even then i believe morals would have got the better of me).\n\n-It takes me back to the days when such foul mouths would not spew fourth whatever vile word he was able to think of under the Sun without so much a clue to their meanings.\n\n-Of a time when the game was not riddled and infested with try-hards of the like.\n\n-When the game did not become another zombie game...i mean...hasn't that ♥♥♥♥ been worn out yet?\n\n-A time things increasingly got out of proportion with exo-suits and and other imo "uncesessary" crap.\n\n-Where the storyline is not you being some uber-badass superhearo and the storyline followed the common soldiers.\n\n-Where instead of regen-health you instead have a standard health bar and the healthpacks would be quite a distance away. Meaning instead of going ahead guns-ablazin' as if you are a rambo wannabe you have to use this thing called COVER. Yes...you are not rambo in this game.\n\n-It takes me back to a time where a good game was not just about the damn looks and more about the experience.\n\nCall of Duty was that game.\n\nLadies...Gentlemen and Squeakers of the franchise...I give you Genesis. The classic. The father figure which would be the foundation of the franchise we have all come know and love/hate (for me it will be the latter).\n\nIf you have come for the graphics, then just look elsewhere. Besides, you missed the bleedin point! Sure some of the voice acting may be a bit iffy and some of the animations may have you giggling a little, but all is forgivable. It's an old game so of course it will seem floppy compared to todays counterparts (wait...did i say counterparts?)\n\nThere are quite a lot of missions, but most of the time they are around 5-10 mins depending, though difficulty levels would perhaps set the time lengths a tad higher. You begin as an US Paratrooper and as you work your way through the game, also play the role of a British Commando and a Soviet Conscript in the appropiate theatres.\n\nFor those, like me, who played COD when it was great in the days, and want to feel those nostalgic moments walking down memory lane with this game, well...what the hell are you waiting for? Get it! Even if you never have played this in your younger years (or were unable to for legit reasons such as being confined to a crib or whatever), i would still recommend it for if you would like to know the roots of the COD franchise.\n\nBefore i go though...one last thing. I would like to make a toast to a game that was great for its time and is still kicking a bit out of the tank all these years on. To the game that would spawn one of the best known franchises which has, sadly, fallen into a shadow of it's former glory. Oh and Captan Price...you magnificant sonofa♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nCheers! *clink's glass and drink's with a bitter thought of that i will never have such memories again.*\n\n...\n\nOn a side note...call me whatever profanity you want to call me for seemingly hating on the modern series. I'll admit, i might be abyssmal at them. But spawning sequels year in year out has a tendancy to get...repetitive.","November 8, 2015","true","4.8"," 189 of 203 people (93%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","93","189","203","45","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/2620/","Sweatbandz","A_Sweatband","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/","254 products in account","Call of Duty is very different from modern Call of Duty games. It doesn't have regenerating health, it has a different game engine, combat flows differently, and you are a regular soldier, not a super soldier or super agent.\n\nThe campaign follows three nations battle against the Third Reich and their constantly growing military. You play as Americans, British and Russian soldiers in different battles against different groups of the massive Nazi Army. As the American solider, you are fighting in France in a desperate battle to claim land and villages from the Nazi's, as the British, you go from standard soldier to SAS agent, and charge on Stalingrad as a Russian soldier starting as a lowly conscript and end as a senior soldier. In the campaign, you never feel invincible, and unlike modern Call of Duty games, you will almost always have a large amount of soldiers with you, rather than going alone or with a single invincible commanding officer. This doesn't make the game easier however, the lack of regenerating health means that it is unwise to carelessly move, especially on higher difficulties where having low health and no health kits for another mile can make the games campaign brutally difficult.\n\nThe soundtrack is a high-point for the game as well, with memorable themes. The voice acting is far from modern Call of Duty's Hollywood voice acting, but then again, it can stand with it as an equal because nearly all the Call of Duty games have bad voice acting (minus Kevin Spacey, he was the best part of Advanced Warfare of course!). The sound effects hold up to players because they were re-used for several more games, and as they stand, they aren't exactly low-quality.\n\nVisually, the game has aged since release, with odd faces, bad animations and low-resolution environment textures. The gun models are noticeably lower detail compared to Call of Duty 2's models as well. Despite this, the visuals only get in the way if you decide to only focus on them. The engine is clearly quite old, but the game runs well on modern computers for most of the time. The only real annoyance is the lack of support for most resolutions, meaning that .cfg configurations are needed to run in resolutions such as 1920x1080.\n\nDespite its problems, Call of Duty still stands as one of the best in the series, the game may be visually aged, it may lack the narrative focus of later games, but it stands taller because it focuses more on spectacular battles and large set pieces instead of plot and the excessive use of QTE's. I ultimately recommend this game to anyone who loves Call of Duty to see how the series should be done, and lovers of the genre as Call of Duty, and its expansion pack, United Offensive make the best the series. A stellar game, and a brilliant starting point for a series that has unfortunately lost its way.","February 19, 2015","true","6.1"," 110 of 114 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","110","114","8","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/2620/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Call of Duty is a first person shooter set in World War 2. We start off as a simple American rookie in boot camp where we are thought the basics of crawling, shooting and reloading. Before you know it you are sent right to the heat of battle and left to fend for yourself as your allies are too busy trying to survive to help the recruit. It was a pretty cool intro that immediately reminds you that you are just a simple soldier not John Rambo. There is no regenerating health but instead you must rely on health kits to restore your health. It forces you to play much more smartly and knowing when to duck and hide while letting your allies take the fatal wounds in your stead.  You are very rarely alone and will have allies watching your back throughout most of the battles.\n\nUnfortunately your allies can prove to be just as fatal to your as the enemies. They will occasionally block your path while you are under fire and have a habit of looking into your barrel while you are trying to line up a shot. You are not allowed to shoot them since the gun won't fire when you aim at them but they somehow find ways to get killed by your bullets. They are not completely awful and will frequently save your life but they can be quite a burden at times. Later on you will also play through the eyes of a British and Russian solider which have completely different feel and take place simultaneously to the American war efforts.\n\nEach nation has their own unique set of weapons but the Germans use different guns so you will run out of ammo and have to rely on scavenged German weapons in all three campaigns. The British campaign is the weak point of the three as you will usually be “infiltrating” some place but it always ends up with you killing tons upon tons of enemies by yourself or with a few allies which feels very out of place from the chaos of the other two campaigns. Chaos is where the Russian campaign exceeds. It is very brutal and you better pay attention to what people are saying and duck when you hear them say so or you will without a doubt die. Your comrades won't even equip you with a gun, just a round of ammo and tell you to run up a hill where the Russians are being slaughtered by the dozens. Gods help you if you stop running to collect a gun and some more ammo, they will assume that you are a coward  that froze up and gun you down killing all sense of comradery between you and the people at your back.\n\nGun play is top notch and is very fluid. All the guns feel unique and sound very powerful. It is truly a pleasure to the ears to hear the battle around you and  everything comes together to be very immersive. The Germans have far superior aim than your allies and it can be annoying how accurate they are with anything in their hands including mounted machine guns. Your allies are pretty capable when they are rushing toward the enemy but as soon as they are stationary they suddenly have the aim of a drunk Stormtrooper. You are equally as accurate as the enemy with most guns and are capable of leaning sideways without moving which is very useful. Up to two weapons of your choice can be carried along with your pistol and grenades. It does present a problem when there are tanks in the area and you are forced to carry one since your allies are always extremely reliant on you even if the anti-tank launcher is right next to them.\n\nGraphics are obviously dated and it does not support modern resolutions out of the box. You will have to tweak the config files a bit for HD. It is surprisingly pretty tame on violence. There is no gore and the only blood is a small burst when shot that quickly evaporates. Music is great, sound effects are incredible and voice acting is pretty good too minus the Russians. Multiplayer is only played by a few dozen people and it's alright. Nothing special but it is pretty fun though expect a challenge from the veterans that still play this game. You will not be on foot throughout all of the campaign, you control a tank for a brief mission and will have to occasionally shoot out of a moving vehicle. The latter can be a bit frustrating since you do not regain health and have no way to avoid damage other than shooting them before they fire a shot at you.\n\nThis is still a great title that holds up well to this day. The only feature that would be odd to modern FPS gamers is the health kits required to survive but other than that you should be able to fit right in. All the things that make a game like graphics, sound effects and gameplay work very well with each other in this title and it makes it a immersive and brutal experience throughout. This is definitely not the Call of Duty to get if you want to play multiplayer though. Outside of the campaign there is nothing else to do and there is no incentive to replay it again so it is the type of game were you play through it once and delete it. It is one hell of a ride though and  highly recommended to those seeking a single player World War 2 experience.","May 21, 2015","true","9.3"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","51","55","9","0"

The gameplay is FUN, the guns are awesome, and feel great., the weapon you will be using the most is the MP40, its powerfull, all troops carry it, and plentifull ammo. Now cod is split into 3 campaigns, i will review each.\n\nThe Americans\n\nThe worst, its basicly a tutorial, gets you in the ropes, but the only redemming quality is the revisted last mission, were you sabotage V2 rockets.\n\nThe British\n\n2nd best, lots of sabotage, airdroping into the french country side, and plus Captain Price.\n\nThe Russians (Putin Aproved)\n\nThe best, INTENSE FIGHTS, difficult, and the ending is amazing (if youve beat you will know what i mean)\n\nThe Multiplayer\n\nIts okay, but you cant change/mod the FOV, so that sucks.\n\nOver all Call Of Duty Is What I "Call" A FPS Game, i Reccomend Buying It In The Warchest Bundle, Comes With COD:UO And COD 2. I Absolutly Recommend This. 8.8/10","November 26, 2014","true","20.9"," 66 of 86 people (77%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","77","66","86","17","0"

This isn’t that bad, but on Veteran, there are no health packs, and the AI and situations can be unforgiving (to put it mildly).\n\n-The graphics are not the best. Not that this is actually a bad thing, but the character models live in the uncanny valley, and are difficult to look at.\n\n-Somewhat repetitive, but this can be overlooked because you’re actually playing though different parts of the second world war.\n\n-The tag line was “no one fights alone”, but because the AI was still pretty weak, there are some missions in which you operate almost entirely alone (say 1 out of 3?).\n\n-Some areas have respawning enemies, which can make advancement difficult.\n\n-The saving system in this game makes it a little difficult to just pick up and play one or two missions.\n\nPositives:\n-You generally have more control over your character than later installments (Black Ops through Ghosts), and are not forced to watch as many cutscenes or set pieces (they do still exist though).\n\n-It’s not trying to be dark, gritty, and mature. It’s just trying to be a fun game.\n\n-You really do feel like you’re in the middle of pretty epic battles, when they happen.\n\n-Harder difficulties are actually hard.\n\nBottom line: I had a lot of fun with the different weapons and scenarios, and can forgive its mistakes because it was the studio’s first project.","November 3, 2014","true","14.8"," 70 of 100 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","70","100","5","4"

It's been just over 10 years since I played this game last. It looks like it is running on Quake III Engine as were many games of its time. Based on WWII, you play as the Allies; US, UK and the Soviets. Use guns of the time, drive tanks, shoot with Panzers, anti tank rifles, even get shot by Soviet Sargents for running like a coward (as they were told at that time to keep on advancing, don't turn back or you will be shot) - even the fact that the soviets were either given a rifle or ammo was there! This is the Call of Duty without auto health regeneration, you have to find those health packs. Towards the end of the game, some footage is shown (although later CODs like Call of Duty: World at War has more footage). I wouldn't expect Multiplayer to exist. I'm giving a thumbs up because I like this game, liked it before too, otherwise the story is pretty short for the value for money.","April 27, 2015","true","6.1"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","28","32","6","0"

When someone told me about Call of Duty, which was still a WWII FPS at the time, not the overblown FPS that apparently changed the Game Industry we know today. I played the Original Xbox version of Big Red One, and loved it. Much like other WWII FPSes like Medal of Honor and Battlefield, I love this too!\n\nCall of Duty is a first person shooter game that, unlike the recent titles, focuses on shooting and killing things than making it look like some silly interactive movie. The shooting and kill is essentially artilleries, tanks, at some cases, turrets, not where you are stuck with it, it is optional that you use it but recommended if you want to take down large waves of enemies. Artilleries are also opitional but should be used at all cost with tanks, or in some cases, use a bomb given to you to destroy things. In some cases with WWII games, you are in a airplane doing things to destroy buildings that support the enemies, which is satisfying to see the destruction of the buildings.\n\nAside from that, it's a great game, infitnitely better than the recent Call of Duty games in the recent years.

There are car chase's and secret missons and mass attacks, and its all more realistic then QTE gubbins and granade spam.

A cinematic Wartime FPS that will throw you into the heat of world war 2. One thing I love about this game, is you feel like a soldier. Like you are participating in something bigger than you. Other FPS games throws you into the shoes of the only person who can single handedly save the world. This is more realistic, as all the people you play through the single player campaign is just a cog in a machine.\n\nEasily one of the better games in the CoD franchise, and while the graphics have dated somewhat, it's still an amazing game that has aged surprisingly well.

I was always more taken towards the Medal of Honor series, because it was original, and the first of its kind. Subsequently some of the development team went their own way, and thus created Call of Duty.\n\nI have to say, given the amount of time this has been out, and it's only taken 12 years for me to 'give in' and give CoD a shot, because I've always seen the game-series itself 'tarnished' by it's more modern work, especially all this guff being created with advanced-advanced-advanced warfare.\nThe series itself of CoD, is more robust, proper and rooted properly with their earlier work. Subsequently- this makes the mark, and makes it an honour to play such a game.\n\nAlright, into the nitty-gritty. It's a game, alright from 2003.... graphics are going to be limited- bear in mind this was awesome stuff from back in the day, stuff which was top of its peak.\nPerformance wise, on a semi-good/mid-range rig. It works. It's amazing. Everything can be maxxed out without any hinderence. I would assume it can also work on a potato. Not even that, a stone. Dirt. Sand. I dunno.... Donald Trump?\n\nIt's a great game, runs smoothly, does its job, offers challenging and exciting missions. As well as being historically rigourous when it comes to uniforms and the storyline itself- to an extent. You do get the off bluff of 'destroying hundreds upon hundreds of soldiers in one small area' sort of guff.\n\nOther than that. It's amazing. Wonderful. Brilliant. I thouroughly recommend it!","December 23, 2015","true","6.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

After the first couple of Medal of Honor games, some of the people who made it splintered off to form a company called Infinity Ward.  This is Infinity Wards first game.  It did not take long for this game to become known as the new high mark for single player WW II gameplay.  It's a little dated at this point, but if you can forgive the graphics, it is still a great WW 2 game.  Playing as the Russian who has to wait for the guy ahead of him to die to get a gun is certainly interesting.  You also play as  American soldier, and a British Military officer.  This game spawned a still thriving dynasty.  It's worth checking out.","March 15, 2014","true","16.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ok the good, COD world at war and COD 2 played like a charm on my PC. now the bad COD played all the way up till Stalingrad and that was it for some reason, it would play the boat sequence, but I couldnt control my player and as a result during the Stuka Strafing run I had no control and was just killed I shut it down I reloaded, same result, I dont know why I couldnt stand , jump , crawl, nothing, and as for United Offensive, plainly and simply dont work ,does not work, I have windows 10, a brand new gaming PC, it flat out doesnt work, So its COD warchest is a mixed bag, I just picked up COD 3 on XBox 360 for like $5.00 USED.

It's SO HARD.  I set the game on normal, I'm not sure if it glitched and turned it to insane because man, that enemy AI is so flipping good, everything is BS.\n\nI had to hold this building down that I just killed loads of germans to take back.  So after already killing 40 of them to get this building, I now have to kill another 100 guys plus 6 tanks.  Not at the same time of course but within like 6 minutes.  They just keep coming, to take down the tanks there are 2 anti tank rifles places at crappy places, one of them is right where the enemys are coming up so you are screwed if that ONE guy covering two stair cases die, so you have to fight and kill as many of them as you can so he doesn't die while trying to take out tanks when they show up, and you have to figure out which place the tank spawns to go to which ever rifle meanwhile protecting that guy.\n\nBut guess what?  After me saving his ♥♥♥ and there's only a minute left, he throws a ♥♥♥♥ing GRENADE.... right at his feet and he just curls up in a F**CKING ball and BLOWS UP!!!!  After all that, after me working so hard to save him, he just kills himself, and right after that a German comes up the stairs and KILLS ME.  So I restart and do it all over again, I get passed it and 10 of our tanks show up... when we already killed everyone.  WHAT?!\n\nSo then we go onto the next mission, it spawns you without much info and you instantly have to kill people, I mean instantly you're in a fire fight.  You then go through buildings getting COMPLETELY screwed over, using most of your ammo, running out of health with the most crazy ai that shoot you so badly and omg they're just so good.  I barely find health and most of teammates die\n\nAfter killing the guys and you're about to get to the next bit, a few more of your new teammates show up replacing the ones that die and then you get to this really stupid bit.  I thought I was done the stupidness but it just got even worse.  I got to this trainyard where there were loads of enemys and artillary fire was hitting us.  And guess what?  My teammates are talking and it's actually OUR guys that our shooting at this location, and they said they don't even know we're here, and they also said even if they did know, they probably would shoot here anyways?  WHAT?\n\nSo I'm in this place, the Germans are everywhere and owning the crap out of me and then guess what, I run out of ammo on my sniper and my sub machine gun but luckily I killed most of them so it takes all I got to take out that last guy... while I was killing the last guy, I could see 10 green dots around the corner and loads of gun shots, I come around to see what the fus is about and... there's a tank, and only one of my guys left.\n\nLUCKILY there's a rocket right there so I use it to destroy the tank.  YEY, oh wait, there's like 20 Germans in that hanger that are the best flipping guys ever, I swear they were all Rambo.  So I go back and find a sniper on the ground.   I go to the hanger and start trying to hit these shots but man is it hard, they're so good and I manage to kill at least 10 of them.  My teammate runs in there and actually survives and is in there shooting them but I'm still back here trying to kill the remaining guys that are behind all these pillars in there.  I finally stick my head out to see the few last guys and I get shot 5 times in less than a millisecond and DIE.  RESTART from the start of the trainyard.  I quit right away.\n\n\n\nI'm going to be back and I will beat this but OMG this game was a lot of fun until Jason Statham showed up.  Once I saw him it was like the game changed to insane.  It was so much fun.  I'll give this game that though, It's a war simulator.  I mean I feel like crap, I feel so stressed and feel so tense.  I do recommend this game, but just play the first few missions and then get out of here because WW2 was kinda fun for like 30 minutes, but once it comes to it, it was horrible.\n\n\nBelow is after 30 minutes of gameplay\n\nI've only played a bit more than half an hour, already hooked.  The first Call of Duty I played was Black Ops.  That game is awesome, but this game is better.  I'm so sad that I never played this one before.  You know why this is so much better?  NO FUTURE CRAP.  You move as a unit, you feel like you're REALLY there, staying together, moving together.  Just so good!  You know what's also good?  Being able to have to primary weapons PLUS a sidearm.  How all games should be.  Not sure why they took this out of the one later in the series.  STUPID.\n\nThis game feels like if they kept going in this direction, they would have WW2 SIMULATOR DOWN.  I mean this is so good that it's 3 am, tired as heck and I was still in 100% wide awake feeling like I'm really there.  I'm sad to say I've played Black Ops 3 and Advanced Warfare... I didn't buy them, played through a friend and WOW are they just bad.  If I wanted to ♥♥♥♥ing jump around like that I'd play Destiny or something, how could they call the newer ones Call of Duty?  More like SH*T Duty.  I mean imagine this game, with 2016 graphics?  WOULDN'T THAT BE THE BEST?  But naw, let's keep going into this future crap, everyone wants that!  NOT.","December 26, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

And after the 2nd one, I played 4, WaW, Black Ops, Modern Warfare 2, and I think that's it so far. So I was actually a bit surprised at how similar the British SAS missions were to the SAS missions in the later games. I was expecting a plain and simple war game comparable to the slightly superior Call of Duty 2.\n\nI will say this though, I wish the Russians weren't pegged as the enemies all the time in the new ones as their campaigns in the WWII games always end up being the best, except for the beach invasion in CoD 2, that might be one of the most memorable missions from the WWII games. That said, this is a classic game; one that should be played by all FPS enthusiasts and especially enthusiasts of WWII games. It was a game changer with multiplayer and the anchor in the Call of Duty series; without the success of the first one, it wouldn't be the franchise it is today.\n\nWonky animations though.\n\n9.0/10","November 11, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As I felt with Call of Duty 2, it was kind of a boring FPS that I only really liked because of its World War 2 setting and mainly Russian campaign. Now, it was not a bad game at all, just some missions were more like a chore than anything else, but that is what I expect from a Call of Duty game. I really respect this game for turning into a great franchise for at least a little bit and making the World War 2 FPS more of a thing like Medal of Honor originally did before it. Though I still prefer the earlier Medal of Honor games to the early Call of Duty ones, I think this game was still a solid WW2 FPS and it gets a 7/10 from me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nick930930/recommended/2620/","Nick930930","Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nick930930/","256 products in account","So I watched Band of Brothers recently for the first time and absolutely loved it. Then I remembered vaguely that this original Call of Duty game had a mission at the beginning where you're part of the 101st Airbourne on D-Day and thought it might be cool to play through that mission and see how similar it was to the movie. It's identical. Infinity Ward didn't even try to shy away from the fact that they borrowed heavily from "Band of Brothers" in their very first in a massively successful franchise, Call of Duty. I mean, there are lines in the cutscenes that are directly from the movie. So this Call of Duty is essentially the Band of Brothers video game and the first couple missions let you personally experience those epic moments like fighting through the trenches on D-Day as you work to destroy the artillery guns. Unfortunetly, this game has not aged well.\n\nThe graphics are likely the first thing you'll notice when you boot this game up. The game requires you to edit the config.ini file just to put in an HD resolution, and even then the textures, models, and animations are severely dated. They were fantastic for their time, don't et me wrong. But they just did not age as well as some of the later games. Explosions are weak, the gun is awkwardly small compared to the screensize, and all of your fellow soldiers will waddle around like their pants are falling off which really pulls you out of the experience. The graphics aren't the only thing that didn't age well though.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints about this game are the terrible British campaign missions. Instead of giving us more epic largescale World War II battles, Infinity Ward felt it necessary to sprinkle in a whole lengthy and boring campaign of almost solo missions where you infilitrate Nazi supply depots, hydroelectric dams, and battleships and just absolutely obliterate hundreds of nazis by yourself. These missions are typical of shooters back in the day, which is a shame because Call of Duty is revolutionary for its contribution to the idea of having larger open battles with more friendly AI fighting alongside you. Thankfully the game comes back to full strength in the final campaign that features the Russians reclaiming stalingrad and eventually capturing Berlin. The crossing of the river into Stalingrad is as epic as any D-Day mission with tons of soldiers storming the beach and plenty of gunfire, artillery, and planes flying overhead. It really was surprising to see a mission of this scale put into a game this old.\nAnother major problem with this game is the outdated health system. It's a static health bar that will only replenish if you find healthpacks that are scattered throughout the missions. There's at least 3 different types of health packs that give you varying amounts of health. The problem with this system is that even one shot from an enemy submachine gun will drop your health down to half or even lower and the game barely does anything to let you know how close you are to death. Dying becomes so frequent and frustrating that it turns into a game of absolute luck, running from cover to cover and spamming F5 to quicksave the game. The health system wouldn't be as bad if not for the overly difficult enemy AI. I played on the "Hardened" difficulty which is not even the hardest setting, and whenever I peaked out to get a view at a Nazi soldier, they instantly are aware that I can see them and stop everything they're doing and start firing directly at me, even if there's allied soldiers standing right next to them. The same is true for enemy tanks and enemy MG42 machine gun nests. If you peak out of a corner to shoot at one of these enemies, you have about half a second before they turn their gun and start perfectly firing at you, and once that happens, your screen will continuously jump upwards preventing you from landing a shot on the enemy. Not to mention enemies generally take more than 1 shot to kill which can be frustrating when you're stuck with mostly bolt-action rifles.\nFinally, there's no sprint button. I know this was back in the day when sprinting was not expected in shooter games, but it feels really absent in a war game that requires a lot of cover-to-cover movement. Oh! And friendly allied units can accidentally shoot you in the back and kill you, which happens very frequently. Never in all of the shooter games that I have ever played have I ever found a game where your own friendly units can shoot you in the back and actually kill you. That is an impossibly stupid design choice.\n\nSo despite the graphical shortcomings, the poorly designed middle campaign, and the outdated gameplay mechanics, Call fo Duty is a classic that features some intense battles from World War II and a great game to help you relive the experiences (albeit very watered down and unrealistic in comparison) that are represented more acturetly in "Band of Brothers."","July 19, 2015","true","7.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

AI-controlled squadmates? That was here baby. "Ramirez DO EVERYTHING?" This game pioneered that.\n\nThe hardest time I had with the game was the fact that there is no sprint key, So you feel like you are running a lot slower than other CoD games, Oh and theres no regenerating health, which means getting shot is punishing. And you will die. A lot. The enemies in this game can still be tough little buggers frequently. But thats also what makes the game rewarding.\n\nFlaws? Oh the game has them, Some are simply due to the age of the game, such as enviornments feeling quite linear and the draw distance feeling very low, these are just due to technical limitations of the day. THe bigger flaws to me would be that sometimes inputs are very.. picky.. on when they want to do what you need, and sometimes you seem to get stuck on debris. Also some areas feel very "narrow" and you end up hitting a corner. Oh and the squad AI, as innovative as it was back then, is still pretty bloody bad, I've watched them grenade each other or me from time to time. But hey these dont detract from the immense fun and challenge this game provides. And to me the missions in this one ended up being the ones I remembered the most.\n\nGet it, You wont regret it","June 24, 2014","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Let's start this up with the first one then.\n\nSo let's just get this over with from the start, the original Call of Duty is a classic and a great game. That said, i think people overrate it waaay above of where it actually stands. First off, the game has a pretty crappy story which is basically just composed of different missions in the second world war. The gunplay is fun, but feels a little weak compared to many other games of the era. Remember that this game came out in 2003 and by that we already could have had fun with the Venom Gun in Return to Castle Wolfenstein for two years.\n\nThe game includes a total of three different campaigns. One for each of the British, US, and Soviet factions. Funnily enough, you only fight the Nazis in this game regardless. Which makes the campaigns rather similar besides from having different weaponry at your disposal. Remember that this was before they got the series staple regenerating health, so the missions can be vastly different from one another. At one point you are playing a generic CoD sandbag mission and the next you have to kill 100 dudes alone in a bunker, which makes it really odd and unbalanced honestly.\n\nAlthough this might sound like a bit of ranting, i did have fun with the game. Especially once they introduced the Sturmgewehr 44 as a weapon, that gun is pretty awesome and i highly recommend picking it up whenever possible. And while i said the missions can be a mixed bag, they also bring out something the later CoD games are missing. Variety. Which made the game a breeze to play through. The game took me around 6 hours to beat, but it's really all in the player. I found it a tad too easy for my tastes on the regular difficulty, but then again i didn't have to save scum at all.\n\nI guess i should give these a score rating since i'll be going through the entire series.\n\nOn a scale of 44 Nazi helmets being good, and 5 million dead jews being bad. I'll give this game a rating of "Certified Tiger Tank"\n\nIt's pretty good fun for what it lasts, but don't buy it for the full price on Steam. 20€ for a game this old is just ludicrous.","June 24, 2015","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Developed by Infinity Ward (members that left 2015 Inc. to form their own studio after the development of Medal of Honor Allied Assault) this is their vision of war.\n\nThis game took heavy inspiration from the developer's previous title (Medal of Honor Allied Assault) and so some elements may seem similar if you played their previous title you'll see some similarities such as standard health and the classic espionage mission that was in a lot of WWII games at the time. However this game contained three shorter campaigns with different soldiers in different armies and it's quite cool fighting in France, Russia, Germany etc. Graphically it won't wow you but there are some really good set pieces with the Russian campaign being the best as it was quite brutal going out into battle without a weapon. Music is nice and gameplay wise it's great. I was playing Black Ops II alongside it and my favourite thing about the earlier Call of Duty titles and FPS games in general was that you could usually go at your own pace. No waiting for characters to talk your ear off for half the game. Maybe a sentence or two then off you go! The game is linear but gives you a long enough leash that it doesn't fully hold you back compared to the more mordern titles. Shooting is fun and responsive, you have some good weapon variety and you feel like a soldier just trying to survive and do his duty... THE CALL OF DUTY! :P\n\nAs a WWII shooter it's fun, the only problems I have is that it's a little short and I wasn't able to find a game in the multiplayer. This game at most goes on sale for 50% off so don't expect a great deal. Is it worth playing? Depends if you like WWII shooters and if you don't mind a short but fun campaign. If you do get it I'm sure you'll have a good time with it. I give this game 7.5/10","August 7, 2015","true","6.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Despite the age, the atmosphere is briliant, action is frenetic and you are really "there" (if you can swallow that arcade style, but come on, its CoD). Missions are well written, ai is... manageable. Overall it would realy be nice game. But the bugs.\n\nSometimes you need to restart whole level several times, because some quest, despite being done, does not finish itslelf. Sometimes it works. But right in the beginning, third or forth mission - Taking a bridge at Caen...\n\nI take the bridge, kill the tank and have to clear all Jerries - three are "nowhere" to be found. After 10 minute searching I snipe two standing figures ny shooting to their revealed hand. The last one is not in my LoS. Restart level (as actualy killing yourself or your officer does you move only to last check point where the bug "already is"). I get the bridge, kill the tank, kill all germans and my officer will not end the quest. Restart level, I get the bridge, tank comes, but I cannot go to kill him, becasue the engineer who must go with me, is "inactive". Restart level. Get the bridge, kill the tank, kill the germans, officer does not move. Restart level,get the bridge, kill the tank, cannot find 2 jerries...

Sort of like having a bipolar girlfriend.\nSo, I have mixed feelings on this.  On one hand I'd like to recommend the game, but on the other, I wouldn't.\nI like the WW11 setting.  I get a feel for the atmosphere.  But the gameplay is extremely irritating.  Enemies are bullet sponges.  You can't mow them down with a machine gun or at close range with your primary weapon.  Most times, after 3 or 4 shots, they fall to the ground only to get back up, brush themselves off and continue fighting you.  A couple times I found myself reloading after what I thought was a kill (close range 3 rounds into the enemy) and during my reload animation the a$$ hat got back up and killed me.  WTF???  Anyways, now I know better.  I make sure they're dead before reloading.\nI found hit detection to be a problem, as well.  I've shot numerous rounds at enemies that were directly in my sight and found myself having to compensate to make hits.\nThe most annoying part is your team/allies.  They get in your way and can get you killed.  There's nothing like walking through a corridor or staircase with a member of your squad directly following behind you.  As you turn a corner you find yourself in conflict and want to retreat back around the corner.  But you can't because your a$$ hat teammate is humping your leg and won't back off.  *Dead*  So I always let that f****r go first if possible.  When you need a quick escape, you can bet there will be someone, somewhere, that will get in your way.\nFor a war game, first of it's kind or not, I am struck with awe that there is no way to sprint.  I am talking about the original COD here and how it was originally designed.  I served in the Army, and one of the first things they teach you in basic training is the 3-5 second rush.  So, needless to say I was very irritated trying to advance from point to point  without being able to rush for cover.  This may be a minor gripe, but I feel it's important to have something like that in a war game.  I can't understand why it wasn't there.  Oh well, let me walk to this cover point while I get shot up.  Need a health pack?  Let me walk over to the health and hope I don't die in route.  Sometimes you'll grab a health pack only to get shot the f**k up in the second it took you to turn around to take cover.\n\nI somewhat like the game, and like I said, only playing it to play through the franchise.  I had high hopes for it since it was given a lot of praise.  But I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to do what I'm doing or are a fan of COD and haven't played it yet.","January 12","false","10.9"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","0"

You sit hunched down among 20 other comrades in a small, beat-up wooden raft, your only protection from the rain a worn red tarp full of holes flapping in the wind above your head. Your superiors circle around your small pit with machine guns and shout with a megaphone about reclaiming the motherland. German fighter planes strafe the rafts and blow them apart one at a time, until only yours remains. Some of your friends attempt to dive into the water, and your superiors turn around and shoot them. Your boat just manages it to make it to the opposite dock, where wounded Russians are being treated in a makeshift hospital. You line up with the rest of the survivors and pass a checkpoint, where the man in front of you is given a gun, and you are given five bullets. You have no weapon. With that, you begin running forward and almost immediately get knocked down by a mortar shell, and with your head swimming and your ears ringing, you continue up a hill as if in slow motion, where a long row of German machine gun nests lie in wait. You watch flag carriers and unarmed soldiers get mowed down around you, and you know your only option is to continue your suicidal advance. It's a unique set piece that I have not experienced in any other WWII shooter.\n\nThe rest of the game bored me. It's an important piece of FPS history and is the origin of many systems and styles still in use today. Yet while it remains very playable and occasionally exciting, there's nothing here you haven't done better countless times since.","September 14, 2014","false","5.9"," 17 of 95 people (18%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","18","17","95","4","0"

Although CoD 9 is nearing release the ideas on display here are still widely used in the newer titles: you are one of many, not a superman capable of winning the conflict by yourself, -your experience is more of a physical person on the field and not a floaty-gun moving about, and the enemy isn't all out to get YOU and ONLY you.\n\nUnfortunately you will always be shunted through heavily scripted events to the point where you aren't so much navigating the game as just moving from one whack-a-mole experience to another. The guns are varied, the shooting sort of satisfying, and the environments can have memorable character at times. Sadly you will be frustrated as the game punishes you for following the scripting exactly, and despite the insistence that you are not Rambo your comrades can do diddly if you don't carry the lion's share of the burden.\n\nStory and presentation are king here. Gameplay is fun evenso.","September 12, 2011","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquid_courage/recommended/2620/","liquid_courage","liquid courage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquid_courage/","448 products in account","Call of Duty is easily the best WWII game on Steam. The levels feel exciting, the music provides an excellent complement to the atmosphere; the level design and AI is great.  The levels are all set pieces unto themselves, featuring a nice variety of scenery and objectives: shoot down planes, take out tanks, and kill Nazis by the scores. But I can’t really do justice to the game. The greatest strength of Call of Duty is that the game play feels both immaculately paced. Each mission feels like a fleshed out conflict that changes over the course of your playthrough, and the soundtrack lends each mission an air of significance. For its time, Call of Duty had some truly impressive set pieces. Each of the three campaigns brings a unique perspective and its own dynamics to the game, as the Americans seem to favor running and gunning over the Russian campaign, which feels more like a war of attrition. The first mission for the Russian army is perhaps one of the most intense I’ve played so far. As the Russian Army suffers heavy losses you make it out onto the battlefield without so much as a gun at your disposal. You dart through gun fire, saved ironically by Nazi artillery, which exposes a building. After taking the building by force, an artillery strike is called in. The salvos leave the several Nazi tanks in shambles, as the few Russian troops left scurry across the remains of a square in Stalingrad, you feel like you've actually pushed back the Nazi invasion.","January 13, 2013","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Many of the missions were quite poor and involved simply going from point A to B with no real stand out moment or climax, several times i had to ask myself "is that it?" when the mission ended. Honestly thought the game was underwhelming and it would have left me disappointed only for the final mission (the storming of the reichstag, though nothing compared to its counterpart mission in World at War, was awesome) and the russian lads speech in the final cutscene. Also the "No cows were harmed in the making of this game" disclaimer which i found quite witty. Overall it wasn't terrible but still a shadow of the latter releases, granted it was released in 2003 but COD 2 in my opinion offers a vastly more enjoyable campaign.\nEDIT: I know it's irrelevant from a reviewing standpoint, but Danny O' Dwyer said the mission I mentioned above was the first time he cried while playing a video game.","May 3, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The longevity and multiple entries into the series are a continual cause of debate, argument and even insult. And it all started here in 2003 with the very first entry.\n\nI'll keep it relatively brief here since I go into a lot more detail in my episode on Call of Duty for my web series Knee-Deep in the Dead (found HERE).\n\nCoD sets you up in three different campaigns, American, Russian and British and was one of the first FPSes to really work towards a larger, battlefield experience. Two levels that showcase this goal the best are the invasion and defense of Sainte-Mère-Église in the American Campaign, and the Battle of Stalingrad in the Russian campaign.\n\nThe sound design and environments are one of the best stand outs of Call of Duty. The guns are all loud and reflect their real-world counterparts. Some negatives would largely be the very baseline AI, lack of enemy variety and the fact that, even when you have allies around you, enemies more often than not target you.\n\nCall of Duty is a fascinating object of study when it comes to evaluation of the evolution of a game series. In playing the first entry, you can see all of the budding elements that would eventually become core "staples" of the campaign: scripting, having to wait for sergeant to boot down the door, press "F" to do thing, simple AI and stories seemingly assembled solely for the set pieces. Also, a side note is that it seems a /bit/ overpriced on Steam...$20 for a 12-year old game is kind of silly. You'd likely be better off getting the War chest, since it has the expansion pack to CoD and Call of Duty 2. Which has one of my favorite CoD levels ever, the Battle of Pointe du Hoc.\n\nNevertheless, the first Call of Duty is an important entry in the series to play, though it's much easier without nostaliga goggles and truly seeing it for what it was: an immersive, action shooter that helped ensure the FPS genre kept fighting WWII for 6-7 years afterwards.","October 13, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even for the time it came out, the graphics were nothing special, and the gameplay is linear. The British and American campaigns feel like you're watching (playing?) a B-movie. That said, the Russian campaign so superb that it made me read up on Stalingrad and subscribe to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History. The Russian campaign in particular does a good job of making you feel like you're engaged in a noble cause, a fight much bigger than yourself. It will also remind you that real war is very, very deadly.","January 24","true","10.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Either this of CoD2. I'll need to play CoD2 some more and then I'll pass my final judgement. But you may ask "Why, Birdman? Why is this better than the UBER 1337 H4X0Rness of MW3?" Well, Johnny Consolefag, it's largely due to a little thing I like to call "Mr. Grenade." You see, Johnny, In this game things like the knife and the grenade are selectable weapons, so there's not just an instant grenade and knife button. Which is a good thing in and of itself. But when using the grenade, walking around with it in your hand, you are allowed to use it for melee. That's right, you can beat Nazi's to death with a grenade. Take this explosive projectile fragmenting ball of democracy and 'MERICA!, and slam it into the skull of WWII German Nazi scum to smash the life right out of their body. But, it's pretty BS that Activision or whatever are being such hard-asses for cash, that it's still $20. This is seriously a $5 or $10 game these days.","December 27, 2011","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezerk/recommended/2620/","rezerk","rezerK❃","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezerk/","62 products in account","One of the greatest game ever made. In my opinion the best among those of second world war. The gameplay is fast despite you can't run, but the possibility to lean and shoot quite precisely during jumping enrich the experience. Have a life bar to care about, means that you must be more careful in you movements. This guarantee a deeper experience and force the player to thought more before every action. Turn a corner in the wrong way (in high difficulty), will certain death. What about the story... it's beautiful, not the best ever made, but still beautiful. I appreciate the theatricality of some moments like the landing of russian campaign.\nAt the end, if you play it now you must consider how old is this game and appreciate the advancement that it have ment for its time.","June 3, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get to play as the Americans, British and the Russians. Each side has their own campaign to play through, so there's alot of variety to be had. Level design is excellent and memorable, it definately has has replay value.\n\nThe Sound Quality is top notch when comparing it with other WW2 First Person Shooters games at the time of it's release, it was the best. The same can be said for graphics and models.\n\nI believe this was the very first WW2 FPS that you allowed you to bash someone with your weapon. On top of that, you can look down your gun sight to increase your accuracy, and get a better visual on your target; but doing so will make you move slower than normal.\n\nIf you haven't tried this game out already, give it a go because you won't regret the purchase.","July 19, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is one of the more interesting titles despite the bad word-of-mouth the series itself has been getting. I was actually surprised when I found this game had come out in 2003, and not 2006 as I hastily read as I purchased it- the graphics are perhaps what Half Life 2's graphics would have been, had it been released in 2003. The weaponry is realistic, the storyline is convincing enough to count as World War II material, the same goes for the dialogue.\nIf you plan on gluing a storyline together from all of the Call of Duty games and not simply shoot everything that moves in the later titles until you're a neckbearded manchild, I would most definitely reccommend this title. Even if you aren't a fan of the franchise, this title is still worth playing.","April 30, 2013","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
