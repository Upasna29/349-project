That alone decides whether you want this game or not. I personally LOVED Super Mario Galaxy, and this one is the closest you'll have to getting that for the PC.\n\nWhat prevents me from recommending this fully is the quality of the PC port. It runs at 60 FPS, yes - but the devs chose to use frame-dependent timing for its engine, which means it's not going to skip frames every time your machine fails to render 60 frames within a second. If you're only able to run this at less than 50 fps, you're going to get markedly slow gameplay - a deal breaker for any Sonic game.\n\nGetting consistent 60 fps is not really a problem with "gaming" PCs built or bought within the last 5 years (hence the positive review instead of a negative), but I imagine there will be people playing this out of the mistaken belief that they'll see good performance, just because Sonic Generations ran well on their below minimum requirement machines (an understandable mistake, since Sonic Generations looks slightly better than Lost World in terms of visuals.)","December 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 127 of 150 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","127","150","10","2"

So, for you who doesn't know, the framerate can now be unlocked! Keep in mind though, at least right now, the developers are calling it unstable. If you want to try it out yourself, sign up for the public test beta and start the game with --F. For more info, check here!\n\nThe soundtrack is now also on Spotify, so that's always nice :p\n\nReview So, after playing this 7 hours the day it came out and completing it, I can finally write a full review of it.\nI have not played the Wii U version, so I can't really say what's missing or changed form the PC version, but it seems like they dropped stuff like the Miiverse stuff, but also the 2 player mode, which is odd.\n\nAlso a summary at the bottom if you're interested in that instead.\n\nGameplay The game is very different from other Sonic games or just platforming games in general, since you are mostly aren't going on a flat surface. I personally, kinda like this.\nThere's also a lot more precise platforming than other Sonic games, requiring you to slow down. That's mostly why there's a run button now I guess. The whole thnig with Sonic is going fast, I know, but I personally didn't mind this at all. It still has sections where you go fast and stuff, so if something, it just mixes stuff up.\n\nOne thing I really feel is missing is some sort of thing where it would tell you what to do. On some of the bosses I had no idea what I should be doing and died many times over, having to me look up what I actually needed to do.\nThere's also 2 different types of homing attacks, kicking and the normal homing attack. Then again, some enemies and some bosses require you to do either of them, where doing the wrong one will hurt or kill you and the game never tells you what you should be doing. Just a different icon on the homing attack icon would be enough.\n\nControls I've only played this with controller. I don't even want to try it with keyboard. I know how bad Generations was with keyboard, so I'm going to guess the same for this. So if you don't have a controller, you might want to get one. If you like these kind of games, you should anyway.\n\nIf you have a controller, the controls are great. I feel like I full control over Sonic and that he does what I tell him to. Sometimes, the homing attack can target weird stuff or not at all, but not a big issue.\nThe only thing I really have to complain about here, since you don't have a whole gamepad, like the Wii U one, to play with, some of the buttons are weird. I kept pressing LS by mistake a lot to open the missions menu, but just smaller things really\n\nSoundtrack Not much to say here, it's Sonic, to what to expect.\nThe music is really awesome. Maybe not as good as in Generations, but those were just remixes. As far as I can tell here, all tracks are new and no remixes this time.\nI also just had to extract the music files from the game itself to load up in a playlist to listen to outside of the game, since I couldn't find anywhere to buy the actual soundtrack.\n\nThe port So, alright, the port. In short, it's just ok. In many way it's worse than the Generations port.\n\nThe port still has a Wii U feel to it, there are buttons on screen which is meant to be pressed with the Wii U gamepad etc. and as usual with the Hedgehog engine, the game is capped at 60 fps. This is not a huge issue, but it's a thing.\n\nIt also feels like the game is made for Wii U and not for the PC, for example, there are plenty of popping issues, just moving forwards and backwards. It's very noticeable.\nAll cutscenes are in 720p, they don't look very good, but not a huge deal either really. Keeps the game smaller I guess.\nPretty much all 2D sprites and menus feel really low res. I can only guess this is because the Wii U version ran at 720p and they didn't bother to fix them for the PC port.\nThe performance overall is fine, I only had 2 small frame drops, but it was up to 60 fps again in less than a second.\n\nOne huge issue is the graphics options. They are terrible and very limited. You can turn on and off some thing and the resolution switch is there, finally in the game itself rather than from the launcher, but a lot of options are missing. The thing I was missing the most is AA.\n\nSummary So, overall, the game itself is awesome. It's different than other Sonic games, but I don't mind it too much. There isn't as much of just going fast, but more parts where you have to take your time and sometimes even solve small puzzles.\n\nAs usual with Sonic games, the soundtrack is really awesome. For me, this is a huge deal. If a game has bad soundtrack, I can just feel like not playing it.\n\nThe port is probably the biggest downside. It's just ok. It has the same issues as Generations, 60 fps lock, problems on some computers etc.\nThe graphics weren't changed much, if at all for the PC port. Some stuff, specially the 2D stuff, look really low resolution.\n\nThe game would get 9/10, but I'll give it 8/10 for the bad port.","November 2, 2015","true","17.6"," 77 of 93 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","77","93","8","0"

This, of course, changed when Sega announced this port. I waited for the Steam sales when this game was 50% off and purchased it. How was it in the end?\nWell, it's pretty good.\nThe level design is generally interesting and open, the boss fights are fun (if quite easy), the soundtrack is SUBLIME, and the graphical quality is pretty sweet. While I'm not crazy about the wisps, I approve of the improvements made to Lazer, Drill and Rocket over their original controls in Sonic Colours. Getting extra lives also becomes increasingly easier with this game, as clusters of them can be found at reglar intervals like at Honeycomb Highway.\nI can't really say if there are improvements over the Wii U version (as stated above, I've never played it), however I approve of the ability to use the mouse in-game to open hints and the item briefcase. Also, if you're like me and you're not a fan of Lost World's storyline, you can skip the cutscenes, which I'm grateful for.\nI do have a couple of problems with the game itself though:\n- While using the run button isn't too much of an issue, I'd much prefer Sonic to just have a naturally fast momentum as he usually does. Also turning while using the run button cuts down his momentum noticably.\n- While i praised Lazer, Drill and Rocket earlier, some of the wisp controls are odd - for example, you have to hold down the run button in order for Hover to float wheras in Sonic Colours it was the jump button, wheras Eagle appears to decend if you press either of those.\n- There are times when I'm running along a wall and try jumping to the one opposite, only to fall off and (usually) die. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, but it confusingly works well with some walls and terribly with others.\n- The red star rings. Whilst most are easy to get, others will really test your patience (case and point, the third one in Frozen Factory Act 3)\n- Finally, Frozen Factory Act 2... The entire level. You play as a snowball. Enough said.\n\nOverall though, this is still a very good game. I'd recommend Sonic Generations more, but this game certainly wouldn't be far behind it.\n\nSo, as a final request... Colours and Unleashed on PC?","January 1","true","33.4"," 51 of 59 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","51","59","7","2"

It has many, MANY obvious flaws, but it manages to not screw up more to be seriously offensive.\n\nThe most problematic element of the game are controls. Those are seriously sloppy and badly designed. Let's recap: dedicated run button, walk speed without said button is akward, double jumping feels akward, like struggling through the mud, going smoothly in diagonal direction at 3D sections feels off, ice physics, air physics... Those controls take enourmous amount of time to get a hang off. Not that it is impossible to do so, but after you master them, you still don't feel right in controlling Sonic.\n\nLevel designs aren't helping. I can commend Sonic Team for trying something new and fairly original (but let's be frank, Mario comparisons are legit), but some levels can completely change rules of play, in worst cases putting some dreadful one-hit kill obstacles. There are some misses, but other levels are not that bad and they give some enjoyment in completing them. While levels can be creative and fun at most times, I still don't like the theming - shuffling the styles between zones without much sense and with zero interesting settings or locations. Not only you have some Standard Video Game Forests and Deserts, but you also have something like beehive or candy land on said desert... What?\n\nLast serious offenses are the Story which is uninteresting and boss fights that are laughably pathetic. Those last ones are particularly jarring. While some of the ideas for them are pretty neat, the execution and difficulty dropped hard. Final Boss in Sonic Lost World is easier than FIRST bosses in several other platformers. King Knight (Shovel Knight) is harder than a Lost World's final boss. Snake Mount (Freedom Planet) is harder.\n\nSo why I'm giving a positive review after all? This game is not a masterpiece, but at most times it stays competent and gives decent amount of fun. While I won't defend this game to death, in my opinion Lost World got disproportionate amount of flack and hate. I would recommend to grab in on decent sale if you are interested in 2D and 3D platformers and already beaten Sonic Generations. LW doesn't hold a candle to Generations, but it is still a solid title for those experienced in the genre. However, I would discourage people not good with the genre, since difficulty level on some stages proper may be frustrating for less resistant.","December 22, 2015","true","26.4"," 54 of 68 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","54","68","0","0"

Did not had any issues with it. Only AA is missing. Force it on, on your Nvidia/AMD - Control Pannel and you should be fine. Alright now let's get to the actual game.\n\nGameplay:Sonic Lost World is more a mix between Sonic & Mario. Even though it still has all of Sonics abilities and the new pakour system, it still feels more slowly. You notice this time that the developers want you to explore rather than just run fast. With exploration I mean mainly getting collectible. The player is more likely to explore the area than it was on previous games. But basically if you are expecting Sonic out of Sonic Lost World, then you will be hugely disappointed. But if you expect a more Nintendo/Mario/Yoshi-like game with much exploration then you will be satisfied. Most of the levels in this game are pretty good designed. I enjoyed nearly every level. But there are a handful of stages which are just bad. They still look good and the soundtrack is appealing, but too much trial and error and unfair level design is not something you should be proud of. But overall I could enjoy the majority of levels. You should just keep in mind that there is more exploration and mario-like gameplay than actual sonic like. If you are fine with that then you will get a really awesome game for your money. Even though I think 30$ is a bit much. 15-20$ yes, but not 30$.\n\nNote: I have seen people saying about this game "Worst Sonic game" or "The first Sonic game that made me hate it while playing it". That is definitelly not true in my point of view. Some parts of the game are bad or even deccent, but it is not such a bad game as those people are claiming it to be. It is a ok game, sometimes even good game.\n\nRating: 7/10","November 5, 2015","true","25.4"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","46","60","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsantor9/recommended/329440/","dsantor9","dsantor9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsantor9/","27 products in account","After the success and critical acclaim of Sonic Generations, the community was shocked when SEGA announced Sonic Lost World for the Wii U and 3DS, as it seemed to play completely differently than the "boost to win" formula they had perfected in Colours and Generations. After it launched in North America in October of 2013, it was met with mixed reviews, with critics saying that it was a slow and bizzare departure from their most recent formula with clunky controls and crappy gimmicks. In November of 2015, SEGA Europe ported the game to Steam on PC, removing all of the Wii U Gamepad touch and gyro gimmicks. Is this port better than the original? After completing both versions, I can say: YES. YES IT IS.\n\nThe story of this game, like Generations, is very by the books and as simple as it can be. My only real complaint about Generations was its lack of story, and even though Lost World follows suit, the writing is overall better and funnier than Generations, even though there are some lines where Roger Craig Smith seriously sounds like he's constipated or something (no offense; he's still my favourite Sonic to date). I won't go into the story much in this review, as there isn't very much story anyway. Just know that the game is about Sonic and Tails crash landing on a planet known as the Lost Hex, to defeat the Deadly Six (Zazz, Zomom, Zik, Zeena, Zor, and Zavok) and Dr. Eggman.\n\nThe main critique people have with this game (besides the story) is the slower gameplay. Dubbed the "Parkour" formula, Sonic Lost World forgoes the boost gameplay to bring us something a little more like the Adventure series, being able to spin dash and such. You can also double jump, like Colours, and new to the series, use the parkour system to climb and run on walls and ceilings. Also new to the series is the gravity-based platforming. Even though we've seen this in Sonic games before (Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic Adventure 2, etc.), this is the first game that focuses on it the whole way through, and even though it's not used to the extent of Super Mario Galaxy, (which by the way, people criticized this game for trying to BE Mario Galaxy, which again, I don't agree with) I still think it's an interesting feature to the game. Being more like the adventure games, many people criticize Lost World for being very slow compared to recent games. Although they are right to some extent, I disagree, in that the spin dash is very useful (and yes, fast) if you know how to use it. It is a unique approach to the boost mechanic with a bit more skill needed to pull it off right, as it can be pretty much infinite if you know how to use it. Overall, by using the spin dash and new parkour correctly, this game can be very fast, and is no where near the levels of Rise of Lyric.\n\nBeing completely absent from the Wii U version, the PC port now has an achievement system. In both versions, Omochao will give you missions to complete, and will reward you with items for doing so. But, in the PC version, these missions double as the achievement system, unlocking one per mission completed (THE ACHIEVEMENT IS UNLOCKED FOR COMPLETING THE MISSION, NOT JUST FOR DOING WHAT IT SAYS. That drove me crazy until I figured it out). Also different in the PC version is the lack of the Wii U Gamepad. Even though I'm generally a fan of Nintendo's PSP/iPad hybrid, they used the thing ATROCIOUSLY in Lost World. But in this version, I'm happy to report that all the gyroscope and touch screen BS in the Wii U version is completely absent. Well, kinda, as all the gimmicks still technically exist, they are now just controlled by the analog stick. Speaking of, let's talk about the control between versions. Since you were only allowed to use the Gamepad, finally being able to use an XBox (or in my case, Steam) controller feels great, and definitely more natural for a game like this.\n\nLike Generations is the extremely talented and creative modding community, which has pulled through once again to produce fantastic mods for this game. Even though the game only has character mods right now, as the game has only been out for a couple of months at the time of this review, I can be certain that the level mods will be a blast and a very unique experience compared to Generations's mods, thanks to its more platforming based gameplay, slower pace and gravity mechanic (Super Mario Galaxy level ports???)\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering, the music is fantastic as well, per the norm in this franchise.\n\nYou might have noticed that I've used the word "unique" a lot in this review, reason being; that's exact what this game is - a unique experience. Even though it was made to be more like the Adventure games, it's skill-based spin dash and new parkour ability make this game stand out from the rest. It's still, in my opinion, not as good as Generations or Sonic 2, but it's still a damn good game, and is definitely worth your time.\n\n8/10","January 10","true","37.3"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","32","38","3","0"

from Sonic games.\nI didn't care that much about this one (mainly because it was exclusive to the WiiU).\nBut when the scores hit, I was actually surprised!\nIt was almost getting as bad scores as Sonic 06!\nI thought "what a shame, maybe next time".\nI also remember the Mario Galaxy comparisons, something about that just didn't feel right.\nBoom bombed it's way onto Wii U, people lost it.\nPeople were saying stupid things, and this forced me to go back to Sonic The Hedgehog.\nSo after a 2 year break, I returned to the City (just to escape from it once more).\nLong story short, I'm addicted to this franchise again.\nBy the way, Boom was made by Big Red Button Games and not Sonic Team.\nIGN and Gamespot were wrong about the Mario Galaxy comparisons.\nJust check out the level "Mad Space".\nLost World is fast, just use the spindash.\nOther than that, they just moaned about dying.\nStick to your Mario games guys.\nI was gonna cash out for a WiiU just to get this game, but right before I did the Sonic PR guy on Facebook praised Gaben for allowing him to announce "Sonic Lost Word is coming to Steam".\nNever liked his games, but I personally owe him a thank you.\nThanks Gabe.\nOn the other hand, watch your back (because Nintendo's got it in for you).\nPlease SEGA, quit these annoying deals with Nintendo.\nI get the Olympic Games and such, but not the main series' games.\n\nStory is written more like a TV show, like Colours and Generations.\nBut it's less cringeworthy, and actually entertaining.\nRoger is better, not the best still.\nThough some voices (like Amy's sounding like Mickey Mouse's girlfriend), could be better.\nDr.Eggman's voice actor has always been delivering though.\nThe Deadly Six are entertaining, they're there for laughs and bosses.\n\nThe gameplay has a focus on Platforming like the old games, it feels like Sonic Team is stepping in the right direction.\nBut in this one, the Platforming is really there.\nIt's almost there all the time.\nThat's probably why there's a run button.\nIn my opinion, the run button's not as bad as I thought it would be, but it shouldn't be in this game.\nIt should only be used for the Parkour, that's all the button should have been implemented for.\nMirror's Edge is able to do this while keeping Momentum gameplay, maybe Sonic Team can actually learn from the Battlefield developer DICE (never thought I'd say that).\nAlso the lack of momentum based gameplay is what bothers me, they got it right in a 3D environment the first time with Sonic Adventure, and the second time with Sonic Adventure 2.\nWhat's their reason for this one?\nBut in all honesty, this game controls like a breeze.\nHaven't thought about a Sonic game's controls like this since Sonic Adventure 2.\nAnd that's saying more than a lot (believe me).\nThe parkour is weird at first, and not really explained.\nIt's not even explained on how to access explainations, you'll see a question mark.\nYou'll learn Sonic's new moves through trial and error.\nYou'll die in this game, and that's okay.\nThe parkour is fun, but not perfect.\nIt's so awesome to run on walls and use the spindash.\nBut some things are clunky.\nSome times there's trails of rings that go up a wall, then go to the side, then go forward (by this point you should be running along the wall).\nHalf of the time you'll fall.\nHe'll just slide off to the side, which is annoying.\nOther than that, it's a pretty cool feature which I hope Sonic Team works upon with their 25th Anniversary game.\nThe spindash is back!\nAnd it's better than Shadow The Hedgehog's and 06's!\nStill not as good as SA1/2's, but it's still powerful.\nThis will send you blasting off to your speed needs.\nStill wish it used momentum based gameplay like the SA games.\nHow you could roll down a hill, and get faster and faster.\nBTW, where's the slopes?\nI mean there's tiny ones, but those barely count.\nI miss the massive ones that sent adrenaline through my eyes, to my heart.\nWhen you're not going from floating planet, to floating planet, or in 2D sections (which are actually good, but not fast though).\nYou're just going along this flat path avoiding or hitting enemies.\nThis is where the massive slopes should have been!\nThis would have been the perfect set up.\nThere's multiple paths in this game, which I love.\nThis adds so much variety and choice to the game, as well as replay value.\nI can never get bored of a level so soon (as you can already tell by my play time).\nThe multiple paths can make a journey different in many ways.\nI've only run into one glitch, that's about it.\nAnd it was a glitch I did on purpose, so...\nThe mach speed sections are back from 06, except done up.\nThey're really fun, they may have you sweating at times.\nAnd man, just give Desert Ruins act 2 a go.\nPeople dislike the snow levels, I like them.\nExcept for Act 2, that snowball level sucks!\nI thought it would be fun, I thought critics were just being moany (like usual).\nBut boy, you will lose it when you play that level (the atmosphere is still nice).\nSuper Sonic is unlocked when all Red Rings are collected.\nHe's okay, not bad.\nKind of wish you could play as him in Mach Speed sections.\nThis is one of Sonic's toughest Adventures, which I like.\nI think this has been missing from Sonic games for a while, a good challenge.\nThe grinding is a bit of a downgrade, he only goes forward as well.\nYou can't really go fast on rails, you can't control the speed like in SA2 and Sonic Heroes.\nAnother annoying thing is you can't look back.\nThat right thumb stick on your controller is only used for useless power ups.\nThe wisps return, and they're way better than colours!\nMainly because they're optional.\nWhich is the way it should have been.\nThe classic power ups aren't in the levels though, they're unlocked after doing challenges.\nAnd they don't even work well.The running one just let's you run as Sonic without holding the run button, it doesn't make you go faster than normal.\nThe boss fights are mixed (just like this game's metacritic score).\nSome are actually challenging, but some are just lame.\nAll of that build up for nothing.\nThe double jump is useful, and fun to use.\nAlthough I honestly just wish they would let me use the homing attack (even when I'm not targeting an enemy) just to get extra distance.\nThe kick is an alternative to the homing attack, which is pointless.\nIt looks nice, and sounds nice.\nBut it shouldn't be a mandatory to the homing attack at times.\nAnd the targeting system isn't needed.\nI want to take them out, thanks!\nYou don't need to do it all for me.\nOther than that, this is what innovation looks like.\nThat's right TitanFall, you heard me.\nSonic Team doesn't innovate because people are demanding, they do it because they feel like it.\n\nThis game looks sweet!\nThe graphics are really great for something from the Wii U.\nImagine what Sonic Team will do on the PS4/ONE/PC.\nThe cartoon art style really makes the world pop out of your screen.\n60FPS really benefits this game, since Sonic is a fast character.\nApparently it was essential during the game's development, like SA2's.\nBut be warned, if your PC can't handle this game at 60FPS.\nYou'll be playing this game in slow motion.\nYou can't play normally at 30FPS.\nLuckily it looks great at all resolutions.\nBut just make sure your PC can handle this game.\n\nThe music is well done.\nBetter than Colours', that's for sure.\nBut it's nothing amazing like SA1/2/Heroes/any Sonic game before Colours.\nThe sounds of your enemies popping open just feels so right.\n\nThe PC version is missing the Multiplayer mode, which is a shame.\nI was looking forward to that, because it looked almost as good as SA2's.\nHopefully they patch it in.\n\nThis game deserves an 8.5/10\nI'm still playing it after 30 hours of gameplay.\nJust remember, it's different.","November 29,

It's a creative take on Sonic, even though it borrows a few things from the more modern gameplay of Mario Galaxy, but it borrows even more from older Sonic games. That's a good thing right? Yes, it is.\n\nI was kinda disappointed that Sonic was the only playable character... again. While it was understandable that Sonic was the only playable character in Sonic Generations, more playable characters would have been nice or this one. Still, a few other problems - such as the anti-aliasing, I suspect it's because this is a pretty straightforward port of the WiiU version but still, that's no excuse.\n\nNow I have to emphasize on the game's easter eggs a bit, whether they are things tht pop up in your face or subtle things in the background, there is alot here that makes this game a love letter to older fans (much like Generations was but in a different kind of way). I suspect that newer Sonic fans will see these things but won't be able to fully appreciate what these things are, where they originally came from or why they're even there. Heck, the might even see these things as annoying or unnecessary but I love them all. Whether it's the return of the animals that you have to save, the floating canons which shoot you into the sky, or the enemies that have the ability to counter your attack & then you have to jostle your analog stick to free Sonic from their grasp. Yes, newer Sonic fans might just hate this game for those things alone.\n\nPros: Great Level Design\nClassic Enemies Make A Return\nFun Soundtrack\nTons of Easter Eggs (for the Sonic veteran)\nCons: Sonic feels more like Mario than Sonic as far as movement goes\nSlower gameplay than a Sonic game should feel\nNo tutorials for newcomers\nNot many visual options for high-end gpu owners\nBosses are a bit too easy, even on the hardest difficulty\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nIf you are a fan of the old Sonic enemies instead of the new mech-like robots of newer games then this game is for you. A good 80-85% of the enemies of Sonic Lost World are returning enemies from the original classic Sonic games. This includes the more insect-like robots such as ladybugs, wasps, mantis, and then we have the desert's hot heads, oil worms, spiders who grab you and more.\n\nRating (6.8 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","March 22","true","6.0"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/329440/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Sonic Lost World is a 3D platformer that has our protagonist Sonic and his friend Tails crash landing on an unknown planet. It is a strange world with floating chunks of land each having their own gravitational pull allowing Sonic to walk on them even if he is upside down. This leads to plenty of areas to explore and well-hidden secret goodies. Nearly every couple of feet there is something that can kill you be it spikes, water or robots and like previous Sonic games taking damage will send all your collected rings flying in all directions leaving you a small amount of time to recollect as many as you can. As long as you have even a single ring on hand you will not die from damage though falling is still certain death. Dying will set you back to your last check point and lose you a life. Lose all lives and you will be kicked out of the level you are on and back into the overworld. The overworld is all hex based and you can move around over the map to find items and choose to play any of the levels you have unlocked. It is a neat gimmick but is pretty much a glorified list of levels.\n\nWhile in the overworld you can accept quests from a robot that will give you prizes. These quests are dead simple and range from collecting a certain amount of coins to climbing a ledge a few times. They are uninspired and pointless tasks but the items received from them can be very useful. Items can summon a shield around Sonic, give him rings or even allow him to skip a section of a level if you are finding it too difficult. These can be used any time by opening up your inventory and selecting them while inside a level. Every 4 or so levels will lead you to a new section of the overworld that are your typical jungle, snow and lava themes in pretty much every platformer ever. The neat thing though is that levels are far different from one another and some don't even follow the theme of the area you are in like the casino zone or the junk food one. One of the first levels is a “Nights” themed mission that was originally DLC for the Wii U and is already included in the PC version. It is disappointingly just a boss rush mode with a different skin over them. At the very least it is a great level to grind for levels when you are running low.\n\nSonic has quite a bit of tricks up his sleeve in this game like wall running, spin dashing and ground pounds. Double jumping is very problematic as pressing the jump button twice can also cause Sonic to lock on to a nearby enemy to and commence a homing attack that can easily get you killed when you accidentally attack an enemy that can't be harmed by attacks. In another occasion I was running away from collapsing landscapes and Sonic decides to attack an enemy behind me while I was trying to double jump over a gap, resulting in a cheap death. The strange part is that Sonic also has a kicking attack that does pretty much the same thing so having the dash attack on the jump button in a game that requires precision was a weird decision that detracts from the flow of the game. Kick attack is useful for enemies that throw bombs at you and robot spiders. I didn't even know about the kicking attack until I was stuck in an area where killing spiders was necessary and your homing attack gets you hurt if you try it on them. Why your red sneakers hurts them and not a giant blue hedgehog dashing at them, spikes first is beyond me.\n\nScattered around levels are random creatures in jars that grant Sonic powers like digging underground, turning into a laser or becoming a giant black hole thing that destroys whatever it touches. You can activate these whenever you want or simply never use them in some cases where it is optional. There is a ton of things to consider while controlling Sonic compared to the simple run and jump nature of the original Genesis versions. There is no tutorial to speak of and the hint bubble that you must press in order for a tip is gone as fast as you blink. It is refreshing for no handholding in a big budget game though this is one of those games that you may want to read a manual online as to what items do, how to use them and the things that Sonic can do like running up walls. Usually a game would be designed as to allow you to learn by yourself overtime but it is quite difficult to do that here as the levels vary far too much and consist of different gameplay styles.\n\nYou can never get a handle on all of the game's mechanics as there are quite a few levels that break up the normal run and jump style of gameplay we expect. One mission will have you using Sonic as a pinball, another will have you controlling a giant snow ball in narrow environments Super Monkey Ball style and others will be auto running, lane based sections where it plays kind of like Temple Run. Those are just some of the modifications to gameplay that frequently break up the normal gameplay and more often than not will be the ones that eat up your lives. I am making it sound like the variety is a bad thing though in truth it is a double edged sword. For one, you will always be looking forward to see what is next even if it keeps you wanting to play just one more level, though on the other hand when the gameplay in that stage is annoying it feels like a waste of a level and a chore if you want to get all the red rings. Red rings are the well-hidden collectible item in this game that's purpose is unknown though one would assume you get something for collecting them all. It is quite common for you to zoom right past one and be unable to return to that area so expect a good challenge and multiple restarts to collect all that are in a level. This game is quite challenging even without trying to collect the red rings.\n\nThe story is your typical save the world from the bad guy trope but the interesting twist is that Dr. Robotnik is forced to team up with Sonic. It does make for humorous situations but it is an overall uninteresting plot that you likely won't remember once it's over. The villains in this game are 6 aliens that have taken over Robotnik's energy consuming machine and are using it to suck all the life out of Sonic's planet. They are all uninteresting characters to say the least. A whiny emo, a fat man that loves to eat and your typical dumb character to name a few. Sonic himself is probably more annoying than any of them and is fully voice acted for better or worse depending on who you ask. The only semi likable character in the game is Robotnik himself. In all fairness I doubt anyone comes to a Sonic game expecting a gripping story line and interesting characters. One thing that must be commended is the soundtrack. It is just superb and the track “Sea Bottom Segue” has to be one of the best I have heard in quite some time.\n\nControls are a bit too loose, though you will get used to it given time. The problems are with the homing attack being bound to the jump key and wall running in a very small area can get Sonic stuck in his running animation costing valuable seconds which can be fatal when being chased by lava or a giant hedgehog eating worm. All in all this felt like a game where the developers had a ton of fun and just throw a bunch of their idea in, for better or worse. I may have been frustrated with some of the levels gimmicks like guiding Sonic through the air but most of their ideas actually worked and gives Sonic Lost World a unique feel that separates it a bit from the Super Mario Galaxy clone comparison everyone gave this game. Each level even has a time attack mode that lets you race for the best time possible and uploads your score online to compete against strangers and friends. This is one of those games that you want to go back and replay as soon as you finish while skipping the mediocre story cutscenes the second time around of course. If you are looking for a 3D platformer this is one title you may want to check out regardless of your opinion on the Sonic franchise.","January 8","true","6.9"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","17","21","3","0"

Cut this out. I’ve been playing Sonic my whole life, and I’m sick and tired of seeing our loving hedgehog go through so many changes. You don’t see Mario change in every game they release. They slowly add mechanics to him. I wish Sonic Team would stick with a mechanic, and improve on it. They had it right on Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Generations, and other games.\n\nRegardless, I will admit that Sonic Lost World gameplay took a while to get used to. From beginning, you may either hate or love it. If you played Sonic Generations for thousand hours like I have, it will take some time to get used to it in order to achieve Sonic’s max speed and blast thru maps. Unfortunately, Sonic doesn’t exactly go as fast as Sonic Generations, and it’s not as rewarding either.\n\nThere so much positives and negatives about this game. Depending on how you play and like about sonic games will determine your purchase.\n\nRight from the beginning, the type of graphics and enemy designs are quite charming and nostalgic. I hope they continue with these type of designs as I rather see more toonish badnicks than GUN robots or realistic monsters. However, the environment feels so empty and lackluster. Nothing feels so lifelike and most of the planets end up looking the same. Not to mention, lot of these levels have too many hazards that prevent you from going fast. I almost feel punished going fast, and lot of level designs prevent you from doing it. Side scrolling levels are the worst type of level design and other level designs felt outdated or stuff you would see on a Nintendo Gamecube. Nothing was unique or stood out. Not to mention, there were some awful enemy placement you have to destroy by a timed homing attacks. Why can’t I destroy them with spindash or bounce over their heads? Sonic Generations had better enemy designs because they weren’t so annoying, and they were mostly there to help you reach shortcuts you couldn’t before. It maded Sonic look and feel like the badass we loved since the Genesis.\n\nSonic’s movement is absolutely terrible in this game.  Well, his controls have always been negligibly bad, but it didn’t matter since maps were straight and linear.  However, when levels require precise platforming, this becomes a problem. There were so many times when I died because I was struggling to get a Red Ring. Sometimes, I’d have to side track back, but I couldn’t tell what was behind. Being able to control the camera is a must! I hate that I kept getting killed only because of an unfair sneak attack. Also, whose bright idea was it to remove the front trigger turns from Sonic Generations? Lot of the levels that require moving down a straight line became much more difficult because I couldn’t get Sonic run on the narrow path in time. I liked having the ability to turn left and right quickly. I will admit that after a while, I started to like the ability to walk, spin dash, and jump instead of homing attack. However, it was quickly ruined by the game’s terrible physics. Seriously, Sonic’s speed drains very quickly and returns to his max run. Sometime I really love to do in Sonic Generations was launch myself using the boost to reach other platforms. I can’t necessarily do that in Sonic Lost World as the spin dash doesn’t launch that far. I have to magically jump twice in order to double my speed in order to launch myself, but then I immediately fall down with no horizontal speed. I could go forever on the physics of this game… But I won’t. Oh, and the parkour system. Best way to describe it: It’s exactly like how I feel about Assassin Creed's parkour. When it works, it’s great. When it doesn’t, you will hate it.\n\nI will say that I absolutely loved Sonic’s animations. They’re the best I’ve seen in a Sonic 3D game. I love how he runs, walks, jumps, acts, etc. I hope the next Sonic game has animations as detailed as now. It brought such good smiles just like the original 2D sprites. However, the Deadly Six are the most cliché Villains I’ve ever seen. I can’t stand any of them. None of them stand out at all. When you fight and hear their dialogue, you’ll understand what I mean, especially Zeena.\n\nThere so much this game does right that I hope SEGA uses in the next Sonic Game, but there so much that brings this game down. Some of my complains can be avoided, but your first playthrough may not be so memorable. I recommend this game when it’s on sale. It’s not worth at full price especially when you can beat it under 5 – 7 hours.","November 5, 2015","true","11.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","18","23","6","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mitnickman/recommended/329440/","Mitnickman","JewBrownie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mitnickman/","18 products in account","I have mixed feelings for Sonic Lost World, but more on the postivie side. This game is a step in the right direction for fans who enjoy the classic games. The style is more cartoonish and colorful than what we are used to seeing. It leans even further from the edgy, "real world" sonic that was present in the early-mid 2000's 3D titles. I grew up playing the classic games, but spent far more time the Adventure games. As most of my friends know, I am a highkey die-hard Sonic fan. I'm a senior in high school and my passion for the series is just as strong as it ever was, and it probably wont ever go away. The day this game came out on steam I ran home early and downloaded this jank. I finally get to play Lost World 2 years after its WII U release.  Since Sonic Generations (a huge success), this game had alot to live up to, but does it do the fastest thing alive justice? It does! Kinda.\n\n\nThis game is fun as hell! At times. Ugh, just when im having a blast at any point in the game, there is some gimmick or roadblock that changes the pace or dosn't give you enough control. I feel like SEGA wanted to please every single fan when making this, which is litterly impossible. When developing a game for a popular IP, there will ALWAYS be fans wanting diffrent things. Stick to a focus in gameplay style and perfect it! Sonic Advenutre 2 may have had 3 gameplay styles, but at least when I was playing as Sonic, the pace was constant and I was always running/grinding fast. This game tries so hard to be the entire ice cream parlor, but ends up awkwardly sampling all of the flavors. With that being said, running as Sonic feels very natural, the speed is perfect, and the 3D levels without gimics are the best parts.\n\nThe story is really half ♥♥♥♥♥. I don't usually care about story but I miss those epic moments from previous sonic games that made beating bosses/levels that much more satisfying. The conflicts are a bit forced, the "Deadly Six", which are the main bosses of this game, have 1-dimentional bland personalities. They are legit copy and paste villians from a 1st graders coloring book. The ending is an abolute dissapointment, please dont play this game for the plot! The plot really does suck, but there is some funny diologue, along with some intresting character interaction (Eggman is hysterical in this game). Most people skip the cutscenes, but I recommend watching em to get your full 30 bucks worth.\n\nAs i stated earlier, I love how Sonic plays in this game! He is given alot of old abilities that he used to have, such as a spin dash, bounce ball, double jump, spin dash and DID I SAY SPIN DASH? Wanna gotta go fast through all the levels? VROOM VROOM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Alot of fans are udnerwhelmed by the lack of physics in this game compared to previous titles, and I have to agree with that, but a new gimmic was added that I actually enjoy was added, called the "Parkour System". This is also super fun, you can climp/run accorss walls based on your speed. While its buggy at times, I'm glad it was added and hope to see it in future games.\n\n\nWarning: this game gets HARD AS ♥♥♥♥. The difficulty curve comes out of nowhere and will truely test your patience and blood pressure. There will come a point where the VROOM VROOM just wont cut it, and you will only succeed with careful jumping and puzzle solving. Lava Reef Zone act 2 dosn't ♥♥♥♥ around. I don't think the game becoming hard is necessarly a bad thing, but I do feel that many of the moments I was stuck on wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been.\n\nI want to say I love this game, but there are too many little hiccups and gimmicks that make it hard to determine what kind of game this even is. Yea, its a Sonic game, but there are so many unnecessary gameplay features, such as the wisps, and controlling a giant snowball, that take away from the action and dosn't capture my intrest at all. Also, the 2D sections slow sonic down and are kind of pointless. But for what the game sturggules in, it makes up for in certain levels that you will find yourself going back to over and over.\n\nI only reccomend this game to Sonic fans, I hate to say it. I'm the kind of person who love to share my hobbies and intrests with other people who don't know much about it. However with this game I foudn that the more i played it, the more i got used to how it worked, and therefore enjoy it even more.\n\nSonic Lost world is like fine wine. Most people will find it bitter at first, but with steady sipping and regular use, you will soon find it enjoyable on occassion.\n\nJewBrownie Final Vertict: 7.8/10    Not enough Knuckles","December 5, 2015","true","10.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJackedex/recommended/329440/","TheJackedex","The Jackedex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJackedex/","38 products in account","This game is fun.... at times...\n\nDon't misunderstand me when I say that, because there are some nifty ideas to how a game like Sonic Lost World can work. Firstly, graphically speaking, it is a gorgeous looking game and it runs at a consistent 60FPS.\n\nThe game may look like a Super Mario Galaxy Knockoff, and the developer of this game has admitted to that, but personnally, I didn't think it was a bad choice for level design.\n\nControl wise, its easy to move sonic about and being able to home in on multiple enemies with the homing attack is certainly satisfying, but the game does have a hard time teaching you how to use its Parkour feature and the game can feel clunky at times. When you get the hang of it, the parkour can be a welcoming new gameplay feature to the Sonic franchise, and I think they should keep it for potential future Sonic titles. I find it strange that Sonic's natural abilitie to run around is mapped to the right bumper of my controller, does Sonic just not have the natural ability to sprint around naturally anymore? However, I do love the welcoming return of the Spindash, that little baby is still rocking my world, although I do wish it lasted longer that 2 seconds after charging it.\n\nBe warned, this game starts off simple and easy for you too grasp the basics of how things work, but slowly and surely, the game with put you to the test. This game will frustrate you if you are not patient enough to endure a lot of trial and error, levels will get harder, crazy gameplay elements will be thrown at you from all directions and you are most likely going to die a lot, so rack up on those lives, because this game is not going to show you any mercy.\n\nAlso, don't feel surprised if you feel like the games many gameplay elements consist of strange activities, such as guiding fruits to blenders, because believe me, the game will eventually reveal itself to have levels built specifically for experimentation and player feedback.\n\nThe music is definetly something to behold, wonderfully composed with a lot of great orchestration, rock and occasional heavy metal. Though I do wish Crush 40 or Cash Cash came in to do a song like they've done in the past, I guess their contract with Sonic games is over. :/\n\nNow, the one thing I hear people complain about constantly is the story, and yeah, it isn't overly complex or enjoyably silly as say, Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colours, but with what the game presents us graphically with its simple yet beautiful designed with a simple Sonic must defeat Eggman/ The Deadly Six plot, I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off. The Deadly Six as characters, I don't hate them, they're just not that interesting, although Zazz cracks me up with every line he says.\n\nOverall, even though I haven't completed the game, while I find that the game does reek of experimentation and they're are some issues with the controls, I had a fun time with this game. Its is not perfect by any means, and for people who can't get into this based on the level design and the controls, I don't blame you, you probably don't have as much patience with games as much as I do.\n\nApproach this game with caution my fellow gamers, if you found this review helpful, I'm happy to have given my thoughts on it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/a-lame-username/recommended/329440/","a-lame-username","Donny T","http://steamcommunity.com/id/a-lame-username/","275 products in account","Occasionally you'll be met with a tricky level  or two, but generally, this game is really good fun. And although I haven't got there yet, I know that this game brings back the ability to use Super Sonic during normal levels. I play with an Xbox One Controller, and I've had no controller issues. My PC has an AMD FX-6300, 8GB RAM, and a GTX 970. It can play the game at solid 1080p60fps, at max settings, and it has not crashed once.\n\nThe Good:\nGameplay: It has a flow that's pretty good, but not without its flaws, and the parkour (wallrunning/climbing, edgegrabbing) is a welcome and also logical extension of Sonic's abilities. The speed of the gameplay is just right; it's fast enough to keep me on my toes, but not so fast that I can't react to what it throws at me.\n\nGraphics: This game is actually quite pretty, and it uses the usual Sonic the Hedgehog aesthetics in a new, vibrant, and interesting manner. The animations, particularly Sonic's, are also quite excellent.\n\nSound: A lot of the sound effects are fitting, modern recreations of the usual ones, and the soundtrack is a little different to previous games, but definitely not unwelcome. The game is generally a lot more vibrant than its slightly darker 3D predecessors, and the sound reflects that, ditching the electric guitars and power chords, in favour of traditional wind and string instruments, playing joyful sonatas.\n\nLevel Design: The level design is the centrepiece of the aesthetic. It's truly insane, and at times, beautiful. For example, in one level huge sentient apples will roll around the place chasing you, and you have to lure the apple into a juicer, which will then produce a giant juice stream that you can use to travel to the next part of the level. Insane. The beauty comes in contrast, as in another level, you're travelling through an underwater tube, from which you can view the underwater wildlife.\n\nScript: Although it doesn't have much of a story (it is a kids game, after all), it's not an awful story, and some of the verbal burns the characters give eachother are pretty funny and unexpected (savage, bro). And sometimes just oddly dark, which gives it some amusement value.\n\nThe Bad:\nSome gameplay elements, such as the auto-lock on (used for homing attacks) can interrupt the flow of the game a little, although the levels are very well designed, so it doesn't actually interrupt gameplay, but it doesn't quite have the same flow as the rest of the game. It's also sometimes unclear when Sonic or some enemy types are vulnerable to attack.\n\nIt's also worth noting this game lacks cloud saving. Not that bad, especially as the save file is really easy to find. In the game's directory, the save file has a ".sdat" extension. I copy+pasted it to another PC and it works perfectly, but having cloud save would be nice.\n\nThe Ugly:\nThe menus are largely unresponsive with a controller, at least. Thankfully you don't have to use the menus very often, but they are pretty terrible.","November 4, 2015","true","5.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

For some it is a step backwards but for other's it is an underrated classic.\n\nFor me, it is an underrated classic with a lot of Flaws. Although I say this. the first Playthrough I did on Sonic Lost World for Wii U made me despise it. After hearing it was coming to PC for some reason I was very excited and couldn't wait to give it another go.\n\nSo before going into detail about the game itself, I will answer the question what is on everyone's mind for people who played it on Wii U.\n\nIs the PC port good?\n\nAt first I didn't like the port because it was very lacking in the Settings department. I had to force Anti-Aliasing to make the graphics look amazing. Other than that it is locked to 60fps and sometimes there is slow down. So not the best port but playable.\n\nIs the Game good?\n\nStory\n\nThe Sonic Franchise isn't really known for having a great story and Sonic Lost World is no acception. The new bad guys 'The Deadly Six' are nothing more than archetype's. They are very one dimensional and have no real purpose than being the bad guys. Although The Deadly Six are a let down, That doesn't mean the other character's like Sonic, Tails and Eggman are a let down as the character interaction's in this game are very good and may have you laugh sometimes.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nTaking away the Boost Formula was a very risky move by SEGA as Sonic Generations was a huge success due to the Boost formula. Instead we have Sonic at a walking pace, a run button, A Parkour system and the Spin Dash becoming useful again. This Port of Sonic Lost World improves the control and makes it a lot more tighter.\n\nSonic Lost World does not tell you how to use a lot of it's features including the Parkour System.\n\nBecause of the success of Sonic Colours wisp's make a come back. Now they are basically just power-ups which control ok-ish.\n\nOverall Sonic Lost World can be a very frustrating game at time's and especially on your first playthrough. If your a Sonic Fan or a Fan of Platformers maybe take a look at this misunderstood gem.","November 5, 2015","true","32.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

But dusting off the gold glitter will reveal a giant turd in the shape of horrendous controls, arbitrary changing rules, and artificial difficulty. Summarized best with the third phase of this boss fight.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iTLdxRVXHSM?t=1003\n\nUnless you SIT STILL and do NOTHING long enough for the lock-on reticle to beep enough times, the last strike against this boss will damage the player.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","I'm confused by the Sonic franchise; everytime a game comes out it's apparently the worst game ever. I remember this title coming out for the WiiU and getting destroyed, and I also remember Sonic Colors coming out for the Wii and receiving the same treatment.\n\nI played Sonic Colors; it was actually a fantastic game with a great soundtrack. And I've played this title, and it's NOT a bad game. So it's either one of two things: either the Sonic franchise is legendarily good and the games never live up to the Half-Life esque levels of expectations, or a segment of people blindly hate the series.\n\nWhatever the case, Sonic Lost World is the previously WiiU exclusive Sonic title which was created with some collaboration by Nintendo. It shows; Unlike Colors or Generations (the last two 'mainline' Sonic games), Lost World is a slower, more platform oriented game in the vein of Mario titles. Not all levels are speed affairs whereby you have to make quick jumps and precise moves to get onto the faster path down the course. Granted, Colors had less of this than Generations, but Lost World is even slower than that.\n\nThis isn't to say the game isn't fast. It's still a Sonic title and there are plenty of levels and segments that are speed affairs requiring quick reflexes, but for a Sonic game there's an unusually higher amount of 'slower' segments than these games typically contain. The experience isn't a constant, though. By which I mean: some levels are pure speed, others are entirely on-rails with you needing to jump from rail to rail, whilst a few are entirely 2D platforming levels. Overall it's a thoroughly mixed experience that feels 'experimental', with the developers trying out a bunch of different ideas. In many ways this feels more like Mario Galaxy 2 in how the levels can vary wildly in both length and design.\n\nIn general, that variety maintains the game fresh and adds to the title. But some levels, like the slower, mario galaxy-esque 3D platforming levels I could do without. It's not that they were bad, it's that I don't wanna play Mario; I wanna play Sonic. Thankfully they're kept to a minimum and there are, like, less than 5 of those levels. But there's also some of the 2D levels which are also a little slow, and the on-rails levels which are pretty meh and linear to a fault. Granted, these aren't really critiques as the levels aren't bad, they're just not to my particular liking and wants in a Sonic title; you may disagree.\n\nOverall it's nothing amazing or groundbreaking like the levels in Sonic Unleashed and Generations; like I've said, the game feels somewhat experimental in how much variety it has. One of the downsides to that is that you may not always hit the mark, but this game generally stays close to it (or close enough to it) for me to have enjoyed my purchase. I'd say it's a forgettable Sonic title that doesn't do anything wrong, tries variety in its levels to varying results, and as a whole is a game to play and spend your free time with. In other words, not one of those ''must-play'' games that you MAKE time for, but more of a game that you SPEND time you have.\n\nDon't get the wrong impression; it's a good game. Just nothing astounding or worth noting; I'd give it a mild recommendation. If you have better games to play go for it, but since I'm somewhat of a fan of the series I'd say it was alright. It's certainly not a bad entry into the franchise, but it's also not noteworthy. It's just....another entry...into the franchise. If you like Sonic games you'll like this one, but you won't love it like Generations.\n\nIt's worth noting that 3D platformers are somewhat rare nowadays, so it helps the title stand out. Unlike Colors or Generations, which I'd tell you to play, I'd say you can skip over this one. Not because its bad, but because it's whatever.\n\n5/10-an alright game (for reference a 6 would be above average and a 7 would be a GOTY contender; a 4 would be a  game with some notable flaws that bring down the experience). The only flaw this game really has in terms of control is how Sonic BARELY moves horizontally when jumping; you need a bit of momentum to really jump far. It made me fall into bottomless pits a few times and left me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that this fuc*er BARELY moved to the right.","May 14","true","14.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

It could be absolutely great if not for some not most important but still annoying things.\n\nFirst of all - the most important part - platforming - is great! Both in 2D and 3D parts it's responsive, levels are imaginative, like always in Sonic games give you choice between many routes, encourage exploration, replaying, have score attacks and time runs - a lot of fun. Only nitpick I have is that there are very few really fast parts, I'd expect more of them from a game about extra-fast hedgehog ;)\n\nGraphics are mediocre. It can be easily seen it's a WiiU port and that WiiU is not a powerful machine. In some parts it looks worse than older Sonic Generations.\n\nNow to actual problems.\n\nFirst off story and enemy characters. Sonic games were never known for great stories and you don't really need epic tales in a colorful platformer, but this game takes the crown for the most stupid, boring and unimaginative plot ever presented in any Sonic game. Top it with the worst enemies ever (they are the most cliche baddies you could ever think of, have nothing to them except for one attribute that 'defines' them aka this guy is a glutton and only wants to eat, this guy is an emo, hates the world and want to die, this chick is totally self involved and wants to polish her nails all day long) and it becomes really hard to get invested into the story at all.\n\nAnother big problem is total lack of any tutorial, in-game explanation, actual tooltips, important UI elements etc. For example - you do missions and collect items which you can use later on. But game only show you an icon of an item without any explanation what it does. You have to either memorize all the icons or alt-tab to check items in the internet all the time. Another example - game introduces new mechanics and expect you to use them without even informing you you can do anything new. Like you don't learn anywhere what is Sonic Kick, how is it any different from Homing Attack (their animations are very similar btw, so you can go for most of the game not even aware you have two kind of attacks), or you are never informed that you can charge your homing attack and do it up to 5 times. Then you are simply presented with a boss that wil require first breaking his defense with Kick, then moving him through platform with charged attacks, then kicked again, then charged up to 5 then attacking. And you never even had to use any of these mechanics before, you don't even know you have such attacks. Again you are forced to look for guides and manuals on the internet, because without them you are simply wasting your time on unbeatable part of the game. It's one thing to learning boss patterns, it's another trying to beat a boss which requires you to use special attack you don't even know you have because the game never informed you about it.\n\nThat being said it's still a good platformer. It could be great, it could be SEGA's version of Mario Galaxy, but as it is it's only good but I don't think it will become a cult classic.

That said, it's far from perfect. If I had to sum it up in one word, the game is competent.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun Sonic game with a good sense of speed then you should probably stick with Generations which is probably still the best modern Sonic game. The pace of most of the levels run a bit of a slower pace than I would like and the levels that are intended to be fast and "twitchy" can be a tad frustrating in the later half of the game.\n\nThe most frustrating moments from playing Lost World were rare but when they happened they were really frustrating. You'll likely encounter situations where Sonic does something - like wallrun when you don't want to - in a level that requires you to be quick or you'll die. Fortunately, the game is pretty forgiving and if you're dying a lot and are low on extra lives, you'll get a powerup pop-up at the start of a checkpoint that'll jump you ahead a whole section. Speaking of powerups, If you've played Sonic Colors (or Generations) then you'll find yourself in familiar territory as some Color powerups (and a couple new ones) have returned in LW.\n\nOverall, the levels are pretty forgetable. The music is tolerable but nothing special. Bosses are pretty easy. There are time trial modes if you're into that but for a game this slow it feels somewhat out of place in my opinion. This is a game I paid only 25% of it's full price and took me 8.5 hours to complete all the main and secret levels. It's not something I can see myself replaying like I would with a game like Generations where trying to finish a level as fast as possible feels super rewarding. I would still recommend it as a game to consider purchasing during a Steam sale.\n\nIf you're looking for faster Sonic (or classic Sonic-inspired games) you're probably better off with Generations or Freedom Planet. I would still rank LW as a far better game than any of the Sonic Adventure games.","March 18","true","8.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Like Colours and Generations it keeps the gameplay as a mix of 3D and side scrolling, which works better than it has any right to do. It's very much a case of Sonic does Mario Galaxy on many of the 3D sections, however the inside tube levels remind me of Knuckles Chaotix more than anything else. It's got classic Badniks, the story still keeps the Saturday Morning Cartoon approach that I enjoyed in the last two games. and the new controls work better than they sound on paper.\n\nBut I can't recommend it. So much of this game is cheap rather than difficult. Moving upwards in a virtical scrolling level shouldn't create an instant death pit beneath you, and a lot of deaths feel forced or ineffectively telegraphed.\n\nIf you're a fan of Sonic, you'll probably dig it, but I totally understand the lukewarm reception it received on the Wii U. If it felt tighter maybe a lot of that would go away, but it feeling cheap as opposed to challenging kinda breaks some of it for me.","November 4, 2015","false","8.0"," 31 of 56 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","31","56","0","6"

It's difficult to learn, but when you do, it feels so satisfying to parkour across the level.\n\nStory is surprisingly simple this time around. Won't be Adventure 2 or Unleashed level of story, more like Generations.\n\nDialouge is... okay. Some jokes were just stupid, some made me chuckle, and some made me laugh.\n\nThe main enemies were.... okay, I can see why we haven't seen them since.\n\nIf you're worrying about glitches, because of the franchise's reputation with glitches, you won't find many here. Some minor, some normal, few game-breaking. You won't be dying every four seconds by clipping through the floor.

I definitely prefer the 2D stuff more as there are no werid camera issues like in alot of the 3D sections. Sometimes the camera struggles to keep up with the action and does a werid zoomed out overhead reaction which is very disorienting.\n\nThe bosses are varied and you do fight quite a few in this Sonic game. Difficulty is very inconsistent. Some levels are short and easy, others are hard and just drag on. I'm not really sure who the target audience is for Sonic Lost World, it's definitely too hard for younger gamers, and older gamers will likely quit from the constant cheap deaths.\n\nI don't recommend this game.

It was made to be Nintendo platforms exclusive in 2013 only to come out onto Steam in 2015. Made by Sonic Team. Get ready to face the sissy six!\nIt also came out for WiiU, as said, as well as 3DS. 3DS version is quite different, you know, same title, tried to do same theme but made from scratch, by Dimps.\n\nLet's talk about differences between this release and original WiiU version that it's based on. First, each copy of game on Steam has Nightmare DLC, which was available only to bonus prepurchase edition of WiiU games, from what I read. Sadly,  Steam version it doesn't have two different DLCs, that are Zelda and Yoshi themed ones. No wonders, they are Nintendo licensed ones, so not blaming Sega.\nWiiU also supported 2-player play, mostly races. One player has TV screen, another player has gamepad one. There is no multiplayer on PC.\nThat, and PC version doesn't use any other WiiU feature. Like, you can control Wisp powers normally, no fancy. Or there is no Wiiverse implention, so you can't exchange powerups with other players. Also, bomb powerup that you could get only through exchange is now part of mission rewards or Nightmare zone one.\nSo, WiiU might be the version that you want to get, but PC isn't bad either.\n\nAs for technical problems, yea, there are some with this release. Most importanly, this game is locked in 60 fps. I don't mind 30+ fps limits, but in this case it also means that if your computer can't handle 60 fps then gameplay itself will slow down, not daring to skip the frames. Thus, slooooooooooooooooooowwwwww Soooooooniiiiiiiiiiic!\nAnother bad glitch is that if the game detects while running that you have a controller that isn't xinput, then it's going to glitch up when you enter any cannon. Gameplay will just stop, nothing will happen. Pinball section in game also becomes unfinishable. So make sure that you play it with xinput gamepad. Keyboard is also possible, but please no, it's a platformer game.\n\nAnd yea, Deadly Six. They are main antagonist of this game, and they are supposed to be Deadly. Maybe. The plot is actually not good. Wasted. All the silly soap opera happens in cutscenes and seems to have no meaning in the end, Tails sub-plot just going past without any special gameplay related to it, ending just comes. Yea, could be good. I recommend to just watch "Sonic Lost World in minutes" from Roger parody after beating this one.\n\nAnd since it's Sonic game, it requires a separate mention of music. As usual, it's awesomesauce. No dissapointment. It actually has a different, less Sonic-like style to it. But by now, variety is a good thing. And look, it still has final boss music that is awesome, so there. Graphics are also simple, yet colorful and awesome.\n\nAnd when you start the game the most obvious thing about this one you will notice is that it's actually a shameless ripoff of infamous Knuckler's Chaotix special stages and the cancelled Sonic Xtreme. Which means that actually developers try out something new, to use various geometry shapes and gravity to give players more interesting choices of movement and environment, with tubes, mini-planets and such. It's still a linear game though.\n\nAnd most importantly, they changed Boost gameplay core into what they call Parkour. What it means is that while Sonic is much slower, you do much more of actual platforming, carefully positioning and having fun. As a gamer who's childhood was spent on the first Sonic The Hedgehog, I really enjoy this aspect. I sure missed. The feature of this gameplay is that Sonic now learned how to parkour, which in this case means that he learned to run over the side of wall or right onto it, which is a very excellent idea. Closer to what I wanted 3D Sonic to be like.\n\nOh yea, and it has missions system. You can have three at the same time, but sadly they get to the point where instead of helping you to motivate to do something during main walkthrough, you have to go out of your way, possible into previous stages, and grind them out.\n\nSadly, one of game's fault is that it explains how it works really badly. Or, rather, not at all. Thus I highly recommend to read the Steam community guide that does exactly that, which is better than having pain due to, say, not knowing that you can kick enemies. Or how wall-running works. Or to learn that you can go fast because the spin dash is actually limitless and you can keep speeding and spinning.\n\nAnother thing is that game is quite hard. It's one of the harder Sonic games around, ignoring the 8-bit ones. You lose a lot of lives during stages. But you also gain more of lives. And I like it, an actual hard platforming. It does sadly have some gimmick stages that people don't enjoy, mostly snowball one, where you keep trial and erroring through, being hard to control. But oh well.\n\nSadly, this game has a huge flaw. The bosses suck. Badly. It actually is more like the usual sad rule of 3D platformers "hard stages, easy bosses", main innovation of Mario 64. The thing is, though, is that Sonic is a game with linear stage progression and the difference in difficulty between stages and bosses is way too huge. As a result every boss is anticlimatic and even final boss makes the game feel empty. Which is worsened by the fact that the plot itself holds on Deadly Six being Deadly. But while the boss battles are varied, they die in pretty much one or two hits, being empty air, making plot empty air as well.\n\nBut in the end, it's a good 3D platformer. I would recommend it, for gameplay and that stages are fun, while having awesome graphics and music. Just a shame that plot and bosses are almost not exist. I wish Sonic Team will keep moving in this direction, as I surely prefer this over the Boost mechanic.","May 28","true","13.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can pretty much sum up the main reasoning that Sega has lost touch with Sonic in one sentance: There is a sprint button. If you're not constantly holding down the trigger on your controller, Sonic walks at a dreadfully slow pace. What happened to the always "Gotta go fast!" mentality? This leads to a whole other issue in the game's ice level, in which if you barely move left or right while holding sprint, you slide incredibly fast in that direction, making it awfully difficult to dodge obstacles correctly.\n\nA lot of the reviews here are mentioning Super Mario Galaxy, and that's definitely true. 3D worlds and jumping between random planets, but the charm of Galaxy is missing. All you need to do is pratically run from one end of each "planet" to the next. The level design in Frozen Factory is probably some of the most frustrating, as a whole chunks of the level are placed on a single planet, resulting in a long amount of backtracking to where you were if you fail a jump. I believe the most fun I had was in a (literally) on-rails grinding section. There was a fun little rolling snowball section, but the final boss was incredibly frustating, with it being hit-or-miss as to whether you'd actually damage your targets.\n\nThe tutorial is lackluster, never telling you what you want to hear, but appearing frequently for the most annoying reasons. The color aliens from Sonic Colours are back, but we've never had Sonic Colours on PC, meaning you won't know what most of them do until you use them. And on the other side of the spectrum, every single time a power runs out the game feels the need to pop up a "This colour's power has been depleted", which was already fairly obvious. The game has some kind of item system, but it never explains anything about it at any point. Thus I've played through the game without using it once, and still don't have a clue now.\n\nIn all, I'd say you want to get this cheap in a sale, and go in with low expectations. C'mon Sega, Sonic 4 Episode 2 was a good move forward, don't mess it up now!","May 7","false","3.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I know my PC isn't *that* much in today's game standards, but an i5 5000 series, 8GB RAM and 2GB VRAM should be more than enough even for the recommended settings. Alas, playing this in 720p and no other effects enabled becomes a mess after a couple of minutes (literally). As far as I'm concerned, Lost World runs in the same engine as Generations, which in turn runs fine on my rig... So, where's the catch?\n\nThe only clue I have is the constant 60FPS lock the game has and cannot be turned off, where everything (you name it: particles, enemies, shadows, and even the timer) must match that requirement or else the game says "get a better machine to play". I read somewhere that setting the game to lauch on --f via Steam solves the issue as it forces the game to accept a lower frame rate. But... why should I do that? Why do I have to go through the hassle of doing this instead of releasing a patch of the game so it does that already? I've paid for the game, so at least some extra useful options would have to be included.

Let's take a look and see how well this port holds up!.\nLet's start by taking a look at the game itself.\n\nStory\nEggman's up to something again and he has some backup on this one! A group known as the Deadly Six, formed by lifeforms known as the Zeti, a race of creatures native to the Lost Hex, a mysterious and unexplored continent floating in the sky and the main setting for our adventure. It's up to Sonic to foil Eggman's  plan once again!.\n\nGameplay\nCounting with 32 levels, Sonic: Lost World features a more traditional platformer style with some of the speed Sonic is known for.\nIt mixes 2D and 3D sections. The former being more reminiscent of something out from a 2D Mario game, with a slower pace with lots of jumping and less running around. The later containing mostly cylindrical levels, places that allow Sonic to run on a cylinder shaped level that lets you move forward while running around the walls/floor and sections that are pretty similar to levels from Mario Galaxy, a spherical chunk of land with it's own gravity field. For the most part the level design is pretty good, most of the 3D levels allowing you to keep some momentum and speed around in classic Sonic fashion, however the 2D sections, while good, interesting and well designed for the most part, go against the sense of speed that one expects from a game of this franchise.\nThe game tries to keep it fresh by adding a few levels with different sections such as grinding, flying, ice skating, rolling around as a snowball and sliding down in sand, while the grinding and flying sections are okay, the rest feel a little bit gimmicky, adding some weird momentum and restricting movement, making the levels annoying and harder than they should. Fortunately enough, the game spawns a power up capsule with a wing inside that will allow you to skip a section of the level once you failed several times in a row. sometimes it can be annoying as you might not want to grab it, but it will spawn on a pretty awkward spot that will make it hard to miss it.\n\nThe Wisps from Sonic Colors also make a comeback on this game allowing you to take alternate routes on the levels but ultimately  adding nothing to the game. The game adds the ability to parkour. Sonic can run, climb and jump along walls with this new mechanic, Even though these individual movements have been previously showcased, the parkour mechanic allows you to use any wall in the environment rather than just specific parts. It's really neat and has its moments but could be better implemented.\n\nThe bosses, they're uninteresting, the battles are nothing special and Instead of having a dedicated stage for the boss battle, you have to fight them on the final part of the second and fourth stage of each zone, meaning you'll be stuck in a boss battle when you only wanted to play a level as fast as you can.\n\nMusic and art style\nRather than aiming for realism in the visual style, Lost world presents a cartoony look with really vibrant colors, round edges and lots of basic shapes making most of the scenery. However, accompanied by the level design, it really makes up for an interesting experience and some really nice and beautiful visuals.\nThe music, it has to be the best part of this game, I've fallen asleep listening to some of the music on this game, it's just  so relaxing and beautiful.   It has a slower pace when compared to most Sonic games but it's very fitting when paired with the levels, it's because of both that each zone has a really distinct feel to it. Forming a great atmosphere and making the levels really enjoyable to play.\n\nPC Port stuff\nBut what about the porting itself? Well, here things start to get a little worse.\nFor starters, the game is locked at 60FPS, which might be bad news for all those power-PC users and a horrible thing for people with low-end specs, since the game suffers from a terrible slowdown that makes everything run REALLY bad. SEGA released a PBT version for the game, which can change the frame lock on the game, but it can break the physics making the game unplayable.\nThe port is also missing the multiplayer component of the game, so no multiplayer races for the PC users.\nThe controls with keyboard are simple and really good. They can be remapped in any way you like, I only had a small problem where the game would change the Sprint key from Left Shift to Right Control every time I start up the game, I have no idea what's causing it, but it's just a minor issue.\n\nSo, in short\n+Nice visuals and style\n+Beautiful music\n+Good sense of speed\n+Nice level design\n+Interesting movements for Sonic    -Game suffers from terrible slowdowns if you run it below the 60FPS limit.\n-Mediocre, forgettable and really easy boss battles.\n-Some gimmicky sections and power-ups that don't add a lot and can be frustrating\nShould I get it?\nSure! I recommend this title to players that love platformers. Even better if you can snatch it with a discount. Just make sure you can run it at a steady 60FPS or your experience will be really hindered by the slowdown.\nA pretty good game that has some minor flaws and some technical problems but is a nice addition to your library.","January 30","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoy learning and perfecting the parkour, jumping from wall to wall and using momentum to run straight up walls like some blue 3' tall jackie chan on speed, just feels right for sonic and incredibly fun.  We've seen him do these things in game cut scenes!  As fun as this is, it deminishes knuckles' ability to climb or tails' ability to fly, since all but the highest platforms are now accessable to sonic.\n\nThis game also gives us back the wisps, which I rarely find myself using, and thats the way it should be.  Perhaps in future games, they should be present but not pushed into your face (maybe placed in hidden difficult to reach areas), and more like a cheat to get past a difficult agility or combat obstacle rather than a necessity.\n\nSpeed? Ugh...For some reason the only time Sonic runs is after hitting a dash pad.  I get it, the focus of this game is platforming, and there are plenty of areas where running fast would be a bad idea anyway, but you're not really given enough time to explore per mission.  Is this a ploy to force replayability? Because you "gotta go fast?" I hate to think that, but unless you know where the special areas are by stumbling upon them or watching youtubes, you won't have time to look for them.\n\nUnfortunately, once again, you are on sonic lock.

I've always been a sonic nerd, since the origional release of sonic 1, and I will continue to play until the seriese is buried (and probably after that too).\n\nAll of the above don't paint the game in the greatest light, so I will say it explicitly: The game is fun, challenging at times, with some replayability, I would say it's worth it if you're ok with the price for a sonic game without the speed we expect.","December 3, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, here things start to get a little worse.\nFor starters, the game is locked at 60FPS, which might be bad news for all those power-PC users and a horrible thing for people with low-end specs, since the game suffers from a terrible slowdown that makes everything run REALLY bad. SEGA released a PBT version for the game, which can change the frame lock on the game, but it can break the physics making the game unplayable.\nThe port is also missing the multiplayer component of the game, so no multiplayer races for the PC users.\nThe controls with keyboard are simple and really good. They can be remapped in any way you like, I only had a small problem where the game would change the Sprint key from Left Shift to Right Control every time I start up the game, I have no idea what's causing it, but it's just a minor issue.\n\nSo, in short\n+Nice visuals and style\n+Beautiful music\n+Good sense of speed\n+Nice level design\n+Interesting movements for Sonic    -Game suffers from terrible slowdowns if you run it below the 60FPS limit.\n-Mediocre, forgettable and really easy boss battles.\n-Some gimmicky sections and power-ups that don't add a lot and can be frustrating\nShould I get it?\nSure! I recommend this title to players that love platformers. Even better if you can snatch it with a discount. Just make sure you can run it at a steady 60FPS or your experience will be really hindered by the slowdown.\nA pretty good game that has some minor flaws and some technical problems but is a nice addition to your library.","January 30","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","I mean no hyperbole when I say Sonic Lost World is the best 3D Sonic game despite its flaws.\n\nWhy? Because SLW has none of the filler no one asked for found in other 3D Sonic games--the Adventure games' emerald shard hunting or the walker sections, the illusion of choice from Heroes, Adventure games or Shadow the Hedgehog, and the forced mini-games of Sonic Generations.\n\nAnother reason is that SLW focuses on what makes Sonic special. This is the game that finally puts the 2D style gameplay of the classic games into the 3D games, and it's because this game is about three things: Sonic, skill and speed.\n\nIs it worth the $30 price tag? I don't think the game offers enough, although you will get 10 to 12 hours of gameplay (especially if you go for the Red Rings, which I would recommend). But if you can get this game at half-price, you should definitely give this game a chance.\n\n(Also, don't play this game without a controller. You won't have a good time.)\n\nIsn't That the Mario Galaxy Ripoff?\nThe funny thing is the more I played SLW, the more this game reminded me of Mario 3D World. Except with Sonic.\n\nThink about it: The premise of 3D World is encorporating the 2D gameplay for a 3D game. And this is probably the best, succinct description I can give for SLW. (It's very obvious when you put the Classic Sonic model on this game; he perfectly fits into the gameplay.)\n\nYou have the spin-dash, which can be a serious tool for speedrunning as you can chain together spin-dashes, the Classic games' power-ups found within your inventory space, the Eggman capsules, the transitions between 2D and 3D gameplay, and the branching pathways should you screw up. I would include Super Sonic in every stage but that's been a standard since Colors.\n\nIncluded in old mechanics we also have the Bounce Bracelet, a second jump, ledge-climbing, the upgraded homing attack and the parkour system from the start.\n\nThe last inclusion can be the bane of many players as the game doesn't properly teach you how to use it. You'll have to experiment on your own with how the system works. (And whenever you go into 2D sections, let go of the run-button.) But the parkour system is only necessary should you choose to go for the Red Rings.\n\nBut many fans of Generations might not like the lack of the boost button, and scoff at the run button. Sonic still moves fast enough to make speed a challenge, and I'm of the opinion that boost mechanic in Unleashed and Generations makes Sonic too fast to control properly. I prefer the spin-dash and run-button option for a sense of speed.\n\nYou also have the Wisps from Colors, but, again, this content mainly serves as an alternative to the parkour challenges if you haven't gotten used to them. (But there are a few Red Rings that require them. Very few.)\n\nAs the parkour and wisps play into alternative paths, the level design offers a subtle difficulty option as most levels have broad paths with varying levels fo difficulty. But it never becomes a laybrinthe--except for the first ice level which has a confusing route--and if you press the pause button, you'll see that the levels are still linear.\n\nSo if you grow tired of the harder challenges (collecting the Red Rings), then you will probably be fine sticking to the normal route as the platforming still offers a good challenge.\n\nIs This a Perfect Sonic Game?\nAbsolutely not, and it has to do with the lack of polish to some of SLW's gameplay.\n\nThe main cultprit is the parkour system. the second is the ice-mechanics, and the last are the bosses. All of them.\n\nFor the 2D sections, you will want to let go of the run-button whenever you approach a wall; he'll climb right up into the wall's cooch and get stuck there. The nuances of running along walls can also be an obstacle too if you aren't sure how it works.\n\nFor example, one Red Ring requires you to run up a wall, then hop along it to a section where you can run and jump from one wall to another at a certain height (all with the run button, the thumbstick and the jump button.)\n\nLike the spin-dash changes, the parkour system is something simple to understand, but challenging to perform, and I think for the most part it relies on the player's skill than a shoddy implementation.\n\nI don't find the ice-mechanics themselves intolerable, especially once you realize you have better control while letting go of the run button. My main problem is when you are running and jump, Sonic performs a pirouette with no control. Worse, you can't use the second jump to save yourself.\n\nThe Deadly Six are chumps, and only towards the final area of the game do they pose a real problem. But one of unfairness because the level-changes can kill you without knowing. However, like the Classic games, the lead-up to the bosses are still platform levels and so the fights do not take up a level themselves.\n\nAnd as much as I praise the game's level-design, some levels don't have branching pathways. I'm okay with this because if every level was of Sonic running around cylinders I would probably get ill. I like to think these are breathers for players, but the game could use more of its branching pathways than we have now.\n\nThe Wisps aren't given an explanation for why they're here, but I don't really care to think about it. The story is a simple "Stop Eggman!" plot with obvious twists, and even when the game gets more serious, it still is light-hearted to not get broody.\n\nThere are some lines and scenes that do genuinely surprise me. For good and bad reasons.\n\n"I've been dreaming of pounding that sorry blue butt." --Not a fanfiction, but actual canon.\n\nMods: They've Only Just Begun\nAt the current time of this review, the mods for SLW are different models for this game. (And I would recommend the Classic Sonic mod for a Sega CD vibe.) But I can see modders using the parkour system in SLW over Generations to make some really interesting level designs or remakes of fan-favorites.\n\nIt's still amazing how many mods are already out there, and I imagine soon that will be a selling point.\n\nSome Changes from Wii U VersionNo two-player cooperative mode. (No Wii U pad.)\nNo carnival games. (No Wii U gimmicks for the pad.) Game has less animals to collect.\nAnalog stick controls for Wisps.\nNo LoZ and Yoshi levels. They were 5 min gimmicks anyway. (The Nights' level is great for farming for 15+ lives every 100k points. Yeah, a score-system with no purpose.)\n100 rings gives you lives now, but I think this was patched on the Wii U too.\nNo tutorial prompts.\nRebindable keys, not rebindable controllers.\nA Few Misteps With Every Great Stride\nEven if you don't find SLW a good game--as many fans feel towards it--the game is a great test for Sonic's gameplay design to see what works and what doesn't work. Hopefully, Sonic Team will not disregard the SLW gameplay entirely for something new just because of many fans' legitimate gripes with its execution.","November 19, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You have to hold a button to run. There should be no holding of run buttons in a Sonic game, if Sonic needs to walk for some reason, there should be a walk button, BUT THAT'S IT; Sonic's default speed should be "RUN". Also, the levels feel long and more tedious, but I could probably overlook that if I wasn't having to constantly HOLD THE RUN BUTTON FOR THE DURATION OF THE STAGE.\n\nOn a positive note, I've not had any technical issues with the game.\n\nI've bought too many games and I need to finish some so I'll push myself to finish this and then redo my review.

That is a serious problem in a Sonic game.\n\nThey mixed it up by adding spherical platforming. I really don't think they did much with it. Some may be tempted to call it a rip off of Mario Galaxy. I don't agree. I'm pretty sure other games besides Mario Galaxy have done spherical platforming.\n\nThe final boss is Eggman. Right the fudge out of nowhere.

Answer: Something quite dazzling, and it happens to be called Sonic Lost World™. This game is yet another one of SEGA®’s exquisite masterpieces since Sonic Unleashed™. The story also has an excellent plot, however, some of the controls are pretty terrible; not all of them, but some of them, for a few people are showing explicit negativity toward the game – the controller for Xbox 360 never works for me, so I always use my keyboard and mouse. And the Wisps return from Sonic Colors along with new wisps, as well. There are kinds of new ones depending on if it’s either the Wii U/PC or 3DS version of the game, though I prefer the Wii U/PC version. Which version do you prefer?\nSo then there are a somewhat “underrated” bosses, a group of sinister individuals known as the Deadly Six. It is said in the Facebook and YouTube franchise that they have a reference to the koopaling bosses in the New Super Mario Bros.™ series, especially Zavok’s 2nd phase in the lava Mountain Zone. Last but not least, there are also a few DLC patch for each different system versions of the game, and there is yet another new wisp known as the Black Bomb Wisp, and it be obtained either by beating the Nightmare Zone DLC stage on the PC version or obtaining it from the Miiverse on the Wii U.\n\nOther than the game’s downsides, I give it a 7.5 out of 10.\n\nAt first when I played this game, I thought: "What is this, a copy of Super Mario Galaxy™?"

It's weird because the cutscenes run super smoothly for me with no technical hiccups.\nI'm hoping that in time this version of the game gets inproved and gets options to tone down graphics to help users who don't have especially powerful computers. I've played the Wii U version prior to this and that was a great experience.\nInteresting level design to accommodate a new gameplay style for Sonic. The visuals (assuming your computer has the specs) are amazing and the soundtrack, like with virtually every Sonic game, is pretty sweet too. I like the story and characters/voice acting, and whilst it's a diversion away from the formula established in Sonic Unleashed, Colours and Generations, it's still a nice change of gameplay that isn't completely intrusive.\n\nIf you think your PC can handle it, get Sonic Lost World. If not, try the Wii U version. I just hope that Sega fixes the issues of this initial port.","November 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lepondi/recommended/329440/","Lepondi","Rok o Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lepondi/","1705 products in account","The game is fun, I enjoyed it on the WII U, and im enjoying it even more using a DualShock 4 instead of the bulky gamepad. Its a gorgeous game (and looks great on lowest settings too!) and is really well optimized. Like Valkyria Chronicles and SA2, If you drop to 55fps or lower the game runs in slow motion, I managed to improve this in the control panel for my PC. However unlike Valkyria Chronicles, Lost World doesn't have a 30fps lock to stop this.\n\nThe levels are fun and the speed is slower then it is in Unleashed or Generations (Which personally I don't mind) and later levels can be a little frustrating. But the game throws lives at you like crazy so you probably won't get a game over if you save them up.\n\nOne thing new is the 100 achievements that come with the game, NONE of them are story related and you get them all by doing easy challenges for Omochao, Which kind of sucks because Red Ring achievements would push me to 100% it, But I'm probably going to do that anyway. The game also includes the Nights DLC Level which was previously only in the Deadly Six Edition on the WII U version, Which is a plus.\n\nOne problem I have is that Bosses are super easy to beat, Passing a super frustrating level only to fight a ♥♥♥♥ easy boss is a little dissapointing, Another complaint is the story, The whole "Deadly Six" is a depart from normal Sonic games, But the story is still super predictable.\n\nIf you're a fan of sonic games I recommend picking this up, But if you're into super high speed levels like Generations and Unleashed this might not be for you.\n\n7.5/10","November 3, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Instead\nCons:Its a Mario Game on Steam but starring Sonic & Co. Instead\nEither way you look at it. This game was on the Wii U and I happen to complete both systems with this title. Moreover I enjoyed it due to its fantastic levels, music, and breezing gameplay of speedrunning and loads of platforming action.\nSad thing is....This game is more focused on the platforming then the Speed. Don't get me wrong. There is speed in the game but for the majority of the game there are levels where its basically you have to do tricky jumps which at first caused me a few hiccups while getting used to the controls of it.\n\nWhat I do dislike is how forgettable the Deadly Six were. Like sure they are mysterious and little is shared about them but there is little to no story back on who the ZETI or for that matter LOST HEX even was.\n\nIs it worth $30? Well for some people who are fans of Sonic would go for it. Maybe some would wait for it when it goes on sale or in a bundle. But if you wanted a good time in platforming ala Mario style. Pick this game up.

It looks alright, it controls as well as can be expected (particularly with a gamepad) and it runs upscaled at 1080p, at a full and steady 60fps.\n\nThe surprising thing about "Sonic Lost World" is that finally, after decades, there is honest effort to make a good Sonic game that doesn't come out on a handheld. The writing is extremely light, but not wholly irritating, the voice acting isn't as grating as in previous titles and controls -generally- are a hell of a lot more responsive than they used to be. Lost World features constant switches of 2D and 3D, color-powers and, most importantly, precision platforming. Running and spinning have been assigned their own buttons/keys for better control of Sonic in the slower parts of the game and it works. The levels are imaginative, the pacing is good, the music is alright.\n\nThe bad thing about "Sonic Lost World" is that half-way through the game, the developers presumably had a stroke. All of them. Self-playing Sonic returns, the otherwise decent controls are thrown out of the window, because of the ridiculous level design and the player is punished simply for playing the game. Pitfalls that can't be avoided in the first few tries (at least), trial-and-error gameplay, cheap traps and insta-deaths that the game doesn't bother explaining before it's too late.\n\nListen, SEGA, take Classic Sonic from Generations and make that. Not Sonic: The Hedgehog 4, just Classic Sonic. There's a boatload of modern 2D-platformers. Why do you keep on trying to make 3D Sonic work for the last *15* years?\n\nOutside of hardcore Sonic fans, I don't see how this purchase would be worth anybody's time. It's a mediocre platformer, an often-frustrating experience and nothing that won't be either repeated or surpassed by the time the next Sonic game rolls out. The biggest praise I can give it is a couple of decent ideas in the core mechanics and that it's not as bad as most Modern Sonic games.\n\nI only regret having played just a little more than I should've to be able to refund it. Spend your money elsewhere. It'll save you a trip or two to the psychiatrist.\n\nPS: SEGA, drop the freaking LIVES system. It's obsolete, it's useless and your developers go to lengths to balance out the entire game for a reward/punishment system that hasn't been relevant in twenty years.","January 30","false","6.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","1"

I played 39 minutes to get to a boss that took me less than 10 seconds to beat, all the while listening to him taunting me through every stage up until then, extremely anti-climactic.\n\nOverall, this game is a crapshoot, go play Generations.","January 21","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StormieCyan/recommended/329440/","StormieCyan","Stormie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StormieCyan/","98 products in account","The positives\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHonestly, while this game is pretty different from other Sonic games, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The level design and music are nice, oh, and, the developers have a sense of humor. For the most part, the levels generally aren't broken (read the third paragraph for more info.) As colorful as it looks, perhaps it's not all just sunshine and rainbows. Not sure, haven't made it that far, but even if I did, I'd rather you find out for yourself by playing the game.\n\nUnlike Sonic Generations, it seems that ALL the cutscenes are either pre-rendered at a higher quality and resolution, or they're in real time. But my guess is, based on the game being originally on Wii U, they're pre-rendered. Either way, they actually look really nice.\n\n\nSome potential issues at this time\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn my experience playing the game, it didn't seem to have any issues, except one. In the first level of the second zone, getting hit by the worm and landing on the platform that rises when you land on it, seems to graphically freeze the game, and the level. But, for some reason, when I press the pause button, I can hear that it's paused, and things of that sort. If you experience this problem, take the other path. Unless this bug is patched.\n\n(Oh, but, the game might not work on your computer, that seems to be a problem with this game; not working on several people's computers for no apparent reason. If you really wanna play it, you may want to alert Sonic Team of the problem, and refund it if it doesn't work. Or you can wait if you're that worried, and see if the discussions by the community reveal the game to work as it should. Or wait for some fix to this mysterious problem come along.)\n\n\nConclusion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAnyways, if after reading this, you feel like getting the game, cool. If not, I kinda don't blame you. Whatever you decide to do, just make sure you've read my warning.\n(Also, if these issues are solved, I will adjust this review accordingly.)","November 4, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This review is made with me only played the very first zone/stage of the game*\n\nAs a Sonic fans that have no consoles, any Sonic games released on PC is always a nice thing.\n\nI find the control and stage environment is rather confusing at first, but after sometime playing it, the fun feeling started to emerge. Well, there is no tutorial whatsoever, you start a new game, got to see a beautiful cutscene and then straight to first zone without anything telling you what you can do in this game, not even an Omochao tells you what to do in the loading screen. Probably will be told later as I just played the very first zone/stage of the game.\n\nMultilock homing attack is also kind of confusing as I still don't know how to properly multi lock on enemies, sometimes I lock one, sometimes two, sometimes almost every enemies nearby.\n\nI don't know if this a con or a pro, but there is no rank system when finishing a stage, meaning there is no rank E,D,C,B,A, or S after you complete it. The bright side is that with this you can actually enjoy exploring the stage without worrying the time, instead of blasting through the stage and restart on even just one simple mistake like usual Sonic games before this game.\n\nThis review is made with me just playing the first zone and repeatedly playing it until I get all 5 red star rings in that stage, and my conclusion is : Sonic Lost World is fun, might not be the best Sonic game ever made, but I find it really fun to play. And FYI, I didn't get bored a single bit even I played the same stage like almost 5 times straight as there are many paths to choose from to finish the stage.\n\nDefinitely going to recommend it to someone, even if they are not a big fan of the blue blur.","November 3, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has your very basic graphics options, such as resolution, shadows, and grass, all of which are located in-game instead of in an external launcher, a Sonic PC first. I wish there were more, but for now it passes. For those wondering, the game has V-Sync enabled by default, and Anti-aliasing and Anisotropic filtering can be enabled externally using the NVIDIA or AMD applications. The Wii U buttons have been replaced by very low quality XBox buttons, and all of the Wisps can now be controlled without needing a touch screen (Yes!). Load times are quick, and the game maintains a solid, albeit locked, 60fps.\n\nThe graphics of this game are FANTASTIC, but I'm sure you've heard that already. No need to explain further! :P\nThe cutscenes are mostly rendered in-game, for your information.\n\nAs for almost every Sonic game, this game has a soundtrack better than its' graphics. The stages all have music to fit their atmosphere, and it all just sounds SO GOOD! Plus, a few of the levels have TANGO as the music. Who can get away with tango in a platformer? Sonic, that's who (The song is called Midnight Owl in case you were wondering.).\n\nGameplay-wise, the game isn't as bad as I remembered it being. You essentially are playing a Sonic game that is heavily inspired by Super Mario Galaxy. The controls seem to have improved a bit from the Wii U version, being even tighter than before now that we have 60 frames to work with. The level design is overall alright. There are more good levels than bad ones, but those bad ones will be ones that you will remember for being simply too difficult or too gimmicky. The boss battles, on the most part, are a piece of cake, and overall do not add much to the game. I find this game to be enjoyable overall, but you really need a controller to do so. The keyboard feels too clunky.\n\nA bit of a warning before purchasing: I don't know if this is just me or not, but this game has slowdown issues whenever there are more than 5 things on the screen. I look at my Task Manager as I'm playing and the game is hardly any using any of my CPU. What gives? Either way, take caution. I have and AMD CPU and GPU, for your information.\n\nOverall, a very solid entry into the Sonic franchise. Do not listen to what the haters say. I would highly recommend purchasing this game. Just beware of slowdown if you are an AMD user!","November 5, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_ERROR_ERROR_-0____/recommended/329440/","_ERROR_ERROR_-0____","Donald Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_ERROR_ERROR_-0____/","209 products in account","Sonic Lost World is a frustratingly difficult mess of a Mario Galaxy rip-off.\nAt first.\n\nWhen playing through the game on the Wii U I found that I was so frustrated with how Sonic controlled around the tube-like structure, which is very similar to that of Mario Galaxy. Seeing as I don't even like how the structure of Mario Galaxy's levels, I don't like it here either. It's not that I don't think it's good design, and it is for the most part. However taking controls from Mario Sunshine or Sonic Adventure and putting gravity physics into the mix, doesn't always end well. You'll notice both Mario and Sonic had to incorporate some form of a double jump into the control scheme because the gravity physics can screw up the jump arc you might need. When taking that into consideration, you really can't be formulaic when making a gravity based game like this.\n\nNow that's not saying that it's a bad game. I did have my fair share of fun with this game and I played it twice. Once on the Wii U (bought it day one) and once on Steam (pre-ordered it this time for the DLC). While both experiences were enjoyable, the Steam version was the most enjoyable. But why. First off, it's not because it's "1080p at 60fps!" No. This is a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port that only allows for windowed fullscreen mode. Meaning no anti-aliasing and no lower resolutions for people whose computers can't handle this game at full 1080p. The technical aspects of the game themselves don't make this the best version, what makes this the best version is because it's not on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Wii U. You don't need a heavy brick to play this game. You have any controller you want at your disposal, even the Wii U Pro controller, which you can't use to play this game with on the Wii U! Plus there's no Miiverse crap or other stuff, and I notice the hints and item bag a lot more because it's on the screen I'm looking at.\n\nThe next reason is because I have played the Wii U version 2 years ago. Was it that long already? ♥♥♥♥! Anyways, back when I first played this game on the Wii U I had no idea how to control Sonic and navigate the levels with parkour and crappy gravity physics. Now that I know how to handle it better, I actually had a much more enjoyable experience. With a bad experience under my belt (and the fact that I impulsively bought it like a little kid on a sugar rush), I thought that I made a mistake purchasing this game for PC, but I was wrong. Playing the levels with some more practice and skill than when I first did made me notice that this game is much better the second time around, and after Sonic Boom, I appreciate this game a lot more now.\n\nBottom line is this game is better the second time around. I can say that I enjoy this game a lot more than I first did two years ago, but that doesn't change the fact that I had a frustrating time trying to get used to the game's unusual control and level design, even if it does look good on paper.\n\nSonic Lost World get's a 7/10\nAnd a reccomendation to play it twice. Not 'cause it's great, but you won't notice it's good until you start another new game.","November 6, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It presents many good ideas among some poor ones.\n\nThe "Boost-to-Win" Sonic games suffered from an unruly control scheme that limited the potential for level design. Sonic Lost World's top speed is perfect, in my opinion, and it allowed for nicely designed, open-ended levels that this game is chock full of. I could really do without the "walk" function, however, because there are only so few instances where it's useful and come on, this is a SONIC game.\n\nBy far, the biggest flaw this game has is its over-complication with the controls. Having two seperate homing attacks was unessesary, and the parkour system felt really unintiuitive and lacking in polish. The early Sonic games, even the 3D ones, got away with very simple, 1-2 button controls, and that was a good thing, because while they were all "tough to master," it allowed players of all experiences to easily pick it up and play. Lost World feels like I need to refer to an instruction manual throughout with its control scheme.\n\nI could go into more, but overall, Sonic Lost World at least holds promise to me for future Sonic games to come. By all means, it's not a great game, but it's not bad either. Give it a shot if you like.","May 2","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game suffers from constant slowdowns even at minimum spec and resolutions. Apparently I need a Xeon to properly run Sonic Lost World, or perhaps a 980 TI. It's quite sad because it's easy to see that underneath its unplayable performance, this is a totally awesome Sonic game. Funnily enough the game runs the worst in 2D gameplay portions, maintaining a syrupy slow ~45fps, and yes, the game slows down anytime the framerate drops below 60fps. This makes the game the antithesis of a Sonic game, a slow and torturous exercise in frustration made all the more difficult to endure by the occasional brilliance that shines through in the level design and visuals which apparently mainstream computing components are unable to do justice for even at the most unselfish graphics settings. Speaking of graphics settings, they are almost nonexistent, which may be one reason playable performance is impossible to wrestle from this stubborn piece of software.","April 28","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bendilin/recommended/329440/","Bendilin","Bendi The Ripper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bendilin/","431 products in account","I originally bought the Lost World title that came out on the Nintendo 3DS because I was itching for a handheld, 3D Sonic title. Although it wasn't what I anticipated and the level design was pretty bad (mostly due to Lost World's building-block aesthetic translating horribly into the game itself), it was still somewhat enjoyable.\n\nI can't say the same for the "full" version of Lost World. Never having an opportunity to play it originally on the Wii U, I was excited to have an opportunity to try it on my PC. I regret everything. The only positive thing I can honestly say about this game is that the game ran well on my PC, the team did a seemingly great port of the game.\n\nSonic games, specifically the 3D titles, have always had issues and complaints, but I've always enjoyed them. Until now. If you want a 3D Sonic title on Steam, please, get Sonic Generations or Adventure 1 & 2 instead. Even if you've already played them and you're jonesing for more 3D Sonic, avoid this one. Don't even consider it an option.\n\nIt doesn't even have rememberable boss fights or music, which are usually Sonic staples regardless of the overall quality of the game. I am very, very glad that Steam gave me a refund for Lost World as quickly as they did.","January 22","false","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

No real complaints as it is a Sonic game.\n\n-Clunky gameplay; wall runs, ledge grabbing and Sonic's speed and jumps all feel rather awkward and sluggish. The lock-on attacks seem very temperamental and I found myself being hit quite a lot due to them not working properly. Half of the levels feel like I'm not even playing them, lots of on rails sections that you just watch rather than play.\n\n-Bad presentation: I genuinely have no idea why the levels are set around a boardgame-like hex grid. There are other spaces to move to to get achievements and pick up items, but there seems to be no real reason for it to be like that. Comes across as rerally ridiculous.\n\n-Bugs: Got stuck in the terrain/scenery quite a few times in the space of 2 hours. Managed to bug out the interface by switching between the pause options on the map area and the item menu. Experienced some really nasty slow down in a few areas. Not what ou should have with an overclocked i3, 8GB RAM and a 750ti.\n\n\n\nI was going to going to write a proper review but i think it was all summed up above. It's not "terrible", like so many Sonic games before it, but it certainly isn't great or even very good. I kept trying to excuse it as a kids game but that isn't fair either, as plenty of universal age games are actually quite good.\n\nIf you like Sonic then get it on a deal like i did, didn't feel to bad for £6-7. I just feel sorry for the people that bought it for full price on the Wii U. :/","January 24","false","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GearTight/recommended/329440/","GearTight","Tracer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GearTight/","331 products in account","This game is really tough for me to recommend.\n\nWhile the gameplay is Sonic X-Treme come to light, it once again changes something that didn't need to be changed. Sonic Generations, Colors and Unleashed before it had given Sonic a great base for Sega to expand upon, yet they somehow still felt compelled to completely throw everything from those games out the window here. The gameplay on offer feels a lot better in Super Mario Galaxy, but with Sonic, it just gets unnecessarily clunky.\n\nThe game is also far too short. At the time of this review, I have played through the main story once. That process took me six hours, and that includes cutscenes and Game Overs. By the way, the story is lame. Even Generations was more interesting. And for a franchise that (almost) always offers an at least half-decent storyline, that is inexcusable.\n\nThe levels are also often confusing and the boss battles far too easy. Even the second battle against Zavok becomes a cakewalk once you figure out how to do an off-the-wall jump.\n\nHowever, I do still have to applaud this game in a few aspects, most notably graphics and sound. The graphics are bright and colorful and remind me of the first Sonic games on Mega Drive, with lots of basic geometrical shapes built into the scenery of both levels and cutscenes. Speaking of which, those cutscenes now feel a lot less compressed than those in Generations, which look grainy and ugly in comparison.\n\nThe soundtrack, especially the main theme, final boss theme and Sky Road 1, is also once again very well made.\n\nFurthermore, this port is one of Sega's best yet for a Sonic game. The launcher is gone and graphics options have (finally) been moved into the game's own options menu. The game manages to hold a stable 1080p60 on my machine. Also, the dreadful Wii U controls have been reworked into something far more managable, especially with an Xbox 360 controller.\n\nUltimately though, I cannot recommend this game to anyone but the most die-hard of Sonic fans, especially not at its current 30€ price point.\nIf you're still interested, I would recommend waiting for a Steam sale.","February 3","false","6.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hawthm/recommended/329440/","hawthm","Hawthm the Coward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hawthm/","64 products in account","I was excited to see this game out on Steam, since I'd enjoyed Colors so much on the Wii. I was looking forward to playing the game now that it was no longer exclusive...\nHowever, it ended up being very disappointing.\nThe stage designs aren't bad. The villains are poorly acted but no worse than some others I've seen. The graphics are nice (though the colors are a bit gray at times). The music is the high point of the game, aside from the boss theme it's quite good.\nThe main problem with this game is how Sonic moves. The new double jump/target jump combo handles poorly, often causing accidental damage and even death. The colors handle far worse than they did in Colors, and pop up an immersion-killing message every time they wear off. The brake is poor and never useful. But the biggest issue is...\nSonic moves SO SLOWLY.\nI wouldn't mind if it tried to handle itself more like a slower game. Mario games are slower and play well. But this game tries to combine Sonic mechanics with the low speed, resulting in something that always feels painfully slow. Your maximum speed is reached very quickly, since Sonic accelerates like he always did; making it feel like he's TRYING to hold back. And the occasional speed machines (don't know their official name, the things you've always run into to go faster in Sonic) propel you forward at a more classical speed (though that is slower as well), they lose their boost rapidly, killing off any rush you might've gotten from it.\nOverall? Sonic Generations is on this store, as well as 2, CD and Adventures 1 and 2. Any of them would make a better choice. This was a nice attempt with one fatal flaw...\nBut that flaw kills it.","February 12","false","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I wanted to like this game, it had a few okay levels at first, I even got myself to laugh at some of the dialogue for a while. But it just can't last. The story just makes less and less sense as it goes along, and the characters feel alienating, when there is a clear, external antagonist and instead they just focus on bickering between each other, and having Tails turn into a sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (more so than Sonic, I mean) part-way through the story just feels weird for me, especially when it just comes out of nowhere. But honestly the story and writing is the least of my problems with this one.\n\nThe score is lighthearted but utterly feels uninspired, as do the world designs. The zones can get pretty inconsistent, especially the second 'desert' zone that contains two desert levels, one level set in a beehive, and another level set in an alternate universe that is literally made of sweets and cake and that kind of thing. I really don't know where they came from, honestly. Lots and lots of cheap deaths because of the cumbersome movement controls, that's what killed it for me. It all feels kind of weird: they try to use the old 2D sonic physics (with Sonic having a lot of weight and taking time to get up to speed) without providing anything in the 3D space to increase momentum in most levels. It's considerably slower than the Sonic Adventure games, or at least it feels that way because of how sprawling a lot of levels tend to be, though at least eschews the darker pallet and more 'realistic' textures for a bright and smooth look. Except the gloves. The gloves are unusually textured, and I can't not notice it. Fighting enemies will kill your momentum in an instant though, and speaking of which, they slowly introduce enemies that require extra steps to beat without any clear rules of how to accomplish those steps. I hope I'm not the only one who didn't know there was a kick mechanic because it only activates when you're in the air and locked onto an enemy, and on the ground it just makes you do slow rolls, which I believe are literally useless, I have not determined a single use of them thus far.\n\nThere are some cartoony demons that comprise the boss fights of the game and their basically just some character tropes. Spastic redneck, fat idiot, old mustached karate master, materialistic beauty queen, and of course the red one who is the leader because he is red. Oh, and one more--the depressed one. Honestly it was just strange, interracting with this enemy. His design is kind of still bright, just using muted shades of blue and grey, and looks very much in-line with the game's aesthetic, but his dialogue is just very ... unique. He just, talks about having depression and waiting for death without a hint of irony or hesitation. Not caring about anything, not wanting to do anything, even get out of bed, telling sonic that "nothing matters" and "in the end we all die anyway", or "In the end, the Reaper is the only one who wins." Honestly just look him up because it feels so out of place. I don't think a game clearly intended for young audiences SHOULDN'T be allowed to have characters who are clearly and openly depressed, even suicidal, and they definitely don't make it over dramatic here, but it's hard to tell if all of this is just a joke like literally every other boss character, or if they are genuinely trying to be serious about it, in which case, it feels kind of pointless, for at least as much of the game as I played, nothing really happens with those character traits at all. It feels silly to go on about that character as much as I did but I legitemately suffered through the most wretched and painful to play zone, the Silent Forest, just because he was talking in it the whole time. Saying that now I have to wonder if that was meant to be like the suicide forest, though I may be stretching it there. But hey, the frustrating levels made me want to kill myself, so there's that.\n\nThe game has a couple talking points in it, if only to see how Sonic games have changed over the years, but at the end of the day, this felt empty, poorly designed, with cumbersome and awkward controls and characters that felt disconnected honestly. I wanted it to be good, but I don't think I can easily recommend the game to anyone when it's just not really that fun.","February 11","false","4.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShonowTH/recommended/329440/","ShonowTH","Taco Belle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShonowTH/","84 products in account","It's EASILY the worst Sonic game. There's no question there. They put the least effort into this of all games they've ever made.\n\nWe all know Sonic 06 was pretty bad, but I'm gonna blame microsoft for that one, since they rushed its production almost a year.\n\nSonic Lost World is more of an effort to dip their toes in the water on a new approach to Sonic's marketing. There are 3 kinds of gamers.\n1. There are the older folks who played video games when the entire concept was new.\n2. My generation, the people who grew up while graphics were improving quickly and variously.\n3. The kids these days whining about how they don't have the games their friends have.\n\nThere are two kinds of gamers in that third group. There are the kids who like all the toony games, like Mario and Skylanders, and there are the CoD kids. They were aiming for the kids who are into the toony games with Sonic Lost World (which, mind you, is the severe minority of the two).\n\n\nAnyway, enough about marketing. I'mma get more personal.\n\nI liked mario when I was very little and had no game console where I lived. With the market rivalry between Sonic and mario going on when I was younger (around 10 or so), and Sonic being the one I favored while watching those fanimations of the two fighting, I grew to be very biased against mario and more fond of how original and often thrilling Sonic games were. I'm sorry to admit I became a creator of fan characters, but I was in the crowd that liked Sonic's darker, more dramatic plots. I'm not sorry for that. Sonic 06 is honestly one of my favorite Sonic games (but I give it credit that most people refuse to because they don't know microsoft is the troublemaker). The environments were too FF, though, for sure. But aside that game, what Sonic game (just Sonic, not collaborative with other games and characters) wasn't original? Sonic Drift 1 and 2. Anything else?\n\nAnd the music was always AMAZING. It got better and better and better! Sonic Unleashed is my favorite Sonic game in absolutely every way (other than the night stages, of course, for obvious reasons that need no explaining). The music, the thrills, all of it was just epic.\n\nSonic Colors was much less thrilling, but still alright. Generations was between the two, but it was fun to see this reference and that detail from way back when.\n\n\nSonic Lost World is almost a copy and paste of super mario galaxy. The biggest difference is the pace you can move at. I've actually never played or watched any mario games newer than SM64, so I could be wrong. I honestly don't care. The environments and gameplay had nintendo written all over them, regardless, and being not only biased against nintendo, but favoring the originality and thrills and relative realism in Sonic games' environments and music, I was as disappointed with Lost World as everyone else. Almost offended.\n\nI do still recommend this game, though. Why? It sucks among Sonic games, but I'm also biased with Sonic games being my favorite series. And even though it IS slower and less thrilling than other (fairly) recent Sonic games, it's still faster than anything you're gonna get from boring ol' nintendo. The art sucks, the music sucks, the story is "meh", but I can't say I didn't have a moderate amount of fun playing it. Honestly, when Eggman "died" near the end, I cried. Even though the game was very light, that weighed SO HARD on me.\n\nThe thrill and fun of the game, like most Sonic games, is in the long segments where you can dodge this, break that, and keep going without losing much speed (and not in the 2d platforming areas, which was almost the only shortcoming for Sonic Colors). They become more and more rare as the game progressed, and you're usually forced to slow down. No, I'm not one of the people who takes stages slow. I hate standing still, which is another reason I've found to hate nintendo.\n\nThe new wisps are garbage. Without playing the game, you forget over a very short period of time that they're even in there. The red "eagle" floats like twice as fast as the green "hover" wisp, but that seriously isn't much. The indigo "asteroid" wisp is a time-consuming gimmick. It does you no favors in the game other than getting you either past a wall or toward a poorly-placed red ring.\n\nSpeaking of red rings, Super Sonic is once again achievable by collecting them, and this time, it's even LESS worth it. You're invulnerable, but your top speed is no faster than the spindash. The spindash is simply replaced by boosting, which moves just as quickly and turns just as effectively, but it doesn't require the 60 milliseconds to initiate. And considering how long the transformation sequence takes, you're pretty much losing time doing it.\n\nAS FAR AS THE PORT GOES\nThere is no instruction manual. You gotta go to your input screen to figure out how to play. That wasn't much of an issue for me.\nYou might have a hard time believing that the gameplay went to 1080p when you set it that way in the menu, but just get to the gameplay part, okay?\nAnd the cutscenes are compressed this time, sadly.\nFurther, my IR emitter (that's a device for playing games in 3d, for those who don't know) won't even acknowledge it as a game.\n\n____________________________\n\n\nOverall, among all video games, I would give this 6.5/10 or so (which is still technically positive).\nAmong Sonic games, definitely 2/10. I enjoy it much more than those sorry phone games (of which I've played about an hour).","November 2, 2015","true","44.5"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","8","19","3","6"

I have to make that clear now because this isn't the focus of the review. For the record, I have played the game itself on Wii-U but I'm a huge Sonic fan, despite how terrible the majority of the 3D games have been.\n\nI want to talk about the port. There is no form of anti-aliasing in the game, not even FXAA which is very easy to implement -- for us end users, it can be forced in the nVidia control panel, and I believe AMD users can force it or SMAA using a third party application. It is forced into borderless fullscreen, and using DSR to supersample/downsample simply doesn't work. I set the ingame resolution to 2x2 (3840x2160) but the rendered image was very clearly 1080p. The incidental assets - menus, UI and so on - haven't been produced to a higher quality, and in fact look worse than I would expect from a 720p console port; it feels like I'm emulating a PS2 game. Simply forcing MSAA and transparency AA in the control panel doesn't work.  As a result, the game is a blocky mess.\n\nFXAA and downsampling are really simple to support. One is a post-process method, and the other just requires the game to render at a higher resolution. With most games, it is assumed that they will support both of these methods, if no other is available.\n\nFor now, the best option is probably to use a third-party SMAA injector, but this really shouldn't be the case and until Sega fixes this, I couldn't possibly recommend the game even to a hardcore Sega fan like myself.\n\nQuick edit: I will say that the game runs well, but it's difficult to gauge performance relative to hardware because this is a straight Wii-U port running on a modern PC.\n\nQuick addendum: there is a way to enable proper anti-aliasing (the SGSSAA method) using nvidia inspector and the same anti-aliasing compatibility bit that Sonic Generations used. I will say that, using this method, it's a really gorgeous and colourful game and the visual design is really impressive (as, to be fair, was that in Colours and Generations). I recommend turning DoF off for the best image quality. It's a competent platformer but the change of direction is a negative one, the run button was fairly unnecessary as much as people complain about the controls in 3D Sonic games, but I had and am having fun playing it and don't think it's some sort of massive downfall for Team Sonic, just a misstep. If you're a Sonic fan like I am then consider this a qualified recommendation.","November 2, 2015","false","15.1"," 26 of 56 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","26","56","3","0"

That is actually impressive.\n\nSo I'll just say it right now. I'm a HUGE sonic fan. Not the kind you might think, but just a guy that really loves Sonic games. I can even like Sonic Adventure and Adventure 2 as some of my favorite games despite it's horrible flaws. But this is just... It feels like a shell.\n\nSo I'll go over the things I DID like in the 15 minutes and then over everything that I didn't like and made me stop playing after such a short time.\n\nPros:\n-Visually as beautiful as ever like most Sonic games (with Generations still being one of the best looking games on the market in my honest opinion). Colorful and bright. While I do like Adventure 1 and 2, I do feel that the hugely colorful nature fits Sonic better.\n-Music is pretty good, which is to be expected from a Sonic game.\n-It runs pretty well, but then again I am running a gtx 960 so I'd be really surprised if it managed to tank in framerate.\n\n\nCons:\n-The gameplay is AWFUL. I don't want to complain about Momentum based gameplay being gone, but the problem is that it's been replaced by something that just isn't good. The movement is very sticky, making walls more of bothersome than ever. Not only that, jumps are AWFUL. Without a himing attack, the distance is just straight up horrible, ESPECIALLY for Sonic. And you get hit for seemingly no reason. What was once a succesful homing attack then suddenly turns into you taking damage FOR NO REASON. Nothing being done differently. Not only that but the few levels I played were VERY linear. The best sonic games always have multiple paths despite the level being linear in nature.\n-The Deadly Six are probably, from first impressions, the LEAST interesting villains in a sonic game to date. They're just kinda boring, and their designs don't even look like they belong in the Sonic universe.\n-Why are wisps even there? They seem to be included for no reason other than "just because". The wisp did nothing to add to the gameplay and just made me stop for no reason other than "oh I have to use a wisp".\n-Speaking of which, this game does a LOT to stop you from just fluidly going through the level like a Sonic game should.\n-It's just really kind of boring.\n-The game utterly fails to explain ANYTHING to you. It just throws you into the game and goes "well you figure it out". This works well for games like Zelda but here it fails horribly. Hell even Dark Souls 1 had a better introduction into the bloody controls.\n\nPC specific cons;\n-You can tell it was a console game. The UI graphics are quite blatantly low res and in-game cutscenes too. This is at 1080p resolution, by the way. That is pretty much the standard for PC games. At least it's not locked to 30, I guess...\n\n\nThe game feels like a shell. Like a tech demo. It feels like an idea and nothing more. This should've been a tech demo for the development of a good game, because what you have is a good base for a potentially good game. But it just isn't.\n\nAnd this comes from someone who had enjoyment out of eldritch abominations like Sonic R and Sonic the Fighters.","January 8","false","0.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","3"

I love that about games, when the colors are intense and vivid. It really makes the game more enjoyable and pleasant to look at. That's why I love games like mario sunshine and galaxy cuz their color scheme is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, and also cuz they were fun and stuff.\n\nHaving a run button was ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. This is sonic, the guy who can run around the world in seconds, why the ♥♥♥♥ does he need a button to RUN?\nThe 3D segments were alright, they reminded me of mario galaxy, which isnt bad.\nThe 2D segments felt REALLY AWKWARD to play, like really awkward. The way you needed to hold down the run button to climb up walls was just so ♥♥♥♥ing weird, maybe its just me, but it totally ♥♥♥♥ed me up.\nAND WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ A RUN BUTTON ARE YOU SERIOUS MY FINGER GETS TIRED FROM HAVING TO HOLD IT DOWN ALL THE DAMN TIME WTF WERE THEY THINKING\nAnd another part related to the 2d segments, there was a part where youre being "chased" by a tornado, which you can easily ♥♥♥♥ing outrun, but when you get too far it makes you stop and wait for it to catch up. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥???\n\nI think the challenges feature should be skippable, like its kinda annoying how it pops up all the time, like omo chao nobody actually likes you, im sorry dude.\n\n♥♥♥♥ tails\n\nI think it was nice to have a new sonic world thingy to play on, with new enemies that was cool, except the enemies were so ♥♥♥♥ing easy to beat.\nLike the boss battles were jokes.\n\nI'm one of those people who haven't played sonic colors, so those sprite thingies were new to me. The last sonic game I had played was secret rings, and that was A LONG ♥♥♥♥ING TIME AGO.

Thanks Steam for adding that!\n\nI think the sonic team or whoever works on the games shouldn't combine the 2d and 3d games. (keep in mind I havent played generations yet so maybe im wrong) Instead I think that they should spend more time on one of the types and really REALLY make it a damn nice game. I personally prefer 3d platforming because I think it allows for more cool things and it's usually more enjoyable for me.\n\nAnyways idk where im going with this, dont buy the game, trust me, the positive reviews made me think ah you know they said the game was okay ill give it a shot but no dont buy it","December 2, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

I don't hate Lost World, but I really don't like it either. Ultimately, I'm leaving this as a not-recommended, but I'd say pick it up should it ever go on sale for at least $15. There's a good game in there somewhere, it's just not there.\n\nSo Lost World. Basically, Lost World. To put it into perspective, if you didn't like the Wii U original, well this may not change too much.\n\nTL;DRA decent Sonic game that becomes a hard recommend due to poor execution, cheap level design, and it's strange desire to constantly change the rules of how the game plays....for the worse.\n\nPick it up on sale.\n\nReviewAnd for the record....I honestly don't really like this game. It's a hard sell at this moment: A Sonic game where it's level design comes from being either cheap or way too gimmicky for it's own good. It's hard to adapt to the game's large list of controls and game mechanics because it really likes to shake things up often, usually leaving in some mixed results.\n\nFirst, the good: Presentation is pretty good. The art style is nice, and the music (Despite not being really "Sonic") is definitely a great if forgettable romp. I guess what I can really say is that Lost World is really "Lost Potential". There's so many interesting concepts, so many interesting ideas, that just get lost in the game. More on that later.\n\nIt's mostly polished, it's mostly alright, it's mostly decent. The issue that breaks the game is really just the questionable execution and the really annoying things about it that make Lost World one of the more frustrating experiences I've had in awhile. It's honestly hard to talk about what I really like about the game a lot, because I don't necessarily hate it. I think it's actually good, it's just so flawed that it's hard to think of what the game really does right at this point.\n\nThe port is nice though, although the resolution is a bit funky for me. The game runs a lot more consistent at 60fps although the cutscenes run at 30fps. Video options are pretty barebones but the optimization is great, so it's not too big of a deal. This can run on a lot of low-end computers too. A lot of the new stuff like controller prompts and such look ugly as hell, so there's some pretty low areas in terms of polish. It's clear that this is more of a budget port, but it's not bad at all. Just not too fantastic.\n\nUPDATE: The game may or may not be a bit a hassle to run for those with low-end computers. Some have stated the game runs perfect with even Intel HD Graphics while others struggle to even get 20 FPS. My PC Build is an absolute beast so this isn't a problem for me at all.\n\nThe story is also just unbearable to play through. Everybody in the game are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Sonic acts so arrogant and cocky that it honestly makes him a bit unlikable, and Tails sounds way too pretentious for his own good. The game's jokes fall completely flat, and it's just not a confident story that delivers. What the hell, like I play Sonic games for their story.\n\nAnd it sucks too, because this game has some seriously great concepts and ideas that could had very well turned Sonic out for the better. But it doesn't, because of clunky execution. Parkour is something that easily fixes the problems of you being stopped by running into a wall, but running into walls and in general wall-running just doesn't entirely feel right, and is in general really clumsy. The real problem is that Lost World constantly changes and shifts the rules of how Sonic controls, without much explanation or any real reason too. There's a level where you're a snowball, a level with stealth-segments, and a level where you glide around in the air. The constant shifts in level design and pacing make this game really hard to play, as if grasping on to it's sort of finicky controls weren't hard enough.\n\nBosses aren't even a challenge. Zazz can be taken down in both of his acts so easily it's almost sad.\n\nThe real flaw here is it's level-design. Lost World has an interesting idea: Make the levels flat, but compensate this with multiple routes. Unfortunately, I don't think Sonic has ever worked that easily in a flat environment, even if the game was designed for said flat-environment. As mentioned before, with the constant shifts in how you play, so a lot of the levels don't even follow the same mechanics as others. And it's just cheap, too. There are enemies in the game that can just kill you in one hit. Bam. Their placement in the levels don't exactly help either, making for some really frustrating moments in the game. For the multiple-paths idea, it's not half-bad, but it's weird that for a Sonic game, a lot of the alternate paths generally waste your time more, rather then saving it.\n\nQuestionable design decisions hold it back too. Why aren't there checkpoints in the time attack? Especially when the game is so cheap that one death leads you back to the start? Why are these bonus items even on there, and what's the point? They're almost completely useless and only the wisp ones are helpful for completing Omochao's challenges, which is a boring checklist of boring things to do but can only do 3 specific randomized missions at a time. Color Powers are just poorly tacked-on for no reason.\n\nIf you aren't reading the English I'm saying, basically what you have on your hands is a game that just has no idea what it wants to be. A platformer? A pinball game? Stealth? Some of the levels are alright, while others are just an absolute pain to play through, to the point of just burning me out on the game completely.\n\nSo overall, what do I think of the game? It's better to pick it up on sale. Flawed execution, garbage level design, laughable story, it all holds it back, but there's still a good game in there somewhere. If you love Sonic, or express interest in trying this game out, then give it a shot. $30 is really stretching it for a really flawed game that's been out for 2 years now though.","November 2, 2015","false","4.4"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","1"

If you're planning to buy this game and have a Wii U, save yourself the crap and just buy the Wii U version. You get free DLC stages there anyway for easy 1ups/animals. If you can't get the game on Wii U or already bought the PC version, pray that SEGA patches this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAs for the game itself...\nIt's a great game. Sonic's run button is a bit of an odd thing to have, but otherwise the mechanics are great. Spindash is basically a Boost you have to charge, Parkour is a great way to get through stages and allows a bit of cheating sometimes. The game has a pretty sudden difficulty curve after the first zone, but it's not too hard to overcome. The villians are for the most part stupid, Zazz being the only one good at his job, but the story is decent. Definitely not Unleashed levels of good story. I reccomend the Wii U version of this game.\n\nFinal rating:\nPC: 6/10\nWii U: 9/10","November 2, 2015","false","9.3"," 20 of 52 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","20","52","3","0"

This game had the potential to be truly great, but carried no inertia into it. Coming from Unleashed (Daytime stages), Colours and then Generations, this title seems to be a de-evolution in reverting Sonic back into a janky platformer with many frustrating gimmicks and gameplay choices. At least it's not Sonic Boom...\n\nThe game runs great on most PCs, but does need a bit more GPU power to play compared to Generations. That may throw some people off, as Generations was a visually superior and seemingly larger game overall. However, if your rig can handle it, 60 FPS is consistent and vitally necessary to avoid gameplay issues and possible motion illness. Also, this is the first Sonic game to not need a launcher, which may or not be welcomed by some.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, with quite a bit of variation between each track. Expect to hear some tracks multiple times, because the main theme repeats throughout and certain Acts and environments are recycled in later levels. The script is not as polished as Colors but is a bit better than Generations' story. I guess the Happy Tree Friends' writers grew bored after counting all their Sega money. Do you like cutscenes in your Sonic game? Expect to sit (or skip) through a LOT of them.\n\nHere's where we start running into issues; the gameplay. Nothing is explained to you clearly. You shouldn't expect a game to hold your hand throughout, but at the same time, not referring back to the wiki every 15 minutes like you were playing Dark Souls because you can't figure out what the game requires. Targeting is nuance and do not expect a solid double jump if enemies or targets around. Want that out-of-reach red coin on the wall adjacent to you and two enemies? Good luck, you'll not be getting it unless you jump beforehand at a particular angle and speed, and you'll just target Badniks.\n\nBosses repeat themselves, are either overly simple or complex and take up a lot of level time. Six main worlds with four normal acts in each. Boss fights at the end of two acts in each world (with the exception of the last world, which has 8 fights). I just wanna go fast, Sanic. These fights felt more like a chore than fun to play.\n\nAcheivements are possibly the worse offender. Most games progress naturally with acheievements. You earn 50 coins, an achievement pops, then later when you would get 500 rings, another one. Not in Lost World; you are limited to pursuing three achievements at any given time, due to arbitary restrictions by Omo-Chao. They are also heavily randomized so you may repeat a few or go from defeating 500 enemies for one, to only defeating 50 in the next. It is game padding at its worse. It does not innovate the player much and becomes a grind.\n\nMy recommendation is pick this up on sale, preferably less than $10. Or get it on the Wii-U for more 'natural' controls and the ability to play the Nintendo DLC stages without mods. It'll perhap show Sega that you want more Sonic/SEGA games ported and developed for PC, but this in particular was a slight misstep  in the direction for the series.\n\n\n\n","March 16","false","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It could be better, but at the same time it could be worse.\n\nMy only complaints are that the key bind screen stops registering my key inputs when I try to swap keys (I can only fix it by shift-tab-ing into the Steam overlay, which even then only lets me exit the menu), so I was forced to use a gamepad. Thankfully the gamepad controls were easy to follow. Other than that, the drop in framerate causes massive slowdown, even if it's only by 15 FPS, similar to some 2D sprite-based games (Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac, etc.), which makes getting through a few level sections a chore. It's odd when you consider that the PC specs are pretty basic (I could probably run this on my school laptop if I wanted to).\n\nIf the devs can patch up these issues (at least the frame rate issue), I could easily call it one of the better versions of Lost World. The controls are tight and responsive (albeit a bit TOO responsive with the analog control), the game looks pretty good graphically, and the levels are very well designed with the parkour in mind.

It slows the Blue Blur down to more Azure-Ambler levels, and the learning curve is a bit sharper than you'd expect from a Sonic game anymore. But in terms of trying something new, this formula may not be ideal for Sonic, but it's certainly a new and fully realized break from a long streak of boost-to-win.\n\nStarting with the cons: the controls are a bit of a hassle, and everything is front-loaded, so you might be picking up on the wrong cues and actions before the game tells you better. I'll even admit, putting the spin dash on the left trigger (on a gamepad) is uncomfortable. But you gotta get used to it, because this game can get really difficult if you haven't mastered the moves. Sonic always seems a bit too eager to show them off, as well, so expect to run up walls you never intended to. And the red star rings are back. I hate those guys. They make you play it slow and silly, when you just want to run.\n\nOn the plus side: the visuals are great. Really great. The lush and vibrant colors, the tube-shaped levels and hexagonal patters. The sleek but adorable badniks, the critters, everything looks energetic and engaging. And, in the end, the levels work hand in hand with the new control style and mechanics, making the game feel pretty tight, save for a few levels that see you falling through the air or sliding down hills (I'm looking at you, rail grinding mine tracks). And NiGHTS is here!\n\nSure, there's a lot of growing pains to be found, and maybe the departure from the standard Sonic toolset is worthy of a little divisiveness. But there's a lot to enjoy here as well, and even if it doesn't work on Sonic's level, it will probably work on yours.","December 23, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays a lot like Super Mario Galaxy(as other people have stated before) where sonic is able to circumnavigate through the levels. With this new type of gameplay, Sonic is able to find different routes as well as find hidden items/collectibles through out the levels by exploring the spheric worlds.\n\nIf i had to compare this with another Sonic game, Id say it feels like Sonic 3D Blast, in terms of excitement. You never feel like youre going "fast", something that obviously all the sonic games are known for, and when you do finally pick up some speed, youre stopped by either an object, an enemy, or you have to slow down and explore the other side of the world to make sure you didn't skip on a collectible. It takes away from the very thing sonic was built around, Speed.\n\nWe also see a return of the wisps that were in Sonic Colors but so far i've very rarely use their powers and really theyre only useful in boss fights that require them or levels that require you to use them to advance.\n\nI think old school sonic fans may be disappointed with this one since it honestly feels like a huge departure from Sonic games like Sonic Adventure or even a recent game like Sonic Generations.\n\nIt's still worth a try but, personally, i'm a bit disappointed with this game.","November 5, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I honestly don't know how to answer that. If the price dropped a bit, then I'd say sure, go for it. It's a competent game. Maybe not the best PC port ever, but it's not awful either.\nFor now, though, I'd say wait until either A) the price drops, or B) modding the game has really taken off, making some of the more annoying stuff... well, less annoying.

But don't let the screenshot or trailer fools you. In this game you play in 3D mode and also 2D mode just like Sonic Generation but it seems to have more focus on Boss fight than the old game.\n\nGraphic -\nCan now adjust graphic setting in game (used to have menu in windows). Graphic looks a bit outdated but okay during motion. A lot of eye candy animation.\n\n8/10\n\nGameplay -\nMany 3D stages have more than one way to beat. For example, one the first stage, instead of just running right away (Grass area). you can try move to the right to flip the level upside down (Mud area). At least it doesn't make the level too linear and much more replayable. Overall, This game is much harder than Sonic Generation, especially during boss fight.\nSome level I feel like I was playing Super Meat Boy.\nTook me 7 hrs to clear this game.\n10/10\n\nSound -\nI like BGM from Generation better. Too many boss fight but only one boss BGM??\n9/10\n\nBoss -\nMost bosses are very interesting and fun to beat, but the game doesn't not explain required moves that that will actually does damage to the boss. (like you need let the spining power to charge up before the attack. or need to kick instead of just spin jump). This is very annoying while I was in the late game.

I honestly don't know how to answer that. If the price dropped a bit, then I'd say sure, go for it. It's a competent game. Maybe not the best PC port ever, but it's not awful either.\nFor now, though, I'd say wait until either A) the price drops, or B) modding the game has really taken off, making some of the more annoying stuff... well, less annoying.

Not the fastest Sonic game, but I do like the platforming sections and you can still go quite fast if you use the infinite spindash move.

What that means is, the controls are sluggist and delayed as hell compared to the Wii U version. This game emphasizes precision fairly heavily, so the sluggish controls are honestly a dealbreaker when maneuvers that were easy to pull off on Wii U are nearly impossible here.\n\nSomething funny to note is that the 360 control map is literally a graphic the devs lifted from a deviantart page. They stole art. Wow.\n\nGet this only if you've already experienced the game in its best form on Wii U and were desperately craving another Sonic mod experience since Generations.","December 27, 2015","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game controls like a piece of ♥♥♥♥, a metaphor for Sega's everlasting reputation. I shouldn't be suprised, just when they got the formula right with Generations they go an ♥♥♥♥ it up for no apparent reason.\nGraphically the game is appealling, good colours, textures and all that. But the asthetics are probably the only appealling thing about this game.\nControls are abysmal, its hard to navigate through levels and the whole parquor aspect is a bit clunky. The reason why generations worked was that the mechanics were simple and easy to navigate, it allowed a fluid flow of motion and gave simplified decision making in high speed parts. It was easy and fun. Here in Lost World, they try adding too many elements (parqour, wall running with homing attack, wall jump,etc) Its too much, allowing it to be more complex. That's no fun.\nVoice acting and story are your standard in any other Sonic game, nothing new there.\nIn summary, a disappointing and frustrating game. To put things into perspecive, I always like to finish campaigns to get a sense of accomplishment and to finish the story. For this game, I switched it off after only half way, it is not worth the time.","December 27, 2015","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy it on sale.  Its a highly polished, platinum guilded turd.\n\nIt comes to a great start, coming off as Super Sonic Galaxy.  It has  wonderful, diverse music, a majority of the levels are pleasant.  But poor camera and unexplained controls and quirks ruin it.  I ended up going on Youtube a few times for help on certain parts, only to find the Youtube comments of others venting the same frustrations "how am I supposed to know how to do THAT?!"  There are a few levels and bosses that will have you going "what were they thinking?"  Unfortunately, those moments are too diverse.\n\nSonic has a few new tricks.  But right down to the end, I never figured them all out and neither will you.  Sonic still has his 3D era lock on jump.  But for reasons unknown, you will not know why it doesn't work on certain enemies until its too late.  He has a second lock-on attack that serves as a kind of "grapple kick" for those heavier enemeis and not much else.  He also has a new "parkour" ability that will get you killed.  Over and over.\n\nThe plot is throwaway, which is fine.  Sonic and Tails encounter a new possee called The Deadly Six.  They are deliberately stereotypical, and awful both as characters and bosses.  The female one may offend female gamers, like, TOTALLY whining about her nails and some junk.  You'll smash all their faces in until the final one, in which you will have to reach for Youtube because Sonic Team decides to throw some new rules your way.\n\nUgh, I deleted this with a vengance.

But when you have a game like Sonic Lost World, in which the controls deviated a lot in comparison to the other 3D installments in the series, you need one of two things: level design that can teach the player the basic of movement and how to properly interact with the stages or a just a tutorial stage - or stages.\n\nSince this game doesn't give you a chance to experiment with certain mechanics (like the parkour and unnecessary Wisps) before putting you to test with do-or-die situtations, a proper tutorial would certainly be helpful. This is probably the main reason SLW got a lot of hate on its Wii U release, by doing a bad job teaching the player.\n\nIf you endure some frustration (especially with some red rings and questionable checkpoints), you may be able to enjoy a fairly good platformer with great music, graphics and performance. I have a lot of fun replaying the stages, be it for the sake of exploration or just for speed running. I really wish the next 3D Sonic game gives us something similar in terms of controls, but with more clever level design and less gimmicks.\n\nProbably a 7,5/10.","February 3","true","37.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Except it's got like... a few extra toes.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it's probably one of the least buggy Sonic titles in history, it's just very formulaic. Every world is long level, gimmick level with a miniboss, short gimmick level, and leadup to boss. You need a certain number of rescued animals to enter the boss stage, but (according to the FAQ I consulted at one point anyway) it sounds like they lowered the numbers you need DRAMATICALLY in this PC port, so that's cool. I only had to grind a single time for about 15.\n\nIt's just not amazing. But a mid-tier platformer with some of the weird ideas this game has (KATAMARI LEVEL. CASINO STAGE. SKY RACE.) is way better than a busted mess or an unplayable title.","March 5","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The achievements are related to the missions that Omochao gives you after finishing the first level. You can only have 3 missions at time, and missions are only updated after you finish the level or lose all your life. This mean that if you leave the game earlier, the missions won’t be updated.\n!! Beware !!\nYou should be warned that some achievement won’t unlock on the first attempt, if that happen you need to do it all over again if you didn’t follow my tip. Please refer to (*) at the end of that review.\n\nI only suggest to get this game around $10.\n\n\n(*) : When you finish a mission in a level, a window pop up and you should also have the steam achievement pop-up too. If not you should leave the game, check your network and restart the level again until the steam achievement pop-up. If you don’t do so, you’ll need to restart a new game after finishing all the missions to start over until you finish the one that didn’t unlock on the first attempt. The other way is to make back-up often.","March 1","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/recommended/329440/","goldenagegmr","GAGMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/","425 products in account","SEGA just has to keep reinventing the wheel, don't they?  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game but it just falls flat on almost everything it's trying to emulate from the Galaxy series. Also, holding the R-Trigger to run makes for a very odd way to play a Sonic game & it makes my hand cramp.\n\nPROS\n-Solid PC Port\n-Includes Nights DLC\n-Unique style gameplay compared to other Sonic games\n-Well Done Animated Cutscenes\n\nCONS\n-It's boring\n-Clunky & Painful Controls\n-It does very little with the Galaxy-like design\n-Absolutely must have a controller\n\nStory\n\nThe story is pretty basic, even for a Sonic game.  It starts off with Sonic riding with Tails on his biplane chasing after Eggman who's capturing critters to use for his experiments.  Your plane gets shot down into this new place called the Hex.  Sonic then chases down Eggman only to blunder & release some new minions from his control.  It then turns into Sonic stopping these Deadly Six from destroying the world.  That's pretty much it.\n\nGameplay\n\nSo this is where things get iffy.  First of all, you know how in most sonic games you hold forward to run & then there's a boost, spin dash & a jump?  Well whoever directed this game thought it would be a good idea to give Sonic a run button.  My guess is because of how the new world is designed to go slow, or at least slower than other Sonic games.  Now, a run button doesn't sound like a bad idea when so many other games use one but good god, they couldn't have picked a worse button to map it toward.  You have to hold down the Right Trigger constantly in order to move fast and oh my god is this terrible.  After a few minutes of holding it down my hand starts to cramp and you need to hold it down a lot.  Not only because you use it to run but you also use it to cling to walls for wall jumps & parcore maneuvers.  This game is basically an endurance test for me to see how long I can handle my hand straining from holding down a trigger that wasn't meant to be held down this long.\n\nThen there's the level design.  It's trying to be like the Super Mario Galaxy games but it does absolutely nothing with it.  If you've played the Galaxy series you know how much fun it is jumping around worlds & platforming around in low gravity.  This game has very little going for it in that area.  They basically decided to make levels in the style of the Galaxy games but you still just run straight to the very end.  No little extra areas to unlock, & aside from the red rings there's nothing to collect.  The game does give you Omachao challenges but these offer very little reward.  You basically get a random item to use in stages.\n\nAnother thing this game does poorly is the tutorial.  In which, there isn't one.  So you basically gotta figure out how to play the game on your own with some Question marks giving you vague explanations in the first level.  I didn't even know I had an item box until halfway through the game when it said I had too many items & had to delete one.  Also, the game's UI looks like it was designed for the Wii U gamepad since you have no way of knowing what button opens what menu.  Would you guess that R3 opens the item box?  Cause I didn't know that & the game doesn't do much in the way of telling me & no situation where I had to use it to know it even existed.\n\nOVERALL\n\nThis is, for the most part, a very generic 3D platform experience especially for a Sonic game.  It's not a bad game, but it does absolutely nothing to expand the franchise.  If you decided to skip this one you wouldn't be missing a whole lot.  I'd say only get this if you are a big SEGA or Sonic fanboy like I am (even then you should wait for a sale) or if you have some kids that need something to keep them busy.  And make sure you have a comfortable controller because holding down the R-Trigger is the absolute worst part about this game.","March 17","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Remember the time when you had the time to react to badnicks, pitfalls and traps? (megadrive sonic), well this time you have the need to direct sonic and not just press forward in the controller. It´s not the best sonic game i have played , and is hard to beat sonic 3 & knuckles in my opinion, but this is a solid game, and i really cannot understand the poor critical reception by people stating how a sonic game must be.\nI repeat, you can dislike this game, but a bad game? c´mon or you don´t like sonic, don´t like platformers, or read too much IGN.\nI recommend it , but because we all have different tastes, do a favour to yourself and watch gameplays in youtube made by people that can actually play the game.-\n\n","January 28","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Davidson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/R_C_Davidson/","111 products in account","While not the best Sonic game, it has some interesting ideas it could've stuck with if improved.  I have previously played the 3DS version of the game, and all I can say is that this port is way better than that version.\n\nFirst, this game isn't very demanding at all.  Seeing as this was a port (a good one) of a Wii U game, it's probably no surprise that getting 60 FPS is no issue on most computers from at least five years ago.  That doesn't mean the game is terrible looking.  In fact, it doesn't look that bad, and it's pretty colorful.  I would've liked to see a bit more options, but since the port seems to be properly done, I'm not going to make a big fuss out of it.\n\nThe gameplay is also good.  While there are some flaw here and there, like not properly teaching you the new parkour system, I really have no complaints with the style Sonic Team went with.  I do question why the Wisps are back, because in the story (more on that later), they're not in it.  They're just there just to be there.  In fact, other than a completion record, they're not really that important.  I also love how easy the boss fights are (sarcasm totally intended).  I can name some easy bosses that are harder than these, but the point is that they're so easy that it's embarassing.  Early boss fights are forgivable for this, but the later ones?  One of them is just turning on the lights and do some homing attacks as the guy floats around doing nothing, a fight that probably wouldn't last even a minute.  Gameplay is fine, but they definitely needed to improve it instead of going to.......Sonic Boom.\n\nThe story is a mixed bag.  The parts with Sonic and Eggman working together seem interesting enough, and you might get a few laughs out the story, but the main threat, the Deadly Six, doesn't feel like a threat at all.  Not only are they the easiest bosses I've ever fought in any game, which most of them are likely in my top ten easiests, they're also bland and stereotypical.  For example, Zazz, the rebel type, Zeena, the pretty girl, and Zomom, a big, fat idiot who loves eating food all the time.  About the only thing they had going for them was that they "suck the color out" of Sonic's world, but other than that, they can be pretty forgettable.  Thank goodness nobody plays Sonic games for the story.  That would be like buying a TV to hang a picture.\n\nOne thing I would say that I hate is that the game can some unnecessary gimmicks at you.  While not as bad as the 3DS version (seriously, f*** that game), I feel that most of the game's gimmicks, like the Wisps, don't work well.  In fact, you'll have a boss fight in a giant snowball, which doesn't make sense to me.  If Sonic Team ever does back to this style of gameplay, then they really need to get rid of the gimmicks.\n\nAs a whole, this is actually a good game, and it had a good concept going for it.  Once you get past all the gimmicks in the game, then you will find enjoyment in the game.  Therefore, I recommend this game, though probably on a sale.","January 10","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It suffers from weak writing, characterization and story, as tends to be with most installments in the series. You'll find some particularly cringeworthy stuff here though, even moreso than previous titles ("I can't wait to pound that sorry blue butt!" comes to mind) thanks to the terribad Pontac/Graff combo behind the script.\n\nAs far as gameplay is concerned, there are some questionable level design choices peppered throughout. It's generally agreed upon that the ice levels are fairly terrible (I tend to mostly agree). Parkour fails more often than it works, and the addition of the new run button will take a bit of getting used to for those who frequent the Sonic games.\n\nIs it bad, though? Like, Sonic 2006 or Rise of Lyric bad? Absolutely not.  If you can get it on sale, it's definitely worth the purchase.

The only bad part about the port is that the game runs on an odd engine that has to render every single frame and will not skip (I think it's referred to as a frame-dependent engine). This means if your computer can't run the game at silky smooth 60 fps, it will be run at silky smooth 60 fps in slow motion which is a bit undesireable in a Sonic game. Sonic Adventure 2 also ran with this engine. (Fun fact, Sonic Adventure 1 did not). (That was not a very fun fact.)\n\nI do know how the rest of the game plays out and would highly reccomend the game to anyone interested in it.","January 24","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The writing is a little bit cringey, but the art is really nice and the colours pop. I think a lot of the levels in this game are reminiscent of the 2D Sonic games and kind of how I imagined Sonic would transition into 3D as a kid.\n\nIt is kind of uncanny that this game came out as a WiiU exclusive following Galaxy but there are definitely worse games you could get inspiration from.\n\nOverall it's good, I like the new villains, no framerate drops or major hassles running (though I well overshoot the recommended specs) but it seems to be locked at 1080p without doing some fiddling. The keyboard controls technically work if you don't have anything else but it's clearly made for a gamepad like Generations was.\n\nThere are demos on the other platforms this is on but I recommend playing at least 3 levels or so before deciding whether you like the feel of it.","January 24","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its controls are clunky and lack the flow that previous main Sonic games are known for (Sonic 06 and Sonic 4: Episode I not withstanding).\n\nAnd despite all that, I can't help but keep playing. Sonic Lost World boasts one of my favorite soundtracks in the series, has some really entertaining writing, and for a Sonic game, is actually pretty challenging.\n\nI don't know what it is about this game, because it's so polarizing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrisSapphire/recommended/329440/","IrisSapphire","Sassy Tanassy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrisSapphire/","222 products in account","If there's one thing to make perfectly clear in opening this up, it's that I'm a geinuine lover of the Sonic franchise. The formula of a Sonic game appeals to many parts of me, the Speedrunner, the platformer, the artist.. and just a lover of fun games. So every time a new Sonic game comes along, I'm a very hopeful girl. I try to be optimistic. But what I am not... is a blind fan. I will not defend a Sonic game based on just a few small merits like many would do.\n\nComing into Lost World, I was excited. It seemed odd- and I understand Sonic Team likes to experiment a lot, but the mere idea of this game running on the famous Hedgehog engine was exciting. Each and every game before it.. Unleashed, Colours, Generations.. they all had superb controls, and fast, precise gameplay. Many of their flaws could only be brought down to how the occasional level design worked, or when the game went into autopilot a biiit too much.\n\nSonic lost World... is nothing like this.\n\nThe controls have been stiffened to a point that they feel more like a Mario title.. but the levels are still built with the flow of a Sonic game, just far more linearly for the most part. This causes immediate awkwardness upon picking up the controller, and the controls of this game don't help one bit.\n\nSonic Team attempted to refresh Sonic's pool of moves a litle bit by adding in new features, whether it  be different kinds of homing attacks and jumps, parkour, or a revamped spindash system.. all of these systems are totally unexplained by the game. And while that was okay in previous games, here, it just end up being an unintuitive mess. Fighting with the controller, getting frustrated.. it's the core component of this game. Overall, it's the main issue this game suffers from.. only once you've figured out and mastered the controls and the stages can you have fun, and that defeats the purpose of the first run through..\n\nThis game feels very generic overall. From Grassland themes, to desert themes, ice themes.. only occasionally mixed up with food, casinos, Underwater tubes. There's more, but it's forgettable. The story is also very standard, but this time, the character interactions are a little more down to earth, which is actually refreshing and I hope this becomes standard.\n\nNow, it's not that the graphical style of this game is bad.. but it also feels like a huge step down from the previous titles.. why? Most likely due to the need to scale down the visuals to achieve 60FPS on console... but while the game feels much more fluid for it, ultimately the visuals lack the appeal of the usual sonic games, and they feel too... mario-esque. Which is to say, that they seem like they should be more dynamic to make up for lack of complexion.. and yet they're not. They're very static and you just move past everythig quickly and forget about what you see..\nApart from the visual element though, the level designs are very straightforward. The difficulty spikes are immense, but only when you find yourself dealing with situations where the controls simply refuse to co-operate.\n\nThis review feels like it's all over the place.. but it says somethin about this game. It's painfully average at best.. It tries to be new and makes you  feel good on the rare occasion, but it's all over the place everywhere else... and is therefore something I would not recommend. Go buy Sonic Generations instead- you won't be disappointed with that one.\n\n","January 26","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So why am i waiting around for everything. elevators, bad guys to move, bad guys to reveal their weakness, screen to move ahead so i can progress, homing attack to lock on. I unfortunatly played this right after a memory visit of sonic adavture two which i love, but going from that to this is like going from pizza to dog ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI feel bad cause this game the hours arnt exactly true on the play time. I was so bored with how slow paced the game is that i actually fell asleep multiple times during gameplay. Also i dont get the obsession with tubes and bounce spring cut scenes to move from one area to another.  Feels so lazily done.\n\nThe only place Im going to give this points is in cutscenese. The story is not the best but the character interactions its at least authentic and helps to develop the characters you know and love. (if you like sonic booms iteration of sonic and co.) Honestly i do like old school SA2 sonic but I also like Sonic boom sonic so i enjoyed the scenes.\n\nLong story short, If you want a good sonic game after Sonic Adventure 2, look for Generations.

The story is also very standard, but this time, the character interactions are a little more down to earth, which is actually refreshing and I hope this becomes standard.\n\nNow, it's not that the graphical style of this game is bad.. but it also feels like a huge step down from the previous titles.. why? Most likely due to the need to scale down the visuals to achieve 60FPS on console... but while the game feels much more fluid for it, ultimately the visuals lack the appeal of the usual sonic games, and they feel too... mario-esque. Which is to say, that they seem like they should be more dynamic to make up for lack of complexion.. and yet they're not. They're very static and you just move past everythig quickly and forget about what you see..\nApart from the visual element though, the level designs are very straightforward. The difficulty spikes are immense, but only when you find yourself dealing with situations where the controls simply refuse to co-operate.\n\nThis review feels like it's all over the place.. but it says somethin about this game. It's painfully average at best.. It tries to be new and makes you  feel good on the rare occasion, but it's all over the place everywhere else... and is therefore something I would not recommend. Go buy Sonic Generations instead- you won't be disappointed with that one.\n\n","January 26","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didnt pay full price and im still regretting over and over again to play one of the latest sonic game installments. Glutton for punishment or just guilt of abandoning a childhood hero. Whatever.\n\nI dont get it. Sonic's thing is to go fast. So why am i waiting around for everything. elevators, bad guys to move, bad guys to reveal their weakness, screen to move ahead so i can progress, homing attack to lock on. I unfortunatly played this right after a memory visit of sonic adavture two which i love, but going from that to this is like going from pizza to dog ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI feel bad cause this game the hours arnt exactly true on the play time. I was so bored with how slow paced the game is that i actually fell asleep multiple times during gameplay. Also i dont get the obsession with tubes and bounce spring cut scenes to move from one area to another.  Feels so lazily done.\n\nThe only place Im going to give this points is in cutscenese. The story is not the best but the character interactions its at least authentic and helps to develop the characters you know and love. (if you like sonic booms iteration of sonic and co.) Honestly i do like old school SA2 sonic but I also like Sonic boom sonic so i enjoyed the scenes.\n\nLong story short, If you want a good sonic game after Sonic Adventure 2, look for Generations.  Lost world,unleashed, Colours. ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, and more hot steamy ♥♥♥♥.","January 27","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game was really enjoyable, I think it would have been one of the best 3D Sonic games if it weren't for the awkward controls. You do get used to them but even near to the end you'll be fumbling around with the half-♥♥♥♥♥ parkour system and awkward jumping momentum. The level design is fantastic as there was quite a variety of gameplay elements as each level felt different and introduced new mechanics, some better than others. I personally found the story to be pretty simple yet well done, the new villains were awesome and had unique personalities as well as having fun boss fights. The OST was most certainly a highlight of the game, one of the best soundtracks i've heard in a while. All in all,  I think it is a great game that is quite underrated but it is let down by the new parkour and movement system (please don't ever use these again).  I'd give it a 7/10.\n\nPlease port Sonic Unleashed and Colours SEGA :)","January 28","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The controls were a bit confusing at first, but I got used to them later on. I'm glad the spin dash was brought back and the boost engine from previous Sonic titles wasn't used or featured in this game. Having to do the homing attack on a bunch of enemies and defeating the last enemy with a kick reminds me of those awesome moments from those CGI Sonic cutscenes in previous titles where Sonic would do that. Too bad it's not as epic in those CGI cutscenes though...\n\nThe story is pretty cheesy let's be honest; it's just Sonic teaming up with Eggman and then new pointless bosses, the Deadly Six, are introduced. Nothing new and original for the story, obviously. The music is really well composed, I gotta admit. Some tracks sound similar or familiar to previous tracks heard in Sonic titles while others are flat out new.\n\nThe update sign on the title screen says it's the 2.0 update. I kind of wished Sega could've update this game to 4.0 like how the one on the Wii U is. The 4.0 update feels much better to me for whatever reason than the downright 2.0 version. I know it's nothing to be bothered by too much unless there are some gimmicks that don't work right for this game.\n\nThe graphics are nice, but the levels are obviously "ripped" off of Super Mario levels or at least similar to it. You get Grass lands, Desert lands, Water lands, Snow lands, Forest lands, Sky lands, Lava lands, and even a Special or Bonus land! As usual, Sonic Team's not having enough ideas to come up with creative and unique worlds for this game. I guess the lands are more of a cheap world than a "lost world," am I right? Eh?\n\n...Besides that, this game is pretty fun! It's not the best nor is it the worst Sonic title ever made. It's really good or even great if anyone even loves this game more than any other Sonic title ever made. Overall I'd give this game an 8/10! :)","January 29","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's surprising how good it is, really, considering SEGA's lack of direction with the series. This is the game that feels most like the old school 2D Sonic games... Not in terms of gameplay, but in terms of tone and feel - that nostalgia factor is here. It has wonderful colours and music with a whole heap of classic badniks from the classic 2D games. The story's "okay" but I'd just kind of prefer they set it up and just let you get on with it, but after nearly every stage there's a short skippable cutscene to try and justify the previous/next level.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it's a fairly big departure from even the more recent games - now there's a button for spindash and run, both are mapped to the triggers on a controller. It's a bit weird to begin with, but once it clicks it actually works quite well. Fans of the recent "super sonic" speed may be disappointed that there's no "boost" button like in generations to make you go blindingly fast, (an element I enjoyed from Generations) but on the plus side there's a lot less falling "out of bounds" as a result. The platforming overall seems slightly off from classic games, it's a bit too "loose" - I don't know how to describe it well, but I've fell to my death a few times due to a badly aimed jump I thought I could make, only to end up not jumping as far as I had meant to.\n\nLike I said though, overall the game's a pleasant surprise for me. I loved Sonic as a kid and this brings me back to that same feeling I had for the series when I was younger. Even moreso than Generations! It feels like it's more for children and fans due to it being a bit lighter-hearted.\n\nPros:\nGameplay is fun once you get used to the buttons.\nControls really well when you're "in the zone"\nClassic sonic feel, visually and audibly\nSonic Colours powers return!\n\nCons:\nStory is kind of lacking (but then, most Sonic games lack a good story)\na few cheap deaths here and there","January 6","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Davidson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/R_C_Davidson/","111 products in account","While not the best Sonic game, it has some interesting ideas it could've stuck with if improved.  I have previously played the 3DS version of the game, and all I can say is that this port is way better than that version.\n\nFirst, this game isn't very demanding at all.  Seeing as this was a port (a good one) of a Wii U game, it's probably no surprise that getting 60 FPS is no issue on most computers from at least five years ago.  That doesn't mean the game is terrible looking.  In fact, it doesn't look that bad, and it's pretty colorful.  I would've liked to see a bit more options, but since the port seems to be properly done, I'm not going to make a big fuss out of it.\n\nThe gameplay is also good.  While there are some flaw here and there, like not properly teaching you the new parkour system, I really have no complaints with the style Sonic Team went with.  I do question why the Wisps are back, because in the story (more on that later), they're not in it.  They're just there just to be there.  In fact, other than a completion record, they're not really that important.  I also love how easy the boss fights are (sarcasm totally intended).  I can name some easy bosses that are harder than these, but the point is that they're so easy that it's embarassing.  Early boss fights are forgivable for this, but the later ones?  One of them is just turning on the lights and do some homing attacks as the guy floats around doing nothing, a fight that probably wouldn't last even a minute.  Gameplay is fine, but they definitely needed to improve it instead of going to.......Sonic Boom.\n\nThe story is a mixed bag.  The parts with Sonic and Eggman working together seem interesting enough, and you might get a few laughs out the story, but the main threat, the Deadly Six, doesn't feel like a threat at all.  Not only are they the easiest bosses I've ever fought in any game, which most of them are likely in my top ten easiests, they're also bland and stereotypical.  For example, Zazz, the rebel type, Zeena, the pretty girl, and Zomom, a big, fat idiot who loves eating food all the time.  About the only thing they had going for them was that they "suck the color out" of Sonic's world, but other than that, they can be pretty forgettable.  Thank goodness nobody plays Sonic games for the story.  That would be like buying a TV to hang a picture.\n\nOne thing I would say that I hate is that the game can some unnecessary gimmicks at you.  While not as bad as the 3DS version (seriously, f*** that game), I feel that most of the game's gimmicks, like the Wisps, don't work well.  In fact, you'll have a boss fight in a giant snowball, which doesn't make sense to me.  If Sonic Team ever does back to this style of gameplay, then they really need to get rid of the gimmicks.\n\nAs a whole, this is actually a good game, and it had a good concept going for it.  Once you get past all the gimmicks in the game, then you will find enjoyment in the game.  Therefore, I recommend this game, though probably on a sale.","January 10","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is of a modern Sonic Game, so don't expect much (lots of plot holes and whatnot).  One thing I love about the port aspect is that they actually have a menu INSIDE the game unlike some ports that have an external configuration tool (I'm looking at you Sonic Generations).  Speaking of Sonic Generations, the architecture of the game is very similar, so expect some cool mods coming your way.\n\nHowever, talking about the game itself rather than it's architecture, I wouldn't pay full price for this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReMixx/recommended/329440/","ReMixx","ReMixx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReMixx/","291 products in account","TL;DR: I would not recommend this game after beating it and getting all achievements. It's a hodgepodge of disparate levels, gameplay, and story elements lazily/hastily/illogically glued together. It will cause more frustration than fun. Skip.\n\n\nI found this game to be more frustrating than fun with fighting the camera and dumb level design/gimmicks being the biggest pain points.\n\nYou can't control the camera at all. This makes the 3D platforming parts much more painful than it needs to be. It's also incredibly painful on very small spheres worlds where you would want to rotate the camera to see what's coming from the southern direction. Some 2D parts will randomly zoom out so far that I had to lean into my monitor to make critical platforming jumps.\n\nSome portions of levels make Sonic move forward without your input - they force you to move (for no good reason). This just sucks. If you are trying to get a red star ring but happen to get too close to the invisible trigger, you're stuck moving onto the next part of the level and can't go back. The desert level with the random sand tornado chasing you for no rhyme or reason is particularly annoying because you can't go faster than the tornado moves. The game prevents you from advancing the side scrolling faster than the tornado even if you're much faster than it. There's no logical reason for this, let me move at my own speed if I'm faster than this dumb ♥♥♥♥ - which is, you know, Sonic's thing, moving fast.\n\nTangential to the complaint of not being able to fully control my own character, they add in the stupid ice levels where you're sliding all over the place. I'm already triggered with character control and then they add this garbage of sliding everywhere.\n\nThe physics momentum doesn't make sense. Sometimes you can jump and move around quick in air, other times you jump and you can't move around very much in air. I've falled down a lot of pits because the lack of consistency in movement speed in jumps.\n\nThe levels had no continuity between them. One level you're running across the desert being chased by a random sand tornado and the next you're running through a weird beehive before going back to the desert again. There's no logical transitions between levels.\n\nI more than once lost the location of Sonic visually from being distracted by the animated background scenery.\n\nI also did not care for the Zeti characters. The stereotypes were boring and annoying. It was way too cheesy and unoriginal. Did they really need to talk during non-boss levels? I yelled at them to shut up more than once while being frustrated from the previously mentioned crap. Just because there's a female Zeti, doesn't mean that Sonic would have interest in her. Maybe the characters, story, and dialog were aimed at children rather than adults who grew up with Sonic on the Genesis.\n\nThe wisps didn't make much sense. They were just kind of thrown in as an afterthought. I never played Sonic Colors (not on PC) so I didn't know how to correctly use all the color powers either until reading online. Things like the asteroid can jump higher as you collect more terrain or the green hover thing can travel along ring lines is never explained in-game. I would rather have had the traditional powerups (lightning, bubble, invicibility, speed, rings, etc) in levels than the wisps.\n\nSpeaking of the traditional powerups, they're part of a reward system for doing the achievements and then added to your limited inventory. I didn't do them until after I beat the game and had Super Sonic which made all the powerups obsolete. I never once used lightning, bubble, invicibility, speed, or ring powerups. Just another afterthought. Oh wait, I used the ring powerup once during the final boss fight to get the rings needed to turn into Super Sonic for the beat it without taking damage achievement, except for no logical reason it turns out that you can't go Super Sonic on that level. You can't go Super Sonic on any of the 3D levels that force you to move apparently (bee hive level is another example, except during the boss fight). I never used the radar looking thing either, not sure what that was for ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\nThe inventory system itself was really annoying. Some of the powerups will randomly spawn in the hub world and if you happen to walk over them, you have to pick them up. There's no way to walk away from them. So if you have a full inventory and accidentally walk over one, then you have to discard something - since you can't use powerups in the hub world, not even extra life ones(???).\n\nThe controls/abilities in general are never explained in-game. I didn't know I could run along walls until I saw it in a video getting a red star ring. Other controls/abilities learned from watching youtube videos - can jump sideways while climing up walls, can slide down walls by holding crouch (there's a crouch button?), can hold spin dash after spin dashing to continue spin dashing indefinitely, you can kick enemies instead of the homing attack (it's the only way to beat certain enemies, thanks for not explaining that), and right trigger makes you run faster and run along walls.\n\nThere's also some weird question mark thing in the lower left corner of the screen that will randomly pop up. I never figured out what that was. Looks like the chaos emeralds, but it makes no sense.\n\nThe achievements were dumb - you could only get a maximum of 3 at any time and you had to get them in the order specified by the game. They're all grindy and pointless. Just a dumb tactic to make you play longer imo.\n\nI don't understand the story connection between the red star rings and the chaos emeralds.\n\nThe story was awful. You'd think after 20+ years that Sonic would listen to Tails. And wtf is Knuckles doing? Stop being a little ♥♥♥♥♥ Knuckles and help.","April 16","false","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the story is weak and poorly written, there's occasional difficulty spikes, and the color powers have no purpose of being in the game.\n\n7.8 autists out of 10\n\nP.S. If the game runs below 60fps, the game will run slow for some odd reason. Maybe because the Wii U version is used to obtaining a near perfect 60fps lock. There are ways to decrease the visual quality, but these are very few. The graphical options menu only have resolution, fullscreen, DOF (Depth of Field), Grass, and Shadows. There's no anti-aliasing options. But the game still tends to be pretty otherwise. I ran this at 720p with everything on for my mid-range rig and it managed to run smoothly. I suggest having a good PC to run this game.","February 8","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have never reached the heights of 3D Mario games, even though they have tried - many times - to revitalize the excitement of the original Sonic Adventure. The original SA was a technical marvel back in the day, and also a pretty good game. But it also had terrible story, horrible side characters, and a lousy overworld. Many Sonic games have come and gone, ranging from terrible to pretty good. The newest game is a typical example of 3D Sonic games, in many ways: quite awesome at parts, and quite terrible at others.\n\nSonic Lost World, inexplicably, chooses to heavily invest in story, which has never been a strong suit for the series. But this shouldn't surprise us. Sega has always made bad decisions regarding Sonic. After realizing you can skip the cut scenes, you can start to enjoy the actual game. The visual aspects of the game - including the world design of the different areas of the game - are perhaps its best parts. (I said world design, not level design, quite consciously.) The game is pretty long, and luckily it doesn't have unskippable adventure portions or sections with Big The Cat, or Amy.\n\nThe game is "pure" Sonic. The Mario Galaxy-inspired gameplay feels derivative and never quite reaches the heights of its source of inspiration. There are still too many sudden deaths and camera angle frustrations. But once you get the hang of the controls, there is incredible fun to be had with SOME of the levels. The levels are colourful and speedy, and they range from 2.5D to 3D sections, just like Sonic Generations. Unfortunately the level design is a mixed bag. There are some truly wonderful levels, but there are also more than a few totally unfair, and frankly pointless, levels. Luckily, if you can't get past a particular checkpoint, you can eventually skip the part, although only after dying enough times (5 or so). This is a good design choice. Without the ability to skip some of the most unfair sections, it is doubtful I would have ever seen the end of the game. But I'm glad I played through to the end, since there are some good boss fights and awesome sequences to be experienced. The middle part of the game drags on and increases the frustration of the player, but the overall content of the game is positive. In addition to unfair and frustration levels, which obviously have no right to exist, there are some truly challenging (in a good way) levels, that utilize the game mechanics to wonderful effect.\n\nI doubt we'll ever get a flawless masterpiece of a Sonic 3D game. This game is not even close. But it plays differently enough from the other Sonic games (because it mimicks Mario Galaxy pretty well) that it is an interesting experience.\n\nI would recommend to game, at a discount price, for anybody who has two characteristics: 1) They are willing to excuse a lot of bad design choices. 2) They appreciate fast and fun 3D platforming. This game is a flawed, but quite a fun, platformer, which doesn't do anything to make the 3D Sonic games advance to A class. They are still not worthy of being called Mario rivals. But they are damn fun games.\n\nLike an annoying friend with a personality disorder that can still, sometimes, crack a good joke or two.\n\nRating: 7/10","May 28","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
