Honestly, the fighting was somewhat enjoyable. Needed a change to what I've been playing recently. The story however was not that good, but considering it's a low budget game that is understandable.\n\nPros:\n-Decent game to kill time with\n-Good environmental sounds\n-Decent graphics\n\nCons:\n-Bland story\n-Long, boring dialogs (kinda relates back to bland story)\n-Unchangable key mappings\n-Difficult to navigate through game\n\nNow my cons might seem like they would outweigh the pros, and so you may be wondering why I recomment this game. My reasoning for recommending it is that it was worth what I paid for, enough said.\n\nIf you  guys want to check out the game play for this video, or want to see why my pros and cons are as they are feel free to check out my linked video.\n\nThanks for reading my review, and I hope this gave you information on whether or not you would enjoy this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIMS_MrASMU","February 27, 2015","true","1.9"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","42","52","5","1"

I'll describe this story-driven game as a kinda modern Alice in Wonderland (except you're a guy and weirder). You find yourself in an alternate world with bizarre creatures, people and situations and basically have to find your way through it. Everything about it grabs your intrigue - the locations from underground villages complete with evil looking church and 'starblocks' coffee to vampire-haunted towns, the people you'll meet from a blue-skinned magic girl (love interest??) to a gate-guard who just wants new shoes, and enemies you'll have to fight from cute but irritating garden gnomes (I just loved bashing those :D ) to carnivorous tree-squirrels. I found myself just wanted to keep going if only to see what I'll encounter next.\n\nI have a complaint though: the whole game is pretty much a one-track *very* story-driven one. No open world rpg, exploring away from the set part gets you nothing and no secrets as far as i could tell. Even your weapons are upgraded at set points. For me this factor is a little disappointing because I'm the sort who likes to go explore the forest you're specifically told not to, jump off cliffs to see if i can survive, kiss the queen, hack the village store-keeper etc, basically everything *except* the quest. Only when I'm satisfied I've explored everything else do i finally get back to the story. This game offers none of that.\n\nStill, like i mentioned above, the intrigue just gets to you and i just kept playing till the end (which comes a bit sooner than expected but that's why this game is "Book 1"). So if you want a little distraction for a bit, go ahead and get it, you'll have a few laughs as well.","April 4, 2015","true","6.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Plot -- Story Driven. Story takes you by surprise but has its cliches\nCliches are often incoporated a humoristic tone\nMemorable\nStable and Slick Performance\nDoing some tourism around is rewarding as the world is intriguing and not too badly crafted\n\nCons :\nEpisodic\nExploration limited by invisble walls\nMechanics are very simple but do involve 3 status bars, a basic inventory and dialoge options... so if this is complex enough for you its not a con :P\n\nConclusion : At the time of writing I only had a first impression in but I wanted to write a review to share my enthusiasm and remember to finish this on my next gaming session. I like what the dev did with this, its no technological marvel but it feels like it was made with love and care\n\n","October 5, 2015","true","1.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It's charming, it's actually pretty humorous, and it has the potential to become ever greater as the rest of the games in this series are released (DEVS, IF YOU'RE READING THIS, PLEASE WORK HARD ON THE NEXT CHAPTER).\n\nThe combat is, at times, fairly straight-forward: attack your enemy until their health drops to zero, and block when you run out of energy to attack. You can use magic, but you only learn a singel spell, and it's close to the end of the game, but it's a fairly useful spell.\n\nThe story is actually very interesting. Anything with unusual but colorful lore is something I can get into. The fact that the story, the characters, and the locations remind of the Abarat books makes this game so much more amazing to me.\n\nI did have a few glitches, but they were fairly tiny. One occured near the final battle of the game, where I got stuck on a large physics object. Another occurs if you try to talk to the Starblocks girl behind the counter. With that one, you hilariously float up over the counter, and the camera goes all sorts of nuts, but it's nothing major.\n\nBut, honestly, this is a great game! If you've got a few hours to burn through, enjoy subtle/obvious references, and just flat out love Indie games, then I can happily say that your money would be well-spent by purchasing this game.","April 15, 2015","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
