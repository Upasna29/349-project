"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/58550/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","It has been a long time since I had last played a game like this. The type of game you'd label "A Shameless Cash in."\n\nWith the fourth season of Game of Thrones hitting the air, you might feel inspired to do your own bit of dynastic warfare. I am here to stop you. Whatever you do; you don't want to spend a penny on this pile of refuse. Game of Thrones Genesis is a broken and convoluted mess. It has some nice ideas, but pretty much everything stop it from working as it should.\n\nGame of Thrones Genesis is a Real Time Strategy game, but it has a twist. Instead of building units and testing your tactics against your opponents you are now in the business of building alliances and brokering treaties between the many colourful houses of Westeros. The goal is out out-prestiege your opponent. You achieve this by earning money, maintaining alliances with towns and castles, eliminating prominent enemy units, uncovering your enemies' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sons, and upholding the faith. To accomplish this you employ the services of assassins, envoys, rouges, spies and even your own daughters to break or make allegiences. If you think that this sounds pretty cool then you are sadly mistaken. The system is a micromanagement nightmare. It is impossible to see what you need to do, because each unit is highly specialised. Even your random highwayman can't just be told to kill the enemy envoy. You need another unit for that. To make matters worse, everything is tiny. Even my HD screen is too small to even give me a remote chance to properly click on the one unit I need.\n\nWhen all else fails you can always resort to war. War is an utter joke. Declaring war will deduct points from your prestige, so you need to trick your enemy into declaring war on you. What AI that cannot even walk from end of the map to the other without burrowing through a mountain is going to take your bait? War cannot be waged with your regular security units. Oh no, you need armies; special units that need food to function. Food is a resource that is advertised in the game as much as Sarin gas is advertised as a nice party trick on children's tv programming. You need to put peasants to work the field. However, both the peasants and the fields are hidden in the horrible interface and the unsightly map textures respectively. The army units then are supposed to work with a rock-paper-scissors system, but it doesn't. You're lucky if your army even goes to where you ask it to go.\n\nJust when you thought you had seen it all the crapshoot AI comes in. The campaign is joke. It tells the origin story of Westeros and the Iron Throne. You begin as the Martells and shortly after you play as the Targaryans to subjugate the entire continent. Only to lose it the inevitable alliance of Stark, Lannister and Baratheon in the endgame, followed by a little bit of 'What if' up at the wall. The problem is the crapshoot AI. The moment you start the stage the AI makes it move and beats you. The only way to win is by trial and error. Find out what the AI does, counter it in the first minute, and move from there. The AI will just keep on trying to do what it was going to do, but will fail forever. It is both lame and boring. What's the point of playing a Game of Thrones if there isn't even a real game to play.\n\nDon't buy this game. Avoid it like the plague. Put it in chains, drag it up to the wall, send it north, dump a couldron of gold on it, bury it in soft peat and finally recycle it as firelighters to burn the box it came in.","April 9, 2014","false","10.0"," 261 of 279 people (94%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","94","261","279","38","3"

It was more like a fast paced board game than the sort of resource management and strategy game I thought it would be. I can't fault it for not being like the Total War games, which I was thinking it was, but I can fault it for not being particularly fun. As far as I can see from playing the tutorial and the first level, you basically run around with envoys and spies trying to keep alliances with towns while your opponents ruin your alliances and make their own. It can get a little hectic keeping up with all of that going on, while also trying to get some food or money together to make an army.\n\nYou don't build structures in this game, they already exist on the map. What you do is build units, which will carry out certain tasks like assassinations and spying. The goal is to build alliances with nearby towns and castles to keep yourself stronger and richer than your enemies. You do this to collect prestige points, which determine the winner of the map. The combat in this game is not at all exciting, since your armies will consist of around 8 little guys that will hack at the other side's armies until one team is dead. You don't really want to declare war too often anyway, since it will cost you prestige points. So you want to convince the other guy to declare war, and then spend some time chasing around his units to destroy them, all while chasing his envoys with yours so that you can keep them from stealing your alliances.\n\nThe graphics are decent but not particularly impressive. The music is standard fantasy fare. Not memorable, but not bad either.\n\nIt's just not as impressives as I was hoping for, and I think I only gave it the time I did because of the GoT license. It does go back a ways to give you a taste of some of the origins of the great houses of Westeros, but I felt like the license was not important to the gameplay. It was like playing a licensed version of Monopoly, wherein the lore of GoT only ran skin deep. Overall I could not recommend this title.\n\nGrade: D","June 16, 2014","false","0.9"," 111 of 136 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","111","136","0","0"

It has some interesting ideas about how to do video game diplomacy and intrigue, but those ideas are undeveloped, and make the interaction between the houses of Westeros feel like the mere shuffling around of RTS game pieces. It does have an admirable commitment to the series lore, but to get to the lore, you have to play through a dreary campaign which includes frustrating escort missions. You can control a Targaryen dragon, and it feels pretty powerful, but the actual mechanics of doing so are excessively "gamey" (your dragon has a recharge time, making it less a creature of legend and more of an occasional special ability).\n\nThe presentation of the game is subpar, with a lot of tiny details that are just "off" enough to pull me out of the experience. And the RTS mechanics are a bit undercooked - there's not a lot of unit diversity (or distinctiveness to the units that exist) and the tech tree, such as it is, is mediocre. The most interesting part of the game is the specialized intrigue and diplomatic units, and even then, I find the challenge of not knowing which alliances are real or which units are loyal to be more of a test of mental endurance than a genuine political-style puzzle.\n\nThe game is not entirely without merit, but I would not recommend buying it without first seriously lowering your expectations.","June 22, 2014","false","21.3"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","62","69","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/58550/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","A Game of Thrones - Genesis is a "boardgame" style strategy game with real-time-strategy elements. It's a simple concept: you begin with a "home base" and slowly expand your empire. But that is where simplicity ends: expanding your empire is accomplished principally by winning the loyalty of neighboring towns and castles with diplomatic envoys. The more towns that are loyal to you, the more income you have, and income will help you produce more units.\n\nThen, you will need to create some spy rings in enemy cities, subdue spies in your own cities, assassinate nobles, and other nefarious acts in order to succeed. You can even have the enemy create and command units that he thinks are working for him, but are actually working for you. It is the most layered, deep espionage system I have ever seen in a game (think Civ4 times 15). That being said, I also feel that the game is too deep for an RTS, playing strategically requires a bit of deep thought and I felt intimidated about having to think faster than my opponent, rather than being able to take my time and press "end turn" like in Civilization or Master of Orion.\n\nHere is most of the game's complexity in a nutshell: envoys create alliances, spies ruin alliances, nobles create blood alliances, assassins ruin blood alliances, guards block towns from assassins, spies and assassins working together can circumvent guards. Spies can reveal hidden enemy units, because about 90% of the units in the game are visible only to the player who controls them. They are on a generous "stealth timer" when in enemy territory.\n\n\nThe Good\n\n* Great interface, smooth controls.\n\n* A game so deep that it could never be released on anything but PC.\n\n* The game is very well suited for multiplayer matches with a friend.\n\n* It is kind of fun to learn, but I assume you cannot truly appreciate it until you have mastered the basics (which I was never able to do.)\n\n* Lots of achievements to unlock.\n\n* High skill ceiling.\n\nThe Bad\n\n* Long load times\n\n* Expensive pricetag, the game would be a fair buy at $10, but not $20.\n\n* Very little connection to the A Game of Thrones series that we know and love, except for the Lannisters are all jerks and killed me in my first match.\n\n* The game might be too complex for many people. I don't want you to confuse "complex" with "strategic." There are times when things are needlessly complex.\n\n* Some small problems with the tutorial. It will direct you to "look at the map in the lower right corner," when the map is actually in the lower left. Also, the "back" button does absolutely nothing in the tutorial's dialogue boxes.\n\n* High-learning curve.\n\n* The game is not friendly to colorblind players. The fog of war is just a b&w version of the map, but it's very difficult to differentiate between the colored (visible) parts of the map and the b&w (fog of war) parts of the map, especially in snowy areas. If you are colorblind, you will go mad if you try to play as the Starks.\n\n* The battle animations are, well, terrible - but I'd rather have bad animations than bugs. Additionally, although war is a large aspect of the game, 90% of the game is the espionage that happens before the war.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n* Uses TAGES DRM. (5 machine installation limit).\n\nThe Verdict\n\nIf you are looking for an ultra-deep strategy game, pick this up. If you are new to 4X games, I would suggest waiting for it to go on sale for >49%, as the game is really hard to appreciate if you aren't already intimately familiar with its genre.\n\n\nI'd be happy to answer any other questions that you may have, just message me.","December 15, 2013","true","1.6"," 63 of 78 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","63","78","4","0"

And all of that with one single purpose: making and keeping as many alliances as possible while trying to destroy as many as possible alliances of your enemies while producing enough food and gold to bring armies to the table.\n\nAnd for a military based game battles are very simple: just send as many soldiers as you can, no others plan needed.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are just too complicated to be a game that worths paying for it.","August 5, 2014","false","124.2"," 52 of 61 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","52","61","3","6"

It has gone down in history as one of my most regretted gaming purchases. Cyanide's A Game of Thrones - Genesis is a messily designed, technically janky game that I wouldn't recommend to any besides the die-hard fan, who isn't reading this review anyway.\n\nThe game is essentially a virtual board game, in which you send one of a few kinds of units around a map in order to maintain control of them. It's largely tedious and frustrating. You can do this in a story campaign, which gives you small maps and half-thematic objectives. I didn't make it far into this story and wouldn't recommend you do so. Much more tolerable if not actually enjoyable is the multiplayer mode, in which you select a larger portion of Westeros to fight over with computer or human opponents. Though I very much doubt you will find human opponents online at this point. The gameplay in the multiplayer mode is slightly more interesting, with a few more kinds of units and actions you can take.\n\nTo be frank, Genesis seems like a game designed with bullet points in mind. Marketing materials might say you can marry off your noble daughter to an enemy to cement an uneasy alliance, or send an agent to infiltrate the enemy AS an enemy agent, and then turn him when the enemy thinks he's hurting you with that double agent. Both of these are true, but these mechanics are very shallow and there are only a few of them.\n\nIn the end Genesis will likely leave you wanting, as a fan of Martin's world. I might recommend instead the actual board game from Fantasy Flight Games, or the Crusader Kings 2 conversion mod. Sadly, an amateur game modification is vastly superior and better supported than this official game.","December 2, 2013","false","6.0"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","46","58","2","0"

This can then be undone by removing the bride with an assassin.\nThe game does feel a bit slow at time and does not feel like a classic RTS, so if you are in to games such as Warhammer etc. I would say miss this one out.\nBut if you are open minded and the game is going for a reasonable price (I'd say below 15/ 10 dollars) I would recommend it, there is also a campaign that can be fairly challenging at times and a walk in the park at others but does provide a lot of gameplay (somewhere between 10-20 hours i would estimate, but that's just a guess).","December 5, 2013","true","10.4"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","34","46","0","0"

Still, depsite the simplistic and somewhat sophmoric gameplay, the game shines with great lore and setting, and should reward loyal fans of the Books and Show.\nMake sure you get this on sale, it is certainly not worth a full retail price, offering low replay and a 12 hour or so campaign.

Its not as boring as it sounds, there is strategy to this use of spies to gather intel and uncover secret agreements, envoys to ally yourself with towns and rogues to make towns rebel against the enemy. This is not like Total war the ideas of morale and combat strategy play no part in this games, you use pikeman to counter horseman, archers to counter men-at-arms. Like Command & Conquer you have set missions, where resources and men arent passed onto the next mission which can be frustrating. The missions state with scarce resources and few troops and each mission is usually a challenge until you reach a tipping point where you have the resources to produce a surplus of troops and other units and victory is almost assured. Id recommend this game to anyone who'd like to see how the history of Game of Thrones, Westeros came to be and the conflicts between houses prior to the series, it offers a lot of detail but unlike most games where you are constantly fed information of the enviorment and current events you struggle to keep up with it. GoT Genesis offers the detail in game and in the form of an encyclopedia which offers indept information into game mechanic, unit information, House information etc, This game of good for those who are fans of the GoT books and series, and for those who enjoy Command & Conquer and those who like strategy games. 90/100\n\nOnly thing is the missions dont only the mission focus around the Targeryn history and the are not a lot of missions, but AI custom missions seem good.","December 28, 2014","true","24.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

This was the case for the majority of the first chapter, when you're playing as the initial kingdom in the desert. And that's about a good 3 or 4 hours into playing, if you're slow player like my self ;D.\n\nI did continue playing into the second chapter, and it did feel like it was picking up with giving you the freedom to actually play. Rather than heavily suggesting what your next move should be.\n\nI imagine that this game would be more fun and intriguing to play in a multilayer session with friends, or even against random people.\n\nThe game is heavily focused around it being a political and backstabbing game, rather than a game based on declaring war on the other kingdoms. So in that respect, it does utilise that well with all the non-combat units it offers and the different buildings on each section of the map. If you don't actually want to go down the political route and such, you can quite effectively go down the war path to win the game. You just need to make sure you have enough influence across the kingdom to fund your army.\n\nYou'll just need to constantly watch over your spies, rogues, envoys and buildings etc. If not, you can easily be deceived by the A.I. and be quite gimped in your influence and resource gain. You'll also loose units by assassination attempts.\n\nThe concept is good, it just felt like it was not properly executed with this style of game. It would of performed better if it was like a turn based 4X game, similar to the Civilization series.\n\nI will probably come back to this game one day and give it another bash, once I've read the books or seen the t.v. series. Come into it with a new perspective. But it's defiantly a game which isn't for every one, so be warned when purchasing.\n\nBut if you're committed to playing a game which focuses on tactics other than declaring war and fighting it out, then go for it! It isn't all that bad.\n\nIn conclusion:\nA unique and interesting concept, but not executed well enough to work effectively.\nVery hand holding heavy to start with, takes a few hours before it feels like you can play freely.\nVery overwhelming with the need to micro manage each individual unit and building. Too much can go on at once.\nWould of been better off as a turn based 4X game.\nTakes a while to fully grasp on how to effectively play, without the A.I. wiping you out.\nGames can take a good while to finish, which is good if you like your RTS games to last.\nPick it up in a sale if you want to try it out, it will keep you entertained for a little while at least.\n5 / 10, tried to ride the Game of Thrones hype train and got stuck in the homeless cart as a result.","August 28, 2014","true","5.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

If you're a fan of the SOIAF series and universe, its worth a try - I wouldn't want to pay more than 15$ for it to be fair; but its not /awful/. Slow, kind of tedious and lacking the more massive army/Age of Empires level of military combat and absolutely no town/castle building - it still proves to be enjoyable for something slow-paced and involved. You're always having to keep on the lookout for people trying to cut down your alliances and expanding your own alliances is a must to win truthfully - the combat is a bit clunky and simplified and it really is a pain having to worry about holding alliances with every town instead of just marching a massive army on them - but the game isn't /terrible/.","June 30, 2014","true","4.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It does have it's moments, and if anything, revolutionises the strategy genre, as it adds aspects which you would not consider. This game tries to bring realism into this seemingly boring genre by adding a new form of controlling a town with the spokesmen and through marriage, and a new threat, such as traitors among you're soldiers. I think the biggest let down though, is the fact that the system of controlling neighbouring villages to be to complicated, aswell as the combat system. Maps, I feel should have been larger, and a bit more dangerous, but other wise, it is a decent game...LARGELY better than the one based on the TV show, what a disaster.","February 18, 2014","true","0.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

When this game launched, I was so excited and thought it would be a fantastic game.\n\nSadly, it was not.\n\nThe micromanaging in this game is seriously absurd if you are used to playing ANY other strategy game.\n\nYou do not engage in "battles" per se. From the screenshots it really looks like you can have units engage in battle like in the Total War series. That does not happen here. Instead, you have very specific units scurrying around the map. Send envoy here; send assassin there.\n\nThe feedback and interface in-game is horrendous, it is very difficult to keep track of things.\n\nHonestly, avoid this game, even if you are THE MOST die-hard fan of GRRM's work.\n\nIf you want a FANTASTIC, lore-friendly (and supplementary) game, look at: The RPG version http://store.steampowered.com/app/208730/\n\nThat one has actual meat you can sink your fan-driven teeth into.\n\nThis one, sadly, is a great disappointment and I sincerely hope no one else wastes their money on this.","July 7, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is repetitive and uninspired. The thing that makes it very disappointing is that it had some serious potential.

I tried to give it a chance... I really did.\n\nThe absolutely, without a doubt, most disappointing part about this game is the complete lack of support by the developer and publisher. The game was released and made money based on the IP and immediately abandoned. Good luck getting an answer on a game breaking bug. They even removed it from their site.

Poświęć jej więcej niż godzinę a nie będziesz żałować. Nie jest to dzieło sztuki, ale kiedy zrozumiesz założenia gry, to zaczynasz czerpać z niej radość. Gra polega na kontrolowaniu mapy, w czym nieustannie musisz konkurować z przciwnikiem. Działania są jawne (jak dyplomacja, wojsko) oraz niejawne (to czego przeciwnik nie widzi: tajne umowy, szpiedzy, skrytobójcy, zdrajcy, przekupstwo). Warstwa militarna jest bardziej uproszczona niż w klasycznych RTS-ach aby zmusić gracza do podjęcia gry bardziej wyrafinowanej, co fajnie wpasowuje się w klimat sagi. Na wyższych poziomach trudności gra jest naprawdę wymagająca i potrzeba sporej podzielności uwagi. IMO warto dać jej szansę.\n\nI realy enjoyed this game, mostly becouse It was much different than any other RTS I'd ever played. It focus on operating behind enemy lines, in the shadows. You must take control over the map, and to do so, You have to use plenty of units as spy, hitman, nobles, guards and so on. It's more like conspiracy than military game, and becouse of that it gets harder and much more satysfiying. I felt like in real Westeros. I recomend this game to everyone that wants something new, is open to new style of playing RTS, and mostly Game of Throne fans.","February 16","true","13.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

RTS fans who have other RTS fan friends who are also interested in getting this, should go ahead. Everyone else should consider it carefully before getting this game.\nLenght: A week at least.\n\nThis game is actually a very good RTS game. I enjoyed it a lot, but the campaign is seriously a drab. Through out the entire campaign, I felt like I was unnecessarily being forced to do things that didn't feel like they were intended to be part of the original gameplay. Further more, the campaign grooms the player to focus on things that aren't important when fully playing the game.\n\nASOIAF fans can get some small lore lessons from this games, and as an RTS game, I think it was excellent, but no one plays it, and lacking a good campaign, I felt it was a failure.\n\nIf you have friends to play with, this game could quickly get pretty awesome. I haven't seen an RTS game this decent since Battle for Middle earth, which it is also very comparable with.\n\nThis game also offers quite a bit of diplomacy and trade (or at least attempts to include this) which is nice.

I'm not a huge RTS fan in the first place, so this isn't an objectively fair review, but compared to others of the genre it has some glaring weaknesses.  1) It's difficult to keep track of your units because of the strange navigation.  2) The angled perspectives make it difficult to click on an intended target; I often found myself clicking something unintended with unpleasant consequences.  3) Most importantly this had no GoT feel to it at all with the exception of some name-dropping.  I realize character building isn't an essential part of an RTS but if you are going to build a game based on one of the greatest TV series of all time, I feel like some effort should be put towards that.  4) Lastly, the graphics and sound are poor.  Also not RTS staples, but please game...give me something to like.  2/10","June 8, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you may feel the same way.\n\nWhilst all the diplomacy pieces are there, the interface for doing things is quite painful. Just a wheel around the characters with the actions on a click would have been fine. Instead the game decides on using old RTS style menus and build screens. Stylistically, if it were layed out like a board game it may feel better too.\n\nFor RTS fans, this will feel horrible. You don't want diplomacy, you want war.. However this game is about getting a foot hold over every square inch using spies, envoys, assassins, peasants and then underhanded versions of all that.. And of course marrying off your children... In order to hold up a thin impression of peace and compassion for the other players in the game.  There is a blue bar at the top of the screen, the peace bar,  when it goes completely red you are at war with the other factions, so hopefully your political moves pay off and you have sufficient food and gold to create armies to put down your foes.\n\nThe game really resides more in the "Ticket to Ride" boardgame pile. If you have bought this and have yet to play it... Think of it as a real time board game, with a really bad interface, and you might get something out of it.\n\nFor me.. I'm going to weep a little and bury it, because it touches on everything to make a satisfying experience, but fails to pull it all together.","June 24, 2014","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was not a problem so much when there was just on unit in the area, but if eg. at your town you have more than one unit, it is extremely hard to manage to click on the one you want.  The idea of the game was ok, but the controls take all the joy of playing it.","April 10, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went back and forth with Steam and the developers for days on end trying to get them game working. None of the solutions they provided worked and both spent more time blaming the other than actually providing help.\n\nMonths later when I finally did get it working I find it has some rather debilitating bugs that are pretty explocatable. Some of which include being completely unable to finish the tutorial due to  enemy spies getting stuck in areas you absolutely have to have your spies in order to finish the narrow minded quests. (Two enemy spies can't be near each other or the more recent one will run away and ignore all orders until it gets home) This sort of bug ends up making the game unplayable because there is no natural way to skip the tutorial and get to the real campaigns.\n\nThe skirmish mode proves to be even worse since in order to win the game you have to please people. Which means this is a war game based on being gentle with people's feelings rather than, you know, warring.  Which means you can be waging war and going so with extreme skill and having a very one sided winning streak in all the battles. Yet still lose because you hurt to many feelings.\n\nI understand a large portion of what made up the show was the politics and underhanded negotiations. But it was handled in the poorest way possible. The only way this game could have been made worse is if they took away the ability to pick what house you play as in the craptastic skirmish mode. Then again  I did not see any difference between the houses so in the end it's only a colored flag with no meaningful value.","April 12, 2014","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
