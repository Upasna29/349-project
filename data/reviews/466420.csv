So what do we have:\n\n+5 different characters with different abilities and playstyles, each playthrough takes a lot of time so this game is a great timewaster.\n+Multiplayer for two - you can play x2 from the same PC - pretty fun\n+Leveling, farming, crafting - all those rpg elements included.\n+Different bosses (and hard mobs) - different enemies requires different approach to beat them, pretty fun to play, and the game doesnt punish you much for dying a lot, thats good.\n+Visuals - the looks like Ragnarok Online about ninjas, pals and zombies - i've spent years playing RO and i like that style, but to each his own ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n+Music - music tracks are nice but has one issue - they has diffent music styles, but they changes completely random not like when you are battling one music and when in village another. That could be confusing\n+Steam achievements are pretty straight forward :)\n+Steam cards\n-A lot of invisible walls - you will face plenty of invisible walls here and there it could kind of hard to figure out where to run, specially if you are chased :)\n-Minor bugs here and there, but they getting fixed every day (this is early release review)\n\nTl;dr - this game is very fun isometric action RPG, definitely value for money.","June 3","true","5.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","2"

If you like Dark Souls, this is very similar in term of combat","May 27","true","10.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

Kind of an open world. Seems like theres lots of quests and I die a lot ;)\nIm usually not too much into these kind of games but its pretty fun and I like the artwork.\nThe control seems a little clunky for me, might be better with a controller but its bearable\nwith keyboard and mouse. Has trading cards and achevements too which is a plus.\n","May 11","true","2.4"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","2"

Aside from that the controls and basic combat are serviceable, but slightly flawed and honestly could use a little polish.. which to be honest I think is noticeable in just about every aspect of the game. It’s as if the Developers stopped JUST SHY of creating something truly epic and it’s a bit of a shame. The resource gathering, questing, and market systems are pretty run of the mill for games of this type but aren’t badly done. Quests can be received from multiple characters, each with their own little personality which shows that there WAS thought put into this game and it’s NOT just some kind of asset flip."\n\nThis game is decent, but is on the cusp of being something great. If the Devs polish it just a bit more then there is every potential for a top quality game here. As is, I can still recommend the game at it\'s current price point, but only just.\n\nSee my full Critique here:\nhttps://youtu.be/fUjhyFjyrGM","May 31","true","4.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Excellent core. Just needs polishing, details, UI enhancements and details. Possibly some more classes... like a "Tinkerer" that uses pistols or cannons and traps, or a "Rogue". The only down side for me is the game stutters. Almost to the point of being unplayable sometimes but I push trough it because I'm addicted.","May 17","true","5.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","4"

I felt before the first minotaur and got really upset by how strong the damn thing was. However, when I really tried to defeat him at the very early level, it felt awesome. I like how the game handles the monsters which are very challenging. Each of them was given a unique combat style. I haven't encountered them all but looking forward to more challenges. One piece of advice, playing with a keyboard is terrible. A controller feels much smoother.\n\nOne thing that I hate about this game is the map is a bit too big. Sometimes it can feel empty, but it's still a decent game with a solid core.","May 28","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The music is ok but gets annoying. Building is very simplistic. Boy you need to grind a lot of wood and coin which is slow to get.\n\nCombat is ok, you can only attack left and right, but once you get used to it it's ok. Monster movement is a little odd though.\n\nNeeds a lot of work to really be more than a "I'm bored so I will try it once or twice then never play again" sort of game.","May 27","false","2.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"
