Game hasn't really improved in a year.  To my disapointment, it's to risky to pay 18 dollars.\n\nLong version:\n\nI purchased this game the first day of release, I wanted the final product to be a decent indie game.   Sure it would have flaws but it would be enjoyable at least.  When I first booted up the game boy was in for a surprise... not for how far along the team was in developing this game, instead for how little and broken everything was; flying was awful, the camera was confusing to use, there was little to do, and everything about the visuals was just ugly.  At first I figure; this game is in early development and it's just needs more work, no worries I'll just watch it develop over time.  However over a year later and I would be lying if I said things got better.  Sure they did add some new NPCs, some new sturctures.  However flying is still broken, the scale of your dragon to the world seems off, and the game doesn't feel anymore improved.\n\nSo normally I would brush this game off as a bad purchase and I would have learned a lesson, or maybe still give the dev team the benefit of the doubt.  I honestly don't know that much about game development, so maybe there is more stuff under the hood they are working on that we just don't see yet.  The main problem for me is.  Even after being on the Steam store for over a year.  Red Level Games has decided to start a campaign on Kickstarter.  (To be honest I think they are the only ones to have started on Steam, then moved to Kickstarter.  I know the reverse happens or maybe even they launch at the same time)  It seems really strange to me.  I know games cost money to make, you need to keep people employeed in order to work on a game, you also need a place for them work.  I get it and I don't care that they have this campaign of the side for people who want to help some more.  My real issue is, some of the features listed below (As of the date of writing this review) are now suddenly blocked off by a stage wall.  Even though their Kickstarter Goal is 30K some of the features such as; adding more Dragon body types/species is a 750K milestone on their Kickstarter.\n\nI don't know what Red Level Games was thinking.  This game isn't really popular, it isn't really drawing the attention needed for a Kickstarter to get the majority of it's milestone/stages funded.  It's only popular in a niche market, so the people who would have been willing to donate to the kickstarter probably have already purchased the game and even a smaller percentage of them will  be willing to give even more of their money to this project.\n\nAfter this Kickstarter I'm now worries on the progress that will be made here.  I feel like it would be a huge risk to anyone now to spend 18 dollars on this game.  However all of this could work out, the game gets finished and it's amazing.  I would be so overjoyed and woul gladly admit I'm wrong.  It's just from where I'm sitting right now... I don't have high hopes.","January 15","false","1.3"," 98 of 109 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","98","109","0","4"

I'm glad I spent it so they can work on it some more, but I'm having doubts. This game definitely has a cool idea, but it's not quite ready for anyone to play right now. In fact, there's almost nothing to do but fly around. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the dragon concept, but I don't know if they have a good enough foundation to get this off the ground (I made a pun because the dragon can barely get off the ground). Here are some ideas to make this game awesome:\n\n1. Better flight controls - It's very clunky and full of bugs. I found this nifty little nook on the top of a mountain and I tried to get to it, but my dragon kept falling backwards for some reason. No idea why. I would like to see something like Zelda: Skyward Sword. The birds in the game had very simple, but easy to use flight controls. Flap the wings, they'd go up. If you were high enough, you could coast on the "wind". I'm not looking for realistic, I'm looking for fun.\n2. Better ground movement - Dragons are mythical creatures, so I can't never know for sure...but I'm fairly certain that they aren't supposed to move like that. Also the body of the dragon doesn't interact well with the ground, and I'd like some motivation not to crash my animal into the ground. So far, the only way that's possible to land your dragon from high up is to do a death spiral to the ground.\n3. More interesting landscape - I get that they are trying to be realistic, but I'd almost prefer if they focused more on mechanics and less on landscape. Plus, the mountains are kind of boring at this point. In the future, I'd like to see snow on top of them, and forests so thick with trees that it is almost impossible to land among. Also, rivers and lakes.\n4. Dragon Territory and Hoard- I think the game makers are going for a territorial/combat/choose your destiny kind of game. I'd like to see some caves where I can store all my treasure and princesses.\n5. Better dragon customization - enough said. I'm glad I have an option to explore as a silver dragon, but I'd like a little more detail than that.\n\nOnce again, I understand that this is a work in progress. But they aren't moving very fast and I don't know if they have the foundation for this to succeed. I will remain hopeful, however. So buy the game if you can afford it, but think of it like a donation right now because it's not much of a game at all currently.","March 22, 2015","false","1.2"," 110 of 132 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","110","132","2","3"

After the recent kick starter campain, I know see how the Dev's word things is how they mean it:\n"When connected to the Internet and using Dragon: The Game, RLG may receive information including by not limited to your hardware MAC address, internet protocol address, and your usage of various game features"\nThey go into saying it is "annonimously" taken then you read the rest:\n"The information collected by RLG may be posted by RLG on publicly-accessible web sites, shared with hardware manufacturers, shared with platform hosts, shared with RLG's marketing partners or used by RLG for any other lawful purpose"\nso how could this be taken annonimously if they are going to have a record and want to share it? Oh but my favorite line is:  RLG does not guarantee that your information will not be disclosed to third parties.\n\nThis game was green lit/Early Access November 14th 2014 (which you all may want to look up the guidelines for early access), then January 2016 to Febuary 2016 they had a kick starter, saying they sound their house and vechiles for this game to come into being. Puzzeling how they started to back two other games during their raising of money.\n\nI am fully convinced what you pay for here is ~NOT~ the same game that those who paid into the kickk starter are playing (though the dev's are pleading with everyone to come here and leave a positive comment, getting other people to pay for a unplayable version. This is strenghtened by the EULA stating  "At some point in the future Dragon: The Game may go out of date, and RLG makes no commitment to update Dragon: The Game..\n\nMy Advice? God be with you if you want to buy this game.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/eula/305960_eula_0","February 25","false","1.2"," 63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","63","72","0","3"

A game where you take the role of a dragon for no greater reason other than to do dragon-y things. That's really the kind of game i'm craving these days.\n\nThat being said, i cannot in any way recommend this game in it's current state. This is VERY early access. Like, SUPER early access. It runs like a snail through molasses(very slowly) on my somewhat competent computer, and there are glitches in the most noticable of places, like that one where your dragon gets stuck tilted at a 45 degree angle from the ground.\n\nOf course, the biggest issue here, the one that really bothers me the most, is that none of the dragons movement feels especially dragon-like, with the arguable exeption of the flying. There is no weight to any of your movement, the fire breath carries all of the force of shining a flashlight on things, and all in all, in it's current state, the game ultimately fails to deliver on the one thing it tries to be: a dragon simulator.\n\nI hope, i truly hope by the grace of the moon that this game becomes something grand. And when it does, i swear i will shower it with all the praise i can muster. For the time being, though, i'm just waiting for this thing to become decently playable.\n\nOh, the curse of early access games...","November 27, 2014","false","0.9"," 109 of 150 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","109","150","4","5"

It's like Cliffhorse, but WITH DRAGONS!\n\nAll jokes aside, it's pretty barebones at the moment, and I knew it would be when I bought it. Don't buy it if you're not prepared to play a seriously early alpha build game. I am gonna recommend it, because I have been waiting for this game and would like to believe the developers will continue to the end. But there are some problems.\n\n- Dragon creation screen is broken. Can barely see dragon and most of the features appear unimplemented.\n- Multiplayer stuck me in an endless loop of connecting and freezing then reconnecting.\n- I deleted the dragon named New Dragon, and now the Dragons button no longer works so the game is unplayable. Exit button also broke.\n- If you kill a peasant they bleed and bleed until the game freezes.\n- Launch option doesn't work. You must go through the options pop up first.\n(I could not care less about that last one, but worth noting.)\n\nAgain, do NOT buy this game expecting a finished game, but do buy it if you are willing to trust the developers to finish it properly, or if you're just really in need of a dragon simulator.","November 7, 2014","true","2.0"," 130 of 184 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","130","184","0","4"

Please read the full review for my thoughts! thank you!\n\nThis game is difficult for me to review, and I'll explain why. I have dreamt of this game concept for YEARS. I have told all my friends about this "idea" I had about a game where you played AS a dragon. Where the game was a mix of RPG/Action/Strategy/Open World/Co-op and PvP. A game where you started off as a baby dragon, heading out into the world. You would set up a lair, and then proceed to level up and grow as you saw fit. Maybe you'd be a typical giant red dragon breathing fire on all the nearby villages. Or you could be a diplomatic dragon who forged alliances with humans instead. Each level would allow you to customize and upgrade various aspects of your dragon. Etc...I could go on all day about my ideas (Been thinking about them for years as I mentioned.) Reading the description from the developers, this game COULD potentially BE my dream game, finally realized.\n\nOn the one hand, I want to enthusiastically recommend this game so more people will support it and it can grow into the game of my dreams. However, I have to be honest and tell people what they are getting into before they spend their hard-earned money. I have barely started the game up, and quit after a minute or so because the controls were so un-intuitive and I couldn't figure out how to switch them. The graphics were poor, and no amount of messing with the settings would improve them. Obviously this is still in early access, so there is still hope for lots of improvement. With such a limited amount of experience in the game, I can't talk about any of the deeper mechanics, etc...but the small amount I did experience was hard to endure. I am planning to not ask for a refund in the hopes that this game will continue to grow and adapt into a game I can love. I bought it on sale for $15 ish, normally it goes for $17.99 I think. If you love dragons like I do (and like the developers, from the sound of it) this game could very well be worth supporting. If you're kind of "meh" on the subject of dragons, maybe wait a few months before purchasing.\n\nI will continually check up on this game and revise my review as time goes on. Thank you for reading!\n\nEND OF OFFICIAL REVIEW\n\nTo the developers: (if they read these things...)\nThank you for doing this game! As I mentioned, I have pictured this game in my head for 10+ years now! I always toyed with the idea of submitting it to some developer, but figured it'd already been discussed and dropped, of that there wouldn't be much interest. Every few years, I'd do an internet search for "dragon games" to see if there was by chance a game that somewhat matched my ideas. None ever have until now! Happened upon your game in a STEAM sale and bought it pretty quickly. I understand that this game is a side endeavor for all of you, outside of your regular jobs, so it can't be your main focus. All I ask is that you do what you (reasonably) can to make this game great! I could die a happy man if this game is able to fulfill even some of my grand dragon aspirations. Again, thank you for undertaking this project.","February 5","false","0.2"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","48","55","0","0"

Slightly different crap than what I originally bought, but still utter turd. I bought this game, as many others did, because this is a concept I've always been looking for in a video game. This game does not deliver on that. Dragon: The Game makes a lot of promises, and fufills none of them. Its unplayable, it's ugly, and little to no progress has been made in its development. Frankly, its gone backwards. When i first played, the UI actually worked, to a degree, and I could atleast run the game. Now many of the buttons do literally nothing when I press them, and I immediately crash a few minutes into 'gameplay'.

There is basically nothing to the game at this moment. It is a skeleton, and in my opinion, a little too bare for early access even.\n\nThat being said, I am loving this game. I am a bit bias in this, but flapping the dragons' wings to barely make it over that mountain peak, and the gliding down the side at increasing speeds was a joy. The controls are intuitive and are leagues above majority of the dragon flight games I have played, some including Lair, and Divinity 2, and multiple others that I do not remember the name of.\n\nI recommend this game for dragon lovers alone at this moment, who just want to fly around. I have very high hopes for this game, and I do recommend keeping your eye on this game if you do not buy it now.","November 8, 2014","true","2.9"," 96 of 134 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","96","134","0","2"

I bought in early to Dragon: The Game out of a love for the concept. Now after a year of checking in I'm happy to report this is one early access which I'm glad I supported. The game is far from finished but I am very encouraged to see the progress that has come about in this past year. We've come a long way from the endlessly exploding peasant on day one. What began as essentially a tech demo is slowly but surely taking a form resembling what I imagined a year ago. Through regular communication and constant updates the devs have slowly but surely been earning my trust. I am very hopeful for what this game can become.\n\nIf you're interested in this game please don't let the negative reviews form your opinion. Rather, look at the progress that has been made in the past year and have the expectation that it will be at least another year before the game is ready for launch. Most negative reviews seem to have a common theme regarding the pace of progress despite the devs stating on day one that it would take up to 2 years to reach version 1.0. So far the devs have done exactly what they said they would do, I don't know what more you can ask from them.\n\nIf you love the idea of playing as a dragon I'd encourage you to support this title. As with any early access title nothing is guaranteed but after a year of following the development of this title I say the devs deserve a little faith.\n\n***Update to review: 5/3/16***\n\nI've been checking back on this title monthly since my initial review and I feel I need to amend to keep this review honest. Communication from the devs has taken a nose dive since my initial statement. I feel obligated to say that my original statement of regular communication and updates has not held true through the beginning of this year. While I personally still feel very confident in the devs and don't interpret the poor communication in the last few months to indicate anything negative about the game development it must be pointed out to keep this review honest. Communication has improved in April and I hope we get more contact going forward. It's a very small team making this happen and I believe they are incredibly invested in bringing this dream to life but I'm also looking harder than most people probably will, so I hope they improve the frequency of communications to increase visibility and confidence.\nThat's the largest criticism I can levy currently, over promised on communication. I suspect a driving factor in the communication break down is due to a large overhaul of the game which I will discuss next.\n\nThere have been some major improvements/upgrades to the game including switching to a better engine which is a good thing but is essentially switching horses mid stream and brought visible advancement to a halt for some time. The down side to this is it in some regards is like starting from square one. The upside is the capacity for a much better game. What exists currently is still a bare bones shell but it is clearly a superior shell. Communication from the devs recently inclines me to think the big overhaul is about completed and that we'll soon be seeing content additions and performance improvement.\n\nWhen I speak of the shell of the game improving I don't think I can overstate that. Half of my play time has been from the past week. If I am to be critical of the communication I have to also point to the visibile work done, clearly they have been working on this and what is visibile is much improved. Once the game is a bit more stable and lairs and saved dragon advancements are implemented I can see myself spending quite a bit of time playing this. I REALLY like what I'm seeing with the new incarnation of the game, I see a lot more potential now.\n\nOnce the aforementioned content is added to the game I will update this again.","December 1, 2015","true","3.1"," 61 of 80 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","61","80","0","4"

At that time it was little better than a tech demo.\n\nI have redownloaded the game. This is my new impressions.\n\nI'm going to compare what was, to what is now:\n\n(Note, i played on "good" setting for graphics).\n\nThe UI prior - Seem to be well made for the starting screen where you pick your dragon/map and hit the play button. The background was equally nice. Over all, I liked it. When picking your dragon you could look at stats and what could be skills/powers. Detailed, very easy to read. This alone I'd say was very well put together and awesome at that.\n\nThe UI now - The starting screen where you pick your dragon. First impression... Green neon grass/ground. Picking your dragon button over lapped the play button so all you can see of play is LAY. Which is fine since you can put together that it is a play button. Picking dragons, the details of the dragons you can pick from are lost on the right side fo the screen into the neon green color. Leaving you guessing as to what it is saying.. I think i saw the word Ox for one of the dragons.. not sure what that would be.. maybe fav food? Really not sure what happened here. Hard to read, buttons over lapping. Step down from last time i played. Real disappointment. Almost feels like they went backwards here.\n\nMap prior - poorly put together, could tell it was either rushed, or someone new to map making had put it together. Lots of seems where you could see the parts that were put together. Things would randomly fall through or if they walked into a seam, they'd fall through. Going too far in one direction would unload the map from where you were. Once unloaded, the map wouldn't reload. You were left with "dead zones" where you couldn't go back to them. Few trees. Villagers and their homes were bunched together like small villages (this is a plus). Over all, really drove home the feel that the game was a Tech Demo.\n\nMap Now - Improved, smooth, no seams, nothing falling through the floor. Map doesn't unload and fail to load again when you come back. Rather odd coloring, kind of a neon green or off green for the "grass". More trees. Trees look nicer now. Villagers do not appear to live very close together. Takes away from the feel of villages. Over all, makes the game feel like an Alpha so a step up for sure.\n\nMobs prior - Few villagers, chicks with swords and guys with pitch forks (and of course the villager of doom, but he was a bug/glitch), cyclops, wolves, ents (or where they giants?). AI wasn't that good, simple see and attack. Passive mobs, cows, sheep. Easy to kill.\n\nMobs now - Same types of villagers, plus man at arms (or what i'd call them since they had shields), Didn't play long enough to find many other types of mobs. But i did take note there are now deer, and rabbits. Wolves are still in. AI is still rather basic. Though now they don't all attack on sight (but should in cases like the wolves who sat there and let me fry them for one of the quests)\n\nDragon Prior - Going to be honest here. The dragon we had access to when i first played was awesome looking. Really made me think Dragon. Handled ok, would go lopsided every once in a while. Could even change it's face a little.\n\nDragon now - While it does offer i think premade dragons? Not sure as it wouldn't let me actually pick anything. I was able to change the color of my dragon with sliders. Didn't have that option prior. You could make a pink dragon if you wanted to now. However, the body of the dragon as well as head leave me thinking lizard then dragon. They did it the right way the first time. Though to be fair, i heard we'll be able to have more control over what our dragons look like... hopefully. Otherwise I'd say a step backwards here with the shape.\n\nQuests prior - there were zero quests.\n\nQuests now - very simple quests at first. I didn't put a lot of time in this time around, but i get the feeling the questions are going to become more and more involved.\n\nCombat prior - We had claw/fire to use for weapons. Pretty simple to be honest. shoot some fire, or hit them with your claws. I never found any bugs or problems with it when i played then.\n\nCombat now - Able to use fire or a tail whip. Tail whip doesn't always seem to hit. Fire will fly off into the distance and cross the map. I found this out by ranging in the direction i had sent some flames doing the quest to find a chest. Actually seems more buggy then it did prior.\n\nOver all prior - I felt the game was a tech demo and nothing more. I wouldn't have recommended the game to anyone, but didn't want to leave a poor review as it's not a finished game. I wanted to wait until the game is finished, then give it a real review that may or may not be positive.\n\nOver all now - I don't feel like the game is a tech demo anymore. If i were to gage it's "age", i'd say it's early to mid Alpha. It's gettingn a lot of factors together now. The map is for sure cleaned up. Just needs more TLC. Combat and UI needs some heavy work. The game does though seem to flow better. There are some real possibilities for this game if it ever gets finished.\n\nDo I recommend the game? My answer is still sadly no. Not because it's an early Alpha after 1.5 yrs. Nor because of the remaining bugs, and unfinshed features. It's not even the snails pace it seems this game is being developed at. The reason why I am not willing to recommend this game is simple. Commuication. The developers made a promise to maintain that with us. They failed to keep their promise. I will not move my recommend to a not. Because the game is not finished. As such, there is still a chance the dev's will turn it around yet again. But we'll see how that goes. I will be uninstalling the game now. I'll load it up again when there appears to be either some heavy updates or the game is finished or in another 1.5 years ;) Which ever comes first.\n\n**old review**\nFirst, I am not recommending that anyone buy this game.\n\nI am putting it as a recommend as there is no middle choice. Right now i'm waiting to see where the game goes.\n\nThe idea of the game.. oh my god, it's awesome, what it could be is fantastic... but fantasy and reality don't go hand in hand. What will come out of this game is by far not set in stone yet.\n\nCurrently the game play is little better than a tech demo of a game. Bug filled, not very pretty graphic wise and lacking in content. You can fly around as a dragon, and haphazardly attack things with either fire, or melee. You can fly, and burn stuff. That is what is currently available in the game, plus bugs, lots of bugs, tons of bugs, map disappearing and not reloading, suddenly flying with a tilt, etc.\n\nTo be perfectly honest here. Only buy this game if you want to support the dev's and take a change on if this game will go anywhere or not. It's been out since Nov 7th of 2014, their last update to the game (not counting the testing updates that you can opt into, was in Jun of 2015. They did have some updates before then. They have been working on the game according to the opt in option. However, being one of the people who didn't opt into it, i wouldn't know what sort of "testing" is going on, and based off of the forum posts of actual testers... there doesn't appear to be that much to be impressed with. So, if you like the idea, and want to try to help out the devs... then by all means buy the game. But do so knowing that at this point in the development, you're taking a shot in the dark as to if there will be any sort of pay off (aka finished game) or not.\n\nI bought on the first day it was released onto Early Access. While I'm disappointed that i don't have much of a game yet to play, i do have hope and currently do not regert buying the game.\n\nI will update this review once the game has something to show for itself other than a tech demo style of game.","October 9, 2015","true","2.4"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","2"

It has potential; and this is why I supported it. I play on and off when new updates are released. This is a very unique game which I hope does become a reality like the developer envisoned to begin with.\n\nJust imagine flying around like a dragon, being the fiercest dragon around. How great is that?\n\nThere are bugs and problems which you expect at every early access. But would I give it a negative. No. There isn't much to do at this stage but I hope people buy it because they see the potential in the game and want the developer to foinish it so we can all act out being a dragon.\n\nIf I have to i'll pay the developer to keep going. :) that's how much I like the concept.","November 17, 2015","true","2.3"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","32","39","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackenedmoon/recommended/305960/","blackenedmoon","FeralMoonlight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackenedmoon/","80 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI do recommend this game, even at this stage, to people willing to put up with bugs and etc.\n\nI played it for a couple of minutes and I love the concept. I would really like to post this review to notify fellow players and mostly the developers about the things I have found. Please don't burn me down, I am not a very good gamer, but I believe I should be able to at least have a shot at any game, so here are some things that would make the game idiot-proof:\n\n1. Dragon flight speed has been greatly improved since last time I played it. Steering my dragon around now goes easily. However, I am still missing a possibility to kind of hang still in the air and possibly land like a helicopter. I am curious if there are going to be air battles and how those are going to be implemented because we are going to need a better way to brake, make sharp turns, perform acrobatics and etc. Sometimes you will simply need a sharp turn to eat that one goblin's head off!\n\n2. Camera: Is fine now, good job!\n\n3. Dragon creation screen: Yay for customisation! I realise that once the mechanics of the game are running smoothly, you can start focussing on this point. Being able to zoom in on the face and edit features would be great (look at the Elder Scrolls series, Fallout, etc). Turn your dragon around like you are sculpting it would be awesome. And genders, we need genders.\n\n4. I believe that there should eventually be a "lock on" option during battles and the HP bars of your target should be visible. The battles right now are just really easy: you land somewhere, goblins come running and you burn them, then eat them. Or turn them into a bloodstain and then eat them.\n\n5. SFX and music: The music is really epic, but in my opinion it would be great if the music would change depending on the situation, calm during flight and just walking around, and epic during battles and engages. The SFX are fine for a game in this stage, however you may want to make the dragon a little more menacing by e.g. adding a kind of snarling sound when he breathes fire, adding sounds of pain and agony when you are hit (same goes for the enemies).\n\n6. FPS: I have a very decent PC that can run pretty heavy games, but somehow when I play the game in high graphics, my FPS drop to levels I'd expect on my 5-year-old laptop. Low graphics work fine.\n\n7. Graphics: yeah I know these are not important yet when you are building on the mechanics, but of course the graphics need an overhaul. Ground textures are simple, characters look square. Movement of the dragon is lacking especially when running. There is no AI implemented into the enemies (yet) so they come running and start hitting you like they are suicidal. Yada yada, stuff for later.\n\nKeep up the great work, I am really looking forward to more!","November 12, 2014","true","0.5"," 65 of 95 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","65","95","0","3"

The point of Early Access was pretty much missed.\n\nIf this was a free Demo or something like that I'd be super hyped, but in it's current state I'm kind of depressed. My brother couldn't even properly run the game while it's graphics are really bad at the moment.\n\nI will update this review when the state of the game changes and it actually becomes at least worth part of it's price!\n\nYou should really reconsider putting a game onto Early Access when pretty much every free flash game you find on Armorgames or Kongregate or such sites is more fun to play. And just look at this games price right now, you get the actual game and a promise that it'll be way better. But why not buy 2 excellent games from that money and this one later?\n\n\nMy conclusion: Track this game's updates but don't bother buying if you want to properly play as a dragon. You pretty much can't. There's barely any content.\n\n\nEdit: I don't understand the many negative votes on this review.

I don't even know where to begin. This looks nothing like the videos and screenshots advertised. It looks awful. Even on 'Beautiful' settings, Dragon: The Game looks and feels atrocious. The menus are slow, laggy and ugly. The game takes forever to load and appears to be not responding for ages. The dragon itself looks like the child of an ankylosaur and a pterosaur after a heavy night of drinking and rough sex. Enemies pop back into existence seconds after they've died and go all rubbery when they die. You bounce off things. The HUD doesn't work and I can't upgrade my dragon. Windowed Mode doesn't work either. There's no eating animation, things just disappear. The R key does nothing. Aiming is impossible half the time. And I keep on running into a bug where I can't fly forwards. Random areas are cut off. The terrain is bright and ugly and overfilled with fog. And so on and so forth.\n\nNormally I wouldn't be so angry, but I got this game as a gift and requested that the original purchaser get their money back because I felt they'd been ripped off. Dragon: The Game has been in Early Access for a stupidly long time, with an amazingly good concept, but they barely have an Alpha yet, let alone a Beta.\n\nAvoid this game at all costs. You want a dragon game? Dragonflight has far better performance and controls, Time of Dragons is free to play and TESV: Skyrim has mods that let you become/ride dragons. Heck, the Pyro in Team Fortress 2 is a better fire-spitting monster than whatever this is.","April 7","false","0.7"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","79","34","43","12","0"

The poor attention to detail, the absolute laziness and lack of effort put into something as simple as a camera control, and I won't even start on how the graphics have gotten WORSE over time!\n\nThis game has absoutely amazing potential, it is a game that would go absolutely over the moon! However, there needs to be some sort of change in the current direction of the game. There is little to no effort of improvement on the actual core of the game and what you see in the trailers and advertisement is not what you get when you actually get into the game.\n\nThere are of course many great things about this game.. The play style, the fact that the protagonist is and will be a dragon instead of a human, and the fact that you can choose to be good or evil. However, all other good things about the game that are possible right now are just ideas at the very core thrown into the game without a second thought.\n\nI urge you not to buy the game just yet, as I believe it was thrown into crowd funding without any plan as to what to do with the money towards the game thereafter. The result so far is poor and quite appauling, I sincerely hope that this will change in the future as I was not nearly as excited about any other game as I was about this before I bought it.\n\nOverall: 3/10\n\nDon't buy it just yet, wait it out a bit.

If you're thinking about buying this because you want a complete title that is playable right now, I suggest you look elsewhere - though the whole reason I recommend purchasing Dragon: The Game in its current state is so it is pushed towards completion.\n\nThat being said, let's be truthful: In its current state, Dragon: The Game is unplayable. It is literally unplayable. There is nothing to do but fly around, and even that is tough given the clunky controls and the nonsensical camera. And then there are the bugs. Oh god, if you want the grandest example of how laughable Dragon is in its current state, I suggest you try crashing your dragon into the ground a few times and trying to fly afterwards. Seriously. You'll be flying up when your dragon is upside down, and you'll be flying forward when your dragon is trying his damnest to crash into the ground again. Once again, Dragon is not really playable in its current state. It's super early alpha, maybe not even that.\n\nHowever, guys, we have to support this cause.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/recommended/305960/","melancholyrose","Mel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/","77 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPatch 8.3 Review UpdateI reinstalled the game to check out the latest beta patch. I wrote my previous review months ago, but now I figure it's time to come back and readdress some things with a bit more clarity.\nI purchased this early access game in April 2015. It is now currently January 2016. There have been very little changes since I bought it. Certainly not enough to "wow" me yet.\n\nThe Positives1) Previously, I made mention that the flight controls were sickeningly sensitive to the point of being out-of-control insane. With the 8.3 update, it's not as bad. I was able to move without throwing up in the process. That is one thing I can say has noticeably improved. It was so terrible before that I couldn't play the game at all.\n\n2) The terrain seems more lush than before. All I remember was long stretches of blank ground with barely any trees or mountains or much of anything.\n\n3) You can grab people and animals and carry them into the air and eat them. If you can manage to get it to work properly, that is. I'll get to that later.\n\n4) You can now color the dragon. This wasn't an option before.\n\n5) Flying around in circles is fun, even if I'm not really doing anything important. So, ponts for being immersive.\n\nThe Negatives1) They said the optimization was improved, but it still seemed pretty poor on various settings. The funny thing is, the lag and stuttering happens the most when running on the ground, and it's smooth sailing (no pun intended) when you're flying over miles of forests. This happened to me before the patch, as well, on the fastest graphics setting on a brand new gaming machine with a more-than-capable graphics card. This needs some serious tweaking before it's playable for a wider range of people.\n\n2) While the flight controls were easier to deal with, the other controls were a bit of a mess. I tried like hell to pick up people off the ground in mid-flight. I managed to successfully do it once, then proceeded to drop said human because I'm spamming the Q button like crazy trying to snatch him up. It barely works. I was more excited than I needed to be when I finally managed to get it.\n\nFor some reason, the flight controls were automatically selected as inverted when I reinstalled and restarted the game. I'm used to normal flight controls. This isn't a big complaint, because that's an option you can change.\n\nGrabbing things will sometimes just bug out the dragon or the enemy you're picking up to where they're almost melting together like in The Thing.\n\n3) The envrionment is hilariously glitchy, as are the enemies and objects. While flying the dragon around, I couldn't count how many rocks, trees, tree stumps, houses and people were either stuck halfway through the ground and peeking up through a mound of snow like they got trapped in a snowbank, or were floating in mid-air like they were caught in a time-warp. I almost don't want to call this a "negative" because I laughed whenever I saw it. I actually got stuck underneath a floating rock at some point.\n\nSometimes you'll get stuck on a piece of the terrain-- say, a house or a tree-- and you'll suddenly and mysteriously get launched backward several yards as if you had been rocketed off of a pine tree trebuchet. This also made me laugh. "Where are you going, Dranonimous?!" I yelled.\n\nThe LOD is a mind trip. In the distance, the envrionment is just one giant oil paint color blotch, which really negates the look of the piece of the map you're currently standing in. It makes you think that if you go anywhere near the color blotch, you'll disappear into the gaming void. I didn't want to go past the borders of the snowy forest, which I figured was the least glitchy part of the map. I did fly somewhat away form it to check out a badly-rendered lake. Then I turned back because the rest of the map had also turned into a lake somehow.\n\n4) I never lost any health. Or gained any. I don't think you can really get hurt yet. I understand that eating is meant to replenish you, but that doesn't seem to have a purpose. Not yet, anyway. And your enemies are clones of one pitchfork-wielding dude and cows. Or cottages.\n\n5) Maybe I'm not the first to say this. If I am the first to say it, then let it be known: The dragon... is ugly. I'm sorry. But it just is.\nThe dragon's front arms look like they should be socketed on a G.I. Joe. The back legs belong to some kind of alien frog. The head... well, I can barely look at it, because whenever I try to, the dragon shoves his face in the ground like an ostrich. The tail is three times as long as its body.\n\nThe running and flying animations aren't very fluid. Instead of running on its bulging soldier arms and amphibious hind legs, it does this sort of "hop" that really reinforces the whole "Frog" concept. Maybe there'd be a different animation for walking, which would follow the stride of most other four-legged creatures. Right now, it just looks awkward and weird and not at all aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe flight animations aren't much better. The body is sort of stiff as its airborne, sans the waving, flapping tail, and the wings resemble cardboard.\n\nFinal ThoughtsOverall, my opinion is mixed. It's starting to show a tiny bit of potential, but the updates have not been very grand since I bought this, and they state it should be ready for release and out of Early Access in two years (and they said this when I bought it). Yeeeah, I don't think so.\n\nDragon The Game is in VERY EARLY ALPHA, and this should be considered when making the Early Access purchase. It is barely even half ready after nine months.

I will absolutely be updating this review as more stuff gets released.\nYou create yourself a dragon, you can fly around and you can incinerate stuff - and by that I mean trees - and that's pretty much it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dryheat4u/recommended/305960/","Dryheat4u","Dryheat4u","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dryheat4u/","13 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI will update this review with each successive update to the game.\n\nIf you find this review unhelpful, tell me why and I will try to fix it.\n\nRevised 6-4-2016\n\nOverview: It is evident from the blog and other resources that the focus right now is on game function and code stability, mostly under the hood stuff, the kind of stuff that matters much more than how pretty it looks. Nobody gives a damn about your Corvette if there is no working engine, and nobody cares about a game with underdeveloped code. In that regard I think Red Level has its priorities straight, and in the play-through my priority at this phase in development was to look at code stability, controls, and interface. Stability and Control score a solid OK, it took me only about five minutes to figure out the basics of movement and flight and after ten was able to fly around without crashing into anything.\n\nMovement & Controll: For those thinking of buying now, the dragon maneuvers like you are flying a helicopter, gravity is irrelevant once you hit the space-bar and continues to be irrelevant after you let go, which causes you to slowly float back down to the surface. The W key allows forward flight, with a momentum dynamic like you would logically expect. Turning is instant and mouse directed, but you will tend to drift like a Ford on ice while cornering even if your dragon faces the desired direction instantly so plan ahead. Be aware that the game does not bind the mouse to the game screen, so long turns in one direction will cause the mouse to drift off screen and will close the window when you click any mouse button.\n\nCombat: Combat is very one sided, both in terms of damage taken, and physical damage dealt since you can only swing your tail to one side or your dragon, so make sure the thing you want to kill is on that side. Fire breath is hard to aim at first so be careful using it on the ground or you will burn yourself before anything around you. Think like an airplane when using this, you want to strafe a target with fire if you can, before landing to collect it.\n\nNavigation: As of right now navigation is line of sight only, you get a look at a map sketch when you first drop in to the game but you have no mini-map in your interface so plan on getting lost. Right now having your bearings doesn't really matter since there is not all that much to do. The map is also fairly small, you'll bump into an invisible wall after about ten minutes flying any one direction.\n\nQuests/Tasks: The game will automatically cycle through a pool of quests that are focused on testing game dynamics like flight, hunting, eating, and exploring (No plot yet, Lore on website). There is no mandate to complete them, but a navigation marker will hover over the relevant task to be completed.\n\nInterface: Currently you get three small circles in the lower right had corner of the screen which tell you what powers or attacks you have. There are "Roar" "Tail Swipe" "Bite Attack" and "Fire Breath". Roar did not provide audio feedback when used, and I could not observe any notable effect to things on the surface. Tail Swipe/Fire Breath controls are functional though there are some quarks to be resolved as the game progresses. A Three button mouse is needed to use both bite and tailswing. There is a hunger readout on the bottom right which gives access to the upgrade menu which is currently in development and not working.\n\nGraphics: Mostly placeholder textures, its not supposed to be pretty yet. The framework is there for high poly models but they have not been applied yet.\n\nSound: Mostly placeholder sounds, they have good ambient noises but the looping soundtrack can be a bit annoying. Improvements to come, but likely not until after Alpha.\n\nSecondary Effects: In shooters this would be like bullet holes where you shoot walls, or dynamic destructible vehicles. In dragon this is most notable with fire breath, where your fire can spread from one part of a building to the whole. You can burn down trees, or knock them over with your tail.\n\nPhysics: Physics modeling for a dragon in flight is helicopter based, you will drift in the direction you are leaning when not using the throttle. There are no glide dynamics, gravity is weak to your dragon and allows for unrealastic floating, and there are no fall/impact deaths for you or NPC's. The glide dynamic has improved somewhat with the most recent update, and is being dialed in progressively.\n\nAI: Villagers become hostile when you get close enough, and are harder to kill. They will always take the shortest route to you, and will stack up beneath you if you fly just right. Animals are neutral, (except for bears) but will run away if you get too close.\n\nStability: Pre-Alpha, not optimized. You will have low frame rates regardless of your system power. I maxed out at 24FPS but dropped as low as 12 at max graphics, which did not strain my system. Pre 3-29 update I was lucky to get 12FPS, so there is improvement. There have been a series of small un-announced updates which have improved overall stability.\n\nGlitches: A quick twenty minutes of game play did not result in any crashes or game breaking glitches. I did not get stuck in a cave, or get caught under the map. When grabbing objects you are almost guaranteed to experience a glitch known as the "runaway rag-doll". This glitch can happen as a result of poor collision mapping, or can occur if the engine thinks the object its grabbing is weightless and therefore has no inertia. You get an explosion of flailing limbs that can be distracting, but that’s about it.\nAnother prominent glitch occurs when two animated objects collide on uneven or akward terrain, resulting in one or both objects being thrown violently out of map or straight into the air. This glitch occurs in nearly every game in development, and was made popular by Skyrim's "hammer spike" in which being killed by an overhead swing from a giant launched your character straight up into the air. You will see this in Dragon if you land directly on a live deer or wolf. Sometimes the both of you are thrown, or sometimes only one of you. This is more likely to happen on hillsides or in rocky terrain. It also happens if you tail swing a sheep, deer, or wolf into another object without killing them, resulting in a violent but non lethal vertical launch.\n\nDeveloper: Red Level Games as an upstart has an opportunity to fill the general void left by developers like Bungie, EA, and even Microsoft. All of these companies have had rather lackluster recent releases that have underperformed in some way, they have become victims of their own success and now sell titles based on their franchise hype.\n\nRed Level Games has all the attributes of a good developer, they:\n1. Are reasonably active on their own forums.\n2. Operate an independent website that isn't an eyesore, and was reasonably easy to navigate.\n3. Have an easy "contact us" section which allows anyone to email them directly.\n4. Post blog updates to their website and Steam (recently on a monthly basis)\n5. Allow the community to contribute to game mechanics where applicable.\n6. Are honest and forward in their efforts.\n7. Clearly communicate update goals and priorities.\n\nDragon: The Game has great potential, especially if it allows the community to generate content and assist in building the product. They have already partly done so by releasing a model dragon skeleton for hobbyist animators to play with, and to potentially contribute to animation in game. They appear dedicated, and work in a fantasy niche that nobody has attempted to fill until now. For that reason, and the ones listed above, I can recommend this title to anyone who wants to support pre-alpha development. This means that you are willing to play a partally functional game and be a good sport about it untill things get fixed.","March 11","true","1.7"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","18","26","3","3"

Becuase i'm rather dead locked on this. But since i'm a rather trusting guy (and I dont want the Devs chance of making this great ruined), I alas, must recomend this. BUT ONLY, with a very wary recomdation based on the game that was promised, not as it is.\n\nSimply put. the potential for this game is through the roof. And if they ever reach what they showed in the trailer, and screens, i'll be more then happy with the twenty bucks I spent on this. Just the concept is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.

Simply put, the game in its state right now, is...shall we say, lacking?  As a kind word. I know this is early access. But games like the Forest, Subnauctia, The Long Dark, and Ark are early access, and they look, and feel way smoother and more polished. I dont mind jank...but this is going a little too far for my tastes. Also, the screens in the front, are borderline false advertising, so I wish the devs would remove them for somthing thats more accurate tothe build were in.  Hopefully, since the devs have just got there kickstarter money recently, they'll  improve upon the game much more in the upcoming months (hopefully...).\n\nSo right now, i'll give the game a pass, simply because of it's potential, the fact it's in early access, and I want the devs to succed.\n\nThough like I said before, if you DO not want to support the devs this early, and get a...rather basic product (with alot more promised in the future) I would say lay off.

There's no tutorial, creating a dragon and navigating the menus to play is a chore (you have to name your dragon AND select it after creating it in order to start the game), deleting a dragon causes a game breaking bug that forces you to delete all the files in your steamapps/dragon the game folder and reinstall the game, there's no in-game options menu or sound, nor are there things to interact with.  I did burn down a few houses, but that was all there was to do.\n\nFor those that want to support the devs and trust they'll produce something from the nothing it currently is, I'd say go for it.  For those who like to justify their purchases and have to worry about a budget, I'd say wait a while until more content is added.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DutchAngelDragon/recommended/305960/","DutchAngelDragon","LimaeTheDAD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DutchAngelDragon/","20 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI do recomend this game to people who like helping out with beta games or early access games.\nThe games base is awesome and the graphics are pretty good in my opinion. I have a few suggestions.\n\n-The age of your dragon should affect its size. for example: a baby dragon should have a smal body, baby like eyes, and small wings that don't allow them to fly that easily or that far.\n-The dragons should grow over time so that if you make a baby dragon, you won't be stuck a baby forever. (and don't make the ancient dragons die unless the user deletes them.)\n-You should start out with only 6 skill points instead of 8 so that you don't go overboard with your skills.\n-To go along with your villlages and castles, you should add towns and cities. (Kind of like skyrim, I know that.)\n-The giants should not stay in one place, but move to other places in groups.\n-The dragons should be able to use their right click move to be able to build caves, or dens, to live in. The caves/dens should be as big as your dragon can dig (or as large as the user feels ok) and at the end of their building, they should be able to choose what type of den it is. for example: you could have a den with water surrounding the nest if you feel you want to be a "water dragon"\n-You should add different types of dragons: Water dragons, lava dragons, ect.\n-You should be able to drink water to restore your mana or health.\n-You should allow dragons to mate with each other and share dens. (i don't think there should be eggs though.)\n-Instead of there only being mountains, there should also be desserts, forests, oceans, islands, and other land masses like that.\n\nThose are just my opinions, so you may not like them. Now, to the review part if i haven't bored the reader already. :D\n\n-The dragons flying movements and speeds are perfect so far.\n-The realism with the villagers is spot on, and the cows are so cute that I haven't killed a single one so far.\n-It is fun to burn down villages, although my favorite part is eating the giblets of humans, wolves, giants, and goblins once they are dead.\n-The mountains are cool, and are really fun to glide off of as you burn down a village.\n\nThank you for this game and I really hope you don't give up on it. Even at this stage I feel the game will be absolutely perfect (with some minor tweaks).\n\n~UPDATE~ From watching the video and seeing the upcoming features, I have to admit this game is better than I had imagined it. Claiming territories is what I am most excited about so keep up the good work everyone!\n\n~UPDATE~ I can see that the developers are focused on fixing bugs and glitches, but I have an idea that I would love to see incorperated in the game as soon as possible. I think the game should be a little more fantasy focused. I believe that maybe you should make the dragons able to improve their atributes as they use it more. For example, if you always attack with fire, maybe the more you use fire, the more your dragon becomes one with it. In fairytail (an anime), Natsu called a dragon made up of flames his grandpa. I believe that if you use fire for at least 3/4 of your attacking, your dragon should be able to be ingulfed in flames, and you should be able to change the color of said flames. I also think that early in the game, prefferably while in dragon customization, you should be able to choose what you want your dragons element to be focused on. Like, in fairytail, there were wind dragons, water dragons, electric dragons, shadow dragon, light dragons, etc. that used their element in their breath attacks. I believe that should be done, and like the fire dragon, if they use their breath attacks 3/4 of the time in combat, then they should be their element (light, shadows, iron) in the shape of a dragon. I also believe that you should add other attacks such as a wing attack, some sort of tail attack, and more like it. Also, just like the breath attack, if say they use their claws 3/4 of the time in combat then they should be surrounded in spikes/quills that will do damage if one chooses to touch them, but the spikes/quills can be retracted with the key they choose in a keybinding menu. I believe that you should allow people to choose whether they want to be a human or a dragon in multiplayer so that they can fight against eachother, and you should add a place where dragons go to mate or lay eggs, somewhere that it would take time for humans to find it if they knew it existed.\n\nI am very sorry about the long update, but I just have so many ideas for this game. I am jelous of the people that are working on it. If you want more ideas, please message me, for I have many ideas for this game, even though it is mainly focused on being a dragon. ^~^\n\n~Special shout out to my good friend RageBerry for always being there.~","December 30, 2014","true","3.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","3"

I'd like to see better camera controls when on the ground, and some tweaking on the camera in the air.

It doesn't look like it used to. The thing is, the devs recently rebuilt this game on a new system from the ground up. So it is completley different in terms of looks and gameplay now at the time of writing this review.\n\nBut I will say that even though the graphics aren't great and the gameplay has quite a few bugs, this game will go far. I already have a good amount of fun flying around eating animals and villagers, picking up pigs and dropping them to the ground, and burning down anything remotley flammable. Tail-whacking wolves off their feet is pretty fun too. It's a fun game to play if you want to run around as a dragon for a bit.\n\nI'm giving this a thumbs up because I believe in this game and where it will go. For the usual gamer, I'd recommend purchasing this alpha only if you'd like to support the development of it and stand with the game as it grows over time. It's going to grow into something truly spectacular, I promise you.","February 15","true","19.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

On one hand I want to recomend this game but on the other hand there are reasons why I couldn't.\n\nI'll start with whyI would recomend this game first. Who doesn't dream about an open world RPG where you get to explore, destroy or befriend villages, hunt, build up a lair, raid for loot, take part in ever shifting politics and most importantly you play as a dragon. Now this game really has the potential to be that game someday and that is what the developers have been dreaming of. Since I got this game, I have seen it change quite a bit, but don't take this as it being anywhere near complete.\n\nNow on to bad parts. Currrently the game is very far from complete, as I said, the game does have potenntial but it still has a long, long way to go. The flying mechanics are I have to say a lot better than when I first joined (the flight and flight controls are a lot more stable, thank goodness)  and the textures whilst nowhere near good are at least less of an eyesore than the previous ones (think of Rome II's release and the shining dirt that appeared on that, that was what the previous textures were like.) but the presensce of numerous terrain bugs (floating objects E.C.T.) as well as the lack of things to do in the game in it's current state show that it is a long way from being finished.\n\nOverall I would have to say that I would recomend this game (not really in its' current state) simply because of the potential that is here and it is the potential of the game that just holds it up at the moment. If you're unsure of buying it then perhaps wait fo while for the game to become better but the trickey thing is that the potential can only  be realised through people buying into this early acess which is both the blessing and the curse of early acess.\n\nNow unlike many games that are in 'early acess' I can see that this game isn't just a anouther blatent cashgrab and that the devs really want this game to succeed and I do really see that it is possible for them to be able to pull it off which is anouther reason why I'm recomending it.\n\nJust one more thing I have to say before I end this review, a lot of people are complaining about how the game doesn't look like the videos and screenshots on the store page and how it is in such  a low stage of development compared to the time it's been out, that is because those screenshots and videos are from the previous itteration of this game which fthe devs as far as I know scrapped because they encountered a serious problem with the code, as such this is essentially a whole new game that the devs created  which is why it is in the stage of development it's in.\n\nNow taking onto consideration what I said, go ahead and make up your own mind about whether or not you want to support this game.","December 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

It sounds fantastic and is exactly the kind of game I would love to get lost in for hours on end.  However, i get the impression that this game is going nowhere.\n\nWhen I purchased the game and ran it for the first time I was severely disappointed.  Trying to create a dragon resulting in constant crashes that were resolved by me just accepting the default dragon that appears when you first run the game.  I flew this dragon about and was amazed at how sloppy and almost useless the controls were.  Perhaps I chose a drunk dragon, or, worse yet, the one addicted to some really severe illegal drugs.  In any case, I got nowhere fast and, due to even more crashes, ended up not playing.\n\nNow, I fully realize that this is an early access game.  That being said, I decided to wait a couple months and try the game again.  During my absence I thought that some progress would be made by the devs and that I'd finally get in some play time.  This was not the case.  After two months of waiting I still could not log into the game, create a dragon, and play for 5 minutes without crashing.  So, I shelved the game again.\n\nIt has now been several months (at least 6 or more) since I've tried this game.  I am in the process of downloading it again to see if any progress has been made toward my getting a somewhat playable product that I chose to support.  If I find that the game is indeed playable somewhat, I will let you know my findings.  If not, then heed this warning:\n\nThis game is not playable.  Yes, I only have half an hour play time invested in the game according to steam.  Well, that is a half hour time that I was actually in the game and able to play between crashes.  Honestly, I've given this game at least 2 full days of play time trying to work around bugs, crashes, lock ups, and several other problems that plague the game.\n\nMy system:\n\nintell I5 running at 3.4 ghz, 16 gigs of ram, and a geforce GTX 560 TI with 1 gig of dedicated video ram.\n\nMy frame rate: less than 10 fps if you can get the game to run stable enough to measure the fps","September 15, 2015","false","1.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","11","16","4","1"

And if you could be a wyvern, that would be AWESOME! I, personally, think that wyvern dragons are the best dragons, because of Smaug.\nThe camera is a littla wierd as well. I think that, on the ground, you should be able to look up and down, with out pressing the camera button, that's just my opinion.\nI also think it would be cool if the enemies and villigers turned into ragdolls when killed, then you could loot their bodies for gold coins, weapons and armor, and all the stuff you got off their bodies would go to your hoard. The more stuff you have, the badder dragon you are. And then after looting the bodies, you just eat them right then and there.\nThese are just a few ideas that would make this awesome game, AWESOMER! If that's even a word, which it is now! TO THE CREATORS OF DAGON: PLEASE TRY TO IMPLEMENT THESE IDEAS INTO THE GAME! IT WOULD BE SOOO AWESOME IF YOU DID!","March 8, 2015","true","3.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","10","15","4","1"

I absolutely adore the concept AND what's happening with it. I'm just here to review this early stage, it's very buggy (I'll report as many bugs that I found as possible soon) and barron, but holy diglett dig! It's fun and has more potential than...Burger king lowering the price on the fish sandwich. I recommend it, but don't expect much YET! And now, bug/glitch time!:\nI tried hosting, it made the gui's tiny and flipped them upside down and backwards.\nI found many clip-through unnatural holes in the (currently small) world.\nI glitched the stamina meter, it had infinite stamina. I actually used that to my advantage because the stamina meter's kind of a burdon. >.< Makes the game more fair, though! (Might want to lower the speed of stamina loss a bit)\nOther then that the most I have is a few movement glitches here and there, (you probably already know about the sudden backwardsness) so yeah.\n\n10/10 (if judging as a full fledged game about as much as sonic 06, but it's early alpha so I'm rating fairly) and I love it.

Though it is obvious early development the potential is all there. Just the idea of, rather than being the brave knight that goes off and slays the dragon, but being the dragon who terrorizes, demolishes, and captures towns was very intriguing to me. Just the flight mechanics in general I am in love with. Though they may be a little buggy. But hey, that’s what early access is for. If you can’t fork out the money to buy this game at the moment I do suggest keeping an eye on it for the future.","November 23, 2014","true","1.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Not because it's great, in fact it's in early access and it shows, but because i'm a F*%king DRAGON! the simple fact that these beautiful people at Red Level are even trying to make this game brings me all sorts of jollys. I do recomend this game even with all of it's faults. I do this because I have been watching it for years now and it seems to realy be picking up some momentum. (In comparison to the slower than snail dung pace of the before times) I also don't agree with the assumption that you should automaticaly give a game a thumbs down just because it's not finished, it is in early access after all and reveiws do have an effect on peoples buying habits as well as the moral of the developers. I for one want to see this game reach it's fullest potential and for it to do so it needs our support.\n\nThere is a kickstarter out there if you are interested and dont want to buy an unfinished game, but then why not just buy the game when it's on sale and reap all the free updates? if this game lives up to half of what Red Level is bravley, if a bit brazenly, trying to accomplish then it will be more than worth $60. As of my writing this you can get the game for $15. it's a bit much for an early access game and i dont recomend this game to anyone who is spending their only game money till payday to try and tide themselves over. But if you are looking to get in on the ground level of some pretty fantastic shiz this game is a go.\n\nFor my final and most important point: Because dragons.\n\nP.S. i will be writing more reveiws of this game as i play it more and as updates come out.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\nI have now owned and played this game for a while and there was a patch recently that fixed a lot of the baisic bugs. Every month there is a new patch and every month this game looks a little bit more like what it is supposed to be. This game is not a simple indie project and honestly it would take a AAA game company ten years to develop something on the scale of what Dragon: the game is promising. Anyone who thinks this game should be even close to finished after two or three years has no idea what it takes to build a game.\n\nSome people will fire back that the developers should not have released the game in early access at this stage. I disagree, Red Level is a brand new developer with very few recources and they are tackling an immense project while having to maintain their lives. Puting this game out in early access is a way to generate revenue and allow those who are interested in this type of game to check out what Red Level has done so far as well as get involved with the development process.\n\nGiving this game a bad reveiw because it is unfinished is like being upset that you got fish from a fish market. It is still in its very early stages of development and as i said before it shows. however early access is not for people who want a finished game.\n\nIn the end:\nBuy this game if you love dragons and like to watch as a game grows from idea to fully realized universe.\n\nDont buy this game if you are impatient and want a finished game.","March 29","true","2.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","11","19","3","0"

However, the game in its current form is as alpha as it can get. It's very buggy, many things need to be worked on. But the devs seem really caring about it so I have no doubt that this will fail. It will take tons of patience, for the team and the players for it to develop any further. As far as I know they're the first that's come out with a game like this: deeply customizable dragons that you can play as in a wide, open world. So far they are doing a great job with introducing this game to the world. Baby steps!\n\nIf you are purely wanting to buy this game to play, I would not recommend it (there's not much to do except flying and breathing fire).

After flying around the rather large yet not limitless world and mastering the flying system (which is very simple and easy to figure out), I set to burning every house and creature in sight.  Garnering over 1300 xp, I found that there is not a leveling system as of yet.  I also found that flying at high speed into the ground will glitch you into a wierd angle until you restart the world.  The village people are often immortal, and come back from the dead after you kill them.  In conclusion, this is not a game that you should buy if you are looking for another fun game to play. However, if you are interested and willing to watch and help a game along and make it into a great addition to your Steam library, then I recommend you do purchase it.  You may say that it is a waste of money, I say it is an investment.  Right now, the only actions you can perform are flight and fire breath, as well as a melee attack, there are no sounds, and bugs are like part of the gameplay. but this is how every game starts out.  Now, I think I'll go play some Warframe while I eagerly await the November 14th update of Dragon.","November 12, 2014","true","1.4"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","5"

This game has been in development for a very long time and has made little progress.\n\nWhen you purchase an early access game you are telling a developer that you believe in their product and therefore want it to succeed.  Unfortunately this trust has been taken advantage of all too often and has led many to distrust the early access program.  I am unsure if the developers for Dragon have done so intentionally or not, but they have done so.  Infrequent updates, bugs, and many more problems riddle this game.\n\nThe character creation process has changed very little in two years and it seems that anything you do to the dragon shapes and sliders and color have no effect.  Additionally no matter what color (black, red, blue, etc) dragon you choose the game will label it as a green dragon.\n\nThe camera is too difficult to work with and turns what should be an exciting experience of flying over villages mountains and forests into something much more frustrating.  Your view is limited to right behind the dragon, and because it is so close it obstructs most of the viewing field.  It led to me dying several times because I had no idea that I was being attacked.\n\nPlease do not buy this game.","May 22","false","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Maybe some day someone will be able to realize it. That day, is not today. Dragon suffers from some horrendous setbacks that even some of the shoddiest Early Access titles can't make claims to. It's glitchy, laggy, handles abysmally, has extremely poor models and animation, and worst of all has made very little progress in development. In fact, this recent update seems to have stripped several previously added "features" (if they may even be called such), taken away the previous, somewhat customizable dragon model, and given us a rather horrid mess. The game now lags even worse, with even more terrible flight controls and physics than before. A step back in almost every regard. Maybe, if this game can survive a year and gain some good, solid updates, it might be able to at least succeed in proposing the idea of this concept. That, of anything here, is the one thing that deserves to survive.","April 28, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

You have to create a dragon, name it, and then press the arrows to select that name before you can click the new game/ join game buttons.\n\nSo far there isn't much. You can fly around. you can kill things, you can minorly customize your dragon, if things die you can eat the red meat cubes that drop to heal, you can breath fire, you can bite and you can scratch. The world is small. Other than that ther isn't much until more updates come up, but that doesn't make it bad. They are adding small things at a frequent pace at the moment, so that is good. It is a very early alpha release so none of these things are bad. They are good, because you can actually do stuff! Game will be good if it keeps on updating at this pace in 6+ months.

Also, the controls don't work well with a track-pad and there's no way to aim your attacks if you're not flying. Finally, the fact that there are no options for mouse sensitivity, key binds, or even sound volumes is incredibly problematic. Overall, the game in its current state is hardly worth 2 dollars, and the camera angles and controls should be fixed ASAP, not in SEVEN MONTHS FROM NOW.\n\nI really want this to be a good game, but right now it's just a pain in the neck for me.

BUUUUUUT, right now the game is NOT at it's full potential. Not even close. First off the second I get in the game it lags like crazy unless I have all the graphics options ALL the way down. I know it's not my computer because I have one of the best computers on sale (not to brag). Then there's the lair and landmark thing but the devs are working on it so I will leave that alone. I WILL however, address what is probably the most important aspect of the game, the dragons. Or should I say, the lack of them. From what I have seen from the game there are no dragons other than you. Regardless of where you are. From what ive seen there aren't even bad guys other than villagers (excluding the animal life) and they can get 1 hit by you. I will also leave the grabbing thing alone because that is also explained as buggy in the game and I do hope they improve on it. This game also REALLY REALLY REALLY needs an in game map. That shows the landmarks and lairs. I don't know whether or not I am going in circles or actually going somewhere half the time. There is also no tutorial, which will be a big problem for new players. Right now thought the game isn't really complex enough for a tutorial. The objectives and quest are definitely a no-go. They are too simplistic, I mean cmon! You are a DRAGON! Why do you have to eat 10 wolves here, or 5 rabbits there? The goals need to be higher. Like idk maybe have a quest be to fight a patrol of soldiers roaming the countryside. Right now though there isn't anything else to do because of all the reasons above. Then there's the multiplayer option. I tried to make it work. BUT, of course that didn't work either. It said I need a group name. No matter what I did it always said it was being used. I literally just spammed a bunch of random letters and it told me it was already used. Like seriously I just did this aoifhisacybf8uisyf87wo yvr091yu390rconusdlfumx92uf9w and it still said it was already being used. I honestly don't think enough people even play this game for a normal group name to even not be available. Then there's the lack of a sovereign (and everything else NPC wise other than villagers and these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking wolves). I know it SAYS there is one but there isn't even a castle or building other than these really fat looking huts for the villagers and piles of twigs for wolf dens. There are probably many other problems with this game I don't even know about. All of these problems I got from playing barely more than hour of this game. I mean come on! This game right now is pathetic. It's not worthy of anyone's respect or time. BUT, the game DOES have SO MUCH POTENTIAL! Potential that is sadly not being used. I can't speak for anyone else but this game is not worth 17 bucks. Right now, it's worth like 4 cents. Probably less. Actually the devs of this game should be paying US to play this game. But, I say again, I have high hopes that this game will turn out good. I also REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLY hope the devs of this game don't abandon this game. it has a lot to work on though, and the devs aren't fixing any of the problems by the looks of it and just adding more and more crap that won't work. If they are trying to fix it then the devs definitely need to think of a different job than videogame making. This game has, and I can't say this enough, A LOT OF POTENTIAL. But right now, this is an insult to the gaming society. IF they turn the game around, fix the lag and the bugs, make more buildings, make the present buildings look LESS like someone just got lazy and slapped a bunch of brown texture together and tripled it's size, actually DO the things they say they will, then my review MIGHT change. But for right now this game just wasn't worth my money. AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF the game isn't updating itself as it is supposed to. So my version of the game is permanently stuck at the 8.04 version. Which means the game itself is refusign to even leave Early Access. Even the game knows it sucks. I MAY change my tune if the creators of this game give me a FULLY updated version of the game and a version that updates ITSELF.","February 13","false","3.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is a Dragon Sandbox, and if you played AD&D at all, or perhaps read some of those real popular novels in the late 80s that launched the Dragonlance franchise, the idea behind this game might appeal to you all the more.    Now, I am going to press <enter> and I'm going to indent so that you will see that there is an important point about to be made.  Please take the few seconds to read it.  Please don't skim.  I will refrain from using all caps this time.\n\nThis game is not in Alpha yet.  This game is not a game yet.   This game can only be called a work in progress at the moment     This game is very nebulous at the moment.  Be advised: if you to buy a complete Dragon: The Game, wait.   However, if you are  as intrigued as I was by the game concept as I was and wish to -contribute- and -invest- in the game's future, by all means, buy.\n\n\nI think that the nebulous nature of the game at this point is a selling point.  Buying in now gives you a say, at the ground floor, in how the game develops.  I have ideas bubbling out of my ears, and you will find that many other people do as well if you look at the game Forums.  I envision a game that barely skirts getting sued for copyright infringement, where time tested (and gamer approved) Dragon Concepts are incorporated into the game (for instance, a set number of "Good" dragon colors and a set number of "Evil" dragon colors, as an example.\n\nI will recomend this game for those that have the money to spend and want to help.  I do not recomend this game for those looking for another victory notch on their belt after they "beat" the game in twelve hours.   Just one last comment on the growing number of people that adding helpful, proactive posts on the forums for this game.    It's easy to gripe about a game's flaws.  But it is a far far better thing to actively help the devs and the players for no other reason than to see the nebulous become concrete.\n\n","November 15, 2014","true","27.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

What game is even perfect anyways?\nAs of Build 0.77a, the mechanics are getting better.\n\nPROS\n-Flying is great and feels nice\n-New fire looks a ton better\n-Largeish open world to fly around in\n\nI won't put any cons in, but i do have some suggestions for the creator:\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n\n-Have the camera angle controlled by the mouse, like other 3rd person games (Thinking of Just Cause 2, Batman Arkham series) . Scrolling in and out should control zoom like how it is now, but having to press the scroll button to zoom and move the camera is annoying. ==OR== Have static camera like is now, but have player hold left alt to move camera (like DayZ).\n-The running speed should be a little quicker, but that's just a personal preference. Seems a little sluggish as of now.\n-Castles.\n-Caves in the mountain side that player can use as lair i.e. spawn point. Multiple throughout world? Have hoard of gold inside to show off to other players, stolen from castles. Maybe a princess or two.\n-Maybe a way that dragon can remain in air static, like just floating and not moving forwads or backwards.\n-Have a way to control the dragons head. Like say the player is flying and stops by a house. They hover in the air (holding space?) and then direct the head towards a building (holding L ctrl and moving the mouse) and shoots flames and burns down the house. villagers come and and the player could just move the mouse to move the dragons head to attack the villagers below them. (Controls given optional)\n-Minimap icons for enemies and wildlife should be smaller. They block the view from everything else and approximating distance at first was difficult.\n\nWith that said, it's a great game and every update keeps me excited for what's next. I know this game will be good once the developers give it the time and love it needs, as well as the community giving great feedback.

It's a shame, this game kind of blows right now since you can't do very much at all. But once again, it has potential and I most definitely support the title.\n\n\nAs to bash the negative reviews because it's angering to see what people are writing, here's a scenario to put what people are doing into perspective:\n\n\nLet's introduce "Team 1" - This team is trying to innovate upon ideas for a cleaning product. Team 1 has just announced and released a beta for their new product, "Grime Killer".\n\nNow we introduce "User 1" and "User 2" - User 1 is someone who isn't the sharpest knife in the box and doesn't read instruction manuals or any other helpful texts. User 2 is someone who does read the fine print or manual of a product, but simply does not care about it.\n\nTeam 1 has clearly written in the fine print, "WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS IN EARLY ACCESS. IT IS NOT COMPLETED AND WILL NOT REFLECT THE FINAL ATTRIBUTES OF THIS PRODUCT!" - However, User 1, being the dimwit he is, did not read the fine print. He comes along thinking that this is a full blown product that is already released into the wild for everybody to use. When he posts his review online, it is very short. Although it reflects what he saw, he gives the product one star because it did not work like other cleaning products that were already finished. His review is very short and unrelaible. Many people like User 1 will rate-up the review.\n\nShortly after, User 2 - already deterred by User 1's unreliable review - purchases the product anyway. He is aware that the cleaning product is not done. He sticks with it for a very long time because Team 1 states they are working on improving its performance, and User 2 is curious to see where it leads. Unfortunately, Team 1 has not been releasing new versions of the product all too often. Due to many deterrants (i.e. User 1's review and the fact that the product is not done), funding has not been very reliable for this product. At this point, User 2 decides that "This product sucks!" because they cannot feed his impatience or desire for frequent updates to the product.\n\n\nNow to bash the company with references to Portal (Valve)You guys are a lot like Aperture Science: You promise a LOT, but only live up to a fraction of what you promised. If you have ideas, keep them to yourself until you're sure you can get it done.","March 21","true","1.1"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

Yes "it's an alpha" but when you compare it to games like ARK: Survival Evolved, this game looks like it could be saved on (and played from) a floppy disk drive. The sound effects and music are very nice, clear and crisp sounding.\nBut it seems a little pointless optimising a game for 1080p, when it looks much more like it was made for Windows XP when more effort could be put into the controls is..beyond me. Graphic wise the models move very smoothly across the ground and don't fall through the map. Although, upon killing something it transforms into many opiace red blocks, whilst the running dragon looks more like it's "humping" the floor.\n\nBut, by far the WORST experience I had with this game was during flight (everything else can be overlooked in comparison). This game has MANY control issues, which (in my personal opinion) need to be addressed more than anything else. I literally had to exit the game after my dragon character took flight and began searching the land for some food as I was given VERY SEVERE MOTION SICKNESS whilst playing. I tried my very best to land my dragon in order to stop me from passing out, but in the end had to just exit out.\n\nTo those who are thinking "It's an alpha, what do you expect" this is true, the game IS in alpha development stage and I wanted to support it as best as I can because I simply ADORED the idea.\nAlthough simply using that IS NOT an excuse for health issues which have been CAUSED BY PLAYING and if you're* [*the "it's an alpha" crew] going to accept that, then I think a warning should at least be put on the thing.\n- - -\nI would really love to play this game after it gets more MAJOR updates.

I flew around for a short time and it was really easy to learn how to fly. I found some buildings but no humans to oppose me.\n\nThe animations are not pleasing, when you fly your wings move slowly and not really making me feel like I'm trying to fly.\n\nThe best way to get a reference in animation is to look at other products like the dragons in World of Warcraft. When they fly they make it very believable that it's hovering and flying.\n\nThe walking animation is fine but your back legs make you look like you just took a huge dump and you ran out of toilet paper. The wings when you walk look ridiculous, like you've broken them.\n\nMajor Issue: You are RIDICULOUSLY Tiny. You are SMALLER than the entrances to houses and it doesn't matter what type of dragon you start with, Young or Ancient are just as "big".\n\nThe Fire Breath is just one sprite that get shot out every tick. And if you fly and breathe fire then turn around away from it, you can end up with 1fps, and I am running on a high end gaming rig.\n\nAlso; You can fly under the map. My reaction when I figured this out was: No, that did not happen...\n\nAll in all they tried to make a game, but as we can see it's WAY too early to release it on steam early access.

This game runs a solid 5fps at maximum on the lowest possible graphics setting, making it impossible to actually play. There are so many cool features being talked about and so much great footage out there from this game, but it just isn't optimized enough to experience any of it firsthand.\n\nThe ideas behind this game are superb and considering the early state of development, I'm going to give it a recommendation purely on concept. But I want to make it very clear that buying this game is a long-term investment. Unless you have an incredibly powerful PC, this game is not currently playable.\n\nNow go forth and do what you do.\n\n***UPDATE 1/5/2016***\nThe game has gone through a considerable amount of updates since my last time playing and last review, and it has improved. However, this improvement is still not enough to render the game playable.\n\nIn my initial review, I discussed framerate and blamed my computer for it. Playing now, the framerate is considerably better even though the game has had a significant amount of content added. This tells me that it was not, in fact, my computer being lazy, but the poor optimization of the game.\n\nSound has been added, the camera is slightly less wonky, and it's actually possible to navigate menus now. But this is still FAR from a playable game. If you decide to buy this game, consider it a long term investment. This product should be considered no more than a tech demo in it's current state.","May 29, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

To launch such an early pre-alpha game to an already growing fan-base is a huge testament to the creator's visions of the future, however, technology always gets in the way of a perfect vision. I can say, being a games-dev student that the majority of the assets used thus far, are directly from the unity engine this uses. and anything else was imported into unity via 3ds Max or Maya.\n\nThe dragons themselves, are sorry to say, pretty ugly (especially the run and walk cycle) but function well enough that I have played the game, several times already, and I look forward to what the creative team of devs, has in store.\n\nThe bugs are holding this pre-alpha game back to it's bright future.\nI hope they get fixed soon.\nIf they develop the necessary rpg elements to this game, and add the leveling up system, whilst mantaining a good fan-base, then I can easily say that dragon is well worth a bit of money to see it made better.","November 15, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's obvious that this is still in it's earliest stages as it's little more than a framework for a game. Pretty much all that's available right now is basic movement and combat controls in a relatively small area. There is yet to even be a settings menu where you can tweak audio/video and map controls. But I am highly intrigued by the concept and am eager to see how the game's mechanics will e fleshed out in the future. If you purchase this in hopes of having a fulfilling play experience, you won't get thar right now. At this point, purchasing this game is an investement in what I believe will be a great game eventually.\n\nWould give this a solid 7/10.

First of all, the price is ridiculous, 18 dollars for a game that features floaty flying mechanics and low resolutions maps? IN ALPHA? It is an embarrassment on my part for paying for this game. The animations are goofy, the dragons themselves have so few polygons they look like something out of a PS1 game and they have the low resolution textures to match too. One of the features of the game is "destructible environments" where the destruction is limited to burning down some stuff like houses and trees to a crisp... in exactly the same way every single time. The fire graphics... oh my god... seriously, it's on the same level as Quake (the original one). "Towns" are basically agglomerations of houses sitting on the grass on some prairie or field. They don't look lived in by real people (as humans in these towns are more akin to ants than humans), they don't look like they function as towns and once you've done burning down every single building to the same texture of burnt wood there is no sense of achievement or satisfaction. Nothing you do in this game makes any difference, you might as well just do nothing at all.\n\nThe only thing that seems like it might be a good idea is the concept of flight as you get to flap your own wings at your choice, this means you can control flight much better than other games where there is no difference piloting a flying animal and a jet plane. However the execution of this concept is underwhelming, it doesn't help that the flying animations are just goofy looking and mechanical.\n\nAll in all, a very bad game and the developer excusing it calling out early access and alpha as some sort of excuse for the very poor quality this game has is an indication that this project will never see completion. The mechanics of the game are floaty and unappealing, the graphics are horrible, the textures are low resolution and just ugly, the effects for fire are amazingly bad (and this is a game where you'll be using fire as your main weapon mind you) and I say amazingly because there are free games out there that have better effects for fire. I don't believe this game will ever see completion and I do believe the developer is getting more money than he/she deserves by careful editing of his game's trailer.\n\nIf you pay 18 dollars for this game you're either a dumbass like I am or you're using your parent's credit card and you have no sense for value of money. There are 99 cent games for smartphones that have good graphics, solid gameplay and some even have campaigns with storylines. This game has none of those features. This game is the perfect example of how payed early access can backfire and why these kinds of games should not be allowed to exist by the people over at Steam.","November 2, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

A conscious choice to support and help fund the project, regardless of the potentially difficult road ahead. Early Access games are, obviously, games that are still in development. And every game that you happen to support will be in varying degrees of said development. It's inevitable that you may stumble upon something that is in it's fairly early stages.\n\nOthers have brought up the length of time the game has stayed in development. I can assure you there are games that have had more funding which have been in Early Access for longer than D:TG. Most independent dev groups are small. They do not have the funding or the man power to pump out content as much as we may be used to with other titles.\n\nI've owned the game for some time. The progress has been sparse, but it's beginning to pick up speed. The team has been able to acquire better funding and they are beginning to push for content that we would like to see. It's likely that in the near future their team will grow and they will be able to produce better quality content at a much faster pace.\n\nCurrently, I have to agree with some of the negative reviews. There's a lot of placeholder material, the control scheme is whack (very uncomfortable, but I believe they are aware of this), and there's not a lot to do. You run around, eat a few deer, and set some villages on fire. It's.. not entertaining. Controlling the dragon with the mouse is just strange. I really wish there was a better way to manage one's camera and flight mechanics.\nYet regardless of my distaste I have high hopes for the future.\n\nThe dev team seems passionate about this project. There's not many games out there like D:TG. It's kind of one of those titles we always wished for. But to make that happen we have to help support it. Constructive feedback is the most beneficial to all. Not some cheap jab at an obvious problem without offering any form of solution or critique. If we sit here and ♥♥♥♥♥ endlessly we're going to do nothing but doom the title ourselves, and then try to pass it off as the dev team's fault. It's a two way street with the commitment made with early access.\n\nThey plan a lot for this game.

It's a good start, but here are the first things I feel like are missing from playing the game for the first time:\n- Directional controls are a bit funky. When I try to walk backwards, that's what I expect. Not the weird twirl that my dragon does, facing me away from what I'm fighting.\n- Not sure who is losing health, me or the wolf. Perhaps putting the health numbers of the player in a different color?\n- There's no good sense of aiming. A crosshair or something similar would be extremely helpful.\n- Looking around is clumsy. When the mouse is in the center of the screen, the camera is not. This is a huge problem and could also help with the aiming issue.\n- Quest markers were really all over the place. It told me to go kill a deer and the marker was floating 100 feet over the ocean.\n- Lag. Obvious thing to fix.\n- Upgrading stats wasn't working. I could only update the passive skills at the bottom.\n- Movement speed is terrible. I know that you eventually level up speed, but the starting walking speed is absolutely horrendous, there's almost no point to walking, except that flying is the same. I feel like it takes a long time just to fly over to the next wolf that I should be walking towards.\n\nAfter a quick play, these are the issues that I noticed immediately. I'm sure that there's a lot to get done, but this game has a ton of potential. With work and passion, this could be a fantastic game.

It's a good start, but here are the first things I feel like are missing from playing the game for the first time:\n- Directional controls are a bit funky. When I try to walk backwards, that's what I expect. Not the weird twirl that my dragon does, facing me away from what I'm fighting.\n- Not sure who is losing health, me or the wolf. Perhaps putting the health numbers of the player in a different color?\n- There's no good sense of aiming. A crosshair or something similar would be extremely helpful.\n- Looking around is clumsy. When the mouse is in the center of the screen, the camera is not. This is a huge problem and could also help with the aiming issue.\n- Quest markers were really all over the place. It told me to go kill a deer and the marker was floating 100 feet over the ocean.\n- Lag. Obvious thing to fix.\n- Upgrading stats wasn't working. I could only update the passive skills at the bottom.\n- Movement speed is terrible. I know that you eventually level up speed, but the starting walking speed is absolutely horrendous, there's almost no point to walking, except that flying is the same. I feel like it takes a long time just to fly over to the next wolf that I should be walking towards.\n\nAfter a quick play, these are the issues that I noticed immediately. I'm sure that there's a lot to get done, but this game has a ton of potential. With work and passion, this could be a fantastic game.

Although I fought a bear and it just walked underground and I couldn't fly for a few minutes it's alright. The customization menu is very weak, I can't select any other dragons aside from green (says my dragon is green no matter what i chose), can't select any appearance modifiers like horns or anything, still can't select any traits. However, despite these issues, I can still color my dragon so it's alright. The gameplay is a bit od now I find myself constantly falling in flight after the recent flight update. Gravity was added and the flight modified to make it less "floaty" honestly I'd rather it be floaty than how it is now. Flying has never before been such a pain in the ♥♥♥♥. Mid-flight trying to hang a right will just turn you in place, left doing the same. Constantly falling so you have to keep tapping space at a moderate pace to stay in the air. I tried the fireball skill and it was very offput. You'd think a dragon could hit it's mark with thew force it take to fire one of those but no. A bear is about 30 feet away? not gonna hit. Too much of a "wind" effect. All in all, I'd tell you to wait longer for this game.\n\n**OLD**\nOverall nice concept, if a bit buggy. Lags a lot on my own computer, and I get an error for killing humans with flame breath among other things, and that craches my game. I would not recommend this because it still needs a LOT of work done and seems like it was sloppily made in an hour of two. I look forward to improvement but cannot encourage sales by the product thus far. I ended up buying two copies myself, one for a friend and the other for myself but it turned out to be a waste of my money and time.","December 1, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

As you first start, you come to the character selection, but the buttons to the start, play, and edit are all mostly under the screen, windowed or not. I had problems at first where i couldnt see my dragon because it was behind the two edit screens. to fix this, just restart the game or you can go to the start screen and come back.\nOnce you have created your dragon, (it has: age, race, colors, and the developers will eventually add all the little details, strengths, boosts,  etc. DONT FORGET TO CLICK SAVE DRAGON!!!) you click Play. once you are in your world it may be extremely laggy. If this happens, just restart the game and lower the graphics quality. you should be facing off of a cliff. to fly, you need to jump with spacebar, then let go and press and hold space again. controlling the dragon in flight is pretty complicated until you get used to it. Also, if you're flying and all of a sudden you're energy bar is dropping very quicky for no reason, it is because you are near the end of the map. Just fly back to the inner part of the map and you'll be fine.\n\nNow for hunting. You can find animals and people on the map, but since it's early access, theres barely anything. You can kill them by clawing, which sends your enemies into a massive cloud of blood, then seeing a bunch of stacked red, shiny bricks on the ground. hold E while oer them to eat. You can also breathe fire to kill and destroy things. When you kill something with fire, the meat is flaming.\n\nSome things to consider.\nIf you can deal with a couple bugs and a few problems, that's what's going to happen. BUT, do not doubt this game and think its a waste of money. keep it to yourself. You'll probably change your mind after the update, which is going to be massive as far as I can tell. Yes, this game is cool and for all the dragon RP lovers out there. I hope to see many people post positive reviews, because this game, even in early access, is really cool.\nThank you for this game. iv'e looked for this kind of game for years.\n- WinterTheDragon","March 21, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game has a lot that [i ]could [/i] happen, but not a lot that is. If honest work were to go into this game, it would become very good, but there is no effort. If you really want to know how bad it is at the current level, let me put it this way:\n\nI am in 10th grade and am learning c++ in computer science. I truly believe that if my entire class worked together with a little help from our teacher, we could recreate this game within under three month, working only 45 minutes on weekdays. I also believe we could upgrade that when we finish it with a bit of work and make this "game" into what people want it to be.\n\nI really,  really  don't want to shame this game.  I am a dragonkin, and I feel need to have something, anything at all, in which I can be a dragon or even a regular animal of some sort. This game was really dissapointing when it says that it gives me what I need, and then fails on it miserably.\n\nI really like this game's idea, and with what I've played it even could be good: bad/outdated graphics don't bother me nearly as much as they do some people. Even the broken physics and controls are sort of okay for me. The main qualm I have with it is the lack of content. There is absolutely no point. I've heard "rumors"  certainly not in the update notes  that you can get a cave, but I have found no such area, and the world itself seems so empty. There is no variety in the type of people, and there isn't even a leveling system: all dragons are the same.\n\nIf you want to play it, which you're actually wrong in thinking, I would suggest you find somewhere to pirate it because it's not worth giving the "developers" more money to do nothing.

The promise and prospect are so tantalizing (and need to be) You can ALMOST get over the game crashing every 5 minutes. The game in its current state (v8.4) finally has some content to keep you playing, even if it is a redundant "kill x of these quest system", which most often than not completing a quests will crash the game. Currently the only rewards for eating and questing are the abilities to grow in size (completley aesthetic?) and the ability to move faster. Starting out you get to customize you dragons body color and wing color (with more customization aspects promised in the future). The map is quite glitchy, floating rocks and landmarks. Some physics get a little weird, you might bump into a tree then go flying in a random direction at light speed.  I am definatly interested in seeing what this game becomes in the future, although updates are few and far between. This might be one that I'd wait a year before investing in.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/velikayarus/recommended/305960/","velikayarus","ВеликаяРусь","http://steamcommunity.com/id/velikayarus/","267 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSince this game was just released as a super early ♥♥♥ alpha recently, it's not completed (obviously). There's not much to do and not much to see. It's a starting point and the devs are pretty keen on working on stuff (and did some pretty immediate bug fixes so that's a pretty good sign). Here's the preliminary barebones review, to be updated as the game does.\n\nUPDATED - NOVEMBER 12TH, 2014\n\nNotes: It's really hard to actually split some of these things into pros and cons at this stage of development because everything, depending on what you value or how 'done' it is could go in either category. Until the game is further along, I'll keep the various points in a numbered list here, irrespective of pro or con.\n\nONTO THE THINGS--\n\n1. Lots of potential.\n\nYou're in a sandbox world as a dragon and theoretically, you get to help shape the landscape (metaphorically). Hopefully before too long we'll be able to interact with humans, have enemies, etc. At the moment, as of the latest hotfix, there is a lot more life to the map. Humans (some that attack you with spears), cows, deer, trolls, move houses, lots of trees-- It's not much yet, but it's getting there, especially compared to what it was on release day.\n\n2. Graphics aren't half bad though not spectacular. A little dated at the moment.\n\nThey'll probably get better and could use some optimization work (but so could the whole system and that typically comes with time). There are still some problems with screen resolutions and rendering, but killing something no longer causes the Peasant of Doom glitch (I.E. killing a peasant would cause them to erupt with red blood gibs that formed an FPS-murdering column to the point where you ought to restart your game and think about what you how murdering peasants is apparently bad). Also the status bars and some of the buttons (like the map selection button that looks a bit like a loading screen) could use some polish.\n\n3. Dragons are customizable and can age.\n\nWhile that's not fully implemented yet, it's on the way, bro. There is some current customization and stats (but they don't seem to have much effect at the moment). At the moment, customization is limited to changing colors, but entire different species of dragon and adaptations are planned.\n\n4. Linux and Mac versions.\n\nThey were released pretty quickly along with the recent hotfix. There seems to have been some issues with getting the Linux version to play straight from Steam for some users, but the devs posted a workaround for it in the meantime while they fix up their Linux upload.\n\n5. Very active and respectable developers.\n\nThey've been very active in the forums, very polite in how they handle criticism and feedback of all sorts, and have shown zero leaning towards any sort of censorship. They're chill with anyone wanting to review or add suggestions or doing letsplays. They're also working on cataloguing known bugs to quash as they can while working on implementing new mechanics. So far, they've been very on top of things and have been amicable. They are some of the best behaved Early Access developers I've ever run across.\n\n6. Unity engine.\n\nNot really a con unto itself so much as Unity can be a buggy pain but it can also do some cool stuff. There are people that really don't like the Unity engine. That's entirely fair. However, it can be done well. In the meantime, it's going to be its own pain in the ♥♥♥ while the devs work to tame it. It also just doesn't seem to like some computers which can be a real off-putter to some gamers.\n\n7. Nothing much at the moment to do.\n\nYou can fly around (the mechanics of that were improved with the recent hotfix, but it can still be a bit wonky-- I'm bad at it and faceplant into the ground a lot). You can light things on fire, especially now that there's a lot more to burn: several villages from small to large (though some are unpopulated), a small amount of people (women with spears and screaming men), trees, and apparently trolls. You can also eat the gibs that drop to help you grow. Unfortunately, there's nothing more than that yet. That and the growth mechanic isn't exactly implemented yet either and it needs a lot of tweaking.\n\n8. The tutorial is virtually non-existent.\n\nA tutorial itself hasn't really been implemented but some helpful hints when you start a world are shown on the screen. Unfortunately, due to earlier mentioned resolution problems. There is a list of current controls pinned in the Steam forums, but that's another temporary workaround until things can be more solidly implemented.\n\n9. No save/load feature.\n\nWhen you start a world, you always start fresh. You cannot save and you cannot load. This is only temporary, but at the moment, there isn't much you'd want to save anyway. Your dragon's stats at the moment are carried over through the playthroughs anyway. Just every time you start the game, you basically refresh the map so you can burn the same villages over and over again.\n\n10. Pricy, somewhat.\n\nFor the level of early access that it is, it's a bit high, but they made no pretense about how much it would be when they posted their pricing model in the forums here on Steam. However, in the long run and for being a part of the development process, that's not so bad. It just depends on what's worth it more to you, the customer, to pay now to be part of the development process or to pay later (at a possibly higher cost) when the game is more complete or entirely complete. The developers have stated that they are encouraging people who aren't sure or who have been burned by Early Access debaucles before to please wait to purchase until their trust can be earned.","November 7, 2014","true","2.5"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","2"

If you're looking for a game to play for hours and hours, this is not it.\nThere's barely anything to do at the time being, apart from flying, igniting stuff and eat the occasional mammal. No Quests, nothing to craft or to claim as loot for your lair so far.\n\nYet, this looks great!\n\nTaking off and landing works really great and easy already, the controls are very intuitive, (although a little buggy still).\nThe graphics look overall nice and shiny, and the engine runs stable as far as I can tell, didn't encounter a crash or major glitch so far.\nThe camera allows for 'dragon barely visible'  to almost first person distance and can be turned 360°, you can adore your dragon from every possible angle and distance.\nThe concept and idea is brilliant and support-worthy.\nFlying above the land is really fun already, the speed to map size ratio is nice and you feel like you really own the land when dashing over it.\nI hope they'll include mating in some form though :3\n\nIn this stage, I can only rate it  Dragon/10.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that's almost finished, you'll be disappointed in this, but, if you want to support and be part of what looks awesome... join!","November 18, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

That said, I think I can firmly say that this game should not have been released into early access at this point in time as there is no central idea to build upon. Not only that, but there aren't any mechanics either. Flight is as about as smooth and simple as dancing the can-can with a pitchfork shoved firmly up your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the graphics are about as appealing as the head of medusa if the snakes on her head suffered from projectile vomit, and I have to be incredibly careful where I fly lest I fly out of the flat world, where I ended up spending more than half of my time despite being more cautious than my mother on my first day of school. The "goblins" and "people" might as well have been dots on the screen, and the quite sparsely spread excuses for structures might have fallen over if I farted in the wrong direction- I'm not quite sure what I did, they were always falling over anyways. I can say, however, that the rest of the game was a blissful journey through neverland without feeling a sense of guilt that would have made hitler feel like a goody-two shoes, simply because there was no rest of the game. Perhaps with three more years of work it won't make Tōru Iwatani feel like his Pac-Man game was ages ahead of it's time. I don't think I've ever given up on a game as quickly as I gave up on this one for fear of losing my precious time that I might have spent better playing some other game.","April 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Because it's not fun, it's a great idea and I think it will turn out great and that is why you should definately follow the game if you are unsure about it and see how it improves but for now stay away. I give it a fair 4/10 not because I think the game will turn out completely awful but because the game currently is awful but it's early access so obviously when the game is released it will be a considerable amount better.\n\n---YouTube Video---\nComing Soon","November 8, 2014","false","0.5"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","0"

This said, it's not all that bad to buy, to keep up support for it.  If anyone has seen the forums it has for the game, you can see, it has a lot of positive things that are more than likely going to be added to it.  IF YOU SO CHOSE to buy this game, take note, that right now, it does not have a lot of features you can play with.  The Humans are barely established, the other monsters are pretty rare seen, and the terrain is actually pretty low-key as of this moment.  With the cons out of the way, do keep in mind, it's still a developing game.  You can get on their forums and type away on the things you want added, and more than likely so, they will be as long as it pertains reasonably to the game in question.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatcommander/recommended/305960/","thegreatcommander","Necrodusk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatcommander/","207 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATED: 14 November 2014\n\nFirst off, let me say that this game is in VERY Early Access. All you can really do at this time is fly around and flame some stuff, so if you're looking for a finished game, don't get this just yet. However, this game has a lot of potential, and at this point in time, looks very promising. How it goes from here depends on where the dev takes it, though they seem to genuinely enjoy doing this, so I have high hopes for how it comes out.\n\nI'll edit this as more content is released and the game is updated.\n\nNow, there are currently a number of bugs that are with the game (to be expected from early access) including:\n\n~The Exit button does not work (EDIT: The Exit button only seems to break if you delete a dragon)\n~If you delete a dragon after creating it, it will no longer let you choose/create new dragons, and you are stuck with the dragon you deleted. (EDIT: Completely deleting the "Dragon" folder in steam => steamapps => common folder on your C: drive (or wherever Steam installs itself to) and reinstalling the game seems to fix this).\n~After deleting the dragons and restarting the game, the "New World" is shaded out, until I tried to exit the game (which failed because the button was broken) and went back to the menu, where the New World option was available again, even though forcing me to play as the dragon I deleted.\n~There is also a case of extreme lag, especially when flaming people. (EDIT: It has been fixed, since now it isn't and endless fountain of food, but it still lags at least my game, even though it doesn't crash the game like it used to.)\n~An issue with the mouse staying inside of the window when in windowed mode\n~The camera runs a little high, especially when you land, and seems to get stuck on whatever position it had to go to when you landed.\n~Resolution problems, where changing the resolution affects the menus (at least in Windowed mode, not sure about fullscreen), making it difficult to navigate them because they do not size down with the res, or they compress to fit into the window without changing size, thus overlapping each other.\n~RPG elements are minimal, killing humans and "eating" the blocks they dropped increases your experience bar, even though I haven't found enough humans to get to the level up screen just yet.\n~Customization is minimal down to changing your dragon's color.\n~Perhaps moving the dragon closer to the screen when customizing so you can see them better, as well as enabling a sort of free look so as to be able to clearly see every part of the dragon you're customizing\n~A lot of very bad lag, don't know if it's my computer. But the moment the game starts to the monent it closes there is lag.\n\nGlitches aside, and despite its current minimal state as I'm playing it (14 Novemeber 2014 --- 7 Days after release) this game looks very promising and genuinely fun. I'm looking forward to where the devs take this.","November 8, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Overall, in this state, from a company who has no other games published save this early alpha, I'd reccomend caution. You never know whether or not this could turn into an amazing game, or if the developer could just pump out mediocracy and walk off with bags of cash.\n\nTherefore, in this current state, I have to say that it would likely be wise to save your money instead of getting this, at least for the time being.","November 8, 2014","false","3.6"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","13","31","0","0"

I will say that it's glitch ridden but, that's a given. Alsoc if you accidently delete a dragon, you can no longer open the dragon menu OR exit the game..so yeah that must be patched when needed. There is a lot that needs fixing and tweaking but by the patch date (Nov. 14th) the kinks should be taken care of. I wanted to try something new to wander away from the Gmods and the Amnesias and looked through the MMO lists and just notised this. This title is more for people who participate in beta testing and my only experience was burning a dude and watch him rocket into space leaving a pillar of lag-enducing block-blood. Afterwards I wanted to tinker with the Creation system (Which needs to be able to zoom on your dragon btw) and i accidently deleted my dragon causing a bug that prevented me from opening the creation menus or even exit the game.

I am less than serious much of the time, and usually provide little reason as to why I enjoy or not enjoy a game. So yeah, take that and do with it what you will.\n\nWhile I haven't really played an hour yet, I think I can say I've seen all there is to see at the time period I am writing this in.\n\nFirst off, I made a dragon named Rek'tuum.\nSurprising lack of Elder Scrolls dragons, I assume that's only because not many Dovahkiin have joined the ranks of the dragons yet.\n\nWhile I do have great FPS on fullscreen maximum graphics, the game will crash at random times. Perhaps because I was a server owner (as it had not done so in singleplayer) or maybe it's just a multiplayer thing, I am unaware. Also, there are several bugs and/or glitches that I have noticed that probably everyone else has noticed but I will not refrain from bringing to light (possibly, bringing them to light again.) The main glitch I see is how flying at extreme angles causes the player-dragon to either land at that angle, land at the angle while ricocheting away, or land at another even more extreme angle. Not gamebreaking unless you start getting turned sideways, at which point flying is nigh-impossible without some adjustments. More problems occur in multiplayer, though they may be client-side and my computer is just hallucinating, including other player-dragons floating in midair and walking in place beside one another, or player-dragons not floating in midair and walking in place beside one another. Furthermore, when typing large sentences or multiple sentences in chat, instead of simply continuing on the second or third (or forth or five etc.) line, the box will start removing the beginning of the text being typed. Also, saying nothing still flashes your name on the chatbar, which is a little awkward.\n\nStill, while the paragraph explaining those few glbugitches is quite large, the effect they have on the player player-dragon is not particularly gamebreaking. I'd definitely recommend it, perhaps even more in the future when bugs are squashed, glitches are exploited for humor rather than menace, and new features are added.\n\nDo want.","November 9, 2014","true","2.1"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","6","22","0","0"

Any dragon lover should support this game if only to show the development team your support so they make the best game possible. I showed my roommate the stat page and creation choices and he left the room rubbing his hands together muttering to himself "I must tell Will about this game." My one suggestion is that in character creation i seemed to be stuck veiwing my dragon from behind and thus found the fact i could customize my dragons head rather meaningless or at least i didnt have any visual representaion of my choices i just had to hope for the best.  if you ever add a feature to spin your dragon and see a 3d representation i will be wholely satisfied but for now i will be glad with more things to slay and destroy.","November 10, 2014","true","1.7"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","8","27","0","0"

It wouldn't be much of a problem if when typing and pressing space TWICE before your dragon lands the first time it causes it to jump off and fly off of whatever you may be perched on. If you're flying, then it's not a big deal.\n\n-There is NO SOUND. You're probably working on that, I'm just saying I love dragons and especially their sounds, so whenever you could get that inw ould be great.\n\n\n\nLIKES:\n\n\n-For an early access game, I really appreciate what you have so far, it's fantastic.\n\n-Love the online mode, not many people, but it's fun to fly aroudn with them when there are a few. It's very simple to set up a room and host it.\n\n-Dragon's flying animation is very nice.\n\n\nIDEAS:\n\n\n-Maybe center the dragon more in the middle of the camera?\n\n-Perhaps make the dragon larger? I think that would make it a bit nicer, especially since you get to choose different ages, so the sizes depends on the age, but I've done both YOUNG DRAKE and ANCIENT, and there is no size difference that I can see.","November 9, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","3","17","0","0"

What exists of the land and textures looks really good, and there is already a nice variety of animated mob types with in the beta (humans, animals and different monsters). The new dragon model looks and moves fantastic- I could absolutely imagine this creature creeping down a rocky crag or lurking in a fen.  Given that we already have the framework for both single- and multi-player games, a bit of diversification of dragon types/abilities, and a fair bit of world-building on the dev's site, this game could truly be built up into something awesome.","April 6, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

And somehow you finds some pointless of this game. etc. But I don't care very much.\n\nPersonally, I like the dragons.\nThis game looks like an inspiration of "I of The Dragon" development since 2004, I like that game also. That you flys over the landscape, and killing the monsters.\n\nHowever, I'm still looking forward for this game until to final game.

Nothing had changed.\n\nI tried to fly around but i couldn't turn at the right time and it was so laggy that i couldn't undestand where i was turning.\n\nThe only enemies I found were: two women, a bear, a moose or something like that (can't remember the name right now)...well, the ladies died like instantly and they just ran towards me and stopped right in front of me ready to be barbecued, but the other two...they we're like satan was disguised as an animal, they just didn't move, well the moose thing did jump but never moved away, it just jumped around. I tried to kill them with fire, no damage or they didn't feel the power of my flame or something...tried to claw them, and a strange red aura went around them and disappeard living the animal still alive waiting for more pain...\n\nI have made some screenshots, so maybe check them out.\n\nAs a final conclusion I'd say: Buy the game, try to play it, get distressed after 20 min, hope for improvement cause the idea is there, even if the graphics aren't that good, the idea is there (grow your dragon, get stronger, explore, save mankind or destroy it) but the ideas aren't quite in the game yet.\nSo buy it and wait for the release, hoping that they won't destroy everything.\n\nBye,\nVetens","January 7, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Lots of bugs of course, as is with every game in progress. I've noticed that, when landed and turning the camera, the dragon spins as if on a plate, rather than on the actual ground. So one direction you're looking into the sky, another direction you're head-first in the ground. Another thing is the flight mechanics feel a bit off. I will be straight yet the dragon will be turning as if i weren't. And a tip I'd add is to possibly make it so that the dragon's direction is governed by the mouse? Like it will look where the mouse is 'pointing'. It's difficult to get around without being able to direct yourself.","May 15, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
