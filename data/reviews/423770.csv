But not sure how open ended the game is.\nIt hasn't hinted at any kind of an ending as of yet, but I'm hoping it's playable for as long as you wish to play.\n\nThe progression curve comes in through processing food/goods.\nFor example, trying to keep things relatively spoiler free here (just early stuff.)\nYou can buy strawberry seeds for a certain price, plant and grow them for several in-game days;\nthen you could sell them for a small profit.\nOr you can invest in a 'Crushing Machine' which crushes the strawberries into Jam, and sell the Jam for a greater profit.\nThis is just a small example.\n\nThere is also good detail in the livestock system.\nFor example, at the start, you can buy up to three chickens. (your Coop can be upgraded to hold more when you have a combination of materials to build it, and money to pay the builder)\nYou then need to buy Feed to keep your chickens fed. But when you first buy your chickens they start as baby chicks :)\nOnce they grow, if you visit the chickens every day and keep their feed stocked, they will gain happiness, and more happiness equals eggs to be harvested.\n\nThere are just so many cool things in the game.\nAnother example is there's a broken Windmill on your farm, and if you can figure out how to repair it you can grind various things there; one being corn into Feed. So you can produce your own Feed instead of buying it from the store.\n\nAlso everyone in the town seems to have their own story, more or less, and they have their daily schedules.\nOne downside, and can be a little jarring at first, is whenever their schedule changes they vanish in thin air, and appear at their new destination.\nBut I'm sure it's due to restrictions in the Engine and I at least, am willing to let go of such a small issue.\nBecause it's pretty neat to see the schedules of the townspeoples lives; some might go out for lunch, to read  out on a bench, while others work through it. One girl works many jobs so you'll see her at pretty much every location in and around town.\n\nI've played a few hours now, as of writing this, and there are very few negatives so far.\nOne is there's slight framerate hiccuping, inherent to the RPG Maker Engine, but for me so far it's been quite mild,\nand only around certain 'busy' locations, like your own farm. (busy as in script/engine busy; planting locations etc)\n\nSecondly, there doesn't seem to be any sort of Seasons or Weather, which are usually present in these games, and would have added a very nice touch.\n\nBut due to the strengths of the game, and it's 'fun' quality, I still highly recommend checking it out.\nAnd at $5 or so, depending on your regional equivalent; it's honestly a steal.\n\nSorry if I was rambling on a little, was trying to find a good way to describe the game without going into too much detail, or too little. Hopefully this gives you somewhat of an idea, even though I didn't touch on things like Marriage (which I've yet to experience), expanding your House, upgrading Tools, doing mini quests finding special items around the land, etc.\n\nRecommend from me, despite being an RPG Maker game.","December 4, 2015","true","9.2"," 89 of 102 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","89","102","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/423770/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","A pretty decent homage to Harvest Moon and the closest thing to a true Harvest Moon type game I have seen on Steam so far. (EDIT: This review was posted before Stardew Valley existed which, if I'm being totally honest, is 10,000 better than this game and you should buy that game first.) If you've played the Harvest Moon games, you more or less know what to expect since there are a lot of similarities, but there are some very signicant differences that Harvest Moon enthusiasts will want to prepare themselves for going in:\n\nSome of the major differences include a total lack of seasons, months, or days of the week. It is a land of infinite summer, where each successive day is just one more day. In some ways this is disappointing, since the changing months and seasons of Harvest Moon tend to keep the world feeling fresh for longer, but in other ways it's sort of liberating, since---for example---you don't have to worry about how soon the season change is coming in regard to planting/harvesting. You just plant and harvest without any concern for losing the crops.\n\nOur Love Will Grow is very liberating in other ways as well. In Havest Moon you have limited inventory space, but in this game you have infinite pockets, so you don't have to worry about the size of your backpack or upgrading your shelf space. You are a walking Mary Poppins bag, so pick up as many things as you want! Another thing that's liberating compared to Harvest Moon is that you don't have to tediously select which tool to use, running the risk of swinging your pickaxe at your horse because you forgot to select the brush or whatever. Instead, you just stand in front of the animal or thing you need to maintain and press the interact button. The proper tool/action will be auto-selected. In the event that there is a sequence of things that need to be done, the game will auto-sequence as well. For example, if you stand in front of a patch of dirt and tap A, the game will automatically till it using the hoe, plant using a seed, then water using the watering can. And all you had to do was tap "interact"! It's so nice to not have to fiddle with tool selection so much.\n\nThere is one huge difference with planting/harvesting that I *hated* about this game at first, but in the larger scheme of things I am now kinda on the fence about. In Havest Moon, you have a huge field that is a grid of squares. You can pretty much plant anything on any square in that huge grid. But in Our Love Will Grow, you have a huge field that just has a few squares on it that are specificallly for planting, but you can't use the rest of the field. It's more like farming out of planters than out of the ground. This feels REALLY annoying and arbitrary at first if you are used to Havest Moon, but the longer I played it, the longer I realized that this is also sort of liberating in a way. Whenever I play Harvest Moon games, I have SO many squares on which to plant/harvest, that I get intensely focused on farming and can't bring myself to waste precious hours of my day running around town and doing other things. But since Our Love Will Grow puts a hard limit on how much you can plant (especially in the early game), it really forces you to do more exploring and gathering instead of being an anti-social bean farmer all friggin' day. And hey, maybe that's not so bad.\n\nSpeaking of exploring, there is definitely more nature to explore in Our Love Will Grow than in the typical Harvest Moon game. It's not the size of a Zelda overworld or anything, but whereas Harvest Moon typically has only 2 or 3 screens that are not town or farm, Our Love Will Grow has two or three times that amount. So it's good that you have more time to get out there and explore. And you'll want to get to know the lay of the land, since---perhaps on a more negative note---the game does not provide you with a map of any kind.\n\nThere are parties and town events just like in Harvets Moon but thankfully you aren't forced to participate in any half-baked and janky mini-games like in Harvest Moon. You show up, interact with the towns people, there is a judged contest of some kind involving no mini-games, and then you all go home. Nice.\n\nYes, there is the usual wooing of girls to take as a wife. Sorry, female players, but there is unfortunately (and perhaps unsurprisingly) no option to play as a girl who woos boys instead.\n\nThere are only two significant criticisms of this game for me:\n\n1) Collision checks are huge and bizarre. There are huge collision rectangles around everything and--even worse--there are invisible collision walls drawn in some places where you wouldn't expect them (e.g. you can't walk around the sides of your house, even though it looks like you obviously can). This is definitely not ideal, but it doesn't take long to adjust yourself to it. There are occasional collision errors where you will be seemingly blocked by an invisible wall that was never there before and which disappears if you leave an come back. For example, I once found that I couldn't walk up the path to the mayor's house because something invisible was blocking the whole path. I had to exit the screen and come back. This has happened more than once, in different areas, but is not common. (I expect is has to do with an error in how NPCs teleport around during the day.)\n\n2) Poor energy economy. Just like in Harvest Moon, performing actions costs energy. In this game you get an actual energy meter, so your energy is much more quantified than in Harvest Moon, which is good. But what's bad is that Our Love Will Grow docks you energy for a lot of things Harvest Moon doesn't. For example, picking up a mushroom off the ground in the woods costs nothing in Harvest Moon but costs energy in OLWG. Therefore, you run out of energy very quickly in this game. To make matters worse, there is no good way to recover your energy. In harvest moon, you can take a dip in the hot springs or eat some food that you prepared. But in this game, the only way to get any energy back is to buy yourself a snack at the tavern, which costs 100G (in addition to the time expense it takes to walk all the way back to the tavern), and the amount of energy you get for the expense is not really worth it. As a result, the only thing you can really do when your energy runs out is to just call it a day. (And since there are no seasons to worry about, there is no real harm in blowing off a day like this.) This leads to the absolutely ridiculous situations (but which you'll get used to) where you will sometimes wake up at 6am and end up using all your energy and going back to bed by 10am. Such a thing is unthinkable in Harvest Moon, but it will happen regularly in OLWG.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game pales in comparison to an actual Harvest Moon game. It's a much more simplified Harvest Moon, which in some ways is good and in some ways not so good. But if you like Harvest Moon, I might recommend this game just for the experience of a game that is MOSTLY like Harvest Moon, but is much different in terms of how the economy and pacing work.\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.","January 10","true","6.4"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","40","47","2","0"

You'll get better game play, more interesting characters/story and a more rewarding experience.\nHowever, if you want a simpler, bare bones Harvest Moon-esque experience, I'd reccomend this game.  It pretty much IS Harvest Moon, only much less in depth and with faster progression. It's fine, it's just nothing special and at times feels a bit hollow.\n\nPros:Fast progression, it's easy to accomplish a lot in just a few hours of game play.\nA decently vast world that adds a bit of exploration  to the gameCons:While the bachelorettes each have a few character traits to make them each unique, there is no way to build relationships with the other NPCs. The bacheloretes frequently have moments that completely kill any charm they had and suck the fun out of courting them. It's also hard to tell when they actually like a gift or not, since there are no facial expressions and their dialogue can be very odd and unclear. "This is nice. Thanks." could be taken as earnest, or forced and polite, or sarcastic or passive aggressive. "WOW! I love you ten percent more now!" Awesome, I'm not only dating a robot, I'm dating a very shallow robot.\nThere are lots of little things about the game, from the map layout to the menu interface (particularly the inventory system) that are inconveinient and frankly tested my patience. It's the sort of thing where the game isn't taking more time to complete because of a challenge, but because the inventory system is a pain in the ♥♥♥.\nA lot of aspects of the game become completely pointless further down the road because you'll run out of things to buy and you're just killing time until you can win the love of your chosen lady, marry her and "win."","March 9","false","25.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","1"

And I mean hours, at at time... Lovely!\n\nThings to note: The game displays in a small window, which can be made to a slightly large wondow, but not full screen. It is keyboard controls only, rather than keyboard and mouse, which took a bit of getting used to (though console controllers are an option). There also appears to be no way to save during a day, so you just have to keep playing! These are all minor things though and just things to be aware of rather than discourage you from purchasing.","December 23, 2015","true","64.6"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","4"

The controls are clunkier, the fact that certain things require tools to get and it's automatic instead of organic in nature is a bit annoying.\n\nIt's an okay game for something made in RPG Maker (yeah, I know the engines quite well having used them for the last, oh, 15+ years) but it was always going to be clunkier than anything made in a more versatile engine. I mean, you could actually make something more like Stardew Valley using RPG Maker but that would require a lot more effort than just making everything automatic based instead.\n\nI'm not sure I like this game much, sorry, but eh, I've played a lot worse.

Sure, it's another farm-simulator with an emphasis on social interaction and with SNES-like graphics, but to me its scope is far less ambitious. It knows that it can't compete with the sheer openness and freedom of bigger games, so instead it allows you to focus your efforts in a more streamlined manner. Personally, I prefer this sense of direction the game gives me, as I often get way too distracted in more expansive games.\nSo if you're looking for a more directed and focussed game, but want something in the STYLE of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, this is a game that you might like.","June 4","true","28.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After they create their character (which has absolutely no customization whatsoever). they're thrown RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of the town. The opening cutscene is OK, nothing flashy or fancy or even interesting here. After the cutscene (which lasts all but a minute), you're thrown right into town. One lady greets you "Oh, welcome, the other owners left in a hurry. Good luck" And that's it.  She gives you a starter pack consisting of three tools (sickle, hoe, and watering can) and three seeds (Strawberry). There is no map, or atleast one I've found, so the first day is a struggle trying to find everything (the map is huge and consists of several areas of forests and a beach). The first person I talked to said "I'm bored." Not "Welcome to the town!" or "How are you doing?" just "I'm Bored". Really? I'm bored of this game already.\n\nSome of shops and buildings open at certain times. If an NPC is supposed to be somewhere they don't make their way to the building, THEY ♥♥♥♥ING PHASE OUT OF EXISTENCE. Either a bug, glitch, or intentional but either way, it's awful. Most of the townspeople lack personalities. Seriously, it's like a Generic Town simulator. I found a few cocky NPCs but their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitudes made me not want to talk to them ever again.\n\nFarming was way too simple. Press the button to hoe, to plant, and to water. There's no switching between tools so I guess that's useful for lazy people.\n\nThe day seemed to drag on, painfully. Literally, running around the whole damn town talking to everyone and visiting buildings took till 7pm.\n\nPros\n+Farming is easy (no switching between tools, just pressing the button will automatically use the reccomended tool)\n+Huge town to explore\n+Item customization\n\nCons\n-Dull scenery\n-NPCs are very generic and lackluster\n-No map\n-Doesn't feel like a true farming sim\n\nMaybe I didn't give this game much of a chance. But I'm all about first impressions, and my first impression of this  is "a cheap ♥♥♥ Harvest Moon knock off".","May 2","false","0.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"

Overall so far it is pretty good, I would add running into the game and the choice of being female. The buttons are a bit annoying sometimes and multiple times now I have accidentally quit the game. The game would also be better if it informed you more about what buttons do what, as I had to figure out that 'X' brings up your menu. Lastly I would like a save function, as the game autosaves everytime you sleep, but if i want to stop playing the game in the middle of a cave I lose all that progress. Which I found out the hard way because the game does not tell you it autosaves when you goes to bed and only when you go to bed (or maybe there is some way to and I just have not found it out?).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Philtering/recommended/423770/","Philtering","Philtering","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Philtering/","181 products in account","Got it from a "hidden gems" bundle and thats what it is, a very dirty gem in the rough. It's a VERY light harvest moon clone. There's not a lot to do compared to harvest moon but it offers just enough content for me to pour 20 hours into marrying a girl and settling down... and that's it. There was a decent sense of progression and reward for me to keep playing which kept me going until my wedding day but after that I stopped dead. Those looking for a quality harvest moon game should look elsewhere. If however you're willing to throw away a couple of bucks for a more smaller version might want to consider you checking this game out.\n\nAs you may guess from the title, the game is about you trying to get love by farming. If only it was this easy... and that's basically the whole story. (the story setup is that you broke up with your ex and now you're going to find love in the farmland.) There are events and npc dialogue but apart from that there isn't a driving plot.\n\nOur love will grow boils down to time management. You grow crops, sell them, and upgrade tools to make more money.  You raise animals to help your profit as well. You also use your crops and animal products to cook or make gifts and give them to girls and win them over. Fishing and mining also tie into the game in similar ways as well. There is a lack of customization as your farm is already laid out and you cannot place stuff where you want. The overall game mechanics is average and a bit dull at some stages especially the late game where you need to continually fish for rare pearls which you need gain access to a boat which allows you to get materials required for your wedding. The game had a clear sense of progression however and the reward is getting closer to be MARRIED to a beautiful pixel girl which allowed me to continue. I have to admit that if it wasn't for that, I would have stopped sooner.\n\nThe girls as well as the townfolk have little dialogue. However there was just enough dialogue that you get a sense of what type of girl she is and allows you to choose a girl. There is little interaction other than gift giving but it's nice to be praised for knowing my girl likes pizza. Gift giving is guess and check, with some items liked and some hated. The other npc's aren't as interesting as the girls and offer little to the overall game.\n\nThere are several bugs and design flaws that take a way from the experience. Such as putting a quit option in the menu without a confirm to quit which makes for easy accidental exit. You also lose your extra ore when smelting if you do not have enough to make the next bar of gold/iron etc. The overworld music isn't good either and I turned it off most of the time.\n\nThey only thing that got me through this game was getting married and the payoff was minimal. Although you can keep playing, there are little things that can happen after that. You no longer get events so you're basically just playing to hoard money. Overall I give it a 3/5. It offers a structured progression and reward but lacks in getting a lot of "fun" out of it. The waifu's are a plus though because they're pretty cute. For $5 though, it's a good deal. If you have the money though, stardew valley is a better investment as a $15 game.","March 29","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No clue where that lies on the progression scale though. This game isn't great, but it's not bad. It's surprisingly glitchy for a final release. There are a few that are game-breakingly bad.\n\nIf you play with the dog then give up and go find the ball as your character, YOU TURN INTO THE DAMNED DOG. You can't interact with anything, and there's no way to turn back into the player character other than closing the game. Even if you try to load your save you can't interact with the 'save bucket' or whatever it is.\n\nSpeaking of reloading saves, everytime you relead, your chickens have layed less eggs. Not sure why, as everything else seems to be consistant.\n\nLast major glitch, DO NOT walk behind the fences as you are switching map screens. You will get stuck and have to reload.\n\nThe controls are clunky but not attrocious, I play with my Xbox wired controller and the only problem I found is that it needs to be plugged in before I open the game or it doesn't register.\n\nAll in all its a decent time waster, I'll give the sequel a go and pray to the farm gods that it's more polished than this one.","May 4","true","13.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
