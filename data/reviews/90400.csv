The setting, the investigators, the impeccable slightly over the top British narrator and the characters straight out of any Agatha Christie mystery (if slightly exaggerated) make this a pleasure to watch: this game has got it pinned down perfectly. Sure, you'll be solving casual puzzles (you can pass the controller around round-robin fashion for up to 4 players, the rest'll just have to spectate), but it's the Britishness, the Whodunit-ness, the mayor, the constable, the butcher, the librarian, the doctor, the miller, Lady Snobbish, the gossipy old ladies, the colonel and everyone else who bring this home.\n\nIn short, the game is 6 episodes of ~45 minutes each (that somehow add up to 6.9 hours on the account we played it on, but presumably that includes getting everyone settled on the couch etc.). If the trailer appeals to you, the game delivers exactly that in spades, at a bargain price.","August 8, 2015","true","0.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It is a puzzle game with various puzzles and you could put it to the genre of casual games. The episodes of this game are quite well and eloquently narrated. The narrator really gives the impression of how some stories should be told. Little Riddle is literally riddled with people who use the pastoral and tranquill landscap for their own ... well, you could guess it. You have to solve some murders at hand, so I don't see a need to gloat over the hidden darkness in some quaint (in positive sense) village.\n\nThis game is aimed for younger audiences, up to young adolescents... Still it won't hurt you if you play the game at an older stage of life, though. In fact, it is so funny, so full of witty sideways and unexpected turns, that you might grin and play on. The graphical artwork shines at some scenes so incredibly, that I have to say it is very well designed for an casual game.\n\nIt's so full of humor, that some games of this genre lack bitterly I have to recomend the game alone on this virtue, plus the price/value ratio is quite good, you won't find so much fun for such a low price elsewhere. The characters and jokes are really good, can sometimes catch you off guard ... and take you to a merry roll around in one of the cutest villages you'll ever find in a murder mystery.\n\nThumbs Up for this game!","April 5, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game is cut into nice litle chapters, each taking probably an hour to complete, depending on how many players you have, and how good you are at the challenges.\nThe puzzles range from fairly easy, to downright nasty, and you may find yourself stuck a few times. The voice over that narrates the story was brilliant, and very entertaining, the voice acting was likewise very good. Each character in this story has their own personality and uniqueness, no two are the same! It makes for a very enjoyable, funny, and interesting game, and overall I would say this is a little jem.

Another review already mentioned that this game is confusing to categorize - who is this game aimed at?  The puzzles are simplistic and yet would not be appropriate for children, yet as an adult playing the game, I found that the narrator is condescending to the point of irritation.  In addition, the pacing is irritating.  Two lines of dialogue followed by another puzzle would be frustrating enough, but each puzzle is prefaced by a short piece of dramatic music (the same every time) and a bland and completely unnecessary title screen.  You're then given the instructions, then the puzzle, and then more time is taken up with a screen portraying a nondescript part of the village while three ducks, for reasons unexplained, fly past while the narrator drags out the 'suspense' by narrating "let's see if you got it right" or whatever and more 'dramatic' music plays and you realize that the dramatic music is the perfect background to your dawning realization of just how many of these time-wasting moments you'll have to endure if you continue the game.  I wish game makers would come to an agreement that putting in time padding scenes/dialogue is only going to work if it's not the SAME time padding scenes/dialogue every. single. time.  As it is, I have not yet reached part 2 of chapter 1 and I am very secure in my decision to find something else - anything else - to do with my Sunday afternoon.","April 19, 2015","false","1.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It seems to be aimed towards children and has the vibe of playing a children's game throughout.. however the puzzles are definitely not aimed towards children. It also uses a large vocabulary which makes me wonder whether the game was supposed to be aimed towards children or not. I don't think that a young child would be able to complete a lot of the puzzles in the game.\n\nThe Good:\n-The aesthetics, graphics, character design etc are all pretty good. I like the way the town is designed.\n- The game has a lot of narration and is occasionally funny.\n- It has local multiplayer. Not sure if it's any good though because i haven't tried it.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The puzzles start off very easy but quickly get to be pretty difficult by the start of the second act. A lot of them i found to be not very well explained which made me end up skipping through a lot of the puzzles.\n\n-There's a feature where you can replay a cutscene from the beginning by clicking the mouse towards the end of the cutscene. I found myself accidentally clicking just before the cutscene was over and that caused me to end up replaying entire cutscenes quite a lot.\n\n- The game starts to become boring about halfway through, and it doesn't help that there's not much variation in the puzzles. There's 90 puzzles but there's only about 10 or so puzzles with different mechanics. You'll see a lot of the puzzles being repeated over and over but getting more different and with a different theme each time.\n\n-You don't even need to "play" the game, because you don't actually have to complete any of the puzzles to progress- you can just fail at them and then skip them. It doesn't help that there's no achievements either which makes it have no replayability.","June 7, 2014","false","8.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Would it be so much to ask to give me the info in a journal and let me skip those ugly animated figures?\n\nI really can't stand it when games let me wait instead of letting me PLAY the freaking game. Animations in the background are ok when they don't hold me up. Anything I have to watch through before I can actually do something is bad. If I want to just watch, I turn on the TV.\n\nWhich is actually recommended with this game. Find something else to do while the game slogs through those endless pointless delays. Not just the dialogue, but also before and after actual riddles. Imminent riddle? Oh, great. Let's wait before you can click to start it. You solved it? Oh, let's wait before you get told whether it's correct. You're done with the riddle? Let's wait before you get back to the game. Bah.\n\nThe actual puzzles are nice, but I guess without the forced lengthening of game time by all the delays, the game itself would be quite short. There isn't an overwhelming number of puzzles/riddles. Not that any amount of interesting puzzles would make up for that, as every single one just adds waiting time.\n\nBut if I didn't have to sit through all those delays and just get to freaking play the damn game, I'd actually recommend it. Better short than wasting time with being held up.\n\nThis game is only for people who like watching while not getting to do anything.\n\nOh, and to get it to run in a window I had to find some config file of the game on c: and edit that.\n","November 5, 2015","false","17.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","4"

The puzzles were a bit difficult but I tried my best to solve them. Plus I like the fact that you can skip puzzles if too difficult so I don't see why you would get frustrated. I would recomend this game to anyone. Even if they aren't a mystery fan. I wish I could get another Blue Toad game. VB","June 29, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each player takes turn to solves puzzles to earns some medals and learn some truth and information. Although this game isn't an adventure game, you'll have to use your detective skills (deduction and observation) to find the real culprit in each episode.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward, you don't need to solved every puzzles or correctly guessing the real culprit, the story itself will move forward anyway.\n\nFor $19.99 this game is pretty expensive. I recommend trying the demo first. If you like it you should buy when it's on sale (probaly around $5-$7). I'm not recommend buying at full price beacuse for $19.99 you can buy better games with better story, such as Syberia, Broken Sword, or Emerald City Confidential.","January 20, 2011","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is brilliant!\nAs a Blue Toad Agent, you are working hard and have been sent to Little Riddle for a holiday, but you end up in the middle of a murder investigation!\nYou can choose to play as one of four agents, or you can play with 3 friends (I can't say how that works, because I didn't play it that way. I might update this when I finally do.).  You can question suspects, find clues and make deductions and accusations. And you can laugh a lot while you do it.\nThis game is really funny, really fun and while it starts easy, it gets harder.\nIf you don't like to be berated by the voice of the narrator when you mess up, best not play this.\nIf you enjoy a very tongue and cheek sort of humour, it's a steal.\n\nOne word of advice, if you don't have a photographic memory, write down everything!","June 20, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean, it has some funny dialogue and some of the puzzles aren't bad. Unfortunatily those moments are too far in between. The story is not very interesting, and the most of the puzzels are very easy. The graphics aren't bad for this kind of game, and they blend well with the silly characters. It's just it gets boring after a couple of hours.\nAlthough it's not that bad of a game i wouldn't recommend this game unless you are really into british humor and this kind of game.","January 9, 2015","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
