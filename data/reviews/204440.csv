And it is true that many of them are just clones of one another. Then Pickers comes along and with it comes a welcome breath of fresh air for the genre. This game takes the theme of hidden-object-puzzles and mixes it with simulation elements to create a remarkably novel experience that will definitely appease any fan of the genre, and likely those who are usually on the fence as well.\n\nPickers throws out the tired and cliché story usually attached to games in the genre, and just builds an enjoyable game around hidden-object-puzzles. The concept of the game is influenced by popular reality TV shows like Storage Wars and Pawn Stars. The objective is to go to various locations and pick out certain items and buy them; then return to your shop and sell them for profit. Repeat this for a set amount of cycles and make enough profit by the end to win. It sounds so simple… and it is… but it is very addictive and fun.\n\nYou will go to the different locations and notice that there are actually hundreds of items you can click on and buy. But you will have to be careful to not buy junk. You need to find the good stuff (like rare comics and autographed baseballs) among the nonsense (like common tools and furniture). But what is especially fun about the game is the fact there is no “right” answer or set path; you can buy and sell whatever you want as you play through. That said, there are elements to the gameplay that will guide your choices, like a rotating “hot” category that will guarantee profitability.\n\nPickers is definitely a nifty little game that has a certain unique identity and charm. I highly recommend it to established fans of the genre, and I also believe the more casual fans of the genre will find it enjoyable as well. If you fall into those groups, it is absolutely worth your consideration.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 8","true","4.7"," 72 of 75 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","72","75","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/recommended/204440/","praxis666","Praxis-[CE]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/","1529 products in account","Pickers has a fantastic and unique concept for a hidden object game. You visit different cluttered locations and look around for items of interest, and then haggle with the owners to buy the items you've selected. Each of the objects you find can then be marked up and then resold in your own shop. You can also have the objects appraised or restored or sold at auction for a fee, but you could end up making a tidy profit. You can also pair up related objects, sometimes from picks in different locations entirely, and combine them for an even more valuable item. Also, each day customers want different "hot" items, so picking in those categories can definitely increase your profits.\n\nIn addition to hunting for bargains, each location has a special area where you do a more traditional hidden object game. The premise is that you earn a bonus for finding all the items on a customer's request list, and then the mini-game proceeds with you finding objects in the scene off a list of words. Success rewards you with a item, usually one in hot demand, that you can then sell in your shop with the rest of your stuff.\n\nIf you ever found yourself watching reality "cash for treasures" tv programs like American Pickers, or any of the various storage wars or pawn shop or antiques related shows, you'll find this game to be pretty interesting and a lot of fun.\n\nThe only downside is that there are only 12 locations to pick from, and once you've unlocked them all playing becomes more of a memory game than one of luck or skill. I'd imagine that by your second or third playthrough, this would get too repetitive to be a challenge.","May 9, 2015","true","11.1"," 48 of 49 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","48","49","0","5"

Basically you go around the map visiting different places to find items. You can simply pick up items that are lying around or choose to do a HOG scene (optional) which nets you a free item. Items you selected can then be purchased (or haggled) from the owners and all of them have their own categories. Getting all your picks from the day's hot item categories nets you a cash bonus. All these items are then placed in your item shop. You get to price items, list them, haggle with customers, auction off stuff etc. The fancy thing here is that some items can be combined with others to form a neat combi that sells for a huge profit (like 95% of the time) eg, jukebox + records.\n\nIt doesn't sound too bad on paper but in reality when you are playing, the duration is too long. Every game is 30 days and each day you visit locations, pick items, buy and sell etc. The repetition is simply too much and imo it would have been better at like 15 days max. You also get to collect keys while in game and upon collecting 40 of them (out of 60), the unlimited HOG mode is unlocked and that perhaps extends the game length of this title...just by a little. Overall, not a bad game (nice ideas!) but too repetitive for the most of us.","July 27, 2013","true","8.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

I don’t mean on the high end, buying and selling priceless, authenticated works of art. I mean sifting through people’s attics and garages, trying to find some expensive item that’s been mistaken for a piece of junk. If so, then there’s a good chance Pickers is a game you s hould check out!\n\nThis is an unusual but obvious entrant into the "hidden object" puzzle genre. Instead of the focus being on solving a mystery or gathering clues, Pickers has you sifting through people's collected hoards in various locales throughout the country for no other reason than profit. The main campaign of the game is fairly straightforward. You have thirty days to find the creme de la creme of second hand collectible goods, and at the end of each day try to turn a profit on what you’ve picked (hence the title of the game). There’s a huge load of junk to sift through, along with a wide variation of locations, but you can only purchase seven items each day. The challenge is to pick the best items at the hottest times, buying low and selling high!\n\nGraphically, Pickers does it's job pretty well. This kind of game really requires clear and eyecatching graphics, not only for presentation, but also to make the task of visually searching for interesting items as easy on the eyes as possible. Every item you come across has some beautiful 2D detail, and there’s some pleasure to be had in mentally cataloging each and every item you come across, trying to figure out which object in the horde will be your best bet or match the different categories. The environments and characters are well-designed as well, hovering somewhere on the border between realistic and cartoony. Suffice to say, the game is easy on the eyes – or as easy as it can be when you are, quite literally, digging through other people’s trash. The gameplay in Pickers is really simple. As previously noted, each day you can pick a maximum of seven items from a very wide variety of items and location. You’ll have to negotiate with the item’s owner, trying to haggle them down as low as they’ll go without upsetting them...which could lead to a temporary inability to deal with them further. Afterwards, you can decide whether to risk your item in an auction, netting a fraction of it's price/worth...or price it for sale in your store - where NPCs will try to haggle you down from your initial list price. If you’re the sort of person who just loves to play the auction game in MMOs, this may actually be a title to look at.\n\nThe interface and controls are really easy to learn. Honestly, it’s hard to screw up. If you’re interested in an item, click it and get a little information about it. If you dislike it, just remove it from your inventory and back to the pile it goes. The haggling and price-setting is equally direct, and chances are there will never be a moment where you’re at a loss for what you should do next. In addition to the general polish this game has, there’s also a huge variety of locations to explore and items to consider. It’s conceivably possible that you’ll eventually have memorized just about every item in the game, but seriously… that would require quite a lot of play in this game, and by that point you can hardly say you didn’t get your money’s worth.\n\nOddly enough considering the game’s concept, Pickers has turned out to be quite a bargain itself. While the gameplay has a very tight focus - sifting through items to buy and sell may wear on some gamers – if the prospect of hunting for treasure in a marketplace instead of a dungeon appeals to you, this is definitely one game to check out.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","March 31, 2015","true","5.0"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","1"

You are not just 'running around the country' collecting random items to sell for top dollar at your own store. It is more like one of those old seek and find picture books you could find in a library at an elementary school. Wonderful graphics, not too hard to see every detail on most objects. Also, you can select the object you are interested in to read a tiny bit more about it, as well as see how it looks. Bartering is rather easy (depending on the person's mood and momentary mindset, of course), and if you don't want to wait for items to sell in the shop, you can appraise them & send them off to auction! A good concept and a simple game to wind down with at the end of the day.","June 3, 2014","true","15.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

What that means is that it's essentially a point and click adventure game without the adventure part. Instead it's simply about finding the right part of the screen to click on. You play as a pair of antique pickers that travel the US looking for hidden treasure in a bunch of predetermined locations.\n\nThe gameplay happens in two parts the first of which is the buying of items where you pick a location to go to and then click on various objects on the screen to add them to your cart and then haggle for price. Most of this is either spam-clicking the screen trying to find little hidden items and simply knowing which items are valued at what price.\n\nThe second part is when you have bought the items you take them back to your shop where you can combine certain items, restore others, have your items valued for a fee and then put them up for sale in your shop trying to make the most money within the game's time frame.\n\nUnfortunately the gameplay boils down to mainly knowing in advance where the valuable items are hidden and what they sell for so you can make the leaderboards and it's all very simple and monotone. I suppose it's a genre I am simply not that fond of personally but I really have trouble seeing how a game like this would appeal to anyone.","January 4, 2013","false","50.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Sarcastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docsarcastic/","356 products in account","Personal Rating: 6/10\n\nWell, I didn't expect to actually play this game, but I did and to be quite honest I enjoyed the small portion of playtime I had. The graphics are neat and the concept of the game is quite a new and interesting idea. It reminds me of shows like the American Pickers or Pawn Stars, or Youtubers like The Game Chasers.\n\nHowever, the music in this game isn't really the best. I know it's a small point to make out, almost nitpicking as a result, but it's practically the most annoying thing in the game. Another thing I realised early on is that it's very difficult to make a loss in profit, I even TRIED but I apparently got a jackpot item which sold for $9,000. The game does have a limited number of locations to visit and the sessions only last for 30 Days. Which is reasonable, but it doesn't take long to get through it and then get bored. I tried out the game on Zen mode where there isn't any competition because I wanted to see what functions the game has and this is what I found out in the process.\n\nIt's a point and click adventure without the adventure part. Especially when you have to find all the items. It reminds me of a game released on PC. Coronation Street and the Missing HotPot Recipie. The same two to three things over and over again. Don't get me wrong, it's enjoyable, but it turns into a pattern and not a good pattern at that.","May 3, 2014","true","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can unlock an endless mode, but it is specifically hidden object.\n\nThe core gameplay takes place over the course of 30 games, and in the different difficulties you can either not compete against other (npc) "Pickers", or increasingly difficult "Pickers" in order to make the most money.\nIt's a fairly interesting game, and (as previously stated) the hidden object function is optional. In each location there is a hidden object mini-game, which you can play for a free item to sell. But, though it can be played in each subsequent visit to a location (once per day), once you've located an item on the list you it's gone, and can't be grabbed again, so each time the mini-game gets easier. And on my second playthrough of the game, I realized that the items are always asked for in the same order each time, and the items are always in the exact same spot, so once you've done it once, you can do it really easily again, unless you don't have a very good memory.\n\nWhen you go to a location to find things to sell, you can choose to get the items apraised (a limited number of times, for a fee), but the value of the items doesn't change from game to game, meaning that if you take note of the value, you never actually have to bother getting them appraised again.\n\nIn fact, the only thing that seems to change is what the "Hot Item" will be that day, and which items will sell in your store on a given day.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you can get it on sale, it's fairly worth it, you can play it through in only a few hours, but for the $3 I paid for it, that meant that it was roughly .50 cents an hour worth of entertainment, which is about the same as going to an arcade.\nIt could probably be played again later, once you've forgotten the prices/locations of everything.","January 3, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The pros are slightly keeping this game upwards.\n\nIt is a hidden object game with a twist. You have the job to work as a picker and search for the most profitable stuff that is collected by other people. If you are into History chanels or Biography (A&E) style reality TV shows this game is made for you if you love Frank Fritz and Mike Wolf searching old barns, hoarders lawnyards and such. But you also have to sell the stuff you found, and sometimes you need "expertises" or a "restaurator".\n\n'nuff said about the background.\n\nPro:\n\n- Fresh story of a hidden object game. You also need to haggle, and sometimes to search for matching stuff over different areas.\n- Good rendition of the idea, that at least keeps the interest as long as the game is new, what kind of character will be the next unlocked trader (one reminded me of Riff Raff of the Rocky Horror Picture show).\n- Auctioneering option, thus selling the stuff over a possibly random driven routine, it's some suspense when you sell a ring that had a net value of 8000 bucks and find out that it sold for far more than that. But sometimes you aren't so lucky.\n- Of course the Achievements may keep you at playing this game to reach a 100 % accomplishment, but on the other hand - for some people this doesn't even count.\n\nCon:\n\n- It still is a hidden object game, if you are not a fan of this genre, it might not be the right game for you. But on the other hand you might give it a try anyway.\n- It has a low replayability. If you run it through once or twice, you feel like in a grinding game. You know where each of the hidden object is put, you know how some personas react on underbidding them, you know how to get them favorable again (yes, there is a little and pleasing trick to this). Most Achievements are en passant, or no brainers if you like this term.\n\nBuy the game if you like hidden object games (which I do sometimes, since they are nice and easy going games most of the time) - if you don't like hidden object games, avoid it at all cost, because this game can get you mad by the pretension of being a American Picker Sim... which it isn't of course.","September 1, 2014","true","30.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
