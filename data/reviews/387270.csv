Mystical was a bit awkward for new players upon release, but the dev has made it much more fun!\n\nMystical is a fun, well presented and unique matching game were you have to match trios of items of different colours and pairs of items of the same colour. Each item you pick costs a coin, so it's important that you have a stash. The number of coins you can earn has been increased making the earlier levels much more fun than now than when the game was launched.\n\nThe only issue that I find now is that the English explanation of the rules is a little difficult to understand as the dev's native language is French, however it doesn't take too much effort to work out how to play. I may offer to help improve these though as it would be nice to see more people playing Mystical!\n\nIn summary, I will definitely be playing Mystical more now and say that's worth picking up.","September 2, 2015","true","4.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","6"

If it weren't by French developers it would be awesome!\n\nVarious tiles drop from the top of the screen and your job is to match them.  There are different objects in the tiles -- books, shoes, pants, scrolls -- and different colors of the different objects -- red, blue, and green colored books, for example.\n\nYou need to collect pairs and trios within each family.  For example, two red books make a pair, or a trio in the book family would be one of each color (red, blue, and yellow, for example).\n\nAdded to this is a time limit, which ticks down faster than you realize.\n\nAlso, you have to manage resources -- you have to make sure you have enough magnifying glasses or you won't be able to collect pairs or trios.  Collect coins for your final score.\n\nEach level becomes more difficult, collecting more pairs and trios as the game adds more objects -- bags, hats, flowers, envelopes.  And each time that clock keeps ticking down.\n\nAs you progress into the different chapters of the game, another wrinkle is added -- for example, you have to knock gears off the background of the playing area.\n\nIt's a pretty simple game but is addictive.  It's hard for me to play this time of game for a great amount of time as it gets my heart racing trying to match everything.  I'm not sure if I'll ever be incredibly good at this type of game -- it requires a lot of visual-spatial reasoning and planning.  But I do enjoy the game and even though I'll never be a superstar.\n\nWell worth the money and time.","February 7","true","1.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

The experience provided by the game is closer to a board game, or even some card games. The core of the game is to match pairs and families of items falling on a grid. It requires a good visual memory and some rigor. You are asked to match at least each family and each pair once to complete a level. Matching items uses coins and magnifying glasses and grants you points. You can acquire cups (bronze, silver and gold) depending on your performance. There is 50 main levels divided in 5 stages, and there is different items in each stage, and more families in each level. There also are some additional gameplay elements as well, as bombs, cogs, chests, etc..\n\nOnce you have finished the 50 main levels, you can unlock additional challenges that can be radically different that what the game offered at the beggining. Some challenges are stressful, harcore, luck-based, puzzles, etc. and adds variety to the game. There might be some grinding involved to unlock every challenges, particulary if you made your way through all the levels easily, but at this point you should already have at least 15 hours of playtime, and you can keep playing the game by short sessions to continue enjoying it. The game has some flaws, like repetitiveness and maybe a lack of charm, but it does nevertheless remains an interesting, unique and addictive experience.\n\nThe principal question you should ask to yourself is : "Would I enjoy this game ? Am I that kind of player who could spend some time on this ?" If it is obvious that you won't, just forget this game exists, but if you hesitate or could enjoy it, I'd suggest you to try it, you might be pleasantly surprised. For $1.99, the game provides a lot of hours of playtime, I think it is completely worth the asked price.","April 6","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
