Each game literally starts the second where the last game ended.  When you start a new game you get to import your save from the last and you will have a small recap of the last game.  While it is enough to get the gist of what happened in the last game it won't be enough to get the whole picture, especially if you pick up part 3 first.\n\nThe first two games in this series in my opinion are very well done.\nGreat music that goes along with the game.\nA good combat system, its well paced and yet flows smoothly for both trash grinding and boss battles.\nNice sidequest that give good rewards without being game breaking.\nHumor, where the first two really shined.  Lots of good laughs in the games, something I really enjoy.\nDecent sized.  To 100% both game one and two I put about 20 hours in them.  Just about the perfect size for a game like this.  Not too short so it feels like you didn't get your moneys worth and not to long so it drags on.\n\nOverall the first two games are some of the best RPGs I have played in a long time.  Having only played the third a little bit it seems like it is keeping what worked in the first two games.  I really reccomend this gem of a series.  John Wizard has done a great job on this one.","July 7, 2015","true","25.1"," 57 of 69 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","57","69","0","0"
