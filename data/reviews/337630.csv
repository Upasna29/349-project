So when an visual novels come to Steam, I usually purchase them to support said games. It doesn't help that I this game was made by the same people who did "Unhack," a game which I adore immensely. However, the problem lies in multiple aspects, making it confused as to what the true culprit is which makes this game not pass.\n\nLet's break down the elements on the game, starting with the music. This section will be short because, to be frank, the music is pretty forgettable. Normally, with another game, I wouldn't focus to heavily on this but, with a visual novel, there is a lot more riding on the music, It conveys what the game can't so the music needs to convey every emotion just as well as the character's dialogue and voice cast, if there is one. With "Bermuda," the music felt static. It never felt like it was anything special and, once the scene was over, the music vanished both from the game and my memory.\n\nNext, let's look at the story. The story provided is rather silly in concept and is too rushed to be anything special. It also doesn't help that this seems to be a character driven story but fails in execution, which I will discuss later. The plot is sort of there because it needed to be, that's all.\n\nBefore moving onto the characters in question, let's address one of the major problems with the game: the gameplay. To be fair, not many visual novels have a gameplay aspect so, the fact that this one does makes it a tad more interesting for having one. With that said, the gameplay is boring. If it was difficult but well-made, I wouldn't be able to complain. If it was very easy but well-made, I'd complain on difficulty but that's it. However, "Bermuda"'s  gameplay finds a way to be  simple, boring, and pathetically easily. You move the main character, Edward, on the same map, accomplishing whatever  goal is given to you. Whether that be going to the top floor, buying time for someone, or bringing guards to their untimely demise. The problem is that it's the same thing, not really changing at all. It's boring is the best way to put it.\n\nThe last point and the largest problem are the characters. There are only about five major characters, not discussing one for spoiler reasons. The first is Finyomu, the acting commander of the ship. She's only about seven years old but acts much older than that. She wishes to know more about the surface world, studying humans to learn more about them. Besides some things that come up later, that's pretty much it. She's a basic character, as if copy and pasted. The second-in-command, Mukan, has even less character. She's the atypical tomboy, liking girly things (poetry, romance novels, etc.) but having to be a hard ♥♥♥ on the ship. She's overly protective of Finyomu though she is her best friend. That's it. Then the human characters. First up is Paul. He's a tough guy who went to jail for protecting another character, Joanna, and is currently in a relationship with her. He's the guy who the reader might identify with in this situation. He happens to also be the most developed character in the story. The second human is Joanna. I hate this character. She's barely in the story but has such a pull on the Paul and Edward. She is clearly in love with Edward but is dating Paul because he asked. She is the only human teleported back to the surface before something goes wrong . That's all we know! Lastly, we have Edward/Eddie, the main character. He's bare bones, nothing special to him at all. Though he loves God...a lot. Exaggerating here but it's almost like every other sentence is about God. That bothered me immensely and made me start to hate him a bit. It's tiresome, hearing about God non-stop. That's all there is to it.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, the main point in that massive section above was this. The story is too short for the characters to shine. No matter how bland a character might be, they can be exciting in some way throughout the story. Especially in a character driven story, the length can hinder the characters. Many stories, however, don't have this problem but I finished this game in just under two hours. That's too short. Visual novels like "Saya no Uta" or "Little Busters!" thrive on their characters. Though the latter is muchy longer, the former visual novel is fairly short, only about two to ten hours as listen on VNDB. However, unlike this game, "Saya no Uta" has characters which can shine, even if they aren't the best or most well-written. This game just didn't take the time so the characters fall flat, killing it along with it.\n\nOne last point before the wrap-up: the voice acting. Though these voice actors are amazing, having a deep love for Christina Vee and Kyle Herbert, the acting is fairly stiff. I don't know if it's because of the material given but there's something off with these performances. Well, except Christina Vee, who sounds very good and emotional. Everyone else is stiff.\n\n"Bermuda" is a game which I wouldn't recommend. If you happen to have it through a friend or in a bundle you were gonna buy anyway, give it a run through. It most definitely isn't the worst thing out there. However, don't purchase it. Instead, buy "Unhack," which is by the same people and does everything this game should have done but better.","March 19, 2015","false","1.9"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","40","47","0","0"

It is too short, the "sneaky-beaky" parts are repetetive and, frankly, boring, and the VN part... Well, there isn't any VN. It is basically a simplistic stealth game with in-between cutscenes.

Even the straightest of VNs that I played offered at least two plot choice moments. And the plot itself... Well, as I said before, this game is incredibly short, thus plot is very rushed and cramped together and, well, filled with cliches. More near the end characters feels more and more acting in certain ways not because they would do so, but because the plot demands it from them.

Plot devices are invented off hand and then left suspending in space as if to serve as window dressing for the explosive non sequiturs which cap off each act. It’s as if in its feverish obsession to create “emotional moments” Bermuda forgets everything that took place before that scene, unconcerned with how far it has vered off course so long as it arrives at the next juicy twist.\n\nBut I couldn’t even find a way to enjoy Bermuda ironically because its flat writing leaves no room for camp or unintended hilarity. Characters are boring, single faceted shells for the equally uninspired plot which drone on and on, unaware that their audience has long since dozed off yet seeming just as bored with their lines. It doesn’t help that there are a lot of things about Bermuda which are more than a little weird. The religious undertones feel pigeoned in almost for the sake of being able to present Bermuda as a bizarre piece of Christian media, and the fetishistic relationship between two characters left me feeling dirty and creeped out.\n\nIt’s just an immensely unenjoyable experience all around, and one that seems intentionally so but without anything interesting with which to fill the black hole that seems to have enveloped Bermuda to ensure nothing joyful or humorous finds its way in. And so Bermuda comes and goes, full of drama yet lacking any presence and leaving me grasping for even the tiniest justification of the hour I just lost.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 10, 2015","false","1.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

God may lead you, return to God, God can forgive then I can, God help us, God's mercy, etc. He basically doesn't have a personality, he does everything because that's the nice and good way to do it.\nThe captain of the ship, who's nice, sees wonder in the world, and trust the guys.\nThe bodyguard-like character, who's paranoid, aggressive yet follows captain's orders whom she idolizes\n+ between acts you can talk to random people on the ship, who are saying stuff that's supposed to be funny and totally out of the story. They are playing games (khmUnhackkhm) on duty, there because of the tax benefits, and things like that - they take the quirky role.\n\nVoice acting is kind of lifeless - it's understandable really well, but totally lacking any emotions or reflects to the happenings - main character tells us how the alarm triggers and they get surrounded just as calmly as he would be reading out the newspapers while having his breakfast.\n\nThe game's minigames are much less fun than they were in Unhack, and their implication are also not as deep as in Unhack was - in Bermuda, for example you sneak up to the control room - meaning you snak through 3 levels of guards in the minigame, then you're up in the control room, stuff happens. Meanwhile in Unhack the minigames were actual (un)hacking happening, you were getting information on your way, and not just padding instead of telling us " We barely got passed the guards, but we done it"\n\nI can't recommend Bermuda to buy. The characters lack personality, the story is meh and characters are so void it's hard to care about them.  If you have the game, you can as well play it while you're idling it for hours for the cards (took me 8 hours to drop - game is 1h long...).\nIf you're intrested in a similarly short Visual novel, instead of Bermuda I can recommend Shen Gui which has really good atmosphere, or from Bermuda's creator : Unhack which is basically a story-driven series of a minigame, where the story being presented in a Visual Novel format.","February 13","false","9.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","3"

God may lead you, return to God, God can forgive then I can, God help us, God's mercy, etc. He basically doesn't have a personality, he does everything because that's the nice and good way to do it.\nThe captain of the ship, who's nice, sees wonder in the world, and trust the guys.\nThe bodyguard-like character, who's paranoid, aggressive yet follows captain's orders whom she idolizes\n+ between acts you can talk to random people on the ship, who are saying stuff that's supposed to be funny and totally out of the story. They are playing games (khmUnhackkhm) on duty, there because of the tax benefits, and things like that - they take the quirky role.\n\nVoice acting is kind of lifeless - it's understandable really well, but totally lacking any emotions or reflects to the happenings - main character tells us how the alarm triggers and they get surrounded just as calmly as he would be reading out the newspapers while having his breakfast.\n\nThe game's minigames are much less fun than they were in Unhack, and their implication are also not as deep as in Unhack was - in Bermuda, for example you sneak up to the control room - meaning you snak through 3 levels of guards in the minigame, then you're up in the control room, stuff happens. Meanwhile in Unhack the minigames were actual (un)hacking happening, you were getting information on your way, and not just padding instead of telling us " We barely got passed the guards, but we done it"\n\nI can't recommend Bermuda to buy. The characters lack personality, the story is meh and characters are so void it's hard to care about them.  If you have the game, you can as well play it while you're idling it for hours for the cards (took me 8 hours to drop - game is 1h long...).\nIf you're intrested in a similarly short Visual novel, instead of Bermuda I can recommend Shen Gui which has really good atmosphere, or from Bermuda's creator : Unhack which is basically a story-driven series of a minigame, where the story being presented in a Visual Novel format.","February 13","false","9.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","3"

Aside from those faults I recommend it, and it is clear I am not doing the game justice by only saying what is bad about it, but I am not able to do that without spoiling some point of the story.\n\nThe minigame in between Acts is not interesting, nor innovative. And even though you were told you were given permission to travel freely in the ship you still must avoid the guards. The minigame is essentially game with floors where you must not touch the guards or walk under the security camera, and even if you are straight ahead of the guards when they are facing in your direction they do not stop you or act on it, which makes turning off the lights seemingly pointless (It says turning off the lights makes you not be seen while standing still, although if you are in the dark if a guard touches you the minigame is still reset).\n\nThe artstyle is very nice for the story, but mediocre for the minigame.

Bermuda uses same formula, visual novel mixed with minigames. Stealth puzzles are not hard, which I think is great. They are a fine addition to usual VN reading (or listening - all dialogues are voiced) experience, but do not frustrate players who simply want to enjoy the story. Characters are well developed although the story sometimes felt a bit rushed. Again I liked the art design. I'm not sure if I can pinpoint why I like Bermuda's graphics so much, but the clean design with minimalistic color palette and heavy use of blue together with black backgrounds is somehow just so relaxing to watch. Even if Bermuda is a short VN, it takes about an hour and a half to see the ending, it is more than worth your money.

I love Cursed Sight and Without Within and while playing this I expected it to be nearly as good as those two, but reality came hitting hard. Bermuda seems boring, predictable and somewhat stupid. The main character is, for my liking, too religious, at the point to mention god in almost every single sentence he says, I have nothing against religious people but to me is just too much.\n\nPros.\n- Nice drawings\n- Almost nice music\n- Interesting stealth minigame\n\nCons.\n- Short (1 - 2 hours playtime, depending on how fast you read)\n- Predictable\n\nI recommend this VN if you can get it in a sale or in a bundle.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Aside from those faults I recommend it, and it is clear I am not doing the game justice by only saying what is bad about it, but I am not able to do that without spoiling some point of the story.\n\nThe minigame in between Acts is not interesting, nor innovative. And even though you were told you were given permission to travel freely in the ship you still must avoid the guards. The minigame is essentially game with floors where you must not touch the guards or walk under the security camera, and even if you are straight ahead of the guards when they are facing in your direction they do not stop you or act on it, which makes turning off the lights seemingly pointless (It says turning off the lights makes you not be seen while standing still, although if you are in the dark if a guard touches you the minigame is still reset).\n\nThe artstyle is very nice for the story, but mediocre for the minigame. The voice acting is very good (which is standard in games).","June 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bermuda uses same formula, visual novel mixed with minigames. Stealth puzzles are not hard, which I think is great. They are a fine addition to usual VN reading (or listening - all dialogues are voiced) experience, but do not frustrate players who simply want to enjoy the story. Characters are well developed although the story sometimes felt a bit rushed. Again I liked the art design. I'm not sure if I can pinpoint why I like Bermuda's graphics so much, but the clean design with minimalistic color palette and heavy use of blue together with black backgrounds is somehow just so relaxing to watch. Even if Bermuda is a short VN, it takes about an hour and a half to see the ending, it is more than worth your money. I can easily recommend it and can't wait to see what will InvertMouse bring next.","March 24, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

On the other, however, the game suffers from poor writing and pacing, and the 'stealth' action sequences were more annoying than actually fun. It was far too easy to mess with the guards in these sequences once you realized you could stand right in front of them with nothing happening (they need to actually touch your character).\n\nAnother detraction is the 'bonus dialog' before each Act...while it seems to be an interesting addition to the story, it serves to only confuse. IE: You've just been imprisoned, and yet you're out walking in the ship having these side conversations. And only one (I won't spoil whom) is in the past tense. Another detraction is the fact there are no choices in dialog.\n\nLike I said, the voice acting was good, but there isn't much to this game beyond that.

I would give this a once through if you get it in a bundle or something, but that's it.","June 2, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hawkzombie/recommended/337630/","hawkzombie","Hawk Zombie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hawkzombie/","1550 products in account","It's hard to reccomend this title...On one hand, the voice acting is superb. On the other, however, the game suffers from poor writing and pacing, and the 'stealth' action sequences were more annoying than actually fun. It was far too easy to mess with the guards in these sequences once you realized you could stand right in front of them with nothing happening (they need to actually touch your character).\n\nAnother detraction is the 'bonus dialog' before each Act...while it seems to be an interesting addition to the story, it serves to only confuse. IE: You've just been imprisoned, and yet you're out walking in the ship having these side conversations. And only one (I won't spoil whom) is in the past tense. Another detraction is the fact there are no choices in dialog.\n\nLike I said, the voice acting was good, but there isn't much to this game beyond that. A very unimaginative story.\n\nTLDR: Only get if you're a fan of any of the voice actors involved, or REALLY like Visual Novels","June 5, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is the next step in the author's career after Unhacked (1) and Without Within (1). It's a little slow paced, and even though my computer is just a notebook, it takes quite some time between each screen.\n\nThe character development and storytelling was good, but you may want to consider the fact that it wont be the longest read or story that you've ever encountered, and thus, character developtment and plot only go so far. It attempts to really cross the line after which you feel emphaty for story, but I fear that some may not feel that emotive.\n\nI do recommend this game.","February 23","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boxudo/recommended/337630/","boxudo","Boxa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boxudo/","1482 products in account","Bermuda is a visual novel game with just some puzzles to play in it, most of the part it is the characters interacting with themselves. The story is ok but nothing much, the voice over is good, except for the protagonist, the soundtrack is ok but can be repetitive, and the graphics are fine, even it being too much static, although the characters are not really that much charismatic as in the developers' other game, unhacker.\n\nThe game is only recommended for those that like visual novels, since the puzzle part does not make for the game itself. But, this game is pretty cheap, so anyone that want to try a visual novel game can buy it and get into the world. The game is also pretty fast to beat, and it only depends on your comprehension of the things that are happening (you can jump the story if you want to)\n\nSo, basically, Bermuda is an ok game, you can play it and have some fun with the story, but it does not really have that much, with the price making for its flaws. You can get it in a sale, as well.\n","December 8, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
