You jump off things, gravity takes over and you steer, as with actual base jumping.\n\nThis game isnt rocket science, but it is challenging and although as stated above, it is the same basic action and objective in every level. However, the levels are massively varied and theres a few extra things thrown in, (hand gestures and spraypainting buildings with the mouse).

Then you put it back away for a very long time. I don't blame you. It's fun for about 15 minutes, but then you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. There's only so much fun you can have in a game about jumping off buildings. Well....maybe that's not true, but there's only so much fun you can have in this game.\n\nYou start each round by jumping off a building. Points are scored for getting close to objects without hitting them, interacting with people (thumbs up or flipping off), flying through certain gates, and sticking your landing. This gameplay can only interest you for so long. The controls work well enough while falling, except controlling after deploying your parachute can be a little awkward.\n\nThe visuals are bright and intense, but not all that interesting. There are lots of flashing lights which could be problematic to some people. The music is fast and somewhat entertaining. Maybe the best part of the game.\n\nI could not recommend this game for more than a few minutes playtime.

While it's fun to play for a bunch of the levels, it slowly decends to a kind of perfectionist/point ♥♥♥♥♥ style of gameplay where you can only advance if you play previous levels to excess to get more teeth (in-game currency) and allow you to unlock more levels. I wouldn't mind so much if the teeth values for most levels were significantly lowered, but having to play and 5-star the easiest level 200 times to unlock the next level is tedious. Other than the occasional ARG content, it's not worth playing past a certain point mid-way through what's available and leaves much to be desired.\n\nIf you really want to play it: unlock all the little extra videos/audio content first, then see how far you can get. The extra little tidbits are genuinely hilarous by virtue of surreal humor.\n\nGenerally: give this a miss.","July 1, 2011","false","20.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The levels are mostly very stylized (with a few which are meant to mimic natural landscapes). The game is very entertaining for the first bit, but is best experienced in bite-sized chunks. Once you've done a few levels, take a break and come back later - it can get repetitive rapidly, and while the later levels definitely add a lot more to keep track of, the core mechanics remain consistent.\n\nIt's a pity, because the later levels are the better ones in the game, but ultimately, since the replayability is based off of the levels you've unlocked it doesn't feel like there's a great deal of depth beyond what you see on the surface.\n\nI had a good time with it. However, I've only played about 5 hours and I feel "done" with it - I don't have any particular desire to go back into it. If you're looking for a neat, stylized experience? Hard to do any better.

Don't mistake this game for some sort of simulation though, you don't just jump off of real skyscrapers, but rather interesting and fictional constructions and there is quite an array of things to do on your way down.

AaAaAA is a pretty fun - if sometimes frustrating - game which involves BASE jumping from the tops of skyscrapers, floating platforms, mountains and more. It is not a "realistic" BASE jumping simulation, though. The levels are crazy-insane and the game is rife with a twisted sense of humor, which all comes together to make AaAaAA a very unique experience. While some levels can be extremely challenging, failure usually leaves you with a "just one more time" feeling, rather than outright frustration. I thought AaAaAA was well worth the price of admission, and recommend it if you are looking for something completely fresh to kill some time.","April 17, 2011","true","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It doesn't let me change the resolution (Which would have been fine if it didn't fail to run properly at my normal nvidia surround resolutions), and it doesn't let you change the keyboard layouts (which would have been fine if it didn't introduce the grafitti action on a ♥♥♥♥ed up hand-contorting key).\n\nSo way to go, developers, you showed us how pointlessly anti-configuration you were for no god damned reason.  Hope you're proud of your perplexing design decision because it ♥♥♥♥ed me up.\n\nAs for the game itself, some levels have a bit of a super meat boy vibe of short levels with challenging manuvering, but sometimes they make the levels long so it's hard to practice them, especially the end of the level because it's hard to get to it.  Also it's a little needlessly unforgiving, such as falling on a 1 degree plane counting as falling onto flat ground, and catching the very corners of things should damage you sure but it just anihilates you instantly.\n\nAnother really messed up thing is that they're offering a one-time-only achievement. That's right, play now or forever have an empty slot in your achievement list. That's some really epic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Am I the only one who is annoyed as ♥♥♥♥ by that?","December 20, 2013","false","1.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There's not a whole lot to say here - it's a well designed, simple concept that's extremely fun. I don't see myself playing this to the point of obsession, but I will definitely play until I unlock everything and see what else I can do with it.\n\nFor those of you who are like me, and entirely too afraid to actually participate in extreme sports like base jumping, this will confirm your belief that you're really not cut out for it. You will be perfectly satisfied to sit in your chair, breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth, and imagine yourself floating to the ceiling.\n\nA fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has enough silly humor to make you smile - note that you won't laugh uproariously, but I don't believe that was the point of this, anyway.\n\nGameplay is top notch, soundtrack is fun and funny, and I will definitely enjoy any time period in which I play this game, but I seriously doubt I will get addicted to it. One of those rare gems that's worth anyone's time, even iff you just have a few minutes to kill. I, personally, enjoy games that don't require a huge time investment in order to understand what they're about and have fun with them, and this is definitely the type where your boredom will die for a bit.\n\nPlus, after you play for an hour or so you'll exit and still feel like you're playing it.\n\nNeat. 8/10.\n\n(Small edit: I mean it's not very addictive. I meant to say that it was fun, but I don't see myself getting addicted to it. Fixed.)","December 3, 2014","true","0.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

It a freefalling game where you have to do 'stunts' to gain points really. Except, it doesn't look like a freefalling game. Yes, you have the feeling you're falling down, but that's it really. It's all in first person perspective so there's no actual character involved as well. The idea is cool, but its execution is kind of poor. It would've been so much cooler to have a realistic freefalling game. Like the realism of Mirror's Edge and the freefalling/parachute gameplay of Just Cause 2. But that's all just in hindsight. So all in all; it's ok. There aren't a lot of games with this sort of gameplay so I can't really recommend any better alternatives.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","August 28, 2011","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A crazy idea deployed with a great soundtrack.\n\nSometimes it can be frustrating to get that score you need, but at the end the reward is more than enough. However do take into account I played this during the Portal 2 ARG, which raises the question if I would have played it into such intensity in other circumstances.","June 30, 2011","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The basics is you use the wasd to controll your characters while hes falling and you do stuff during the fall to gain points before you get to the end and land...\n\nThe design is strange and the presentation sucks, but the core gameplay is actually fun and you unlock new "abilites" during the way to keep the core game interesting. Add to that you can unlock any level you want from the level select screen you wont get bogged down on one level you cant get through. Gain rank in a level, 1-5 stars, gives you "teeth" points and these points are used to unlock new levels. The concept  works.\n\nThe resolution could have been better, but I recommend it while its on sale at 75% off and the competition level is the first one to the left you can unlock next to the introduction text boxes. The ach is pretty simple and you can also view it on Youtube if you serach the level "Mash Face Against Mountain".","December 9, 2010","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The other objective is to get a 5 star high score so you can earn 'teeth' the in-game currency (that's what we going to use when we run out of paper?) which you can spend to unlock more levels. Each level you complete you get treated to some funny news announcements or instructional videos. One video teaches you the do's and don'ts of accidental time travel, another video teaches you grandma's secret ingredient in her choc chip cookies being human remains and the list goes on. Most of these are either novel or groan out loud weakly executed attempts of humor.\n\nThere are a number of ways to build up your score. The main one is to kiss a building (get so close you can plant your smackers on it) and to hug them (free fall down at a constant close distance), but you can also do other things such as give a two fingered salute to red spectators (Mr Bean is Professional at that) and a thumbs up to blue ones, you can also graffiti tag certain buildings on your way down, smash into a bird, hit various glass colored plates for money, or perform the very tricky thread a needle move.\n\nMost of the time you will struggle to do any of this as you will be too busy in a g spin of certain death since the controls are ridiculously hard to master. Hit a building and you become a human pinball against concrete flippers. I dare you to smoke a joint and try this with rift. You will be vomiting up your lungs as your characters nasal passage begins to smell the back of his brain thanks to the constant concrete jungle your treated to.\n\nWith all these things going on and it's unique game style you would think that this would be thumbs up material. It ISN'T. The game gets tedious and laborious fast. It gets too difficult too quickly, you might get 5 stars on two of the levels if your lucky. While it is possible to get 5 stars on the other levels, still you will soon discover that you will need to spend this life time, and your next reincarnated life time, or your next eternal life on a paradise earth, or your next life time being burnt alive forever and ever, but look on the bright side least you don't have to get five stars on this anymore.\n\nThe other reason it's thumbs down is because there is another version on Steam which is exactly the same, but contains more content with more 'polished' controls since it uses a different game engine. The other game is called 'AaAaAAAA!!! - for the awesome'. So if your interested "Go! .... Go Jump off a cliff!.... What are you waiting for??? .... JUMP!!!!"","January 16, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While the game does feature a wide variety of playmaps and modes, and the unlocking and teeth currency system are welcome, the game has some pretty noticeable flaws.  First and foremost is the lack of controller support, which given the twitch nature of the gameplay seems like a must.  Secondly, the game does not feature any interesting music and the sound effects particularly for the parachute are quite poor.  I had fun with this title for a few minutes, but the tedium grows as these flaws repeat over each game session.  I would recommend this game only to action fans who want a novel concept but caution others to stay away.","April 23, 2012","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is basically built around high scores, in the same vein as classic arcade games. But when the leaderboards are dominated by hackers (a million points in the tutorial level? Please) with no moderation in sight, that takes out the possibility of an ePeen simulator.\n\nOne positive about this game is the level design.

First and foremost is the lack of controller support, which given the twitch nature of the gameplay seems like a must.  Secondly, the game does not feature any interesting music and the sound effects particularly for the parachute are quite poor.

Despite the fact that this game is frustrating as hell, it is still amazing. Graphically, right from the first spit second of the menu screen, this game is a thrill to play. Unlike DRP, this game says exactly what it entails, and that is the sound you'd be making if you were the protagonist in this game. You jump off a building, you scale buildings for points, you meet score quotas to earn stars which, in turn, earn you teeth which you use to unlock new levels. Again, like DRP, Dejobaan proves that you don't have to be complicated to be an amazing game. Just pair stunning visuals with great music and COUNTLESS levels. I've been playing this for a hours and i still haven't unlocked them all. And for a game where all you do is fall, that's pretty damn good.","April 8, 2013","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game, you are basically free falling from the sky, down towards a small landing pad in which the journey from point A to B is littered with obstacles that you must maneuver to obtain massive points by scoring tricks.\n\nControls are a little tough since even the slightest movements will crash you into the side of a building or you'll end up faceplanting some random obstacle at terminal velocity. There are plenty of levels and challenges to do so this game should keep you occupied for awhile. I'd say the difficulty of this game is up there and frustration is inevitable for certain challenges.

If this doesn't seem interesting to you then you need help.\n\nYou can graffiti buildings, flip off spectators, smash into birds, break through scoring glass, fly so close to rugged mountains that you'll lose your belly and ♥♥♥♥ yourself laughing at some of the in-game antics.\n\nBuy this game, you'll never regret it.","June 28, 2011","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Interesting concept, might play it again some day. It takes a while to figure out the controls and mechanics. The graphics aren't that excellent but they do their job.","December 9, 2010","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The continus movement combined with controls to deface buildings and gesture to NPCs provides a satisfying reward loop.","June 4","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
