Looks like devs did minor (and silent) update to fix most annoying problems. At this point I have no interest in full testing, so I just strike down few lines.\n\nGame is Ok, it's common 'run-'till-you-can' time killer, probably it was made for Android tablets and just ported on PC.\n\nActual problem is the fact that PC port was made awfully. Biggest flaws so far:\n• only one locked screen resolution (1280×720);\n• no full-screen, game windowed even if your screen smaller than 1280×720 — in that case you won't see some HUD parts or even whole down level of tracks Fixed; now you can switch to fullscreen with Alt+Enter;\n• godawfully made keyboard&mouse support: sometimes to hit in-game button you'll need to press Enter, sometimes (for pretty similar button) only Space or mouse will work;\n• wonky controls that can start flicker between two buttons for no reason;\n• cart can stuck in corners of screen, above track levels or even below;\n• no separated settings for sounds and music;\n• no volume settings at all (just 'Sound:On/Off' button);\n• Steam achievements for this game are broken: “Keep Going” just unobtainable for most people for no reason (see screenshot) Fixed: devs just removed broken achievement srom Steam.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506756311\nDevs abandoned this project and don't care about Steam version at all: I've tried to contact them directly, but got no answer.\n\nBuy only with significant discount and if you don't really care for things like achievements.","August 18, 2015","false","11.8"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","3"

It features typical smartphone game quest system - you will always get three small tasks to do and those will try to get you addicted to the game, making you getting better score meanwhile.\n\nIt's not a bad game but there's nothing worth mentioning besides its mediocrity. It's just an another typical endless smartphone one-button platformer with added buttons for rocket jump, crystal magnet and shield. There's no reason I would recommend it, as there are way better games in the genre.\n\nPros:- Mediocre platformer. It doesn't deserve hate but it also doesn't deserve any praise.\n- Upgrades and unlockable cart skins.\n- Full controller support.\n\nCons:- Nothing original or extra entertaining. If you don't get addicted to the well-known three task system, you'll get bored in few minutes.\n- Only a few Steam achievements. There could be an achievement for each in-game task, like in Beyond Gravity, but developers decided to use only six tasks for an achievement.","January 7","false","6.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Could be a mobile port but it's ok and funny. You can pickup max 3 earthworms in your cart (like extra lives). If you hit an obstacle you lose one. The aim is to come as far as you can. You can extend your record with collecting crystals (worth 500 gemstones) and pay some continues with them. Also a huge range of in-game achievements. Mostly you reach the Steam achievements before you unlocked every in-game tasks. And only the goals shown at levelstart count. Not if you hit accidently another one. That's a bug I think","February 13","true","5.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/recommended/371000/","agw_ottawa","Sheep!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/","420 products in account","Cave Coaster is blatantly a phone game ported to PC.  The simple control scheme and concept make it obvious. Phone games can still be fun, though, even if they have to be designed around hardware limitations that the PC doesn't have.  Cave Coaster, however, is not much fun at all.  Not even by phone game standards.  The gameplay gets tiresome after your third or fourth run, and controls seem glitchy and unresponsive.\n\nEven if you were playing on a phone, Cave Coaster would be a mediocre choice at best, but on PC, with so many better options available, it's not worthwhile at all.\n\n","January 24","false","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

My review is partially based on the price I paid. I recommend buying this game when it's on sale.\n\nI've played a few different coaster games, and the dash through the level as far as you can go types in general and I have to say this one isn't too bad. Even for something that's been ported from a mobile game.\nI've heard some people say it's hard to control...I haven't had any issues with that and I'm using a cheapo 20 dollar Dell USB keyboard...so I assume that's user input lag and lack of skill at timing jumps.\nThe main issue I have with this game is the fact that the music is repetetive and highly annoying, and that the objectives are flat and boring and could really use some diversifying rather than doing the exact same things only more. If those two things were fixed and more variety was added to the random generated levels and maybe the store was expanded a bit, it would easily be worth it's price, as it stands, it's really only worth it on sale.\nJust another Steam game with potential and not there.","December 7, 2015","true","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If that could be changed this game would be way better.\nI do recommend it, just because it's cheap and I don't think it deserved not to be recommended.","August 18, 2015","true","4.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Got it in a bundle with other 7 games for less than 2€, I can't complain.\nI allow myself to quote another user's final statement on the game, because it's 100% what I think of it: "I do recommend it, [...] because it's cheap and I don't think it deserved not to be recommended"","January 5","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scheper/recommended/371000/","scheper","Buck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scheper/","1801 products in account","This game is a reasonably enjoyable casual game. There isn't much to it, and gets repetitive fast. The main reason I can't recommend it, is because it's very buggy. Sometimes you'll fall through the tracks or a rope randomly, causing you to drop to your death. On occassion, the next sector doesn't load and you just disappear into the void. The hitboxes for the barriers are way too big; you could jump high over a barrel but still get hit. There aren't any exciting power ups, and skill doesn't mean that much in this game, so you end up just grinding for achievements.","November 16, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I used my controller and its not hard to use at all, someone else said that the keyboard controls are not the best so I would recommend using a controller if you have one.\n\nThe game itself is fairly easy and simple, good for a little while, best to play in small sessions as not to hurt your eyes.\n\nI got it for 99p, so for that price i'd recommend, however at full price I would not recommend. Good for 99p (was on sale) but I would not pay full price for it (usually £3.99). My advice is to get it on sale, play little by little when you need a little distraction and use a controller if you have one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordro8/recommended/371000/","lordro8","Olda Robot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordro8/","615 products in account","It’s time to relaunch Indie Game of the Week with a boom, of dynamite that is!\n\nCave Coaster is an addictive new Indie Game which sees yourself as a gem hungry miner who loves to ride the rails with his miner buddies and risk it all to claim as many jewels as possible before they fall from the tracks.\n\nWe’ve been taking our cart for a ride and here are our thoughts on the game.\n\nGameplay\nWell paced action keeps you playing at a speed that’s balanced enough for you to decide your next move but fast enough to keep you on your toes. As you progress so does the game, making it more challenging and adding more objects for you to understand.\n\nPower Ups\nCommon in most casual Indie Games are Power Ups as they offer the player a goal to aim for that helps to improve their game.\n\nFirst up we have the Magnet power-up, this one is designed to suck in all the gems around and help the miner collect more.\n\nTop Tip – Make sure to use the magnet when you’re in a section that is almost completely filled with gems as you’ll collect a lot more!\n\nThe Rocket is a big blaster, designed to help speed sections and progress at pace.\n\nFinally the Shield is used to defend your cart against damage, at first this will seem like a un-needed power up but what you quickly come to learn once the game develops is this is one of the most important.\n\nDefending yourself\nThe best ways to keep riding the rails for longer and progress more within a single run is by picking up friends along the way. Each miner in your cart can be compared to a life in terms of when you crash into a barrier you’ll lose one but be able to recover. Keep your cart full so when it starts getting hairy you’re prepared. As well as having a full cart of miners it’s important to keep an eye on your Shield power up and make sure it’s charged just in case. Using both these solutions will give you a much better chance at survival.\n\nUpgrades\nWant to boost for longer, feel stronger or collect more? Then you’ll want to upgrade your power-ups. Using the gems you’ve won and collected you can earn enough to level up and improve your arsenal of powers. Bored of your mine cart? Don’t worry they are unlockable too so keep hitting the caves and you’ll be riding in all sorts of vehicles.\n\nGraphics\nVibrant, full of colour and well crafted. Although when we played it didn’t display in a full screen we were still able to enjoy the rich environments of the caves.\n\nPublished Blog Post[www.dabs.com]","August 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"
