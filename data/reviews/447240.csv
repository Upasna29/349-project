You can draw on whichever 3 faces are closest to the camera, but you can also rotate the cube (and the already-drawn lines with it) to access the other faces.\n\nThe first trick is thinking about how the finished image should look when wrapped around the cube. The second trick is that you can't "pick up" your pen. This in itself adds two factors of difficulty:\n\nYou have to think about whether the shape has to begin at a certain node in order to be completed (you can't trace the same path twice)\nWhen you rotate the cube, the cursor doesn't move along with it. So if there's a linebreak in the puzzle, you have to plan the position of the cursor as part of your rotation.\nThere is some text-only narration between levels, and the dialogue is a bit stiff at times. I'm only a few dozen stages in, but it's solid so far.\n\ncube/10","April 12","true","0.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
