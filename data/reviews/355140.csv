The people have been captured by some bad guy who stole all the relics.   Jump, roll, and use weapon are your abilities.\n\nWhen you find a relic you have to take it to a pedestal and it opens up new areas, but there's no way to tell which relic is supposed to go on which pedestal so there's lots of backtracking and trial and error.  The gems and coins you collect don't seem to do anything, just add to your score.  You lose them when you die but other than that there's no penalty for dying, you can restart your progress in the same room.  The good things is you don't lose any keys or special items when you die.\n\nThe enemies always reappear in the same room even if you've killed them, so watch out.  There are simple puzzles such as switches that need to be hit.  Early on the enemies will die with one hit but later on they take more hits to die.  There are mummies, spiders, bats, and other such creatures.  You can't kill anything underwater so just avoid the jellyfish.\n\nThere's no life meter--you die if hit once.  But thankfully there is no fall damage, you can fall at any height.\n\nI've been playing for 2 hours and it says I'm 40% of the way through, so the game is probably pretty short, unless the later areas are tougher.\n\nGraphics are cute, cartoon, pixel style.  Very colorful.\n\nSound effects are okay, but I didn't hear any background music except for the opening screen.\n\nI like this game so far.  It's fairly easy, and I find it fun to collect the gems and coins.  People who like more difficult metroidvania games will probably be bored.\n\nUPDATE:  I spoke too soon about it being a short game.  I'm another hour or two in and only 49% now.  Mostly I'm wandering around places I've already been trying to figure out how to open up new areas.","April 16, 2015","true","2.9"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","2"

The basic controls are responsive and there are plenty of areas to explore, so it's an enjoyable game overall. If you're a fan of shorter, simpler games, this is an easy recommendation.\n\nHowever, if you have a lot of experience with other metroidvania titles, you'll notice many things this game lacks. There are no boss fights, you have no health bar (and thus there are no health upgrades to collect), and the only combat upgrade you get is a gun with extremely limited ammo. Upgrades feel more like keys, getting you past a few doors without really changing anything like if you got a double jump or a new weapon instead.\n\nThe map does show you where important items are (which is better than a lot of mediocre metroidvanias), but it doesn't show one of the main collectibles, so it's only of use for reaching the end of the game and not for completionist item hunting. Completionists may also be annoyed at the score mechanic - your score increases when you collect gems and coins, but when you die it resets to 0 and they all respawn. It feels out of place in a more exploration based game like this.\n\nIf all you want is a simple exploration game with light platforming, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you're looking for a deeper metroidvania experience with more completionist item hunting, you may be disappointed. I'd still recommend it on sale, though, as the basic gameplay is solid enough to be fun even though it's lacking more depth.","April 20, 2015","true","3.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Not as linear as some but it definitely has its flaws.   The jumping is very floaty and there isn't much emphasis on combat in the game overall.   The map also doesn't show doors, so finding a door that you didn't go through late in the game can be annoying.    There are no bosses, including at the end.   There are a lot of secrets however, so if you are the type who likes that sort of stuff there's some meat.  There are in-game achieves, but not on steam, which is a bummer as well.   It's not a bad game, but I'd recommend waiting for it to go on a sale.   For the asking price there are more robust MV's on steam.  The game took me a little over 3 hours, but I left a lot of secrets and some collectables out there.  Make of that what you will.","April 22, 2015","false","3.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The fighting is minimal, but adds a bit of action to the mix.\n\nI finished it in just under 5 hours, but did not get all of the secrets or special symbols. I could probably spend another hour or two getting all the symbols. Some of them looked like a decent challenge.\n\nYou pick up gems and coins along the way to increase your score. When you die, your score goes back to 0 and all the gems you picked up return to their position to be picked up again. I thought this was a was a bit odd. I guess the goal is to try for the highest score you can get without dying. It tracks and displays your highest score so far, but ultimately, the score means nothing. I still went out of my way to pick the coins up, and when I got close to a new high score, I tread carefully to try and get it higher.\n\nYou always respawn on the screen you died on so you don't have to run back from a checkpoint or anything, but the whole game is built around lots of backtracking and exploring.\n\nI don't see any replayability, so $9.99 may be a bit high for 5-7 hours, but it was worth it to me.","May 3, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The plot is  nothing special, but this kind of game really doesn't need one. I like that it's a metroidvania-style game where there actually are NPCs to talk to so you don't feel too lonely :P Gameplay is fun, controls work fluently and I love the egyptian theme. Like in every metroidvania game at first there are many places you can't go until you unlock certain items. If you are hardcore metroidvania-player this game might be too casual for you but if you are noob in these kind of games you are gonna love it. ItÂ¨s fairly short and there are couple of downfalls but in overall it's unique and fun game and I will definitely buy a sequal if there is ever going to be one. :)","May 21, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have given it a few chances and it never seems to hold my interest. If you are looking for a platformer or good "Metroidvania" type game then get "Ori: The Blind Forest" instead of this.","May 13, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

With some action elements mixed in. You have to navigate your way through an ancient pyramid defeating foes like snakes and mummies. The further you progress and the more you explore the more equipment you get. Meaning you can backtrack to certain areas that you couldn't access before.\nOn the way you also collect ancient relics and as the name states gemstones. Which if you die you loose.\n\n\n\nNow if you're looking for a couple of hours of gulty pleasure it might be worth it.\nBut I myself wouldn't recommend buying it on PC unless it is on sale. Especially when you can get games like Bastion for the same price.\n\nBut the port is quite good. Doesnt seem to be missing in any key features atleast not for a 2D platformer.\nWould be great if there were separate volume sliders tho.\n\nIf you'd like to pick this game up I recommend doing so on a mobile platform.\n\nI myself don't find it appealing... but as said if you are into casual gaming try picking it up.\n\nCouldnt make a video of the game becouse for some reason my capture software doesn't want to record it.\n\nHope The Rewiev was helpful.","April 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 13 of 39 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","13","39","2","0"

Controls were relatively tight, though the minecart section felt a little off. Completing the game took ~2 hours, and I have no desire to 100% the game. That's not a bad thing, I just feel like I've seen all the game has to offer in those two hours.\n\nThe achievement for liking the developer on Facebook seems very tacky.","September 20, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have enjoyed playing it but it has a few bugs.\n\nWhen I first loaded the game, some of the gems were not able to be collected. I had to restart the game in order to make them so. In my efforts to correct the error with the gems I noticed that the reset game function does not in fact reset the game, only being killed by one of the in-game enemies, choosing to port to camp, and then immediately resetting will make the game as though you have never played it.\n\nThat said, I am enjoying playing it on my computer as opposed to my tablet. The graphics are smooth and the controls less prone to mis-hit. I couldn't imagine playing any of my other IOS games on my PC, but with this one it works well.","April 6","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
