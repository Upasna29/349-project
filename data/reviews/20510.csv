It's inferior compared to SoC, and especially inferior compared to CoP. The Faction Wars system, one of the main selling points to CS, is confusing at best. You can side with three different factions in each area of the game (though you automatically side with one by default at the beginning), and then certain factions become hostile towards you. In return, you get the chance to earn extra jobs and top-tier equipment earlier than normal. The only problem is when you have to actually fight the opposing factions. You need to travel to certain areas of the map, take out any resistance you encounter there, and wait for backup to arrive. In addition, if any of those areas come under attack, you're expected to show up and help out. Thus, you sometimes wind up with scenarios where you're halfway across the map, and get a call from a lone survivor armed with a shotgun to high-tail it over to their position and kindly take out the group of seven guys all armed with military-grade automatic rifles, please. The worst part is that your opposing factions don't stay dead. I've captured every single point including the main base, and killed everyone I possibly could, and they just respawn the second you leave. The good news is, while you will still have to help your allies out, you still get paid a substantial amount of cash for taking out the main base, so it's not all bad, I suppose.\n\nWithout a doubt, the worst part of CS is the enemy AI. For the most part, it's the same as SoC, except for the fact that these enemies can use grenades. Even on lower difficulties, you'll be tapping the quicksave button every few kills just in case they decide to spontaneously send an entire squads' worth of grenades next to your feet. Even worse is the fact that the AI is ungodly accurate with those grenades. Wherever they throw them, they end up directly at your feet with a one-second fuse. It's not at all uncommon to watch an enemy throw a grenade in the wrong direction (as in, they're facing away from you), only to see it reverse directions in mid-air and teleport right next to you. This is especially bad on the final mission, where enemies literally spawn from nowhere armed with automatics loaded with armor-piercing rounds and grenades primed and ready. The most common thing I found myself looking for in CS was not ammo, or artifacts, or even money, as opposed to SoC. No, it was bandages and medkits to replenish any health I was losing from unfair grenades. If you're playing through on higher difficulties, your first priority is to find some armor that isn't completely terrible, and then stock up on as many healing items as you can. Otherwise, you most likely won't stand a chance.\n\nIf you're coming from SoC, you should know that the system for picking up artifacts is radically different than how it used to be. Where they used to be waiting on the ground in plain sight for you to just grab, they're now hidden in the centers of anomalies. You won't be able to grab an artifact unless you have your detector out (press the O button to pull the detector out, and press 2 to dual-weild it with your pistol), and unless the anomaly you're looking at happens to contain one. Most anomalies don't. Personally, I held off on artifact hunting until I got a better detector, but if you can deal with lots of trial-and-error and quicksaving, you're welcome to try.\n\nSpeaking of artifacts, not every piece of armor you find can actually equip them. For some, you need to take it to a person who can upgrade weapons and armor, and pray that they're capable of adding an artifact container or two. Thankfully, most armors can, although it will cost you a good amount of money, even more than upgrading a top-tier assault rifle. Speaking of upgrades, if you couldn't already tell, you can do that now. The same people who offer upgrades also repair your damaged weapons and armor (for a nominal fee, of course), sell you locations of stashes (which can also be found on dead bodies, although sometimes the person selling you a location will tell you what you can find before you open it), and offer you jobs which usually consist of "find information on a particular upgrade in a stash somewhere and bring it back to me". Keep in mind that you still need to find the stash first, as it's not marked on your map.\n\nCS has a much different atmosphere compared to SoC and even CoP. While the other two are generally dark and dreary, Clear Sky is actually rather nice. By comparison, I mean. It's still the Zone, after all. It feels a bit out-of-place compared to the other two, but given that this is a prequel and things aren't as bad yet, it's to be expected. The mutants are still there, so it's not too different, but it is certainly noticeable.\n\nAll that being said, I still think Clear Sky is a fun game. If you can deal with the grenades, the different atmosphere, and the gameplay changes from SoC, you shouldn't have any problems at all with it. Be warned that it is a STALKER game, and is prone to bugs and crashes. I got lucky and only had two with this one, as opposed to CoP which wouldn't launch for the longest time, and SoC which crashed several times and wouldn't let me begin a new game without freezing until I messed with the options. If these happen to you, the very first things you should try are running Steam as administrator, disabling the Steam overlay while in-game, and switching the lighting options to Static. Those will solve a large amount of the issues you'll encounter.","October 13, 2014","true","20.2"," 266 of 281 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","266","281","6","3"

Because of the radiation a lot of weird things happen , anomalies , mutated animals and other monsters and the most important thing , the artefacts which are small valuable objects made from the anomalies. You are a STALKER , a person who came to the "Zone" (area around chernobyll) to risk your life and get those valuable artefacts. In this game you will do a lot of things , make missions , fight people , fight animals etc\n\nThis game doesn't have any PRG mechanics but It doesn't need them , you have a whole map to exlpore , do mission and collect artefacts which you can then sell and upgrade your gear of buy new things.\n\nA new thing that was added was fraction system where you can choose a fraction and you can fight other factions , although that sounds really good I don't like the way it was made because even if you clear out a map of enemy troops and you leave the area 10 min later you will get a notification that an outpost is under attack even doe you cleared out the whole area which I personally hate!\n\nThey also added a new feature which I really like which is upgrading your gear so now money is actually really useful not like in SOC where after some time money was basiclly useless but now you need a lot of money and I found that it's way harder to get the money as well\n\nTo people who are returning form SOC there are few diffrences in this game like for example collecting artefacts which you can't see them no more , now you have to take out your artefact detector and come close to an anomaly and pray that there is one in there which personaly I don't like that system because artefacts are now super rare and It's rare that you actually get one that you can use for yourself.\n\nI reccomend this game to everyone! 10/10","October 24, 2014","true","22.0"," 503 of 611 people (82%) found this review helpful 183 people found this review funny","82","503","611","183","33"

Sounds fun enough?\n\nWell, the enjoyment you get from STALKER games is dependent on whether or not you're able to overlook and put up with all manner of errors, bugs and little idiosyncracies. I'm talking enemies with pistols turned into sniper rifles, a lack of healing items and grenades that land right at your feet from hundreds of feet away. These are amazingly atmospheric games and the worlds they have are so believable and well crafted it's just a shame that they quite often don't function the way they're supposed to.\n\nClear Sky is the black sheep of the series and by that I mean it's the game that most people agree is the weakest of the three. I still give this one a thumbs up because there really is nothing else like it and it is worth playing the entire trilogy if you're into them at all.\n\nBut this is still a deeply flawed game and you might want to check out some mods to get it running smoothly and make it a bit more forgiving.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDrXMQrclpY","March 28, 2015","true","10.1"," 127 of 131 people (97%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","97","127","131","14","1"

Maybe I had the difficulty pulled back a bit for that game. I can't quite remember.\n\nEven so, I don't remember "Shadow" being as downright mean as "Clear Sky" feels.\n\nYou will die. A lot. Continuously. I'm not really exaggerating when I say you should consider saving after anything whatsoever goes in your favor. Clear a group of attackers? Save. Take down a single hostile? Save. Walk forward for 30 seconds without getting irradiated, falling into an anomaly, chewed up by dogs, or shot? Save. Stand still for a few moments without anything bad happening? Save. Hear anything even mildly "story-based" in a conversation? Save. Just successfully saved a game? Save again.\n\nSeriously, I was more adept at hitting F5 than the default run-toggle key after only a short time.\n\nAnd be aware that it's possible (though unlikely) to save a game that won't completely reload. The engine will get to the "Synchronizing" stage and then hang.\n\nSave multiple saves at multiple times.\n\nOh, and you think you're pretty good with guns in videogames? Yeah - about that. In Clear Sky, here's how it works: Your enemies, even the dirt-poor bandits, fire munitions that can apparently home in on you in the dark from across the map. This behavior extends to individual shotgun pellets. Also, their grenades are seemingly possessed of a malevolent intelligence that WILL find you. Through walls. In the dark.\n\nNow, for your part, any weapon that is not a sniper rifle fired from the prone position has about an 80% chance of MISSING whatever it is you're trying to kill. You will fire entire magazines - and I'm talking about one shot at a time, not full-auto - and every bullet but one will guide itself to a point that is not the thing in your crosshairs. If you do hit something by micraculous happenstance, you will have to hit it many MANY times before it drops. This applies to the aforementioned bandits, and the well-equipped military. (It's just that the military kills you faster and takes twice the lead before they drop.) With the notable exception of the Bloodsuckers, any hostile you encounter can be expected to behave as though they were made of solid steel and wearing armor of similarly solid steel.\n\nYou, of course, are made of wet tissue-paper. Some decent armor will upgrade you to dry cardboard. The thin kind, I mean. Not the cool stuff that they make shipping boxes with.\n\nOh, and ammunition is pretty scarce. Also expensive. And the stuff you scrounge and sell to the traders? They buy it cheap. Some things they won't even pay you for. What they sell to you, naturally, carries a hefty premium. You can eventually build a stockpile of essentials, but it will take a while. It will also take a while because the fast-travel system (the guides) costs money to use, and you need to save that money for bullets. A trip to a trader that has anything worth buying often requires walking across nearly the whole world.\n\nGetting rewards for completed missions also follows that formula. That squad-leader you just risked life and limb for? No, he doesn't have the money with him. You have to walk all the way back to The Cordon for that measly 750 RU. No, he doesn't want to buy anything you have on you, except food and vodka. Have a nice trip! Hope you don't get ambushed on the way!\n\nAnd you should definitely build that ammo stockpile. As soon as you commit to a certain kind of weapon, you will go up against a horde of enemies that are carrying weapons chambered for whatever you DON'T prefer. It's almost uncanny.\n\nAlso, before getting rolled up into the endgame, make sure you have all the best gear that exists in the world. Otherwise, you will be like me. You'll get all the way to Chernobyl, and then the game will become effectively unwinnable because you're up against nearly invincible enemies that warp in and can magically shoot around cover. You will need lots of bandages - as in, every single one you can find, and probably ten more. Plus every medkit you can get your hands on, and the best armor in the game. All that, and 1000 rounds of AR ammo. And every bullet you can possibly get for two different sniper rifles. You might have a chance.\n\nAll of the above sounds terrifying and awful, but I also have to say something else: "Clear Sky" is oddly compelling. It took me almost 27 hours of getting abused by the game before I finally decided that I didn't care. Up to that point, I was thoroughly engrossed. The bleak, strange, and unsettling environment is intriguing, and the overall challenge somehow manages to make you want to try again (most of the time). Oh, and when the game decides to mess with your mind, it REALLY succeeds.\n\nSo, give "Clear Sky" a shot. Several shots, actually. Like I said, good luck with actually HITTING anything.\n\nGeeze.","April 27, 2015","true","26.5"," 109 of 112 people (97%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","97","109","112","67","1"

I have found my highs, my lows and then there has been a special place that doesn’t quite measure on the spectrum. S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Clear Sky seems to take that measurement system and throw it out the 10th storey window. I want to put it somewhere on the bar with the likes of Half-Life 2, but then no, it doesn’t quite add up. Whilst the game mechanics are very similar at times, I find myself comparing it more to Metro:2033… then again it often feels more like Fallout 3. There’s no denying it has similarities but doesn’t quite match any of them individually. The game has found a very small pocket within the genre to carve out its own place in game history as a deftly challenging, gritty & unique game. It combines elements of successful titles and throws them all together creating something new, inspiring, very challenging & brutal.\n\nIt is proof of truly evolved gaming that was made by gamers who have a great understanding of games & have refined it in a very Russian way.

You can find both of those mods on the ModDB page for Clear Sky (Road to Limank says that it hasnt released yet; it has, just follow the links on the page).\n\nAlso, you should get STALKER: Lost Alpha, a free fan remake of Shadow of Chernobyl, with loads of lore-friendly added content. I never played SoC, so I can't compare the two, but hey, it's free. Also, be sure to get Boredgunner's Lost Alpha Mod Pack 2014, which updates all weapon models, animations and sounds, adds 50-ish new weapons, and tweaks the economy to be more fair in terms of pricing and item availability (among other things... check out his ModDB page at http://www.moddb.com/games/stalker/downloads/lost-alpha-mod-pack-2014) . I am having a blast playing Lost Alpha, and you should be playing it too!","October 30, 2014","true","62.2"," 59 of 62 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","59","62","0","1"

It has numerous problems. Not the least of which is just a lack of focus. It recycles half of Shadow of Chernobyl's maps and has a less interesting story to boot.\n\nHowever, bearing all that in mind it is priced 10$ cheaper and features a rather unique "faction war" mechanic. This mechanic essentially has it so that all the different factions in the Zone do battle with each other in real time. The player can join a faction if they so desire, and doing so gives them ready access to better equipment and more friendly areas in the Zone. All in the hopes of taking over the Zone through pure conquest.\n\nThe faction war mechanic is extremely well done in this game, and is the reason why anyone plays Clear Sky to this day. Whether it is worth getting is really up to you, since it is the awkward middle child in the series.","June 26, 2014","true","28.6"," 59 of 65 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","59","65","0","3"

To recap after the 1st stalker game revision....this is based on the vanilla experience.\n\nAh, the prequel. Also, the game that the stalker community thought was forgettable. Me? I personally LOVED this game. Sure, it's missing a few things....namely hunger, and an all-around creepiness with some of the environments. But to counter, this game introduced some features that proved to be worthwhile; for instance, the weapon and armor upgrades and repair. Do the weapons and armor still degrade? Yes, but now you can enhance them with more armor plates, flex the durability, and even add protection against anomalies. It's needed because if you ask me, this is the hardest of the 3 stalker games. Just as is with the first game, once you get to a certain point, there's no turning back. So, be prepared for ANY situation again.\n\nThe story revolves around Scar, a mercenary that inserts himself into the faction war. Various factions are battling for territory in the zone in a race to reach the center. When a group of stalkers reaches the center, the zone changes and becomes more unstable, making the territory more valuable.\n\nGameplay is relatively the same with a few changes. First, the artifacts aren't just there for the taking this time. You need a detector to find the artifacts, which involves getting into the thick of the anomaly. The weakest detectors won't spot the best artifacts, so you need a top notch one to make up for the weaker ones shortcomings. This game also manages to feel less like a sandbox, only because as you progress through the story you are able to uncover more of the map. In other words, you're actually blocked from progressing far into the zone until you progress through the story. Once you get so far, then it's open for you to explore all over. Numerous players weren't fond of this because of the open nature of the 1st game, but i think it worked well here because it made for better pacing. You couldn't get the best weapon in the game very early, giving you a major advantage. Even the armor suits were paced better, as an exoskeleton suit COULD be given to you about half way through, but required some work on your part in joining the faction wars for Duty or Freedom. Better pacing equals more fun if you ask me. The stalker way is the hard way.\n\nArtifacts were not so abundant here, as each map in the zone contained a few anomalies, which hold artifacts. With less artifacts comes less money, which means upgrading or repairing was a little tricky because you had to draw the line between keeping an artifact or trading it in for a valuable upgrade. Less money also equals more fun. Stalker games are supposed to be challenging and this adds another layer of challenge. Of course, once you get so far and have your armor or weapons upgraded, then you can save some money for future use.\n\nThe AI has some improvements, but still has its pros and cons. The faction wars can be a bit buggy sometimes, as the AI isn't entirely supportive. You may find yourself doing alot of the work, and while this game is difficult as it is, i personally don't mind doing most of the work. It's a shooter.....you shoot things. The more the merrier.\n\nMost of the maps are reused from Shadow of Chernobyl, with the addition of a few new ones. The swamps and red forest are the highlights, creating a fresh change from gloomy landscapes to lush vegetation. Also, some of the reoccurring maps have been slightly altered to appear more lifelike. Remember, this takes place before the events of SoC.\n\nAll in all, i think this game gets a bad rap. What it is missing from other stalker games it makes up for by introducing some iconic stalker features, like the upgrades. Again, mods are a-plenty here, but do yourself a favor and play vanilla first...on MASTER difficulty. It's brutal again, and the difficulty spike is worse this time around in the end, so be even more prepared. While it still may not be every stalker fan's cup of tea, it's still part of the stalker lore that every fan should check out. It's my personal favorite of the 3 games, mostly for the reasons of the pacing and balance. Difficult as hell, borderline rage-inducing in the end, but still worthwhile. Crowning achievement completing this on master. Good luck stalker.\n\n9.2/10","November 26, 2015","true","361.9"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","56","62","5","3"

It's gritty world is unique and i have always had fond memories of this game series  (minus the endings for Clear Sky and Pripyat)... But no more on that.\n\nSo why do i play this? I play this because of TFW mod (The Faction Wars) - Few know about this awesome mod that gives you a ton of gameplay by removing the story and remaking the world to support factions. It's a free world now yet the area is so familar.\n\nIn this mod you start out as a loner without any equipment and it's up to you to try to survive. You'll need to eat, sleep and get paid. but that can be hard as there are no freebies in this game contrary to vanilla game. stashes are looted. corpses get looted right after the fighting stops and if you try to grab stuff that someone thinks belong to them they will confront you. Needless to say early game is hard but VERY rewarding. Later you will start doing faction missions - or continue to be a loner. It doesn't matter much what you choose. Point is the options are endless and there are so many routes to choose and before you know it the most limiting factor is your actual free time to play the game. I am looking forward to 50 hours+ of quality game time from this mod alone that executes just right the way faction wars should be.\n\nHere is a good place to start looking at mods that might tickle you the right way: http://cheeki.violates.me/","March 6, 2015","true","35.6"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","37","39","3","0"

It is recommended that you play Shadow of Chernobyl first, but not a must.  Although reguarded as the worst of the three, I still think it is a must play.  The beginning is slow and the ending is unfairly hard, with the everything in the middle being one of the most unique out of the three. Faction wars brings a whole new mechanic to the table. As long as you don't finish them completely off, one of the most immersive to me.  There are a few bugs in the game, and after finishing the vanilla game I played it with the STALKER Complete Mod.  This to me is a bugfix and not really a mod, since it really keeps the immersion of the vanilla game.\n\n=Open world atmospheric thriller\n=Side  quests and pda function more appropriately\n=Improved map and Pda\n=Weather is superb\n\nThe big downsdie to Clear Sky is the ending.  Yes there is a point of no return and if you are not prepared you may not be able to beat it. It is hard, ruthless and unforgiving.  Depending on your point of view you may be disappointed with the ending as well.

It's about the single-player campaign, with the Complete mod.\n\nI hope you liked the previous game, because you're essentially about to play it again.  Given that this one is a prequel, there are so many similarities in the environment (which is about 80% the same as the first) that you get a kind of wistful echo of adventures past (or rather, future).  It's a bit interesting to see what various parts of the zone were like before SoC.\n\nYou play as Scar, a merc who has survived emissions from the Zone for some unknown reason.  Once again you're chasing Strelok (really!?!).  The first time he entered the heart of the zone it set off an emission which was similar to a small cataclysm, setting all the factions against each other.  Your objective is to prevent him from doing it again, which would possibly produce a lethal emission killing everyone.\n\nThe new wrinkle this time is the faction system.  It's really just an extension of the old system, with some capture the flag type elements.  You can even take part in the initial war between Duty and Freedom this time around if you like.  Although the rewards are meager for this type of activity, it nonetheless makes the zone a far more dynamic place than it used to be, with NPC's shifting around constantly depending on who wins what fights.  Inconsequential, but you do get this vague sense that you have a hand in shaping the zone.\n\nThe combat system is still bull****.  I hope you weren't expecting any serious improvements.  Bullets still go wherever the **** they want, even with the Dragunov on occasion.  Enemy AI is just as bad, possibly a little worse (and that's with a patch to improve it!).  Even so, it is definitely satisfying getting the headshots with a scoped weapon.\n\nThis time around you can actually upgrade your weapons at various smiths, and find schematics to deliver to the appropriate npcs in order to get specific upgrades.  Kinda neat, and meant to extend the life of the game, but wholly unnecessary.  Same goes for your typical stash drops, which are now a part of NPC dialogues.  Fork over some dough for the information, and most of the time they'll tell you what's in it before you even leave camp.\n\nYou'll still reload frequently, but nowhere near as much or nearly as rage-inducing as the first game.\n\nI can't testify as to how bad the final mission is (remember the last one on SoC?).  My game permanently crashed on all saves about two areas before the end, so I had to watch the ending on Youtube.  It was moderately unsatisfactory, and frankly I'm glad that I didn't have to worry about however bad the last mission was probably going to be.\n\nA lot of other stuff is recycled.  The game looks a little better, but you can tell they didn't particularly try.  If you look at my play-time, I'm guessing it's about the same length as the first, maybe even a little shorter.  The shelf life was no doubt meant to be extended via multiplayer and dynamic zone faction wars.  This is Shadow of Chernobyl 1.5, essentially.  How much you liked the first game will directly determine if you like the second.","October 8, 2014","true","13.9"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","35","37","0","0"

But now, of course, like any other game in the series, a ton of mods are available for us to choose from and almost all of them include bug fixes and optimization features. Some of them stop there, upgrading the graphics a little, optimizing the game for you, and fixing common bugs and issues. Others, however, expand on the open faction system that this prequel provides. Unlike in Shadow of Chernobyl, this game allows you to interact openly and work with the factions outside of their main quest lines, going as far as joining them after reaching a certain status; and that's not just Duty and Freedom, that's almost any faction in the game.\n\nThe story, while not expanding too much on the events its predecessor, provide a little insight into what was going on in Shadow of Chernobyl and why it was happening, as well as revealing to you (Scar) information that Strelok did not know at the time. Don't get me wrong, Strelok is a cool guy, but Scar is probably my favorite character of the series. Either way, don't ignore this game because of earlier setbacks and whatnot, with the mods you have available now you can experience the game in almost a completely vanilla state (if you so wish) with all of the bugs and unoptimized mess fixed and cleaned up.\n\nAgain, an excellent series; the story, atmosphere, characters, and mod variety all make it worth its price.

Blends with FPS, survival and a touch of role playing elements, it was brutal, yet enjoyable experience. So when I hear that the next Stalker game was on the horizon (instead of waiting for seven years), I couldn’t wait to see what GSC Game World have in store. Well, just a year later, along arrives Stalker, Clear Sky (CS) – a prequel to SoC and sadly, also a lessor game in most areas as the new features like Faction Wars just didn’t pan out effectively.\n\nLike most open world games, it’s hard to say how long to beat it. For me, as I like to do literally everything and explore every nook and cranny, took me about 65 hours to complete, so I can safely assume average will be around 20 or so. Pretty decent with a good array of missions / side quests and diversions, CS is unfortunately a step down from SoC. The new features like Faction Wars and able to customise your weapons did not pan out well enough as actually, they are more of a hindrance or simply, not worth investing your time. However the emission blowout was pretty awesome due to its sudden nature. So if you are coming from SoC, expect to be disappointed however if this is your first Stalker game, it’s an enjoyable ride but expect spoilers. I guess you can view CS as a rock and a hard place.\n\nFull review here: http://www.gamespot.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-clear-sky/user-reviews/2200-12643375/\n\n7.5 / 10","April 14, 2015","true","62.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

This game can be a little annoying sometimes, because of how challenging the combat is, and how hard it is to afford new weapons and supplies, but that only adds to the realism and atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic game.

Tons and tons of human enemies to kill, but the atmosphere is completely lost.\nWhat made SoC and CoP great games was slowly passing though abandoned towns and desolated landscapes, looking for precious artifacts and watching your back from bloodsuckers and other mutants. If you want this in CS, you need to really force it upon the game.\nOn top of that, mind that most (all?) maps and locations are the same of SoC. I played SoC some 4/5 years ago and still got lots of deja vu. It can be nice, realising that you actually know this or that place, but feels a bit lazy somehow.\n\nOverall, I recommend it to STALKER veterans who want a challenge, but perhaps CoP with mods is a better choice. In any case, do not forget to install the Sky Reclaimation Project to fix bugs and enhance the experience.\nIf you have never played a STALKER game, play Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Prypjat first.

Of particular note is the fact that Bloodsuckers are invincible while invisible(whereas in Shadow of C̶h̶e̶r̶n̶o̶b̶y̶l Grenade they were still a pain to kill, but could be hurt no matter what phase it was in). If Call of P̶r̶i̶p̶y̶a̶t Grenade was the only STALKER you've played, then C̶l̶e̶a̶r Grenade Sky will serve as an unpleasant(or at least unexpected) surprise. For everyone else, you get to experience the mixed feelings that come from obsessively quicksaving before every major action and dying repeatedly to a̶n̶o̶m̶a̶l̶i̶e̶s grenades, r̶a̶d̶i̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n grenades, m̶u̶t̶a̶n̶t̶s grenades, b̶a̶n̶d̶i̶t̶s a noo cheeki breeki iv damke, and p̶s̶y̶c̶h̶i̶c̶ ̶a̶b̶o̶m̶i̶n̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶s blowouts.

It has too much "voodoo" supernatural bs to it (not that SoC had that at the end too).\n\nA word of warning, the factions cannot be completely destroyed (which kind of takes the whole point out of the faction war), the game is quite short and there is not much to entertain you when the main story arc is finished.\n\nHowever there is one big reason I like this particular S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and it is this video (CLICK THE LINK), which to me is comedy gold.","January 3, 2014","true","58.8"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","21","32","0","3"

Factions, war zones, balls to the wall, ect. If you played the "first" S.T.A.L.K.E.R. You will greatly appreciate this game. It takes place before the first game, and you definitely should play this game first to better apprecidate Shadow of Chernobyl. The gameplay is greatly improved upon, you can join the different factions, and then take out the enemy factions by capturing locations. Some new areas are opened up, but you also see areas that you have visited, if you played S.O.C, before they were damaged further and taken over by other factions.

You cannot survive more than a Couple Makarov bullets ripping through your flesh, but all the other enemies can survive so many rounds to the point that you are wasting your own ammo.

Less intense than Shadow of Chernobyl (SOC); less claustrophobic, less scary. But all the incredible atmosphere of this genre-bending series is intact.\n\nImpressively, compared to SOC, Clear Sky presents both a more linear main quest, and a more sandboxy world to explore.\n\nThere are some bugs in this game. The map for the city of Limansk... some people can't load games that are saved on this map, which makes it very difficult to complete the game. Because of the bugs, many people skip this title and move straight to Call of Pripyat.\n\nTo beat Limansk, I used the "Wish Granter” feature that is included in the Stalker Complete mods to spawn myself some allies to help me through Limansk without saving. (More on the "Complete" mods in the comments below).\n\nThe STALKER series is one of PC gaming's finest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxeel/recommended/20510/","dxeel","-P|T- DxeeL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxeel/","234 products in account","Personal review of: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky\nMods: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky Complete\nDifficulty: Master\n\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky is a sequel/prequel to the events prior to Shadow of Chernobyl. Taking place in 2011, where a second emission took place and created the Zone, a place filled with mutants, strange anomalies, and it's populated by STALKERS, basically scavengers/fighters/artifact seekers, you get the point. You play as Scar, a veteran STALKER chasing down Strelok when an emission hits and you are left incapacitated. You wake up at Clear Sky base, a swamp base where this faction is devoted to understanding the Zone and learning all it's secrets and uncovering the strange phenomens going on. After you finish a few tasks you are free to explore the Zone and side with whatever faction you want, explore and play the game. I won't say more than this since it took me 2,5 hours just to leave the Swamp areas (doing quests, exploring etc.), so the rest is up to you to find out. The game is built on the same X-Ray engine, with a few updated changes. Mainly the AI has been tweeked to fit the new faction war system, visuals have been upped, and many more changes have been implemented. As far as Stalker Clear Sky goes, almost all the weapons have been reused for this prequel, half of the areas too meaning you will revisit some familiar places while exploring new ones. Enemies, NPC's too, so you might find the actual content of this one a bit lacking. Onto more relevant changes, the HUD got reworked, being simplified, also the PDA got some new features, being able to track more easily your tasks, you can now see enemy/friendly factions on the radar, giving you a better understading of where they are being concentrated, etc. The hunger system has been removed, don't know why honestly, weapon upgrades are available, the way you collect/obtain artifacts has also been changed, to the point where you need to use an artifact detector to "see" them. This also implies you will have to walk into the middle of anomalies and hope you won't get killed before you collect them. Stalker Clear Sky has received some flak, being the "weakest" part of the trilogy, and I can see why. This game really kicks you in the balls, same as Shadow of Chernobyl, you start off really underpowered, with little to no ammo/supplies to push through the onslaught of enemies in the Swamp areas. Beware, playing this game and rushing the main storyline will result in a frustratingly hard game. I recommend taking your time and exploring, doing side-quests, parting with different factions as it will result in a much more relaxed experience. It's hard as ♥♥♥♥. There's no doubt about it. But why is it hard? All Stalker games are hard, there's no question about it, this is how these games were built, as an PC exclusive hardcore survival/rpg-ish experience, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky comes short in some areas. The thing is the atmosphere, lighting, texture quality is on par and beyond it's first game, but it falls flat in AI behaviour, there are less underground areas to explore (which were a highlight), side tasks include a lot of fetching and killing. These are the most basic things about it. Then we move into combat, wich remains largely unchanged except for one thing. Grenades, I can't stres enough how annoying this addition is, not only will NPC's hit you 90% with them, they will also result in an instant death on higher difficutly levels, which is not very Stalker like. We all know how you can't really take cover in these games, being surrounded by anomalies, high radiation levels and NPC's throwing grenades makes the combat feel unfair at times. Also the fact that they still use the same weapons as you use, only with 100% accuracy and 0 bullet drop is just horse ♥♥♥♥. Seriously. My main gripe with this game is the combat. It feels so random and so luck based that it's the single thing that really kills this game. Don't get me wrong, this is a massive game, with tons of stuf to do, but when it comes to combat (being an FPS game also) it sucks. It just ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. Bullets dance around hitboxes all the time, it feels like when you shoot in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky you play roullete or you roll the dice. It all comes down to what the game wants to hit, not you. Fully upgraded weapons feel the same, so there's no excuse here. Secondly, the last part of the game (Once you reach Limansk) is just A grade bullcrap. This whole area is designed around enemies placed in hard to reach/predict areas, Monolith soldiers are so buffed, I died almost 50 times in the last part of the game alone. Seriously, a fully upgraded suit will only serve to protect you against 2-3 bullets maximum. There are also a lot of engine crashes here and plenty of bugs, so expect to be disappointed near the end of the game. And now, we have to move to the Chernobyl NPP area. SPOILER ALERT Once you reach Chernobly, this is where the game was at it's worst. First off, there are so many enemies at once, it's likely you will die 90% of the time without any chance of shooting back. Why? They never miss, they take 10-15 bullets to get killed. Also you're presured by the fac that you have to hit Strelok with a gun that isn't effective at all against all the Monolith soldiers being spawned  in this area. This last level is probably one of the worst I've ever played. No joke, hitscan enemies everywhere, almost 0 cover and little or no indication to what you're supposed to do or where Strelok is, I'm not asking for a ♥♥♥♥ing bullseye above his head, but seriously the minimap is useless here, and so are the teleporters, serving only to confuse the player. Want to know how ♥♥♥♥ this level is? It took me one hour to finish it, only because I died constantly and 70% of the time I was loading my last save game. When I did finish it, Strelok got stuck in an area off screen, seriously, he was outside Chernobyl and I was able to snipe him only to get the ending which only disappointed me. I played SoC and CoP and those game featured multiple endings, to my delight, here it's just the same 30 seconds cutscene, which I won't discuss for the sake of your own discovery. Anyways, let's cut the crap since this game is from 2008 and I've talked so much already nobody is going to bother reading this anyway, so here is a small list of what works and what doesn't in the 2nd Stalker instalment\n\nThe good:\nSuperb atmosphere\nAmazing lighting effects\nAstounding weather changes + the seamless shifts from day-night\nFaction wars\nWeapon customization\nImproved HUD + PDA/Map system\nRefined visuals, better draw distance and richer enviroments\nHuge sandbox\nThe bad:\nRecycled enemies, weapons, enviroments make this Prequel feel like they used cut content/turned a boxed expansion pack into a standalone title\nHorrible gun mechanics, play it for yourself I can't explain it (note: I didn't play the vanilla version, I can't imagine how bad the guns perform in the base game)\nThe beginning and ending of this game are atrocious. Honestly\nFewer underground areas, which were a highlight of this series\nThey removed the hunger system, the stamina system sucks in this, making it feel less survival compared to SoC and CoP\nLack of impact on the overall arch of the story, no matter what faction you chose, it all boils down to what gear you obtain, rendering the whole "choice" of it all utterly useless.\nLess russian dialogue and voiced lines, rendering the immersion to a bare minimum in this title.\nLittle to non-existent expansion on the Stalker universe&lore.In the end, I can only recommend S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky only with Mods, I've tried it with Complete only, but I still recommend it, there are few games that come close to it.

O jogo começa bem, open world como o primeiro, te dando opções pra completar as missões, escolha de facções pra uma faction war q parece interessante. Depois começa a frustração. O jogo se afunila e fica linear como um Call of Duty, matando qualquer tipo de exploração e uma ♥♥♥♥♥da de situações scriptadas. O faction war não funciona: você limpa e captura pontos, mas seus aliados não ocupam o local, e qdo vc sai os inimigos simplesmente voltam. Você então desiste do Faction War e foca na story line. Mesmo na dificuldade Normal, os inimigos conseguem te acertar mesmo q você esteja sem 1% do corpo a mostra - atras de cobertura. Conseguem dar tiros certeiros q tiram metade da sua vida. Pra piorar, sua armadura tem durabilidade e a única forma de consertar é com NPCs, e custa caro e nem sempre você tem acesso a eles, principalmente da metade pra frente do jogo, qdo vira um rollerscoaster. A última fase então é um ♥♥♥♥ fest: tem "tempo limite", inimigos q teleportam na sua frente e atras de você, com screenshake atrapalhando sua mira, e você tendo q correr contra o tempo.\n\nComo eu disse, o jogo começa bem e termina horrivel. Ele parece ser superior ao SoC por melhorar algumas coisas, como gunplay e facções q realmente fazem a diferença, mas nope, é tudo muito raso. Os gráficos e a ambientação são lindos. Mas é isso. Vale a pena se você tiver muita paciencia, curtir a série e visitar a Zona um pouco diferente.","May 26, 2015","true","22.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

If your into first person or any open world shooter this is the game for you. Not only is clear sky good but they have other games in the series such as shadow of Chernobyl or call of pripyat. The stalker series would of been amazing if they haven't of given up on the stalker 2 game but they did and now the licence was grabbed my bit composer, which is making the game survarium a look alike to the stalker series turned into a first person mmo shooter. Over all of this game i have to give it a 10/10. i don't want to be a graphic's ♥♥♥♥♥ but the game was made a while back so don't expect far cry or skyrim graphics.\n\nNow i'm going to go into the dynamics part of the game. The game is very immersive. you can spend around 1-5 hours on this game and get back to the real world like "What just happened?" In this game in the series (Clear Sky) you play as a mercenary named scar. you were able to survive a emission which is a blast of radioactive energy that kills anything that is stupid enough to get caught in one. during this game you will encounter mutants, bandits, and anomalies. Mutants have very nice models; The Pseudo dogs for example, they have very nice facial features witch can really be frightening at the night time play through's. The Players in this game don't have the best AI as they might hide behind something that is not as much "cover" and they will shout obscenity's at you in Russian as you fight them. This is the only game were i believe the bandits don't kill you on site, unlike on shadow of Chernobyl were they just are marked as enemy.\n\nIf you buy this game, don't. just save for the bundled pack of the stalker series because during a sale, like the winter sales event you would be able to pick it up for 15 bucks, as did I. The game is GREAT! if you know anyone that is into lore as skryim you can get into the lore in stalker. it may be dark and a bit freaky but it will amaze you in the lifestyles and hardships that they face every day.\n\n***** Five stars, Buy this game!\n\noh, it also has a terrible multiplayer.... but who cares right?","February 12, 2014","true","13.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But it isn't, your in a Cordon zone of the Chernobyl area that has been abandon since April of 1986 due to NPP4 catastrophic failure rendering the environment hazardous to live in. Yes, the place dose exists for real, all locations are based on real locations in the real zone. Life is still going on everyday for the people out side of the zone. The Stalker game series is inspired off the book "Roadside Picnic", which is a short science fiction novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky in 1971. More information on this book is available on a wiki, and the book is also available in English now.  The game is a open world exploration as well as mission directive, Remember that.\n\nClear Sky has its bugs elements but I like the game and has been fun, I been in the zone here since the first release of the dvd of the 1.0 version.  Here your in the Cordon off Zone in which has become a prison. You can get in, but you can't get out.\n\nThere is trading with traders, and different factions that may or may not care for you. Many dangerous anomalies to contend with, and artifact to collect and sell for money. Have to watch out for the areas that are radioactive still. One of the things to remember is question everyone and trust no one. Being skeptical with a gut feeling at times is better than a fire fight, When in this game it is important.\n\nThe annoying draw back in this game is the bug issues, for some reason even a updated version of the game on steam has not cleared bug issues that rolled over from the 1.0 of the game. For this game, mainly if you plan to use a mod, you really need to have at lest 4gigs of ram for the best results. It works on win7 64 bit, but there has been complaints pending Operating systems causing issues with the game. You may want to check in the forums. Due to the buggy issues I normally would not recommend the game, but Others had been able to play the default game and complete it. And the stalker community out of many I have seen is the most helpful there. It seems every stalker dose what they can to help you. And a good community like that is a nice thing to have.  Makes it hard not to recommend the game.\n","December 23, 2015","true","63.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","27"

In clear sky you play as a mercenary called Scar who is able to survive emissions and ends up working with the faction Clear sky, whose goal is to stop Strelok from reaching the middle of the zone where it is believed something catastrophic with happen.\n\nClear sky does add a few new things into the game since now you can upgrade and repair weapons and armour, artefacts are much rarer and you need a detector to find them, you now have guides who can take you into different places, you can side with most factions, you now need slots for artefacts and you must have a minus radiation value artefact if you have a plus radiation one to counter it otherwise you will slowly die of radiation poisoning, and the hunger and thirst system was removed so food now just acts as health items and energy drinks are just to boost your stamina, but other than that this is very much the same as shadow of Chernobyl.\n\nClear sky also improves a few things that were in shadow of Chernobyl, the map and PDA have been improved, most of the weapons are a bit more accurate than the previous game but they still aren’t great, moving is no longer headache inducing, and thankfully loading quick saves won’t cause the enemies to go back to their starting positions which can be right next to or in front or behind you and you'll get killed instantly.\n\nThis is still a strangely compelling game but it still comes with problems from the previous game and it adds its own.\n\nThe gunfights aren’t anywhere near as to what they were in the previous game but it is still a little random on whether you’ll get shot or not and the damage output.\n\nThe amount of bandages and med kits used to stop you from bleeding out is random to the point where sometimes it will only take one bandage, but other times you can go through all of the bandages and med kits in your inventory.\n\nThe map is incorrect with the directions used to go to this one area that’s south east of the red forest, you’d think you’d have to go to the exit pointing south east but that takes you to Garbage, you actually have to go to the NORTH exit point to get to the area that is SOUTH EAST of the red forest.\n\nThe height difference between standing and crouching is two or three inches.\n\nEnemies can now throw grenades, they can throw grenades from over 100 yards away and they explode a second after they land and this is really annoying when you are trying to kill a group of enemies only to have a few grenades land at your feet.\n\nYour weapons jam far too often.\n\nJust like shadow of Chernobyl getting this game all comes down to whether you think you can put up with these problems and I actually enjoyed this a bit more than shadow of Chernobyl to a certain extent.","June 21, 2015","true","33.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I havent played enough to talk about this story-wise yet, but gameplay? Well, it isnt much different than the other two games and i'll even admit the NPCs in ClearSky came off pretty smart compared to the other two games. Thats about it. Rest of the gameplay is either up to par or slightly lacking. CoP had more beautiful enviroments, and SoC was generally more dramatic.\n\nThis being said, ClearSky is the least awesome but still pretty awesome. I highly recomend this game, as well as the other two.\n\n\nNow, I would've given SoC a 9.5/10 and CoP would get a 9.6/10 but I think i'd have to give ClearSky an 8.3/10.\n\nIt is a great game, just not as great as the other games in the series.","December 27, 2013","true","17.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

At that point the game opened itself up to me, and I'm loving it nearly as much as SoC.\n\nLike the original, it's initally unforgiving, with an excellent soundtrack and a seriously ominous and unnerving world. The map is improved to give the player more detail as to who is around them and what their function and intentions are, and the interactions between the different factions are a lot easier to interpret, which makes intervening and helping people out a lot easier.\n\nYou spend a bit of time re-treading old locations, which can be a bit disappointing. However, the areas are occupied by different factions with different goals and it's kind of nice to see how the area changed over time between this game and the SoC, to which Clear Sky is a prequel.\n\nIt also has some new graphical features, particularly when it comes to lighting, that really brings out some more polish in the game's visuals, and makes any action performed during nightime a terrifying affair.\n\nThis is not my favourite of the Stalker series - that remains SoC - but the world is still compelling and oppressive as balls, and the core mechanics are more refined than those of its predecessor, so it certainly is worthy of the player's attention after finishing SoC.","September 26, 2014","true","21.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's much more refined than SoC and when I moved it was a big breath of fresh air and looking back made SoC seem a bit more flawed than it was on the first play. Clear Sky was one of the first RPG orientated games I was able to complete, but looking back the startup was a bit rough. I can really compliment the sense of progression and direction of the game, as well as being a decent length and engaging enough to play the game til the end. It's not one of the best games i've played but definitely worth the purchase if the price drops down.

Clear Sky" - Review\n\nGameplay:  6/10\nThis second installment "Clear sky" leaves something to be desired. Some elements were indeed improved upon such as weapons: dynamics, upgrade-ability and inaccuracy. The use of image blurring also added more depth. This certainly made the game much more fun. A slightly larger world (even though some of it is lifted straight out of the first game) was just what it needed.These things worked well.\nThey've taken the game to an exciting new level by going deeper into the RPG genre (e.g. goods trading etc) which unfortunately has come at the expense of the 'first person shooter' gameplay, and the game suffers for it. It's no-longer balanced; it simply doesn't flow as well as it's predecessor. Going from story to action feels like segments of contrived scenarios of RPG then FPS then RPG then FPS. Even though things happen in-game and around the map without me being there (living world) overall it leaves me feeling more like I'm being taken for a ride rather than being an integral part that sways the flow and outcome.\nBy half way into the game the shoot outs were predicable and by the end of the game the shooting scenes were frustrating unless you have upgraded armor and guns.\nInitially it seems like a lesser game than the first one but it gets better the more you play it. It's not a bad game; if you can forgive it's minor short comings it can still be lots and lots of fun.\n\nGame ambiance: 7/10\nStandard S.T.A.L.K.E.R. ambiance which is nice as expected. Leaves, birds, rain, wind and weather.\n\nReliability/Stability: 4/10\nInstallation was easy enough (both DVD and Steam versions) but in-game there quite a few bugs. Some around AI, the faction wars and some were graphics related. Stability hugely varies depending on the PC.\n\nStory/Plot: 4/10\nThere were some new ideas expressed which were a lot of fun. However, once you strip away the faction wars and take a good look at the story there's not much there, the overall plot was weak and lacked depth which added to the games segregated feel.\nWhile there is a bit of a twist (if you can call it a twist... more like an interesting angle) i don't much care for it. All i can say without giving anything away is that I felt like all my work in the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game was done for nothing, and then undone.\n\nConcept: 8/10\nI get the impression that at the beginning of the "clear sky" project the game developers had a good range of ideas, then somewhere along the line they got lost in what can only be described as a quagmire of loose ends and poorly finished tid-bits.\n\nConcept execution: 6/10\nIs should have been a well rounded, a matured concept.\nFaction wars extend what could have been a short game into an epic one. The novelty of joining factions was fun initially but when it eventually looses it's luster you realise the only motivation for acquiring money in the first place is for weapons. Which is OK, big guns are cool.\nThe AI is a little better but buggy; rather than going around you the AI guys push you out of their way and straight into the line of fire.\n\nTextures: 8/10\nThe textures were a great improvement on the first game. There is a warmer feel, they are more sharp and use some more modern features. Although the settings will have to by played with to get optimum results.\nI love that the PC's in the game use Norton Commander.\n\nModelling: 7/10\nThere really weren't many new elements (most were from the first game). What it does have looks good though.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nThe graphics are a vast improvement; 'Clear sky' does blend each element better than the first game and it certainly added to the overall look and feel. Even though the draw distance could have been greater.\nThat being said, there could have been much more work done in the way of OOP. As on many systems there is a huge draw of resources for graphics that shouldn't require it.\n\nSound: 7/10\nSound too was an improvement compared to the first game. Clean, clear, crisp.\n\nMusic: 5/10\nThe dynamics of the music was good even though the style was not my personal preference, but hey, it's art. There were some song elements that were from the first game and other songs that sound like songs from Mech Warrior: Mercenaries that didn't make the final cut.\n\nAdjustable shadow mapping: No\n\nBonus/Extras:\nSpecial edition comes with - Novel Book (Russian), Zone map, extras DVD, Instruction manual, bandana, zippo lighter, dog tag, poster, Russian calender circa 1985, random faction badge and a ball that lights up with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. on it.","July 17, 2014","true","138.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The glitches are more noticable and don't blend in as well with rest of the environment like in the first game, but on the whole none of them are game ruining.  Ultimately all of the issues can be smoothed out with community mods, that are abundant to say the least, and can be found in the forums and support pages.

It's much more refined than SoC and when I moved it was a big breath of fresh air and looking back made SoC seem a bit more flawed than it was on the first play. Clear Sky was one of the first RPG orientated games I was able to complete, but looking back the startup was a bit rough. I can really compliment the sense of progression and direction of the game, as well as being a decent length and engaging enough to play the game til the end. It's not one of the best games i've played but definitely worth the purchase if the price drops down. Just promise yourself to play it, it's a more than decent game.\n\n\nI also felt a lot less ripped off by the ending compared to SoC's true ending.","January 22, 2014","true","38.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The character is a mercenary but is not part of the faction "Mercenaries" and he was able to survive 2 emissions that affected his nervous system ( this leads to blurry moments during gameplay).The story takes place in The Zone and your task whether you like it or not is to help the Clear Sky faction find out who is messing with The Zone until The Zone turns every living beeing into ashes.\n\nClear Sky brings new dangerous areas with new quests, a new anomaly called "Space Anomaly", taxi, improvements to the graphics ( like dx10,sun shafts etc ) and gameplay.The user is now able to repair and modify equipment (guns and suits) with the help of data found on usb sticks ( the mechanics will ask for these for advanced changes) and join factions after helping them defeat their rivals but beware you are neutral to all {except monolith and some mercenaries} and taking part in their wars will set your status "at war" with the faction they're at war. Artefacts aren't spread all over the map like in SoC and since they're produced by anomalies they can be found only in anomalies,invisible to the naked eye but visible with the help of detectors. Almost every settlement has a taxi that can lead you in places ( not everywhere) if you pay him.\nThe game opens the path for Stalker Shadow Of Chernobyl but doesn't give new info on The Zone.\n\nPersonally I recommend playing this as vanilla for a true STALKER experience then you can mod it and enjoy unexplored areas.\n\nPros\n-Work for artefacs ,money and everything else.\n-Awesome game\n-Taxi for fast travel\n-More than one entry in some areas\n\nCons\n-Game has a good chance to crash at the Deserted Hospital, the Red Forest and Limansk resulting in corrupt saves (saves are lost)\n-Cheap Swamp quests\n-No direction whatsoever for quests from mechanics etc.\n\nFor a true STALKER there are no cons.\nGood hunting Stalker.","December 3, 2013","true","63.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In short, if you like any other STALKER game you should give this a playthrough.\n\nThis game lacks the bleakness and some of the atmosphere found mainly in Shadow of Chernobyl but also Call of Pripyat. The Zone is very populated by NPCs compared to other STALKER games which very much contributes to the fact that the environment feels less hostile. Compared to the 4 horror centric underground areas of SHoC, Clear Sky only has one that is less frightening compared to the SHoC counterparts. Compared to unmodded SHoC, Clear Sky is in many ways a bit more polished in terms of better animation quality, graphical effects and user interface. Clear Sky also introduces a much welcomed weapon upgrade/repair system that was absent from SHoC.\n\nWhile I generally think that the first time you play a STALKER game it should be unmodded I would say that I make an exception for Clear Sky. Clear Sky unmodded has some issues that are flat out annoying and I would consider it bare minimum to install the Sky Reclamation Project (latest version as of 2015-06-30 is 1.0.4) to fix most of those issues. SRP is still pretty close to a vanilla experience and is provided mainly to fix various bugs.\n\nI would also like to mention the following mods that doesn't impact gameplay but makes it look a bit better.\nAtmosfear 1.3 - Improves weather effects, improves game atmosphere (This is also available for Call of Pripyat)\nAbsolute Nature/Structures - High resolution texture mods that makes things look a bit more crisp (This is also available for Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat)","June 29, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Probably, the story wasn't anything too interesting, feeling like a creation from a decision basedo on the success of ShoC.\n\nThe grenade bugs are frustrating, the endgame pales in comparison to ShoC, but the improved graphics and envrionmental story telling are incredible. Limansk is one of the most involving settings to any video game, and that cut content teleroom gives me the creeps.\n\nFaction Wars is probably the best idea to happen to the series although its implementation is so-so.

So use eFX if you want DX10.\n-God rays mod: it makes the game look awesome (and it didn't affect performance in my case).\n\nAlso, don't install Shaders max mod; it has a lot of compatiblity issues and it affects the performance negatively instead (as the mod author states that it affected half of the users).\n\nWarning: I somehow like the game, but I am on the negative side. I am done with it at this point. I do enjoy obsecure games with meh gameplay, provided that they have other redeeming qualities, but gunplay in this game is simply bad.\n\nPros:\n-Good atmosphere.\n-Nice graphics.\n-Great gameplay/survival elements.\n-Factions and collecting artifacts.\n\nCons:\n-Extremely bad gameplay.\n-Badly optimized.\n-Hypersensitive when it comes to modding.\n\nSummary: Don't waste your time with this outdated, dysfunctional piece of crap. If you want to play it, install mods BEFOREHAND and WASTE a large amount of time. I really liked it at first and liked its aesthetics; I am simply disgusted at the fact that I wasted over 5 hours trying to get the damn game to work after installing a couple of mods, and trying to deal with the shooting mechanics. I am 10+ hours into the game and I will not restart just to install a mod that is essential to play the weakest entry in the series.\n\nI will start with the most important thing in  video games: gameplay and how functional it is. Clear Sky is not only the weakest entry in the series (supposedly lacking in atmosphere but it is my first Stalker game), but it is utterly unplayable (once you start fighting things and shotguns miss at point blank range) and makes you wonder if the developers/game designers have been exposed to an excessive amount of radiation to even THINK of such game mechanics--the stupid RNG accuracy.\n\nFirst and foremost, shots are based on RNG, which means you will miss 30ft shots and have to waste a magazine at least to land a SHOT; enemies have a huge amount of HP and they have absurd accuracy and aggro mechanics. I am obviously talking about the hardest difficulty in the game, but shooting is dysfunctional either way; the game is simply boring on lower difficulties. Also weapon jamming (RNGesus), bad maps/no cover when you attack a base, stealth doesn't work properly, FRIGGIN SWAY THAT LASTS HALF A SECOND WHEN YOU MOVE AND AIM, slow aim, slow weapon switching, slow reload...etc. The combat is ****.\n\nWith that said, you HAVE to install mods in order to have fun on normal difficulties or something functional on the highest difficulties, which brings us to how crappy is the game when it comes to modding. You will spend hours just troubleshooting and figuring out in the end that there is some shader incompatibilty or some crappy dll file missing. And the worst of all is having to restart a new game when you install an overhaul or other types of mods.\n\nAnother point is the optimization and lack of a proper Antialiasing. The latter completely destroys the performance when you max out the game on DX10.1. I ended up with a much better game that runs on high frame rate and looks good with godrays  mod, but jaggies and transparent object edges are there; 2x is the most subtle option. Trying to use SMAA or FXAA injections means you have to use DX9, so good luck making a decision there.\n\nThe good point is that the game does feel and look atmospheric, but the combat is an utter piece of crap. The best course of action is to play CoP or SoC (if you can bear with wasting time trying to mod that crap).","July 20, 2014","true","18.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

What can I say? An aweful lot, but I'm going to keep it short. This review will touch on two aspects of the game; modded and unmodded.\n\nModded\nI'm recommending this game because of mods. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is among the most moddable game series out there. Despite this game being the weakest in the series, mods can quickly turn it into one of the strongest, if not the strongest. I've put more hours into this than I have into say, Shadow of Chernobyl or even Call of Pripyat (though between Misery and the recent release of Call of Chernobyl for CoP, my CoP playtime is catching up.\n\nWhy? Simple really. A single mod called 'The Faction War' or TFW for short. It takes a wonderful mechanic brought into the series (but removed for some reason in CoP) and turns it into something more. What might this feature be? Faction wars, of course.\n\nJoin one of the many factions and fight for supremacy, or go alone in the zone and fend for yourself against mutants, bandits or any factions you decide you don't like. It turns the game into an RTS of a sort, with reasonably large scale firefights - or, if you want to, quiet night-time operations.\n\nUnmodded\nThe game is good without mods, but it is arguably the weakest in the series. It has an number of bugs which can be fixed through the use of mods and community patches. Other mods serve to enhance the story and gameplay, so by now you're getting the picture.

I ended up waiting until I was done with CoP before doing it and really there isn't much more to be said about CS or CoP that I didn't say in my SoC review.  These games are fantastic.\n\nI've never played more atmospheric games than this series.  The story-telling is also similarly great.  CS takes you back before SoC and gives you a TON of backstory on why and how the events in SoC came to be.  GSC didn't change much of the gameplay elements for CS, which was genius because why ruin a good thing?\n\nThe S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games are all great and should be experienced together.

The game is clearly influenced heavily by call of duty, which was released just before this. The vanilla game crashes a lot, enemies are quite powerful and grenade spam is common. Bugs are extremely common, and the level design is quite poor.\n\nSome of the freedom of approach is deliberately limited for no reason. For example, in one instance a machine gunner is immune to bullets until you can get behind him and shoot him, even if you have a sniper rifle and can already hit him in the head.\n\nMost of the changes to gameplay are negative, and you will be spending most of the time desperately managing your bleeding.\n\nHowever, it does add a lot more to the story than call of pripyat.","December 10, 2012","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an okay game, but a decent entry into the series. This game is a prequel to Shadow of Cernobyl. Clear Sky contains the entirety of Shadow of Chernobyl's map, with two new zones included; however, this makes playing the game seem like more of an expansion than a standalone title. Clear Sky lacks the pacing that was present in the first title. Within 10 minutes you're loaded up with a pistol, assault rifle, ammo, and medkits. Compared to Shadow of Chernobyl, this game is a lot more action oriented. I finished the campaign with about 650 Stalker/Military/Faction kills, and 100 mutant kills. With so many kills, the gameplay began to feel a bit stale. My favorite part about Clear Sky was seeing how my actions affected the future game. I recommend playing Shadow of Chernobyl first, and following up with this game for the backstory. Overall, I would suggest you skip this title unless you are a big fan of the series; although, I highly recommend the first game.","May 1, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had heard about a ton of bugs in the game but i didn't encounter them i think the only bug i had was later in the game i was about to go to CPP and i had to go do some small quests first, well a emission hit and i got stuck and kept dying so what i did was i used my sleeping bag i got from the mod i had (CS Complete) and i slept through it, afterwards every trigger was broken and i had to reload my save to get enemys to spawn or triggers to work and such.\n\nGraphics- A lot of people will say the graphics are ♥♥♥♥ and aren't very shiney and new, well i feel that actually adds to the game because while playing newer games like Payday 2 some of the graphics would cause problems with aiming or trying to see a target, while in this i don't have those fancy lens flares or whatever getting in my way while trying to shoot a enemy from far away,\n\nStory- The story is kind of ♥♥♥♥, i love it and all but i just can't get into it, it is hard to follow sometimes and some missions just have these massive walls of text, don't get me wrong i love games that have a good story and such but it is like mass effect it has so much text that it just kind of slows the game down and makes me want to take a nap and stop playing. Now i don't want to spoil it so i won't really speak about the mission or the ending but i will tell you that you want to stock up before going through red forest because there are a lot of high paying missions in there that you don't want to fail.\n\nWell if you read through my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review that i probably ♥♥♥♥ed up in many parts congrats now you get to see some numbers!\n\nI give S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeertWillows/recommended/20510/","GeertWillows","Geert Willows","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeertWillows/","208 products in account","S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky is a direct prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl and it's events shed some more light on what went on before SoC and why stuff happened the way it happened. The Zone is also way less of a hostile place in terms of enviorments. The early areas even seem like a cool place to hang out for any man, and the weather is simply splendid from time to time.\n\nThe fact that this game takes place before SoC also means some gameplay-wise changes. For example; the artifacts the Stalkers are after are way less common. This means that you'll actually have to hunt for them now, making you actually feel like you're doing what SoC told you Stalkers do: they *hunt* for artifacts. The artifacts themselves also have been redone in terms of bonuses they provide. I actually found myself selling them for quick cash in SoC all the time, while in Clear Sky they are actually useful to keep on your person for their bonuses. Some absorb radiation, others provide bonuses to healing regeneration over time.\n\nBut this is not the only gameplay change, far from it. Due to the massive Zone-Emission at the start of the game, the clans of people in the Zone have gone at war with each other, using the confusion of the Emission as a good reason to take over new territory. Each of these factions are joinable by the player, and come with terrain the faction wishes to defend or capture. For the player this means they can engage (when they want) in capture or defense missions of certain locations, often bringing them rewards, and greater rewards for capturing bases. As they do this, the influence of their faction increases, while that of the enemy faction decreases.\n\nAnother change is found in AI behaviour, which is (especially on Master) a lot trickier than in SoC. No more wall hugging enemies that are easy to pick off with a sniper rifle. No more ♥♥♥♥♥ that will run into your gun; people are actually clever now. If they try to sneak up on you and you spot them, they'll take off and find cover, to shoot you in formation.\n\nOther than these changes, there's numerous other small tweaks and changes, ranging from stalkers that will take you to specific places in the Zone (for a price of course) to the ability to upgrade and maintain weapons and armor, and then I haven't even mentioned the whole -BLOWOUT SOON FELLOW STALKER- part.\n\n\nThen there's locations to visit. Clear Sky mostly borrows it's locations from SoC, even letting the player visit them in the same order SoC made them visit them in. However, some new areas have been added, some old areas removed and some areas have been changed slightly, or have been added more locations to than in SoC. Still, it's mostly the same ♥♥♥♥ you've been through before. This isn't a bad thing per say! After all, the Zone is the Zone and they try to base it on the real Exclusion-Zone in Ukrain, so they did a good job at how they did it.\n\nThe thing mostly changed about locations that were re-used, is by filling them up with bases of the factions. For example, the Duty faction has it's base at the Agroprom Research Institute, while that was an abandoned bunch of offices in SoC. They actually made proper use of such empty locations this time around, and that was fun.\n\n\nHowever, the endgame is absolutely horrible. The last hour is filled with bugged AI, terrible game design and is just horrificly stupid. The game decides it's a good idea for you to shoot a running target over a long walkway. This walkway is interrupted by several teleports which teleport you to locations where you have to finish off certain enemies only to progress to the next teleport. Not only is this insanely out of place, it's also badly programmed and build in at the most unlogical time possibe. A massive downside.\n\n\n\nOverall I'm giving this one an 8/10","August 31, 2013","true","35.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/recommended/20510/","Pakkidis","Pakkidis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/","1250 products in account","7/10\nOverview: First Person Shooter\n\nNote: I used the complete mod to play the game.\n\nThe Good:\n\n+ Once again atmosphere is the main selling point of the game. The setting, locations and realistic art style really showcase the destruction of the Chernobyl incident.  The developers really nailed being in a destroyed post apocalyptic nuclear death zone. Buildings are crumbling and dilapidated, broken vehicles litter the roads, small settlements of makeshift homes and building house some of the other inhabitants on the 'zone'. Every aspect of the game facilitates you feeling like you need to survive. With the updated engine, the game looks even better than before\n\n+ lighting effects\n\n+ A new addition is factions. You can join a faction to gain unique quests or help them out in general. Joining one faction usually puts you at odds with another. You can choose not to join anybody.\n\n+ Another new addition is the upgrade system. Different armors/weapons have different upgrades that you can choose to buy making them more powerful/effective in combat. In order to unlock certain upgrades you first have to find the blueprints, usually found in stashes or given as quests rewards.\n\n+ Side Quests have been improved somewhat over the first game. Money and quest rewards are more valuable than before and the quests are a bit more varied. Completing quests feels more meaningful.\n\n+ Game play is nearly identical to the first game. Gameplay consists of killing enemies as you traverse 'the zone', scavenging dead bodies and loot to find weapons, armor, ammo, health etc. Survival is a main underlying component with the game. Weapons and armor degrade over time making them less effective and need to be fixed or replaced, radiation levels have to be checked, getting shot or attacked by mutant animals require you to use bandages to stop bleeding, eating is required every so often and you also need to watch your weight limit. Carry too much and your stamina runs out very quickly forcing you to stop or walk until you regain it back.\n\n+ Gun battles are fun, fast and furious. Certain main missions puts you in unique situations which makes gun fights more fun and satisfying. Certain battles reminded me heavily of Half Life 2. For example one mission has you making your way across a deserted town as you clear the road of enemies. Unlike the first game where gun fights usually took place as you traverse the open environment to your next objective, Clear Sky has more focused concise battles tailored to the specific level.\n\n+Variety of different weapons that feel unique\n\n+Sound Effects\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nWith the addition of Factions also comes brain dead AI companions. Like most games, when you go into battle with your teammates, you will do the majority of killing while your 'teammates' sit back and relax. Teammates can also push you aside with ease - a big problem if your aiming down sights ready to make the crucial head shot only to have one of your squad member run into you pushing you aside messing up your aim.\n\n\nThe game features most of the same location as the first game with a few new additions. It doesn't hurt the game by any means as the locations and level design is fantastic however I also find it a bit lazy when developers heavily reuse assets from the previous game.\n\nLong load times.\n\nMinor bugs and glitches.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- (Minor spoiler Alert) There is a part near the middle of the game where you lose all your money without warning. From a story perspective it makes sense, this is a hostile environment and anything can go bad at any minute. From a gameplay perspective this is awful. All the work that went into saving your money so that you can eventually buy your favorite piece of armor or weapon is now gone. Not only was I frustrated but my desire to accomplish any more side quests was also diminished.\n\n-Locating artifacts is a chore and almost unnecessary in this game. Artifacts are items that you can equip that grant you specific bonuses to your stats. In order to actually find these artifacts, you have to first equip your detector, than walk around the level in the hopes it will detect something for you to find. I found the process to be  time consuming and boring. This was a big downgrade from the previous game.\n\n- This game is hard even on the medium setting. Right from the start enemies can kill you with relative ease leading to some very frustrating moments causing me to abuse quick save/load.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the game certainly retains a lot of good things from the first game while improving on certain aspects, the overall package is not as good. The pacing and difficulty being the biggest culprits. The addition of factions is a really good idea but not implemented as well as it should have been.  I enjoyed my time with the game but I was glad it was over.\n","May 8, 2015","true","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

It's rough around the edges in difficulty and smooth in story, a nice touch to the game itself since most of them now a days are either microtransactions or lacking content.\n\nOverall punch-line: Think of Fallout, now add Metro and picture a baby - this is that baby / this is that bread for your PP&J / This is that couch that always eats your change, only finding that change when you really need it / this is like that one really good drink you ordered at the bar and forgot what it was called but rediscover it two years later and call it sex in a glass / This is a damn good game in other words.","October 18, 2015","true","88.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostFoxote/recommended/20510/","GhostFoxote","Big-Eared Trash Eater","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostFoxote/","55 products in account","I'll just say this up front: this game is not as good at Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat. Not by a long shot: bullet sponge stalkers, buggy AI, generally linear storyline and map progression, lack of decent side quests, and wasted potential of the "Faction War" that is more of an exercise in patience than anything else.\n\nThat said, Clear Sky is still a pretty good game, and for all its faults has a special place in my heart - even if I'm not entirely sure why. While the early patches "had more bugs than a crack ♥♥♥♥♥ with the sniffles" I've yet to crash with the steam version. Storyline could be better but is a good enough addition/prequel to the STALKER lore, and for all the frustration and unsatisfaction that will come the overall gameplay is still enjoyable. Plus GSC introduced or overhauled several things in this game that they went on to refine in CoP - weapon modifying, teams of stalkers, fast travel, anomaly fields, artifacts, faction relations, etc - so some stuff being rough around the edges is excusable. And who could forget the bandit polka!\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, bought the SHoC/CoP bundle but still want more, or just are the style to play through games in order, it's worth the $10 to pick up, especially since the modding scene for it seems to be picking up these days. Give it a try, you won't regret it! Or at least, not till you try to make it past the army MG emplacement...","December 21, 2014","true","64.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Instead of billions of mutants and 3 days of march without meeting a person u have a game in which u can join a fraction (freedom,duty,bandits[broken but joined and won the game anyway],loners[Loners? Wait what? How can u have a society of loners????? If u are in a group u are not a loner anymore!] and play the game ur way. Not like in shadow of chernobyl the ending is much less scary and much more fair to the player. Simiulary the entire game is much more fair to the player. But still not fair enough. For example if u join bandits every single fraction in game is going to become hostile towards u! So dont join bandits at beggining of the game cuz you wont be able to play the game and finish the singleplayer. Fraction wars are completely BROKEN and Boooooooooooooring and there is a ♥♥♥♥ load of bugs,glitches and stupidity. However it still gives lots of fun and makes ur brain grow.

I had never heard of this game before, but when the steam wintersale went on during 2015, this game was recommended to me. It was only $4, and God i dont regret buying it.  The action, the factions, the map, everything is so amazing. The only thing wrong with this game is how innaccurate some of the guns are. I have found that the TRs 301 is the most accurate by far, making it my favorite weapon (even though im an AK person).

Released in 2008, It tells an alternate timeline story of "The Zone", which is the highly contaminated and radioactive area surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant and neighboring areas, after a second explosion occurs at the plant. S.T.A.L.K.E.R's are scavengers who traverse the Zone in search of Artifacts, as Guides, Mercenaries, and for research related operations. In this prequel, which is recommended prior to playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl, you play as a S.T.A.L.K.E.R known as Scar, who is injured by an unknown energy emission, while escorting scientists through the zone. Somehow Scar survives and finds himself at Clear Sky, a research colony trying to understand what is happening to the Zone. From here you begin your journey into the Zone, to unlock it's mysteries, as well as to save Clear Sky from the dangers at their gates.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky, came after S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl, so it plays much the same way. You have a set amount of inventory space, an array of weaponry to loot or purchase, armor to help keep you alive, as well as medpac's, bandages, grenades and more. Mods exist for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games, which are extremely popular such as The Stalker Complete set, Misery, and the Oblivion Mod, all of which, change the game mechanics and overhaul the games graphics. S.T.A.L.K.E.R has been a decent Horror FPS series, and spawned another sequel following the events of Shadow of Chernobyl called, S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat.\n\nIf you like games such as Fear, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, you should enjoy S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky. Again, it is the second game in the series, but is meant to be a prequel to S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl, so I recomment playing Clear Sky first.","September 16, 2015","true","1.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Clear Sky just after discovering Shadow of Tchernobyl.\n\nExcept some improvements in the rendering engine (mostly lighting) and the interface (HUD and Inventory), the gameplay is mostly the same, so you won't be lost in this new opus.\n\nThe most important element of gameplay provided here is the Mechanic guy, who can repair and upgrade your equipment (armor, weapons). Being able to customize your gear early really add to the game.\n\nIn spite of this, I encountered a huge difficulty wall after cleaning the "swamp". After emerging from a huge pipe, I'm confronted with about 20 soldiers and a huge machinegun. This was a halt for me and I never succeeded in exploring what the game had to offer.\n\nI didn't like it because I played leisurely in easy mode (that was hard enough for me). I would have accepted it after like 4 to 5h of play, like in Shadow of Tchernobyl, when you emerge inside the soldier camp !\n\nSo in spite of its qualities, I really cannot recommend this game who doesn't want to be played even in easy mode.","October 20, 2015","false","7.5"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","52","11","21","6","0"

If you're new to Stalker series, play SoC or Call of Pripyat.\n\nClear Sky has it's moments. There are lots of well designed environments for geocaching. Day/night cycles highlight game's excellent shadow system. Anomaly artifacts are rare enough. Game works a lot like Shadow of Chernobyl in most aspects.\n\nOn down side, some missions aren't that much fun on harder difficulty levels, there is little or no benefits from finding hidden caches, Faction Wars seems like afterthought and won't lend much to gameplay after starting area. Looting corpses for money is very easy. But those problems aren't nothing compared how bad end game is which must be probably one of the worst I've played. It's time-constrained pipe-running in midst of one-shotting grenade-spam enemies spawning from thin air. If you eventually grind it through by memorizing enemy positions, bugged end game makes you finally turn difficulty down and restarting from auto-save. Or go to YouTube for end video.","January 3, 2012","false","48.6"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/20510/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","GSC Game World had an unexpected hit with S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl and they keep the momentum going by developing a prequel and pushing it out the door in about a year and a half after Shadow's release.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky had some tough shoes to fill. Expectations were very high and whlist it can't match the first for gameplay, it manages to deliver on the atmosphere and adds some new gameplay elements which can be considered either frustrating or brilliant.\n\nYou play as Zone guide and veteran S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Scar who, after amazingly surviving a deadly emission, is rescued by an unknown faction known as Clear Sky. Located in the Swamps, you must work with them secretly to find out why the zone is getting worse.\n\nThe game is a 50/50 mix of areas seen in Shadow of Chernobyl and brand new areas. The old areas have some pretty big changes to them and areas that were safe in the first game might be a complete nightmare this time around and vice versa.\n\nThe game focuses a lot of its first half on the war between the various factions located in the Zone. You are free, once outside the Swamps, to join any faction you want (Freedom, Duty, Stalkers, even the Bandits) and have the privliges that faction offers, all whilst still secretly working for the Clear Sky faction that saved your life.\n\nThe game has had some of its more interesting elements removed; your character no longer needs to eat and drink to stay alive, the systems for detecting how visible you are and how much noise you are making have also been removed.\n\nFinding artifacts is now a bit more challenging then before; in Shadow of Chernobyl they would be bobbing up and down in random places around the Zone and you could just run up to them and pick them up maybe whilst avoiding some anomolies. In Clear Sky, artifacts are now invisible but you have a detector that can guide you to them, you just have to work your way through the deadly anomalies, get close to it and it appears for you to collect. This risk/reward mechanism enhances the values of artifacts greatly.\n\nThe story sadly isn't as interesting as the first game and instead of most of the spoken dialogue being in Ukranian like in the first game, it has been translated into very rough English that sounds forced and out of place. This can take away from some of the atmosphere of being a foreigner in a completely strange environment.\n\nThe game also has a nasty habit of making enemies invincible unless you are close enough. No more picking off people from a distance which can be incredibly frustrating at times.\n\nIt isn't as good as Shadow of Chernobyl story-wise and mechanicly but the atmosphere and general improvements make up for it. A worthy addition to the series and worth playing!\n\nP.S. You can grab the "CLEAR SKY COMPLETE" modification to fix crash to desktop bugs and translation problems.","July 18, 2012","true","68.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Besides that the player pretty much crawls on the floor in a pool of blood when shot once. The missions are glitchy as ♥♥♥♥, I've had to restart the game and leave areas just to come back and make the "random events work" Overall a pretty ♥♥♥♥ sequal.\n\nPS I recommend you play the other two S.T.A.L.K.E.R games.

I played it a long time ago and it's even better now than I remember. Patched up pretty well, doesn't crash or glitch as much as it used to. In fact, it never crashed when I played it this time round, except a couple of times when fiddling with settings. AI is so much better than in Shadow of Chernobyl, and dialogue is voiced (not your character's voice unfortunately), even has full English dialogue (half of combat shouting is in Russian, and it's better that way).\n\nSuper immersive, nice music. There is a bug with music where it randomly cuts off when exploring, dunno what's with that. Pretty unfortunate considering the ambient music when exploring is fantasticly immersive. Also ambient sounds are great. Dynamic music in settings is bleh, it basically turns on combat music to play when in combat, and that isn't really fun.\n\nStoryline is magnificent, and graphics are insane. This game was made in '08 and has god rays, bump maps, the lot. The Map is huge, exploring is extremely rewarding and side quests are fun. Extremely well optimized as well for both nVidia and AMD cards. Great game.\n\nMy biggest problem with it is the ending mission and cutscene. The cutscene left too much in the open, it didn't really explain that everyone was being brainwashed or whatever, or that this is how stalkers are made into fanatic monolith worshippers. The ending mission was just a disaster, once you (SPOILERS AHEAD) enter Chernobyl NPP you're supposed to attack Strelok, and honestly it feels like they rushed the game at the end there. Pretty bad mission. Fully scripted and badly made. Like a mission I would've made in Spore Galactic Adventures. Animations were terrible in the end, jesus.\n\nSo the final mission was super anti-climatic and actually more hilarious and sad than anything else. Too bad, for such a great game. Kinda like Mass Effect 3, I guess. Lowered my rating from 9 to 8.\n\nOh yeah, and I recommend playing in master difficulty, so much more fun and realistic that way.

It has a heavier focus on combat over anomolies. My main complaint was the mess that is the Faction Wars, lopsided sides mean either a battle up or downhill depending on your faction, assuming you can even finish without squads getting stuck or endless assaults. It is a solid game, but it gives way to linear final areas with little warning leaving your character possibly VERY under prepared.\n\nDespite this fans have unofficial mods and patches that greatly enhance the game. Overall I got 35 hours out of it, being the fan of the STALKER series I have to say it is worth playing at least once.\n\nI value it at $20, considering it's normal price is $10 if it goes on a steam sale definitely worth a buy.","March 8, 2014","true","30.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I hate the copious amount of dying and restarting from a time an hour ago because everytime I complete a mission I assume it saves. Well guess what, this game next to NEVER saves! Maybe they thought the autosave would be too easy or less realistic you say?! Well I say Bull&$#!, because, its WAY less realistic to keep pressing esc it open a menu in the middle of a firefight to save, its rediculous. It strips away what would have been a much better and improved STALKER.

When you shoot a bad guy, he winces a little, then you shoot him again but if you shoot him TOO SOON after your last shot, it doesn't even register. I emptied 2 mags at someone in close quarters to kill them. 2 magazines, because the game is almost turn-based in that it allows the enemy to get up again and shoot you before your next bullet will hit him.\n\nIn addition, the voice acting is terrible. I've never heard a Russian call someone a "homie" but today I have. The voices repeat as well, with essentially 1 voice actor for most of the game. Not to mention the repeated dialogue every time you re-enter an area or have to repeat a mission or if the same thing happens multiple times.\n\nWorse yet is the mission mechanics. I stood for about 20 minutes holding a position until the game figured out I had already captured it and sent some bad guys to reclaim it so that I could complete the mission. Well guess what? I died and had to do it again, but this time, the game NEVER FIGURED IT OUT. I stood there for another half an hour and had the mission randomly disappear! Then on my way back to base, the mission REAPPEARED.\n\nI know there are a lot of fan boys out there for this game and if they enjoy it, then that's fine. This is just my humble opinion. I would be more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I hadn't paid a sale price for the STALKER games. Good luck buyers.","March 17","false","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

Like the Metro series, STALKER is a post-apoctolypic semi-mysitcal (Russians seem to like having paranormal elements in thier scifi) Russian game. However, while the Metro series is linear (yet finds room for female characters) STALKER is almost totally open (yet almost totally empty of women). Also unlike Metro, STALKER tends to run fairly well on my machine.\nClear Sky is an enhancement of the STALKER formula. Several addtions are present, not the least of which are gun mods (your favorite weapons can be useful forever now, instead of quickly replaced whenever a new gun appears) and a more interesting story.

Not as good as the first game Shaodw Of Chernobyl as this one shows all the signs of a rushed game. But with some mods installed it's still very enjoyable.\n\n\nLong version:\nPrequel to the first STALKER game Shadow Of Chernobyl (SOC).\n\nCompared to the first one, which is a masterpiece, this game is short, buggier, and just generally a rushed game.\n\nThey only made like 2 new maps while reusing all the textures and maps from SOC yet still manage to code it badly so it's full of bugs. Simply a lackluster effort.\n\nIMPORTANT TIP:\nDO NOT USE QUICK-SAVE QUICK-LOAD FUNCTION BUILT INTO THE GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE CORRUPTED SAVEFILE THAT FORCE YOU TO START THE GAME OVER.\n\nSo, in order to enjoy this, you will need community-made "mods", or patches since they fix bugs the developers are too lazy to fix.\n\nSky Reclamation Project (SRP) (thank you Decane)\nhttp://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&s=forums&s_game_type=xr2&thm_page=1&thm_id=23248&sec_id=19\n\nThis mod is a must as it fixes many game-crashing issues and it changes no gameplay so you can play the game how it's meant to be played.\n\n\nClear Sky Complete (CS COMPLETE) (thank you Pavel)\nhttp://artistpavel.blogspot.ca/2010/01/mod-clear-sky-complete.html\n\nThe COMPLETE mods for the STALKER games are nice because they make the game look and sound better and play better. HOWEVER, even though this mod contains SRP, the SRP is an early version and does NOT include many fixes the most current version of SRP has. You WILL encounter game crashes and maybe even CORRUPT savefiles with this so use at your own risk.\n\nNow if you have some modding experience or some general knowledge of how script mods work then you can merge the up-to-date version of SRP with CS COMPLETE.

Now the enemys in Shadow of Chernobyl could take some damage without soaking up to much ammunition but in this all your enemys from the basic Novice stalker to a Monolith Exo ARE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BULLET SPONGES to the point of you can go through magazines even with highly accurate/powerful assault rifles AND IT'S STUPID!, Also the "Faction War" thing is a waste of time, ammuntion and money for example, I always join the Loners since i have never liked the Bandits so everytime i face them i win but there is that time when i am about to destroy their base AND!, at the last momment i kill the last Bandit (Yoga) then..... the Loners lose the Recievieng Outpost and the  "Garbage" and i have to start over again also another thing when an outpost is underattack and im litteraly 1 seconds away from it i get this "Task Failed: Lost Recieving Outpost" and it makes me as angery as Russian man without Vodka to drink and a Klashnikov to shoot. So those are soeme of the reason why i suggest not getting this game Its rage enduesing, painful, annoying, tedious and most of all!, down right HERESY so if i could give this a rateing from 1-10 i would give it a 5/10 becase it has some good things but its simply in my thought a too difficult to play game even for Masters of the Zone.\n\n-Sorry for my spellign errors\n-Sorry for conventional errors\nP.S- I am no newbie to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games i have played a long time so don't consider this 5 minute rage and review.","December 6, 2015","false","62.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","6","15","2","0"

You can put half an AK clip into a guys head and he would still be standing. Standing out in the open shooting you with his sniper shotgun from about a hundred feet away. Difficulty setting will not help. All it does is make enemies more of a bullet sponges. Because of it the gunplay is just unenjoayble. I went to take a group of bandits. There were five of them. I had just over 600 bullets. My AK is always set on single shot so I can at least try to go for precision. By the end of the raid. I had about two dozen bullets left. Minus about 10 medkits because nearly every one of their shots was spot on.\n\nFriendly AI is even worse. Their pathfinding is horrific. You will constantly pushed out of cover, into anomalies, radioactive water. All they do is rush enemy head on to get killed so you will fail a mission.\n\nThis pretty much ruined my game. I have tried using mods, but it seems none of the mods actually address those issues.

Also the feature with emissions where you in the middle of normal exploring all of sudden have to run fast to any shelter or die under not-so-clear-sky of the Zone. And new system of loot hunting, where you need special detector to find the Zone relics… And many other little things, most of them were invented and even implemented by the original game community.\n\nBeing a hard fan, obsessed with the Stalker immerse world, I was able to made it through all Clear Sky quite fast, when it was just released. And I even felt the need to protect that title from blasphemous critics, who’s just not getting the point… But then I started the game for the second time, to really enjoy all its secrets and tight spots. And now I was puzzled with so many development decisions. Why they done it like this? Really, there should be some other way, there is no any logical base for this move. And that turn. And that was unnecessarily too… Now I feel only a shame for the developers, who ruined such interesting setting with totally unreasonable game plot. And, the worst thing is what all the bad stuff comes at player right away, just from the start! The first level in Swamps, after open wastes, forests and industrial compounds of the first game we need to follow the narrow passages... That's even worse than playing the second Crysis game right after the first one! A way worse. And after you manage through Swamps, the gameplot rushes you to go right on the army's outpost, with the outrageous machinegun (if you never played the game, just watch some vid's about "Clear sky military machinegun" on the youtube, there will be plenty). And if you managed to run out of that setup, you'll come into the Main Clear Sky Feature - the Clan Wars questline. Things finally starting to get interesting after Cordon... right until the moment you realise that all those clan wars are broken beyond repair. The major tip in the community about that quest line - don't do that!\n\nI can say the same about the whole Clear Sky in general. Unless you're a hardboiled Stalker veteran and going to download (or create) some mods for Clear Sky - don't even bother to start it, just get the Call of Pripyat instead, for much better experience.\n\nMe, I prefer the first STALKER game the most, even without mods. Even vanilla Shadow of Chernobyl gives you the biggest amount of adventure, and diversity of gaming experience. Both Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat are just two (of many) mods with the hope to improve some gameplay aspects. And Clear Sky is a lost hope. It done some good, but as a standalone game - it's a very frustrating experience, not worth of your time.

I've started a new game and reinstalled the game four times over the past couple of years and every single time I run into different issues, but mainly things like random crashes for no reason, sometimes at the menus, sometimes upon loading, sometimes in the middle of firefights, etc. The only guarenteed way to run this game fine is on Windows XP, so yeah...","March 28, 2014","false","13.4"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","0"

However, I'm going to give this game something it never gave me: A ten second head start and a bandage when I really needed it,\n\nSo for starters, let's be genuinely honest here; This is the most unique shooter experience I've ever dealt with. For starters, I've never played a game in which you fight armies of angry Russians armed with Iron Curtain weapons and even a few westernized weapons while I only have weapons with effective equivalence of Airsoft guns. Furthermore, every single person in the Zone is a better pitcher than anyone on any baseball team on earth. I mean, I have never been hit in the forehead with a grenade quite so often as I have been in in this game. I could cower behind a wall and say a prayer that I don't die and get hit with a grenade(Not the explosion, it literally bounces off my character) from half the combat platform away. Fast-Travel does exist, but it is quite literally the least convenient source of mobility since holding L2 to walk forward on a Playstation system.\n\nI believe I've made enough statements on how bad it may be there, but there are in fact positives. I am basing this review off my own personal experience, so certain aspects which may be good or bad for me may not be experienced by you personally.\n\nNow the start of the game is interesting enough, so long as you have a well enough understanding of the map and controls and how to utilize your PDA and the Artifact tracker. Seeing as I did not have a great understanding of these things, I went into the swamps and got half way to the second area of the game without completing the first two missions. So be warned, follow the yellow arrow and monitor the grey arrow as well. Now to the good aspects for real\n\nPros:\n+Vast area to explore; The Swamps are interesting to explore but only so long as you can avoid the anomalies.\n+Many different weapons and upgrades available\n+Random encounters with Mutants make this a horror experience as much as a shooter\n+Upgrades have weight to them, just as they have consequences\n+Buildings offer a lot of atmosphere\n\nCons:\n-Fast Travel can be the most expensive habit in the game\n-Most buildings have the most amazing atmosphere, but are too often empty of much worth exploring\n-Invisibility also means transparent/not able to be touched physically by weapons\n-T is for Tedium!\n-The ending sequence of the game is literally the best reason to Rage Quit\n-Game Breaking Bugs(Example: If you retrieve your gear before you go into Duty territory and talk to the commander, the option to talk to anyone is lost and the game can no longer be continued)\n-Pistols do not have iron sights but assault rifles do(Contrast to the older game, Shadow of Chernobyl)\n-Dude from Freedom Faction MAY TRY to sell you drugs\n\nOverall, it's not a great game. It's not a good game. It's barely within the respective zone for being an Okay game. I gave this game a legitimate try. I gave it serveral tries. As a matter of fact, on the last sequence of the game, I gave about sixty-four tries. However, if I were to count only the amount of times I restarted the campaign, it would be six. Three of those were due to glitches, three were due to Laptop changes and difficulty adjustments.\n\nMy Final Rating for this game is\nA Red First-Aid Kit/10\n\nIt's fine, but doesn't do much for you other than familiarize you with some controls and environments of the game, even if it isn't of a similar layout to the other games. It's good enough to hold you over until you can get the other two far superior versions of the game(Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat). While it may quench your thirst for a Nuclear-Disaster based First-Person-Shooter, it is like comparing Resident Evil to the Resident Evil Remake; Only imagine that the Remake came out first.\n\nYou can literally skip this installment.","September 2, 2015","false","81.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

The game devs were quite cruel when making this game.\n\n-Possible Spoiler Alert-\n\nPros:\n-Repair system. This was much needed, as equipment tends to degrade quickly, which can make the game unnecessarily difficult.\n-Upgrades. Feeling of progression with the ability to improve your weaopns and armor.\n\nCons:\nThe game devs were really cruel when making this game.\n-The beginning of the game is pretty dumb. The bandits have all of the advantages against you (better accuracy, can spray accurately, tank more bullets than you), and you're constantly in 1v8 situations with little to no cover.\n-A powerful sniper rifle (VSS Vintorez) is available at the very beginning of the game. However, it is unusable without paying a hefty repair cost, and the ammunition it uses cannot be obtained until late in the game, at which this sniper is readily available. In short, it's just dead weight.\n-There's a machine gun emplacement that guns you down while you run for your life. This is impossible on the hardest difficulty, and even on the easiest difficulty, the machine gun will probably warrant a somewhat expensive repair.\n-At one point in the game, bandits steal all of your money. Adds insult to injury.\n-Bandits are total ♥♥♥♥♥, but only they can help you install the best armor upgrades.\n-Not many side quests.\n-The is too linear. I found myself passing through each area exactly once with little reason to backtrack. Unlike the other STALKER games, there's no central hub(s) where one can settle down and relax.\n\nOverall, not recommended unless you're a hardcore STALKER fan that wants bragging rights for playing all the games.","November 13, 2015","false","19.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","1"

You get bleeding for pretty much any hit so you better scavenge any and all healing items (apart from food which is just going to weigh you down) you come across.\n\nYour weapons rarely feel like they have an "impact" on enemies. You can hit an enemy 8 times with a weapon and they barely look like they are harmed by it. There is no limping, no slowing down of movements, no trying to escape when their life is too low, no stumble when hit by a heavy impact weapon like a shotgun. The only times it feels like your weapons have an impact is when you hit an enemy in the head at which point they're instakilled.\n\nCombat in general is tedious. You have to attack multiple enemies and they all take so many bullets (unless you manage to get good headshots (which isn't easy with how inaccurate weapons are)) to go down while you only need to take a handful to die. You end up playing pop a mole from cover most of the time and there is rarely any other tactic to use since if you kill an enemy pretty much all other enemies are alerted to your presence so sneaking is out of the question. And maybe it is just because I never found a good long range weapon but sniping wasn't viable for me. Neither was storming the place either. It's pretty much just pop a mole from cover for the most part.\n\nThe dialogue in the game is "topic dialogue". Meaning that your character asks questions and the NPC's spew out paragraphs of exposition. I don't care for this kind of dialogue as characters just end up being meat shield/walking lore pamphlets.\n\nI'm not well versed with this regions names, culture and dialects so for me every character blended together with one another. Pretty much no one stood out so I ended up not caring about any of them.\n\nOn that note, I don't even care about the main character. From what I saw during my playtime you are some random ♥♥♥♥ with amnesia or whatever who can survive strange emissions but they will gradually harm you until you die so you need to go to the center of the zone in order to find answers. However, since the character you play as has pretty much no personality or backstory or even motive to go into the zone (from what I understand the outside world isn't completely ♥♥♥♥ed up so why couldn't "Scar" just leave if the emissions are so harmful in the zone?) I don't care about him. I don't care about wanting to solve this mystery because the game gives me ♥♥♥♥ all of an incentive to solve it. I just don't care.\n\nAnyway, whenever I play a game for a while to get a good feel for it I sit down and think about the game as to why I'm playing it and why I should continue.\nSo is the game challenging? Well, no. It is at first, but once you figure out how the mechanics work it stops being challenging and just grows frustrating or tedious.\nDoes the game have an amazing story? Not really, as I explained above.\nIs the game at least a fun time consumer to just waste time in? Not really. The gameworld is pretty barren for the most part and all you find is anomolies and enemies which quickly get repetitive and boring.\nDoes it at least have an amazing atmosphere to immerse into? Not really. It doesn't feel dark or dreary or anything really. It feels cartoonish if anything.\n\nLike I said, it might just not be the kind of game for me but I can't see any reason to keep playing it. The story never grabbed me, the characters blend together, the world is barren (apart from enemies), the combat gets repetitive and tedious and the atmosphere is lacking.","February 7, 2015","false","7.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

This must be renamed STALKER Clear ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or Linear Scripting Hell. They re- use some areas of the old one, but that has it's charm. They've changed a lot and nothing for the better.\n\nFor instance, bandages are highly needed now cause a medkit wont stop the bleeding...no bandage and you will die slowly. And then there is the case when you bandage yourself and you are still losing health, with no other clear indication why! Bandaging again or a medkit does not work. But wait there is more, enemies can see you from miles away, while you still struggling from where that head shot came from. After a while you find out that mr. freaking bandit almost killed you with a pistol from 200 yards away, while yours is inaffective anywhere but point-blank.\nWhile in the old stalker you could use an object to hide from incoming fire, in here hiding does not make sense, when they spot you, they will fire upon you and will hit you. And they will spot you, even crouching and walking pace(slowest movement almost no sound) they will spot you in daylight or in the night as if they all wear NV goggles. Yes they will spot you and shoot around freaking corners or through objects...but that's oke FF. Well hell no it's not, cause once you come out of the swamps, the militairy is waiting for you. They'll ask you to go back, one more step and you are fodder. But you need to go that way cause you can't go another way. You cannot sneak upon or away from them.

Good, you've survived by running...but those 3 militairy dudes followed you and are killing the stalkers in the village(3 of them) and you are next.\nOne last thing, I was irritated in the old stalker by a guy in pripyat, come here stalker, my information...yeah that guy. Now they turned every freaking talking ape in the zone like him.

I had a very poor equipment and I was waiting to meet a shop to get better, but for like 3 areas, along the way, I met not a single shopper, only guys that could only repair my equipment (not even enhance it).\nSo at some point I found myself in a long way without turning back until the end of the game (with no previous warning) with these crappy weapons and armor, and the game turned in a constant "loading and dying".\n\nIn the end, the game feel a lot like its predecessor (intending it in a bad way, overall it feels just like playing again the first), but with some additional highs and lows that, depending on the individual game experience, can turn it good or bad like hell.\nUnfortunately, for me it has been a very bad and frustrating experience.","September 5, 2015","false","13.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

In many ways it's superior but will never be as recognised as the original.\n\n\nIn many ways that quote holds true with Clear Sky when you compare it to Shadow of Chernobyl, but Clear Sky is riddled with a lot of bugs and half baked concepts that, on the surface seem to be great improvements, but in reality, are poorly implemented and in a lot of cases, are almost game breaking, if not so. I don't make this assessment lightly and it's with a heavy heart that I do so... From start to finish, I wanted to enjoy this game, but it just never threw me a bone! Right down to the last boss, that glitched out and began to walk upon air, 50 meters above ground and take cover behind non-existent crates.\n\n*It was a pleasure to gather artefacts in the manner stated in the encyclopaedia from Shadow of Chernobyl, however it was often times frustrating to find artefacts that now had new abilities, some of which did the complete opposite of their SoC counterparts.\n\n*The upgrade system was nice, but needed a lot more work and an explanation in game of how the upgrade trees work.\n\n*The bandits at the Garbage can go eat ♥♥♥♥! Avoid them like the plague! And if you're like me and save up lots of money... Don't! Twice these no good ♥♥♥♥ers bled me dry and with no way to get it back... not even through bloodshed!\n\n*Exploration... What can I say? Shadow of Chernobyl... You look around... Find a nice gun... Or a suit or armour... With Clear Sky however, it's high risk for low to no reward! I know it's only early days in the Zone but at least reward exploration! God damn Scrooges!\n\n*GLITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gotta love them! And 'them' there are many of... From the aforementioned floating final boss, to side quests the refuse to acknowledge the presence of the PDA in your inventory, to enemies that kill you in one hit if you happen to be in the air or jumping.\n\n*Faction wars... Actually the biggest problem here is your allies! Constantly pushing you out of cover and shooting you in the back, mindlessly trying to shoot an enemy! I lost count of the amount of times I was killed in the FW tutorial portion of the game... Shot in the back by a friendly shotgun! If you survive... You're expected to suck it up! ...And if you accidentally hit an idiot that walks in front of you, they get angry and gun you down... ♥♥♥♥ IT!\n\n\n(SIGHS) I know a lot of this sounds like nit picking, but hey!

This is the experience I had! ...And coming off of an enjoyable stint in the zone, in 'Shadow of Chernobyl', 'Clear Sky' was an utter disappointment and seemed more like a fart in an enclosed room than a clear blue sky of promise and in my opinion, will forever live in the 'Shadow of Chernobyl'...

Be prepeared to load last save countless times. But the worst of all - bugs, bugs and even more bugs. Enemy hits with the grenades ALWAYS, while you... well, I don't really remember hitting the spot even once (and I tried really many times). Above all - your granades DOES NOT WOUND the enemy at all. Adding that your enemies see you all the time (even when you are hiding), and can shoot trough walls, while your supposed "friends" simply push you out of the way (usually out of cover into direct firinig line or off the bridge). Oh, and almost all sub-quests fall into category "go fetch something and bring it here" - fun once or twice, but that's all.\nIn other words, if you liked "Shadow of Charnobyl" and "Call of Pripiat" - DO NOT TRY THIS GAME !!!","August 1, 2014","false","41.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","6"

It sounds like a lot of fun right? That is, until you actually play the game.\n\nThe Optimization for this game is horrible, I can't even run it in directX 10 at a playable framerate (I can run BF4 on very high/ultra in a 64 player battle at 60+ FPS, as well as Planetside 2 with 200+ players). The NPCs are much too powerful (even on the easiest difficulty and I'm the type of person that always plays on the hardest difficulties), their grenades always seem to appear at your feet and their bullets always end up in your head. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a challenge in combat but these enemies seem impossible to beat. The game has many bugs and quite a few random lag spikes that can last for more than 10 seconds.\n\nHowever, the game is not all bad. The ambience is fantastic and it really sets the dark mood of the Zone. The story is actually well written and gripping. The location also makes this game amazing as it takes place in the Chernobyl disaster zone (which I love), it is the perfect place for a game like this and lastly, the landscape is beautiful (I find that the abandoned buildings that nature has taken back are beautiful, that's just my view).\n\nThis game has more cons than pros causing me to not recommend this. Stalker Clear Sky was too advanced for its time and had many issues. I would give this game a 65/100 simply due to the reasons I have stated. If you are looking for a game that takes place in a nuclear wasteland that has mutants and bandits I would recommend the Fallout series.","January 8, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

The new faction wars feature would have been the saving grace of the title if it wasn't quite so buggy and had a touch more depth to it.\n\nIt's nice to wrap yourself in the Stalker atmosphere again but overall the game feels too much like a simple (and flawed) expansion rather than a stand-alone game.","January 12, 2013","true","36.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Even if you've got a load of extra cash lying around, I wouldn't recommend buying this game. The game seems great at first with wide-open areas and decent visuals but it all goes downhill from there. It seems the vast majority of the game is plagued with radiation that keeps you from exploring it, and all other areas are loaded with bandits and military goons. The biggest problem with the game are the loads of human enemies that litter the world turning it into a standard spray and pray shoot-out, but with a special catch: every single enemy is a bullet sponge that can absorb clip after clip, the only saving grace being that sometimes a headshot will kill them instantly. Other problems rise from certain parts of the game being a pain to get to because of broken hit-boxes or dozens of 'anomalies' being in the way that make traversing slow and mind-numbing. The tutorials also don't explain a whole lot, the UI is mediocre, and secondary quests are a pain to deal with because of a bad map and the many environmental blockages that will get in your way. It would be enjoyable to wander the expansive wastes, but sadly every five steps you take runs you into an irradiated field or an anomaly that will explode into a cloud of lightning and send you flying. Overall, a terrible game with basically no redeeming qualities.","May 15, 2014","false","16.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

The main menu not only looks almost exactly like the first game's, but even the main menu music is the same. This isn't necessarily bad, but it's like a sick foreshadowing to the travesty that is this game.\n\nGRAPHICS\nVisually, this game is fairly good. However, it's nothing impressive. The first game allowed great immersion, even if you were only playing at the medium graphical settings. This game, however, fails to draw you into the setting, and I just groaned in contempt when I reached the end, where even the legendary and infamous Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant failed to stimulate my visual senses.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe game in terms of gameplay is definitely superior to the first entry. With more accurate weaponry and less shooting-through-walls glitches, I found myself not getting nearly as infuriated with the game as I did with the first. However, the survival/horror was absent entirely. The mutants were nearly nonexistent, whereas in the first game I was constantly on edge with the terror of the fantastic and varied enemies. But in this game, I found myself bored with fighting too many human enemies. Still, the mechanics are far superior than the first game, and I can give this props for that.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nDon't play this mode. Please, for the love of all that is good and sane in this world, NEVER PLAY THIS MODE. Weapon balance is nearly nonexistent, maps and game modes are recycled from the first game. On top of that, you'll be hard pressed to find anyone playing this game's multiplayer. Stay clear of it.\n\nSTORY\nThe game's story takes a massive hit. It is nothing more than a pale shadow in comparison to Shadow of Chernobyl. This game takes place one year before the events of the first game and tells the story of the zone and how Strelok came to be where he was in the first game. Sounds great on paper, but is overall disappointing. The game says multiple times that there are new areas to explore in the game because emissions have changed the radiation levels around the zone. This is complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. There are a total of two new places to explore in the game. Otherwise, you visit literally EVERY SINGLE LOCATION FROM THE FIRST GAME. Actually, even less than that! The fact that I completed this game's story, while completing a few of the dull, uninspiring optional missions along the way, in a whopping 6 hours, proves that the developers were simply lazy with the game. You will shoot hundreds of humans all around the same places you've been to in the first game, and then sometimes shoot a mutant, repeat. Strelok is barely in the game at all, very little of the first game's supposed background history is given in this game, and it fails to inspire and enthrall like the first game. There was no mystery, horror, or intrigue throughout the course of this painfully short campaign, and it felt like a chore to go through.\n\nVERDICT\nThis game is $10 U.S. dollars not worth spending. This was a money-grabber after the success that was S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. There was so much potential in this game that was simply wasted, and I was painfully reminded throughout the course of the game that I wasted money on a game that I will probably never play again. Make no mistake, this is one of the worst video games that I have ever played, a copy-and-paste of the original with less content and a worthless story.\n\nRATING: 5/10","August 14, 2014","false","9.7"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Re-spawn bugs: NPCs that you just shot dead, and an area is clear, they look like they leap back from the dead or magically appear in front of you - making it impossible to take a base as your team NPCs never arrive, they seem to go wandering off in the wilderness.\n2. Persistence bugs and fails: leave an area and immediately return, and all the ground you gained has disappeared with your NPC bases taken back instantly (clock showing only minutes difference).\n3. Later in the game with improved weapons and armour, it seems that the low level weapons some NPCs have become more powerful than your own - such that a shotgun can take you out at 100+ metres. Whilst the fully upgraded sniper rifle won't even take an NPC out with a headshot, often requiring a full clip of 10+ shots to kill a NPC.\n4. None existent game levelling, comparing all game play levels and there was little to no difference between Novice to Veteran.\n5. Missions that appear and disappear within seconds, not even allowing you time to run to them even when only a few metres away.\n\nI have played many FPS, 3PS and RPG games for over a decade, always at highest difficulty. I am a fan of the series of Fallout, Crysis, CoD, Battlefield, Far Cry, Skyrim, Dragonage, Mass Effect etc etc. But this one unfortunately is not going in that list, like I said I really did want to like it, but the above eventually wore me down, I don't want to finish it... so I really can't recommend it - follwing this review it's being uninstalled.","August 12, 2014","false","28.0"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","11","28","0","2"

I figured that even something vaguely Stalkery would be still pretty good because Pripyrat and the original were very enjoyable, but I after playing through Clear Sky I see why people say stay away.\n\n1. Very short\n2. Very linear with exploration discouraged\n3. Less focus on monsters/mutants and more on killing hundreds of human enemies\n4. Ending is terrible\n5. You have very few, if any, choices beyond which faction to fight for\n6. Faction Wars idea feels like it is barely fleshed out\n7. Upgrade system and a few other things tied to the factions are not fun\n8. Little sense of what either of the other two Stalkers are all about (weird ♥♥♥♥, exploration, mutants and being a Stalker)\n9. Only one ending as far as I can tell\n10. Several repetitive sections were you just kill waves after waves of human enemies\n\nLet me explain some of those a little more. The game is a bit short, especially comapred to the other two. My record says 20 hours, but 3-4 hours of that are idle-time when I left it on and the rest was doing absolutely everything I could in terms of side missons/faction wars and trying to explore areas that didn't want to explored. I imagine you could easily run though it (without trying hard) in less than 10 hours.\n\nThe entire feeling of world is almost erased from what was created in the original game (and Pripyrat even though that came after this one). You can only find things if they are randomly located by this guy back at the original base that randomly gives you locations of stashes, or if you buy tips from people for stashes. If you happen to find that stash on your own without doing either of those things then nothing will be in it, hence discouraging exploration. A lot of the areas are also pretty closed off or empty besides human enemies, which kind of give tiers of loot depending on where you are in the games story. All of this might be fine if the story was good, it isn't because it goes against the original's story and just kind of sucks all around, or if the Faction War system was actually good.\n\nThe Faction War system, which is a big focus of the game and one of the main things going on all the time (also one of the main reasons there is less focus on mutants and exploration) is a really shallow offering. You have no real impact on anything and only if you get a mission to take an area will the A.I. faction you are fighting for actually go and capture it. They give you a lot of good rewards for doing missions and taking over areas, but it is all very temporary and the whole system isn't the slightest bit dynamic. The A.I. rarely does anything on their own, they have no ambition, and even when you do the "big mission" that is supposed to supress an enemy faction the area is only captured for 15 minutes at most. You cannot command any squads, request reinforcements if you take somewhere on your own, or really interact with your faction at all beyond their main bases, which just offer shops. It was very disappointing to experience because it could have been something much more complex, dynamic and enjoyable.\n\nSomewhere in all of this is an actual STALKER game with great environments, horrifying enemies, a great upgrade system and so much more, but I whole heartedly recommend playing Pripyrat instead even if you have already beaten it before and you are just looking for another go at this wonderful world.","February 21, 2014","false","20.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","3"

I believe this game was made by a bunch of sick ill sadistic people who barely know the basics of creating video games and entertainment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/20510/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on June 3, 2009\n\nI loved STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl. It wasn't perfect, but it was a really exciting game. However, after playing STALKER: Clear Sky for over 25 hours, I am unable to continue. The game is broken. Allow me to explain.\n\nGraphically speaking, Clear Sky is a huge step up from SOC. It uses some of the most advanced shadows I've seen in a game, and the day and night cycle is incredibly immersive. All of the haunting art design and character modeling for the first game is there, but with improved models. However, the game is also so poorly optimized that it cannot run DirectX11 shadows without becoming a slide show, and continues to give me burst of awful (5-10 fps) lag on my rig. And trust me, my rig is not the problem. I've confirmed that this problem is widespread among many gamers, and is not just isolated to me.\n\nThe sound in the game is exceptional, of course. Weather, ambient noise, howls, fire crackling, gunshots, etc, all really help to immerse you in the zone. I have no complaint's about the sound design.\n\nIf the lag was the only issue, I would probably have finished this game lag and all. I certainly tried to. Of course I saw where it was headed, but the thrill *spoiler* of putting Strelok in the place we find him in SOC drove me onward. *spoiler* However, the combat mechanics, which were really great in the first game, especially the gunplay, are broken in this game.\n\nYes, the AI is more intelligent than in SOC; it uses cover, flanks you, and throws grenades. However, enemies tend to throw grenades in bursts at your EXACT position, and STALKER is NOT a movement friendly game. It feels incredibly unbalanced as one grenade will hurt you even if you sprint away from it immediately, and you will lose your cover. Multiple grenades almost always mean death.\n\nThe ballistics model in this game is a big disappointment in comparison to the first. All types of guns are WILDLY inaccurate at ranges above 50 feet, unless they are absolutely tricked out with accuracy upgrades. With a standard AK 74 or Abakan, you can't hit a damn thing at 100m, and are almost always forced to use assault rifles as if they were SMGs (grenade spamming and charging in headlong). I had to spend a good 15000 rubles on my TRS 301 just to get it to perform like it did un-modded in the original game. The AI, of course has none of these accuracy issues, and can happily hit you at 100m plus with any gun in the game, including the MAKAROV!\n\nWhile the faction wars system is interesting, it's makes the zone feel too crowded, and not nearly as spooky or desolate as in the first game. In addition, whenever you conquer new territory, it takes the AI forever to send backup, which usually consists of 1-3 men to help you fend off the multiple counterattacks the enemy sends, usually consisting of 10 plus total men. You may have total numerical superiority, but if 300 of your best equipped stalkers are sitting in your base territory, you have a problem. This is supposed to be a war, not a one man take down border skirmish.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm not wild about the new weapon upgrade system, but I could see it working in a future title, and i love being able to repair my gear, finally. The new detector and revamped anomaly system is good, and the new graphics and AI are great for the most part. Now fix the balance, lag, gameplay issues, performance, and bring back the spookiness, and cut out the generic side quests, and we'll have a great game.\n\nHere's to Call of Pripyat..... *sigh*","December 31, 2013","false","19.8"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","0"

Also the weapon models don't fit the gritty atmoshere, the shotguns look shiny and round.

Buggy, bland world, uninteresting npc's and quests, half the guns  jam every other clip and like to shoot around people but never at them, you're sprinting back across the map most of the time to turn in a quest you finished an hour ago for a sub-par reward, and it has a *ridiculous* difficulty setting that eventually ruins the game outright (ridiculous because there is a function in the game programming that makes your bullets have a 40%-70% chance to literally disappear out of the air depending on what difficulty you chose). Later in the game, this will make it appear as tho one enemy is eating 2 entire clips right in their face before going down. Game's definitely fun if you like looking at a loading screens - the quicksave and quickload keys are the only useful things in your arsenal the whole time. Overall, just feels like a lot of areas in the game didn't get the attention or time they sorely needed. Don't spend your money on this without doing some in-depth review hunting first. In my opinion, there are plenty of other much better options for the $10 - $20 price range: any Fallout, Far Cry, Borderlands, Deus Ex games - heck, I could go on, and that's just others I've played recently. Play those games if you want a better rpg-shooter hybrid, not STALKER Clear Sky.","April 8, 2014","false","23.9"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","1"

Clear Sky brings along many new additions and upgrades, particularly in the graphics department. And while all of this sounds great on paper the only thing it manges to accomplish is driving home the point that there are no good or bad ideas, only good and bad executions.\n\nThe core gameplay remains the same, you are a "Stalker", a traveler in the cordoned off wasteland that surrounds Chernobyl. An area filled with radiation, mutated monsters and dangerous anomalies. Not to mention the rather high population of other stalkers and residents of "The Zone" that are also collecting the rare artifacts spawned by the anomalies and the various factions that each try to impose their own ideals on the zone and it's inhabitants.\n\nThe faction system is one of the major new features of Clear Sky. They will send off groups of stalkers on their own attempting to secure various points of importance throughout the game world and if you are allied with them you will often be asked to participate in various offensive and defensive actions as mini-missions. This makes the world seem much more alive and as there are not only constant movement around the maps but it's also directed movement, everybody trying to gain the upper hand.\n\nThe second big addition is the increased character customization. Your weapons and armor have many options that allow you to increase their potential in various ways. Many of the upgrades are exclusive as well so instead of making a super gun you have to specialize your weapons and armor. The developers have listened to the community as well and another part of this is the increased rarity of artifacts and the increased difficulty in collection them which is a very welcome addition.\n\nThe unfortunate truth however is that both these additions come in a heavily flawed state and especially the faction system will lead to many hours of frustration. The game still has that "raw" feeling, despite the improved graphics, and where in Shadow of Chernobyl this was mostly forgivable the increased problems with Clear Sky makes it come out at you much more.\n\nClear Sky is a unfortunate sequel that hasn't quite grown enough since Shadow of Chernobyl. It still has all of the problems that Shadow of Chernobyl and adds several of it's own which leads to a sequel that is less than it's predecessor.","December 16, 2012","false","169.7"," 9 of 30 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","9","30","0","0"

My understanding is that it is due to loading in the merchants or base boss. Either way the only fix is to use mods or simply play through it.\n\nThe game is still playable, so long as you go around the areas, and give up any loot you had stored there. This bug was  serious enough to effect my experience of the game as a whole, as after a while the game started to corrupt more locations (like the main stalker base). After this point I just gave up on the game.\n\nAfter playing it for 50+ hours even through the bugs, I would rather go and play "Call of Pripyat".\nCall of Pripyat was much more fun in my opinion.\n\nMy advice is to play Call of Pripyat before this game, and then this (If you still want more).","October 8, 2014","false","88.7"," 5 of 26 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","5","26","0","0"

Could be a "finish the main objectives, get the good gear, then go back and explore type game." I printed the manual and it has proved useful. There could be a better tutorial.

I agree, mostly because a lot of the maps are just reworkings from the first game. Also, there is a little less depth in the story, tipping the scale into Clear Sky being more of a straight shooter.\n\nHowever, the 'factions' war element brings something genuinely new to the game. Moreover, all the great visuals are still there and, when the new maps come along from time to time, they are still a real treat! I like the changes that have been made to the artifacts 'system' as well - there are fewer of them to be had, and they are harder (and more dangerous) to acquire. This adds value to their value.\n\nIf you have an itch to replay Chernobyl, but perhaps don't want to play through the exact same game again, get Clear Sky, especially if its on offer. Clear Sky proivdes enough of a difference for you to get your STALKER fix!\n\nPeople tell me that Pripyat is even better again... I'm saving it though!","September 4, 2011","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Waking up in the middle of a house in a small town where people pull guitars out of there asses after being blown up in a giant nuclear explosion totally makes sense, as does the rest of this game.\n\nThis post-nuclear-war game has you wondering who turned off the lights whenever it is night time. Usually in most FPS games ammo is always around the corner but I find myself walking to the next town just to get 60 of my trusty bullets, and I'll definitely have enough time to carve all of my mutated targets names on them by the time I get back to where i originally started.\n\nThis game has a great sense of atmosphere and has a story, that starts out unusually so I suggest playing the first one. However it is one of the best single player games I've touched, and by that I mean the series.\n\nAlso turrets are OP","January 16, 2012","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The STALKER games are FPS/Survival Horror/RPG hybrids where the emphasis is on the FPS gunplay and the survival elements.\n\nYou can get thirsty or hungry or need sleep and have to manage those needs alongside that of the deteriorating conditions of your weapons and armors. Ammunition, food, and drink needed to survive are scarce, but can be traded for with almost anyone if you have the right amount of goods or money to sacrifice for it. The game has large maps you can travel between like a sandbox game, and the gunplay is some of the tightest I've seen with really good gun physics. The games also have a wildlife simulation system similar to the one in place in FarCry 3 in a way; animals and mutants will run around and do their own thing after they spawn and kill each other (and maybe you) for survival or food.\n\nDespite the large amount of freedom these games afford you to carve your own path, they feel very focused and are best approached with a strategic mindset.","July 25, 2013","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I recently delved into this game again, and I figure I should review it. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has always had a focus on factions, but Clear Sky soups up the faction system like crazy. You can join any of the not-immediately-hostile major factions (i.e. Military and Monolith), which include, off the top of my head, Duty, Freedom, Bandits, Loners, and Clear Sky. You get special gear for joining specific factions. I prefer Duty, personally.\nThe gameplay is solid, although it's essentially the same as Shadow of Chernobyl but touched up a little bit. The accuracy is dictated by whether or not you are crouching, or if you are using iron sights. You bleed if you are shoot in a non-vital spot, so do enemies. Enemies, if hit in a location that bleeds a lot, will eventually keel over and die or curl up on the ground dying. If you hit an enemy in the head, it's an instant kill, unless they are armored up with some of the more powerful gear, or unless they are a zombie. I think it takes 2 or 3 shots to the head to drop a zombie or a guy wearing an exoskeleton.\nA big perk of this game that they added in Clear Sky is the upgrade system. You can attach/detach silencers and scopes, as you could in SoC, but now you can go to NPCs who can upgrade your weapons and armor. You can upgrade gear with composite plates, extra carry weight, artifact slots, etc., and improve accuracy, fire rate, recoil, and even reduce bullet drop and change ammunition type on some weapons.\nFor those who played SoC, artifacts are significantly harder to find in this game. Rather than being able to see artifacts, you need to find them with an anomalous activity tracker, which will track them with beeps. I strongly suggest getting to Yantar ASAP and upgrading that puppy to one that has a map attached to it.\nI feel like there is more to do in this game than SoC, with the faction wars and such. But it does seem like there are less side-missions. That's kind of a con I suppose. Anyway:\n\nThis game has a lot of pros: The combat is interestingly difficult and forces you to think out your combat encounters, or have your entire carry weight taken up by medkits (Don't do that, that's a terrible idea). The faction system and faction wars are awesome. The upgrades are neat, the game is gorgeous, and blah blah blah.\n\nOn cons: This game suffers from pretty much the same issues that Shadow of Chernobyl did. Those are bugs, lots of bugs, the game tends to crash every so often (Quicksave! F5 is your friend. Do it often!), and... An issue I had with SoC that I still have with this game, is that it has an ABSURD difficulty spike in the last act of the game. I can't help but find it irritating. You have a set-up and souped up gear that has allowed you to breeze through everthing else, and then come the last act, you feel like you're wearing the leather hoodie you start off with, equipped with a... I don't know... BB gun.\n\nAnyway, this game is an excellent game, it should be played.","August 22, 2014","true","41.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It forces you to use your brain to survive, the Zone is a rough place and only the best can survive, I've died at least 100 times in the short time I had with it. When facing a situation, it's up to you, the player to figure out how your going to deal or get out of it. The AI are by no means stupid, but neither are they smart. They have a predicible patern when fighting but yet they still seem to surprise me. At night is when I feel I have the most advantage, if I have a silenced weapon or knife I can actually, quote on quote, "Stalk my prey"  because the AI can't see well at night, if they hear me but don't know where I am specifically, they'll shoot randomly in my direction. The darkness is hard to get used but other games I play like Skyrim or Fallout, I have lighting mods making the night and dungeons much darker so I've become quite adept at night fighting. All the weapons seem to have an ungodly amount of spread, which gives me the vibe that Scar is nervous. And why shouldn't he be, half the time I have to take on a camp of 15 enimies on my own.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vepaot/recommended/20510/","vepaot","Vepa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vepaot/","54 products in account","Clear Sky is considered the red headed step child of the STALKER franchise, but in all honesty it's my favorite of the 3 STALKER games and I will explain why to you.\nClear Sky (CS) revamped a lot of the clunky design that was present in Shadow of Chernobyl (SoC), and paved the way for a lot of the useful features that were present in Call of Pripyat (CoP).  First off, CS overhauled your PDA immensely, cutting out a lot of the unnecessary features and streamlining your available options.\nArtifacts also received a major makeover in the game in how you acquire them, and their overall functionality.  Thanks to CS, artifact hunting means you have to actually "hunt".  In STALKER's predecessor, artifacts could be found just laying on the ground and were in a huge abundance.  In CS, you actually have to jump into anomalies with a special detector to find the goodies inside.  And the goodies are actually worth it as well.  An artifact that increases your endurance (recovery speed from jumping, running etc.) has a more limited value than in SoC, prompting you to equip more than one if you're going out on a long raid.  On the up side, health restoring artifacts have a major impact on keeping you alive and actually heal you faster than they do in CoP.  If I had to take a guess, I'd say that little feature has a lot to do with your character's "gift", but you'll figure out what that means when you play it.\nThe world feels more alive, with many of the NPCs getting unique voice actors, as well as a lot of them also interacting with each other.  You can really get a feel for this when you get to Freedom's base and meet the two stalkers that keep hijacking the outpost's loudspeaker to talk smack to each other.  Plus the NPCs are more reactive, they will tell you to buzz off if you're trying to talk to them with a gun in their face, or they'll smack your gun out of your hands if you keep trying to talk to them with it out.  They're also liable to smack you in the face if you keep trying to talk to them while they're in the middle of a firefight or on their way to complete their own objectives.\nThe ALife in this game can be buggy at times, but that's because of the extra features added to the system since SoC.  Enemies can, and will use grenades on you.  And they've all got their own pre-programmed cycles and tactical combat styles.  Some enemies will try to flank you, while others will box you into a tight space with no escape.  Some may charge at you blindly, while others will retreat to call in reinforcements.  A hungry mutant that spots you may follow you throughout the Zone until you either dispatch it, or it dispatches you...while a less hungry mutant may just be protecting its territory and will leave you be once you leave its area.\nBut my favorite thing about the game is how it sets up the story for the STALKER universe.  This game is prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl, and as such it tries to paint a picture of a more beautiful Zone; one that's still bustling with human interaction and chipper attitudes despite the hellish landscape they live in.  SoC is the opposite of this, by the time it takes place the Zone is nearly lifeless and it really makes you feel empty and alone inside.  What makes Clear Sky so great though, is the tragic ending of the game.  SoC has multiple endings, but only two "true" endings...and of those two only one is cannon to the story.  But it's a happy ending overall.  In Clear Sky you don't get such a happy ending because it has to show you why the Zone is such a nightmare in the future to come.\nIn closing, Clear Sky gets a lot of flak for being the weakest of the 3 games.  But it is not a weak game, not by a long shot.  GSC Gameworld took some risks when they introduced Clear Sky because it changed the mold that Shadow of Chernobyl had set after so many years of being in development.  Overall, I personally feel like it paid off.  I prefer the way NPCs interact with one another and the game world, I love the rebalancing of artifacts and the methods of hunting them down, and if you can get past the occasional hiccup or two due to shoddy programming...the experience is worth it.","April 1, 2015","true","102.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I agree, mostly because a lot of the maps are just reworkings from the first game. Also, there is a little less depth in the story, tipping the scale into Clear Sky being more of a straight shooter.\n\nHowever, the 'factions' war element brings something genuinely new to the game. Moreover, all the great visuals are still there and, when the new maps come along from time to time, they are still a real treat! I like the changes that have been made to the artifacts 'system' as well - there are fewer of them to be had, and they are harder (and more dangerous) to acquire. This adds value to their value.\n\nIf you have an itch to replay Chernobyl, but perhaps don't want to play through the exact same game again, get Clear Sky, especially if its on offer. Clear Sky proivdes enough of a difference for you to get your STALKER fix!\n\nPeople tell me that Pripyat is even better again...

Near the end of the game you will not be able to purchase bandages or medkits, and trust me you will need them. If you run out of medkits you will have to turtle your way through massive and very cheap spawning enemies. Now I don't think this is a bad game, if it was intended to be hard then they nailed it. The problems I have with it are such:\n-Enemies have a hitbox inefficiency, some enemies take massive amounts of ammo (1-2 clips) and others take a few shots even if they are the same. Don't bother aiming for the head it works on the lesser enemies.\n-The game goes from a really decent RPG to a linear shooting gallery where you hind behind numerous walls and crates with a "hold" crouch which does not fit well.\n-The ending of the game is something that unless you find out ahead of time you will never beat it. Unless you see that you need ungodly amounts of medkits and bandages "YOU WILL NOT WIN".\n-There are bugs yes but sometimes freaking out and hitting the move keys enough you can get out. If not you better have saved recently.\n-Autosaves are only when you go to new areas, other than that if you don't save you will be playing this game a very long time.\n-Gun upgrading is expensive for the lack of money you normally have. Plus the weapon will lower in condition very quickly so money in this game is your best friend.\n-Finally, the money, if you don't farm and chore through the swamps and all the anomalies to find artifaces or pick up every gun you see, you will have "NO" money.\nOther than these things I find that it is weirdly addicting and quite fun and funny sometimes.

I recently delved into this game again, and I figure I should review it. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has always had a focus on factions, but Clear Sky soups up the faction system like crazy. You can join any of the not-immediately-hostile major factions (i.e. Military and Monolith), which include, off the top of my head, Duty, Freedom, Bandits, Loners, and Clear Sky. You get special gear for joining specific factions. I prefer Duty, personally.\nThe gameplay is solid, although it's essentially the same as Shadow of Chernobyl but touched up a little bit. The accuracy is dictated by whether or not you are crouching, or if you are using iron sights. You bleed if you are shoot in a non-vital spot, so do enemies. Enemies, if hit in a location that bleeds a lot, will eventually keel over and die or curl up on the ground dying. If you hit an enemy in the head, it's an instant kill, unless they are armored up with some of the more powerful gear, or unless they are a zombie. I think it takes 2 or 3 shots to the head to drop a zombie or a guy wearing an exoskeleton.\nA big perk of this game that they added in Clear Sky is the upgrade system. You can attach/detach silencers and scopes, as you could in SoC, but now you can go to NPCs who can upgrade your weapons and armor. You can upgrade gear with composite plates, extra carry weight, artifact slots, etc., and improve accuracy, fire rate, recoil, and even reduce bullet drop and change ammunition type on some weapons.\nFor those who played SoC, artifacts are significantly harder to find in this game. Rather than being able to see artifacts, you need to find them with an anomalous activity tracker, which will track them with beeps. I strongly suggest getting to Yantar ASAP and upgrading that puppy to one that has a map attached to it.\nI feel like there is more to do in this game than SoC, with the faction wars and such. But it does seem like there are less side-missions. That's kind of a con I suppose. Anyway:\n\nThis game has a lot of pros: The combat is interestingly difficult and forces you to think out your combat encounters, or have your entire carry weight taken up by medkits (Don't do that, that's a terrible idea). The faction system and faction wars are awesome. The upgrades are neat, the game is gorgeous, and blah blah blah.\n\nOn cons: This game suffers from pretty much the same issues that Shadow of Chernobyl did. Those are bugs, lots of bugs, the game tends to crash every so often (Quicksave! F5 is your friend. Do it often!), and... An issue I had with SoC that I still have with this game, is that it has an ABSURD difficulty spike in the last act of the game. I can't help but find it irritating. You have a set-up and souped up gear that has allowed you to breeze through everthing else, and then come the last act, you feel like you're wearing the leather hoodie you start off with, equipped with a... I don't know... BB gun.\n\nAnyway, this game is an excellent game, it should be played.","August 22, 2014","true","41.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is NOT A RPG and this is NOT A SURVIVAL game. You just shoot things that appear in your way (and loot their corpses) in order to advance in the linear plot.\n\nThere's no moral decisions to be made, no different paths to follow, no interesting characters to know, no customization of the abilities of your character, no basic needs that you need to fulfill from time to time. It seems the developers kinda started shaping it into a RPG (big maps, side-missions, inventory system), but aborted the idea. If you deal with it as an action/adventure FPS, it's an OK game. Another thing: I played it with the "Road to Limansk" mod, which corrects some bugs of the vanilla game and I recommend.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n- Solid gameplay, weapons fire nicely and each one feels different from another. You can have readily equipped a main gun, a side weapon and grenades, besides a Geiger-counter stuff to locate artifacts (stones that give you some bonuses). There are many upgrades that can be made in your weapons and armor. You can walk/run/crouch/jump effectively, running and jumping use stamina.\n\n- The density of individuals in the map is good: there are few NPCs wandering around (Ukraine Exclusion Zone, after all), but not few enough to the point that it would make the game boring. BTW, the map of the game is divided in separate regions; in order to go from one to another, there's a loading screen.\n\n- There's a "faction system" that, albeit simple, works. If two enemy factions meet randomly on the map, there will be gunfight. A faction's outpost may be overrun by another faction's guys from time to time. Also, you can belong to some faction of your choice if you want to.\n\n- Interesting setting: Ukraine Exclusion Zone.\n- Good diversity of items to loot, and the inventory is somewhat realistic regarding weight.\n- Nice graphics without stressing your pc. Some landscapes and building are quite impressive for a 2008 game.\n- Some interesting mods available with which you can customize your game.\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- Generic characters. With the exception of some few key characters that have a bigger array of dialogue lines, are partially voiced and have a visible face (things that just diminish their blandness), the random guy has some 3 whatever dialogue lines, is not voiced and doesn't even have a visible face (ALL of them use some cloth or helmet to hide it). All of them use the same body model and move exactly the same. Besides, in my 28 hours of game I didn't see a single woman, NPCs are all male so far.\n\n- The side-missions are not only bland, but too quick. It's the same old "go there/get that" style of mission, but instead of going through immense caves or labyrinthical forgotten vaults to "get that", you just walk some 200m, open a crate, walk back and collect your reward.\n\n- Lack of lore-elements to enrich the Exclusion Zone setting. There are no pieces of lore to be found/seen, like diaries, newspapers, radio stations, books, texts or things like that regarding the context of the game. I know, we can read about the real Exclusion Zone in Wikipedia, but the game's one is different and we can't go deep on it.\n\n- Soundtrack as generic as the characters. Generic techno beat during the action and generic ambient music outside of action moments. Play the game with music off.\n\n- Corrupt save-files. Sometimes your saves don't load. I heard that it happens after some scripted event in the game. I had this issue with 2 saves, after that I started quick-saving and hard-saving in 2 different slots before transitioning from one region to another. Haven't had problems after that.","December 10, 2014","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enemies can kill you with a single headshot just as easily as you can kill them, though they did seem to suffer from bullet-sponginess more this time around. This one is considered the weakest of the three, but I did like some of the more focused fire fights that it offered. Some of the new dynamic events are awkwardly timed, so it can be confusing at first before you realize you can't respond to every call for help or you'll never get anything done.

However this eddition of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series has many less mods avaliable for it and there are many unbalanced aspects to the gameplay which are removed.

Once the game is cleaned up with the Complete mod, the faction wars create some interesting dynamics and add some longer secondary objectives.

A prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl, it takes a lot of maps from the original game and a few new areas of its own, with a new twist and improved gameplay mechanics.  It's unique system creates gameplay scenarios you really can't find anywhere else. A game worth playing if you enjoy survival games.\n\nThere are plenty of mods to choose from as well, but if you want to play a modded game, you'll usually have to start a new one. You can't decide in the middle of the game you don't like something, and go find a mod to fix it, most require a fresh start entirely. Definitely do-able without mods, though there are some frustrating things that were never fixed (like NPC nade spam) and some bugs or quirks to address. Doesn't hurt to do a little reading up first, to decide if you'd like a vanilla or modded experiance your first time through.","November 20, 2010","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl, it takes a lot of maps from the original game and a few new areas of its own, with a new twist and improved gameplay mechanics.  It's unique system creates gameplay scenarios you really can't find anywhere else. A game worth playing if you enjoy survival games.\n\nThere are plenty of mods to choose from as well, but if you want to play a modded game, you'll usually have to start a new one. You can't decide in the middle of the game you don't like something, and go find a mod to fix it, most require a fresh start entirely. Definitely do-able without mods, though there are some frustrating things that were never fixed (like NPC nade spam) and some bugs or quirks to address. Doesn't hurt to do a little reading up first, to decide if you'd like a vanilla or modded experiance your first time through.","November 20, 2010","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With mod it is better.\nMain plot is mediocre but open-world and fraction war is interesting. Lot of sidequests.\nShooting is awesome on master. One bullet in head and you dead. And you enemy too. Battles are hard, intensive and you don't godlike, you can't just rush and shoot like it is done in modern shooters. Even with good armor you must plan your attack and use cover. Actually this game from all STALKER games is hardest on master.\nAnd if you plan to go on lower difficulty - don't do it. It is ruin game for you - couse NPC don't became weaker. Just some percent of bullets dessapear in air. Abd yours bullets too. It is really don't have very much sense.\n\nIt is recommended to use with Complete Mode Pack (unlike next game is STALKER series). Mode make lot of things better but not make changes in game. It  repair some bugs and add ability to avoid others. Plus with mod you have ability to skip time (sleep). It is essential because "night is dark and full of terrors". And it isn't unrealistic because if you sleep not in camp you may die very easy from monster attack.","January 10, 2015","true","42.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Putting up with a quest glitching, and having to go back 2 hours worth of gameplay to find a save that will reset it, is not...  Luckily the complete mod comes with a "wish granter" cheat menu that can mitigate some of the bugs and flaws with mechanics.\n\nSpecifically, the faction wars in Clear Sky were pretty much broken for me.  When I joined Duty they would not take the first base after I cleared it.  So I was stuck with Freedom trying to kill me all game without any rewards for it.  It also broke the sense of isolation since you'd hear firefights breaking out every 4 or 5 minutes.   The final battle was an overly scripted inconsistent sort of mess.\n\n8/10","August 16, 2013","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, unlike its predecessor, Clear Sky has added certain new features that enhance the gameplay, such as the Factions War. In the game, multiple factions are vying for control of the Zone, and your character can join a group and help them secure the Zone, bringing in wealth, but also making new enemies, so choose wisely. Furthermore, the ability to repair and upgrade weapons and armor is now available to the player, allowing you to alter your equipment to best suit your play style. However, the story is quite frankly not as good as Shadow of Chernobyls, in my opinion. It lacks the intensity and depth that Shadow of Chernobyl has. I played this game with the Clear Sky Complete mod, which again fixes numerous bugs and noticeably improves graphics. All that in mind, this is a fantastic shooter, with several new features that set it apart from the original, although it doesn't quite measure up to the original in terms of atmosphere and story.

I agree, mostly because a lot of the maps are just reworkings from the first game. Also, there is a little less depth in the story, tipping the scale into Clear Sky being more of a straight shooter.\n\nHowever, the 'factions' war element brings something genuinely new to the game. Moreover, all the great visuals are still there and, when the new maps come along from time to time, they are still a real treat! I like the changes that have been made to the artifacts 'system' as well - there are fewer of them to be had, and they are harder (and more dangerous) to acquire. This adds value to their value.\n\nIf you have an itch to replay Chernobyl, but perhaps don't want to play through the exact same game again, get Clear Sky, especially if its on offer. Clear Sky proivdes enough of a difference for you to get your STALKER fix!\n\nPeople tell me that Pripyat is even better again...

The new areas are excellent and provide a good start and end, while the areas reused from SoC get a slight face lift. Typical stalker gameplay {treasure hunting, mutant hunting, and man hunting} mesh well with the newly implemented faction wars. Claiming territory is fun and rewarding, though it occasionally. doesn't work. If you take an area alone, members of your faction will refuse to take it and smaller land grabs are often abandoned as soon as they are taken. The game crashes constantly for the first two hours of the game. Once you get past the first few missions, crashing becomes a rarity. Common bugs include weather changing when quick loading and enemies losing interest in you after quick loading. Grenades are especially evil this time around. Your grenades are difficult to aim and enemies will side step them easily. Enemies on the other hand, can snipe you with grenades. At one point a bandit 400 paces away killed me with a cooked grenade that hit me as I stood near a third floor window. This entry, having focued on turf warfare between humans, has much less mutant encounters than the other entries. Despite it's flaws, Clear Sky is still a damned good game, and worth paying about $5 to play.","November 20, 2015","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dont get it twisted this game is TOUGH AS NAILS, you will die..over and over, not knowing how or why, grenade spam is REAL, Enemies bullets defy gravity and do matrix stuff to find you. If you play on veteran or master then you will break a computer component in frustration. you think dark souls is tough..Souls games cant hold a candle to this game especially. But yet i loved ever tortorous moment because i finished it. Also i havent played Call of Pripyat yet but played and completed Stalker Shadow of Chernobly and loved it..even though i didnt play it till mid 2015.\nBut Clear Sky is every bit of enjoyable with that sense of Immersion that a post apocalyptic game really can give you. Sound effects are gnarly, the added elements and different characters (well not design wise) and there personalities. Dangerous.. check, Immersive.. Check, great visuals with the dynamic lighting (if your rig supports).. Check, sound effects make your skin crawl...Check.\nAll the while if you play the first one you get to revisit these places but the this game clear sky is set a few years before Shadow of Chernobly. Its great to see how the Zone has changed from game to game..remebering where dangerous spots were before might not be there in the other game.\nLove the Plot that the Zone (which is where the melt down occured) is living and breathing and has its own life force..how theres different factions fighting among each other over beliefs of the Zone, like some want to research it others want to kill everything in it. Hippies peace and love Yin Yang stuff..i finished game in 70 hours..death total...220. its BRUTAL\nGreat game 9/10","September 17, 2015","true","96.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the first 3 hours or so. I died within 30 seconds the first few attampts at the game. At first this was a challenge, then I learned the system, realized the game mechanics are weak and that the game became pointless.\n\n1) I'm tired of my character stopping to pant and be out of breath after a 100 yard walk. Takes him 30 seconds to be out of breath and 30 seconds to regain it. Sprint is basically pointless as you must rest as much as you move.\n2) I'm tired of the terrible loot system and the terrible fps physics -- forced to pick up trash loot before I can even see real loot (which further intensifies the 1st issue). The npcs have 100% accuracy on Normal difficulty, but I can't even consistently--at any distance point-blank, MR, or long range - with a rifle while 1 tapping.\n3) I'm tired of fighting the same 3 enemy NPC's over and over - bandit, pig beast, dog beast - Only to receive the same bits of loot - pistol, sawed-off, hunting rifle (actually, it's a shotgun, but who's paying attention, right?), bandage, 1st aid kit, ammo. Pig and Dog never drop loot. Bandit drops loot I already have (x100) and over-encumbers me\n4) Everything worth getting to requires taking the long route to avoid radiation.

In my opinion it's the most casual of the series as it actually starts with a small tutorial (can't be said of either Call of Pripyat or Shadow of Chernobyl). As you enter the world you will find yourself in the fallout driven land near Chernobyl with said mutations and freaky ♥♥♥♥ to go allong. It may not be the pretiest game and the age did not do it any good either but the gameplay makes up for that all the way.

Alberto Barbosa","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198195209143/","48 products in account","It's like a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game with all the creepy parts taken out of it to be replaced with a buggy faction wars mechanic. It's also one of the buggiest stalker games and in general certain part and places in the game are poorly put together. The core gameplay mechanic have seriously improved from Shadow of Chernobyl. It guess it isn't horrible, but you can skip it if you want to play the whole series. I would rate it a neutrally, not good or bad, but you can't do that.\n\n6/10 I guess, as it's a bit of an accquired taste if that makes sense.\n\nActually, buy this. The game has the perfect music for your various cheeki breeki needs.","February 16","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my opinion it's the most casual of the series as it actually starts with a small tutorial (can't be said of either Call of Pripyat or Shadow of Chernobyl). As you enter the world you will find yourself in the fallout driven land near Chernobyl with said mutations and freaky ♥♥♥♥ to go allong. It may not be the pretiest game and the age did not do it any good either but the gameplay makes up for that all the way. If you find yourself longing something more hardcore then the Fallout Series then this is your go to game.","January 11","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
