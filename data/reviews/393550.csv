It's a bit buggy at certain parts (I was able to skip an entire puzzle by simply being able to jump over a fence), but all in all it was a fun hour.  The puzzles are not difficult.  At all.  The interface was also really wonky and that coupled with the inconsistent graphics constantly remind you that you aren't playing a AAA release.\n\nThat said, I really did enjoy the surreal environments and I thought the plot was great.  Is it worth $2?  I'd say the game is priced fairly or is at least in the ballpark.  Could definitely use some more polish though.\n\nSpoilerish comment I'd like to leave for the Dev:\nChange the main menu splash screen as it's slightly confusing as to why it's being displayed (feels almost like a loading screen or a glitch) when referenced later in the game.","August 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

I enjoy the 10+ birds in the game that make the atmosphere that much more enjoyable and the spinning windmill is pretty sweet.\n\nThis game has a few problems, not so much glitches as much as bugs and general game design faults, let me list the few I found in my time playing:\n-Stairs act like a slippery slope, if you're not walking up you'll randomly slip down?\n-At the top of the windmill if you head inside through the door you kinda spaz out a little but it's not too bad.\n-They've labeled a block purple on a billboard when it's pink, now this is the part where I got stuck so I'm not sure if this was some sort of fault or if I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at puzzles.\n\nAll in all this game is about a 5-6 out of 10, if it were to give you more to the story and gave you a few things to read (that gave you a clue as to why you'd crashed and such) it would be swell, I mean the character could be 10 and could have illegally driven a car, but I guess we won't know?\n\nIf you'd like to have a quick look at this game before you purchase it, or if you get stuck at an early area or whatever the reason you feel like having a look at the game I've made a quick 7minute video that just shows off the game a little, feel free to take a look into that and enjoy your lives bbz. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_bQ-t-A2sw","August 12, 2015","true","1.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

And as much as I love sausage rolls, I feel like this was the better investment. Although not a ground-breaking game, I did quite enjoy playing through it. It takes about an hour to finish, maybe less but I'm actually really terrible at puzzles so I got stuck on a couple of occasions. The story was okay I guess, but it's pretty obvious what the big conclusion is gonna be within about ten minutes of playing. The graphics confused me to begin with, the stylisation just looked to me as a bit lazy but I soon grew to actually find the environment charming in its own way. Although, I put a strong emphasis on 'environment', as the only character model within the whole game isn't exactly up to the same standard...you'll see what I mean.\n\nI would just like to say that my biggest issue with this game, apart from a few bugs here and there, was the sound. Some of the sound effects for doors opening etc. were so over the top and quite often didn't even really sound like what they were supposed to. And there is a weird breathing that's hardly noticeable all throughout the audio which I'm not sure whether it's accidental or intentional but once I noticed it it really put me off.\n\nMy main judging criteria is whether I had fun playing this game, and I can whole-heartedly say yes. At less than £2, it's worth the price, and I feel like a lot of love went into making it despite its imperfections which make it a rather charming and enjoyable game to play. Leave the sausage rolls for now, buy this instead.","August 13, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","8","8","3","0"

"SPOILER" Still did not get connection between ventilation system and computers. Also iron door :D  Eh yeah I liked this game and bought to support the developer. Actually 2$ is worth for this game. I believe they can do more complex and less bugged game.  :)\n\nEDIT: By the way, the environment was really cool. Especially first section the game was nice.  Whole parts of the game low poly and it seems basic but its compeletely peacefull. Lastly I wonder what happened the man who was looking to accident at the beginning.","August 13, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I found the puzzles pretty easy but had to look online for hints in a couple of spots. I liked it ok for a point and click simple walkthrough. Interesting back story. One thing I want to give a warning about, it you easily get motion sick the movement in this game might be an issue. I had to take sea sick pills to get through it but maybe I am more sensative than most!","October 27, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

About 5 levels long.\n\nMuch of the game is a hidden item, once you have all the items you're on your way.\n\nEnjoyed playing it and I hope they plan to add more to the game and it's puzzles.","August 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
