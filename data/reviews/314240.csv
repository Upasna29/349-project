It costs a good amount of gold to build and expand and it is a very small area they give you, building can be next to impossible if you need to remove something and there is a huge building in front of it, and the appeal of your town goes down too quickly so you are left to endlessly build decorations or else your town will get a bad rep and no visitors will come. For example, I tried removing my dirt roads to replace them with stone roads and ended up deleting a flagpole, bounty board, and statue by accident because the action highlighted was "delete road" but it deleted those instead wasting a lot of money. Also when you want to pause the game to manage a store or something else it puts a red tint across the entire screen that is just annoying.\n\nIn short, there are many problems with this game that just make it annoying.

You own a kingdom. Why? Who knows. You build stuff (taverns, shops, barracks, etc.) in a large-ish grid of grass and trees. You attract people into your kingdom, in hopes of them buying some stuff from your shops, like your average tycoon, although as of yet it is a very small focus. The big focus is on quests. You send your heroes on certain types of quests (rescue, vanquish, deliver, etc.) in certain other kingdoms. You allot some points to certain categories, and they're on their way. Thats pretty much it. Build more, quest more. Thats kind of all it is now. Now on with the rating. First of all, if I could rate this game N/A, I would. This game is simply unstable. There are many many bugs and imbalances. The developer himself said the game cost almost nothing to make, so I truly think the game would have been shed in a far better light if he waited to release it on early access. Although it is on the right track, its hard to recommend it as it is. Here is a pros and cons list, with that out of the way:\n\nCons:\nUnbalanced\nBuggy\nSensory-depriving color pallette, nothing but green and brown and gold highlights the whole game.\nSomewhat repetative quests, with sliders that seem to do nothing (unlike the ever-important sliders in GDT) EDIT: Sliders are now gone, and are replaced with... nothing? Now its worse than before, but not stealing something anymore.\nSlow progression, esp. in building.\nOnce money (sorry, 'gold') goes below 0, its game over. No exceptions or anything, just a game over screen.\nHeros slowly die, with no apparent way to heal them. You even get a healing potion store, but not for them I guess. EDIT: This is aparently now fixed\nKlunky UI\n(keep in mind that almost all of these cons are things that can very easily be fixed by tweaking some numbers and code, so its up to the developer to make things right, for me atleast.)\n\nPros:\nInteresting and unique graphics (though they could still use quite a bit of work)\nDespite monotony, still quite fun.\nThings to research,\nShops to run,\nNot much else to say.\n\nI recommend this game because it is absolutely on the right track. If everything goes as it is, this game will be good. I can't disrecommend this game because of unforseen bugs and unbalances. While the developer should have released it a bit later, he very well might not have gotten any playtesters, therefore not being able to find any of those bugs or unbalances. The core game is fun, and thats all I'm looking for. So overall, I'm cutting this game some slack. I'll probably only play it briefly after the large updates every few weeks or so. The developer very honestly says he will work as hard as he can to finish this game, but anything can happen to one lone developer. A caring, involved developer like this is what this game needs to be fixed. I just hope he will. As of now, the current update, wait to buy, but you eventually should.","January 4, 2015","true","6.1"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","36","42","3","4"

Luckily the game saves constantly so I got back right where I left off.\n\nUnfortunately everything was pretty much bugged.\n\n\n-3 buildings were solid the rest were opaque. Toggling that option just switched the 3 solid back and forth.\n-Score was reset entirely for every kingdom.\n-All quick quests were locked agian except for 4 random ones.\n-Same with supplies for quick quests.\n-All progress on epic quest unlocks was reset.\n-Basically everything was completely ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nAlso if you do play make sure you wait for a hero to actually start doing what you set them to do. Some things will allow you to set multiple heroes to one building (Such as training strength).

I bought it yesterday and it's honestly shaped up to be a pretty good game.\n\nDont count this game out because of it's old reviews. I've had a blast playing it.\n\nI'll try to update my review once this gets updated or upon full release but as for now I wanted to add a positive review to the list.\n\nUPDATE 12/2/15\nI havent tried this game again in a good while. So far I can tell the game has had alot of explanations for things added. Such as skills on your heroes. I didnt know what they really did before (or if they even did anything back then) but now you can mouse over things to see what they do. I also enjoy being able to make multiples of certain buildings. Like needing to build houses for each of your heroes, rather than just having one house that you cram all of your heroes into. IM SO GLAD I CAN BUILD MULTIPLES OF THE SAME BUILDIGN NOW! Now I can make massive marketplaces rather than only being able to have one weapon shop! This is something I wanted REALLY bad before.\n\nThis game keeps getting alot better as time goes on. Though I'm sad I lost my save from for freaking ever ago, there's alot of things that changed that I'd need to learn about by playing again. I'm a massive sucker for Town management games.

Which, in my opinion, it shouldn't have been released this early. In it's form now, it's painfully boring, slow and repeatative. You're placed in a large valley and it's obvious you're supposed to be building a civilaziation, or so I think. You're sent on repeatative quests that cost more than you'll get. If you're lucky maybe a villager will buy your $10 potions.\n\nLike I said, I think this was released way too early. It has potential, but for now I can't say I'd recommend this game.\n\nTwo things significantly wrong with the game is that the font is about size 4 and full screen doesn't work.

Henry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/munkelschmunkel/","81 products in account","RPG Tycoon - Review\nGameplay:\nThis game features two different aspects (RPG and Tycoon, duh), which are brought together in a rather interesting, but initially confusing way. Basically half of the game happens in text boxes.\nYou manage a kingdom, build it, take care of your people (your followers) and expand by meeting the needs of both your followers and your heroes.\nHeroes bring in the aspect of RPG: You use the heroes to gain gold, experience, supplies and reputation all around, by sending them on quests. These quests do have direct effects on your kingdom, but in terms of gameplay are basically a few textboxes and a progress bar. It basically brings in another aspect of management, next to the management of income, followers and overall expansion.\nThe game was very confusing in the beginning, since you need to figure out how much you actually spend on working on your kingdom and how much you invest into your heroes and their quests.\nThere is a big repertory on buildings and quests, so one is faced with a lot of decisions.\nThe Tycoon part in general is filled with neat sprites, whilst the RPG part is pretty basic, yet it plays a big role in the development of your kingdom.\n\nThe game also features quite a lot of bugs, which, for a full-release title, certainly is a big down.\n\nPros:\n+The aspect of kingdom-management has been very well designed\n+Long lasting gameplay\n+Full workshop support\n\nCons:\n-The RPG aspect of the game is textbased and very basic\n-Bugs\n\nConclusion:\nThe game seems to be in a strange harmony, with the graphic based kingdom management, and the text based quests, where you need to find the balance between these two aspects to be successful on your journey.\nSince this game is already full-release I can not ignore the bugs and they therefore also will be part of the final score:\n5/10 - in its current state.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 23","true","15.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","2"

The few downsides right now would be that the game tends to just freeze up every now and then , and there's nothing you can do about it. So if you're going to play this save alot and be prepared to be a bit patient as you'll only have 1 hero for a good while and he gets fatigued at times. And the other minor gripes I do have would be with the way you set the sliders for your heroes on a quest. Things like Rush , Guard , Conflict sure you get the basic ideas but it's still very much vague , however the game is in early access and I'm hoping they'll make things like that a bit more accessible to people so they actually know what they're setting their sliders to and how it affects your hero on a quest.\n\nAll in all , promising and excited to see more of it!

Its one of those games that I want to love, but just can't.\n\nHere are a few reasons why...\n1. Stability is an issue even now, almost a year after Early Access opened. Funny thing is: stability has actually gotten worse\n2. The  UI is terrible. Confusing and counter-intuitive, you'll likely find yourself clicking around in menus trying to find things for several minutes\n3. The game is largely all dicerolls. Its unclear how to influence your odds\n4, Missions are arbitrary and pointless. There is no reason to read the text. It doesn't even tell a cohesive story\n5. Its not clear what the game is about. Is it about hero management or city building? And what's the deal with neighboring towns (some you're competing against, and some you're just visiting). It doesn't seem like the game-maker has a single vision for the game, but rather has a few visions for a few different games and kinda just taped them together.\n\nAt the time of writing this, the game isn't worth your money (August 8, 2015).

With that said, the current state it is in I would not reccomend it quite yet to those looking to play a game with some rough edges. This game has more rough edges than a un-cut gemstone. Personnaly I love the concept of this game, but no matter what I do, I lose before I can really get started. The learning curve of this game, I would say, is much higher than need be. The fact that you start with random quests, but the same towns is also a large cause for many of my losses as I've started with three quests none of the towns have cared for, thus ensuing I would not have enough gold income to survive. I also understand that roads need to be maintained, but dirt roads, (in real life can be made by a single person walking the same path over the course of time that all they need to do is keep walking it to keep it in decent shape) costs a fair amount of gold to maintain. That simple fact confuses  deeply. If there isn't another type of road yet in the game, fair enough, but if there is (which I can't get far enough in to find out myself) then there is no reason Dirt roads should cost anything more than being built. Another problem I have is the Item system. My meele hero can have either a sword OR a sheild? and are there no class speific items such as wands only useable by spell casters (I.e. wizzards, mages, ect.)?\n\nIn conclusion It's got a lot of rough edges, but I see that this game might just be a diamond in the rough at this stage. Reccomended for a easy to comprehend and play game for a good time? not yet. Reccomended for someone wanting to see a game as it developes and have fun learning the game and getting farther every update?

Feels like an alpha release.\n\nLitterally from 20-30 minutes of play.\n\nPossible improvements\n\n1. Music is very high pitched. Had to turn it off.\n2. When choosing quests, you can't go back to the original quest menue via a back button. So if you click a normal quest, you can't go to the original screen to choose between a normal/epic/history.\n3. Graphics are too simple... Needs more love/smoothed sides.\n4. Punished way too heavily for repeat quests. I understand if you repeat the same quest and it reduces a bit more every time, but to go from say 8 happy to 1 is a bit drastic.\n5. Purchases don't feel that fun. There's no sense of achievement when you add buildings.  Perhaps ability to upgrade buildings instead of just purchasing more?\n6. The people that come into the town don't have any character to them. They all seem bland and generic.\n7. Heroes should feel more personable...\n8. Combo history definately can be improved to be easier. Say automatically making items that don't work red. But I feel like this feature is kind of... pointless. Why do we even need to bring supplies? It punishes the player for not having unlocked the other stuff you need. I litterally only have 3/6 items I need as soon as I start the game, and that's just for the begining quest.\n9. I can't fully rotate the buildings. Only 2 face options.\n10. The heroes don't feel alive. Maybe they should express things when they are getting worse in mood?\n11. When the tutorial menu came on the right, i attempted to keep doing what I was doing. but couldn't. This might cause confusion for some people. Maybe semi graying out everything when it pops up so you can focus on the menu might be cool.\n12. On the start screen, the game menu back button is too far in the bottum left corner.

The music is decent, but can and will get annoying fairly quickly.\n\nThe controls are easy - lots of clicking on menus extremely remniscent of Game Dev Tycoon (GDT). Many reviews for this game point Game Dev Tycoon as a source of inspiration for this game, however, you could honestly think of this as a much weaker, boring attempt to pay homage to GDT. There isn't really a tutorial function, but everything is pretty straightforward. For some strange reason, dirt roads are very expensive to make (not cost-efficient at all), so DO NOT make any. They don't really seem to do anything either. The learning curve is minimal, but wonky. There are combinations you can do when sending your heroes on missions - for example, certain villages prefer certain missions, and every mission requires you to select "attributes" to put your skill points into (ala GDT).\n\nMission example: when you send your hero on a supply run for village x, you can decide to put a few points in horses (seems to speed up mission completion time), weapons, food, and conduct (seems to do absolutely nothing). Or, you can choose to allocate points to bravado, to scouting, stealth, and aggression. Depending on how "compatible" your mission, selected village, and allocated points are, you will accumulate points in "loot," "influence," and "damage" (again, ala GDT).\n\nThe higher your loot value, the more llikely you are to receive items (ex: weapons, shields). You can sell these all at once or equip them to your heroes (they can only equip one item at a time) for stat boosts. Influence and damage values affect how many followers you will receive/lose after mission completion. I think followers add to your money-generated-over-time, which comes from things like potions being sold at an alchemy store. You also gain renown after completing missions, which is used in combination with gold to purchase building upgrades like more buildings (many features are incomplete or locked at the moment).\n\nDuring missions, you will be presented with 3 scenarios (they are always the same) where you must select a "strategy" for your hero to use (ex: be confrontational, talk your way through, or work around it. Again, depending on what you choose and its compatibility with your selected mission, you will gain points in the 3 main mission counters (loot, influence, damage).\n\nThis game is clearly in early, early access, and I strongly recommend you do not get this (or at least wait until it's released as a finished product). You cannot sell items once you decide to keep them (the sell option is grayed out, so you have to pick "sell" right when you complete a mission and are shownn the loot screen if you want extra gold). You can find new villages and missions with the "explore" option, but it just unlocks more boring, tedious artificial-game-lengtheners.\n\nHonestly, if you want to play a game like this, I STRONGLY suggest you turn away and pick up Game Dev Tycoon instead.That game at least has a lot of variety and aesthetics for you to enjoy.\n\nAt least for now, wait to see how this develops (if you are really, really interested). Even if you are dying to try this, I implore you to wait until it is out of early access.\n\nDo not recommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","October 24, 2014","false","1.4"," 41 of 74 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","41","74","0","9"

It goes down faster than you can send everyone on quests to make money to fill every square with decor. It's just too buggy at the moment to play. I have to Alt F4 every 10-15 min because the game freezes. Then when i reload the cost to expand is different. Sometimes heros leave and dont come back. Reloading fixes that. The quests are awkward and there is no way to let the hero go by themselves. It says you dont control them but it feels like you control there every moves exept healing and fatigue. And half the time they dont do that when they cross the threshold... Just not quite ready to be playable.

I particularly am impressed with the amount of new things a hero can do while another does the generic questing. The settlements have now become far more interactive, the shops serve more purpose than just money farming, and the inventory system now seems much more efficient at relating to the player what exactly they have and what it is good for. There are quite a few things left for me to really explore in this game, however it does seem familiar to another game by Kairosoft which I also loved called Dungeon Village, but even so this game is quickly surpassing that in terms of activities and gameplay especially the questing which allows you to choose your type of destiny instead of just accepting what there is already.\n\nfor my obligatory rant however, I must say that the interface and specifically the ability to click on a specific object like a dirt road to delete resulted in my accidentally deleting an accessory shop, I would ask that with the opacity option maybe a more refined targetting with my cursor is desired. Also another petpeeve i've developed is with the arbitrary award system at the end of the year. In dungeon village the village and its heros in particular are awarded medals which are actual items that can be used to improve a hero's stats across the board. I'm not suggesting that exact thing but I would prefer something other than numbers and letters at the end of the year as this just does not add anything special to the game for me in particular. Lastly, and remember I have not played through the entire game since the last update but I feel as though the random events could be more than just global modifiers maybe something more interactive or under your control or the option to attempt to control the event would be preferable than just accepting the event as is. I suggest maybe also adding something similar to the dice roll system from epic quests allowing your heros to not only quest for settlements but to have the chance to maybe protect, improve, prevent, etc options for a global modifier event. If they fail the event is worse, if they succeed they improve the modifier, if they do nothing it remains the same as it currently is.\n\nAnyway I will be returning to play this after work, and the game as it has now become and currently is, worthy of purchase and worthy of your playtime. I don't know the developer or what he is working with but I saw a pile of crap spread on an empty canvas become a beautiful painting that still needs a slight touch up. Good work man and please continue to do your best and follow your own vision more so than the people who make suggestions because in the end they bought your game because of your decisions and visions and alot of developers seem to bow down to every crappy suggestion that sounds good on paper but damages the core gameplay that originally attracted that same person who made the suggestion to the game in the first place. tl;dr keep doing your own thing, but stay open minded to suggestions that may still be useful or an improvement to your vision.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, I love the settlement of Threepwood, I can't put my finger on why but it seems familiar and friendly to me.","February 17","true","8.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Most of my skepticism stems from the fact that I've played other games that promised me the ability to manage my very own kingdom...and failed to deliver.  Luckily, "RPG Tycoon" has been getting regular updates with a bunch of new content planned.  The game is admittedly unstable at times, though the gameplay was still fairly enjoyable.  In short, you'll be constructing buildings and attempting to attract visitors all the while sending heroes out on quests.  The latter reminds me a bit of "Game Dev Tycoon" in that you can move "sliders" across different categories before sending the heroes out.  This game has a lot of potential and can be something great so as long as the developer continues to pump out content and balance/stabilize said content.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoGQCnQxq8Y","April 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hemmingjay/recommended/314240/","hemmingjay","Hemmingjay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hemmingjay/","1433 products in account","This comes down to early access as a concept. The idea is to support very small indie developers with a great concept that you would like to see developed. There are countless articles in the gaming press about how studios are taking less and less chances since games cost so much to make. This means fewer new IPs or game series and the first genres to suffer are the niches like management/tycoon/sim. This is because it's a smaller audience and a group that by nature waits for sales and opportunities to buy games(trained to look for a bargain by the very games that suffer due to this emotional IQ) for less. If you want games like this your only chance is to continue to support titles like this one in Early Access. To be honest, half will turn out as garbage. A 1/4 will be an outright waste. Another 1/4 though will turn out to be a gem that guides the genre for the next few years and that's worth taking chances. For a genre that simulates business you need to follow the real guideline which is perseverence in the face of staggering odds. 9/10 new businesses fail(false but often quoted stat) and that should roughly guide you when buying EA titles in this genre. You don't avoid starting a business because your chances are small. In fact the reason you keep going is because that eventual success is worth it.\n\nIs this game great...no. However, it has good ideas and flawed execution. Common to EA and this genre. You should buy it to experience it's better mechanics and ideas. You should buy it to show the developers that there is still a market for this type of game. You should buy it to keep this developer making games. His next will be better than this. Eventually he could make the gold standard tycoon game. If you don't support it because it's not perfect then you guarantee the chances of playing a great management game go down for all of us.

I do not discredit the developers in any way, and this is in no way meant to be offensive but I can't even play it. In the Indie game boom graphics don't really hold much relevance, so this has nothing to do with graphics. I am an avid tycoon enthusiast and management simulator, and this falls short on EVERY level. Very minimal control, and little to no reward. Great premise, and could be amazing but the features need to be expanded upon.

At one point, my kingdom is filled with stupid crap instead of buildings.\nYou can send heroes out to help your settlement but beware, they only like a very specific type of quest and if you do it wrong, their happiness will decrease. There's also mix and match items which isn't bad but the quest for settlements are very annoying. If their happiness is low but their risk of being invade whatsoever is high, and you send in heroes, voila, you've now lost your settlement (even if the quest you chose to help is what they like). Makes sense? No? I don't understand neither. What would've help is the settlement send messages saying WHAT they need help with instead of crappy guessing and even if right, fail regardless.\nMostly everything is diceroll and you have no idea what influences it, which is annoying as hell.\nSometimes you might lose your adventure through bugs (for me--he's forever in "recovery mode", you can't even sack him to make space).\nAnnoying UI, if you want to upgrade a building, you have to carefully hover over it alone and then carefully make it back to the upgrade screen, if you by any chance, unfortunately hovered over one of those townies .. well then, repeat the process until you make it to the upgrade screen. Mouse hover shows stats of whatever you're hovering over.\nYou can't redo the placement for you building if you want to move somewhere else. The map you started off is pretty small so I cramped a lot of buildings and decorations (thank you Attractiveness crap), and then everything become a giant jumble piece of crap.\nThere's not much of things you can truly research for, after a while, it's the same thing over and over again (pretty quickly too).

There are some things that need to be changed or added:\n1. you have to be able to change your camera view while you're building something\n2. you have to be able to rotate your building in 4 directions and not only in 2 as it is now\n3. in "building mode" you need to have a reset button or be able to sell the last building you built to the full price, because right now the game punishes you for everything you build and then notice that it isn't the way you wanted it to be\n4. it would be nice to do things while in pause mode (minor problem)\n5. the hole questing system is either to complicated or not explained enough, I think it isn't explained enough because for example I couldn't figure out what the diffrent approaches really did diffrent and what stats were good for what approach\n6. don't use bars, numbers are much more informative\n7. explain why it is beneficial to assign heroes to diffrent buildings and/or settlements\n8. make a free mode where you don't have to compete with other kingdoms, where the goal is just to build your town\n\nTo be honest I really loath the "competing rubbish" in all the Tycoon games, I think it's sad that there is no other way they can make a challenge, but in the business tycoon games it at least makes sense, while in such a fantasy setting there should be something more interesting you could do with the tycoon/town builder-idea.","October 27, 2015","false","1.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","3"

At one point, my kingdom is filled with stupid crap instead of buildings.\nYou can send heroes out to help your settlement but beware, they only like a very specific type of quest and if you do it wrong, their happiness will decrease. There's also mix and match items which isn't bad but the quest for settlements are very annoying. If their happiness is low but their risk of being invade whatsoever is high, and you send in heroes, voila, you've now lost your settlement (even if the quest you chose to help is what they like). Makes sense? No? I don't understand neither. What would've help is the settlement send messages saying WHAT they need help with instead of crappy guessing and even if right, fail regardless.\nMostly everything is diceroll and you have no idea what influences it, which is annoying as hell.\nSometimes you might lose your adventure through bugs (for me--he's forever in "recovery mode", you can't even sack him to make space).\nAnnoying UI, if you want to upgrade a building, you have to carefully hover over it alone and then carefully make it back to the upgrade screen, if you by any chance, unfortunately hovered over one of those townies .. well then, repeat the process until you make it to the upgrade screen. Mouse hover shows stats of whatever you're hovering over.\nYou can't redo the placement for you building if you want to move somewhere else. The map you started off is pretty small so I cramped a lot of buildings and decorations (thank you Attractiveness crap), and then everything become a giant jumble piece of crap.\nThere's not much of things you can truly research for, after a while, it's the same thing over and over again (pretty quickly too).

The music is very good, the graphics are simplistic but very detailed, and the compitition bewteen the kingdoms can drive a user to go farther and try to expand and grow their kingdom. However, There are many bad things about this game as well. When I say bad, I don't mean bad, I mean that could be fixed in the future and because this is an early access game and is very orginal to say the least is a very good acomplishment by the developer. The bad things about this game is that, I feel, when a user uses the arrow keys or wasd, the movement is too slow, now I have to admit. I haven't looked in the options for a change of speed but I feel like it isn't there, feel free to correct me if I am wrong.\n\nRPG Tycoon is one of my favourite games right now and Here's why. First, It's easy to get used to. You can get straight into the game and the game will teach you how to play and after 30 minutes-1 hour you know how to run and set-up your kingdom. Second, what I like about this game is that it allows you to be very creative and you can design your own kingdom however you like, but, this comes at a cost, while you are designing your kingdom it seems that you can only build on 2 sides and can only see one way. I believe this is because the camera is at a fixed postion and cannot move 3 dimentionaly, but that only limmits your creativitiy very little. Third, the implacation of a tourniment between the kindgoms and the fact that you have to have relations with other little cities that are under your kingdom, or claimed by your kingdom is very orginal, at least I have never seen this way of doing it in other games, the closest game I can think of that does this is the Civilization series, mainly Civilization V or 5, with the city states and how you can control them, but not as much as you can in this game.\n\nAll in all I give this game a 8/10, however, this is excluding all of the bugs and code issues that I am seeing on the fourm and experencing myself, I am purely Rating on how fun the game is to me and how much enjoyment I can get from RPG Tycoon.","January 30","true","31.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I've been playing nonstop for the past few hours now and it's a really smooth playing game. There is a little learning curve(bankrupted my first kingdom) but once you get used to it, it's not hard.\n\nI'll start with my first impressions. There is a tutorial that I'm guessing helps you through it(I skipped it and learned by mistake). The game starts off kinda tedious because you only have a few quick quests you can do at the start and you just cycle through all 5 until you get a few more. You luckily don't have to remember what works best for each quest because it has a history feature which shows what goes with what. The art style reminds me of tycoon type games back in the 90s and early 2000s. The UI is nice and easy to understand with tooltips telling you what each button does. I noticed a few typos but nothing a hotfix can't remedy.\n\nAfter a few hours the game starts to pick up because you can now start what are called Epic Quests. Epic Quests are quests that take 2 or more heroes to start. These quests allow you to get more supplies and quick quests as well as other valuable items like weapons and armor. You don't need to do epic quests just to get more quick quests once you unlock the library(I think kingdom level 3) you can research all types of things from lower maintenance costs for your buildings to more followers per settlement.\n\nDon't get me started on modding this game. It's one of the easiest games to mod. First off everything is shown in pretty much plain text(XML) and they have a whole page of the site to help with modding the game. Let's say you want to mod the UI to have a few different textures(I completely changed the color of the UI to green, which you can get on the workshop) all you have to do is go into the UI.png spritesheet change the text you want and next time you load the game it's changed. I recommend making the mod in a folder in the mods folder to make disabling and enabling them easier. Adding quests and heroes is also very easy by just adding a new line to the heroes.xml.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to use interface\n- Modding support\n- Self-explanatory UI and functions\n- 90s and early 2000s tycoon nostalgia look and feel\n\nCons:\n- Few bugs\n- Little grindy\n\nRating:\n9.5/10\n\nEdit: The customer support is amazing. The new update(1.0.6) broke my save but the dev is already pushing out a fix for it and it's only been like an hour. Not only that but he also helped me through any help I needed for modding.","February 12","true","23.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

With every patch it takes a step in the right direction, but in its current state, It's buggy.

I understand that the developer might speak another language other than English (I hope) but the mistakes need to be fixed before the final release. There was also constantly froze everytime I went to the potion store and it would say I didn't have enough reknown (currency) when I did.\n\nAll up the game needs to work on keeping excitement constant and not dragging down in 30 minutes. I see how this game can come good though in future updates (maybe adding plagues or something exciting so that you will need to work harder to keep your followers?)","August 19, 2014","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So far it is tedious doing the same things repeatedly to make money to expand. Contracts aren't working but possibly not implemented yet. The biggest downfall for me at this point in the game is simply the game crashes. The screen just freezes so if you do not save often, you are screwed of all the time spent as well as progress.

And in all honesty, it still probably would be. But I can see that the developer has really put some effort and heart into making this a better game. It's super addictive and overall a major step up. But regaurdless, it's still a buggy broken mess. From the moment you turn it on, optimization issues abound. There is no good way to play this game. Period. The only way to make the text legible is to make the windows to big that they take up the whole sceen. And as for the game itself... Tourist constantly clip in and out of the ground. When you type your name at the title screen, the text is far away. And I finally had to stop playing whenever my blacksmith shop clipped into the ground and a square over from where I placed it. So I deleted it. But the game permanatly kept those squares blocked off. So... and I kept doing this no matter where I placed the shop. Making my small area unusable (and it didnt help when I realized it autosaves every time you place an object.) So, in short... This would have made a great game to play. but not a great game to pay for. And again... thats where the issue lies. But if you just fix those bugs, you'd be golden.\n\nSo just keep on trying. And...

It's almost a city builder, but your resources are your heroes.  You send heroes on quests to earn experience, gold and loot.  You can discover settlements, which you need to keep happy but I'm not exactly sure how to do that.  I've sent heroes on quick quests to settlements "in despair" and actually lowered their happiness.  The game needs to tell you what each settlement is in need of so you can raise their happiness more efficiently.  At this point, it seems to be trial and error.\n\nThe variety of different quests is interesting and leaves the door open for even more complexity in future development.  There are villains that are discovered automatically through quests and are defeated by completing "epic" quests.  Defeating these villains earns extra gold and happiness I think.  There are also bandits you can defeat through bounty quests, but bounties expire and there doesn't seem to be a way to remove the expired bounties from the list.  I wish they just automatically disappeared once they expired.\n\nThe loot system needs some work.  You get loot and it's stored in your kingdom.  Your kingdom's inventory only shows 8 slots, but, as far as I can tell, you actually store a lot more than that.  I've deleted many items in the hopes that I could keep new loot as opposed to selling it at the end of a quest, but I've so far not been able to do so.  I feel like that's a bug where your kingdom's inventory just keeps spawning random items.  Which is fine, since you basically have unlimited loot, but surely not intentional.  Managing the loot equipped on your characters is cumbersome, as well.  You can equip items on your heroes which increases their stats, but I don't think you can view the equipped loot and you can only equip one piece of loot at a time (so you can't equip both a sword and a shield, for example).  You can change your equipped loot, but you can't see what is already equipped and I'm not sure that the stat bonus changes are reported properly when trying to equip different gear.\n\nIt also seems like there aren't many buildings available to actually build in your kingdom at this stage.  I haven't earned a new building in a few kingdom levels and there's really no reason to expand my kingdom further at this point since I've built all the buildings and I don't need more space to build more.  I'm sure those will come in time, but people in your kingdom still complain that there isn't enough to do or enough shops in which to spend money.\n\nRPG Tycoon is an interesting take on the tycoon genre and I look forward to playing it more once it's a bit more complete.  It's one of those games that I could easily see just sucking many hours from my life without me even noticing it.","April 9, 2015","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Developers, please fix the glitch where, only one quest can be active at a time, even with 2 or more heros, and all other heros leave after the one on a quest returns, i got no idea waz up wit dat. as for the actuall gameplay, it's good but there needs to be more of it, i only have one contract, and the reward is broken. there need to be more upgrades. As of now, it's good but incomplete i'll check back a while later with an updated review. p.s. devs, i could help with trading cards and achieves if needed. thank you.\n\nas of AUGUST 18, 2014. The latest Patch fixed many problems. The quest system is much better based on choices rather than sliders. I like that gold is more common ,however reputation is stupidly impossible to come by. I Also noticed that each time i reload the game i have a new list of settlements... this is bad. i understand that it's designed to be more challenging but since you gain more rep on well paired mission to settlement the fact that you can start without any good matches is annoying... it doesn't need fixed.. just wanted to mention it. as of now, I would like to see a better balance of the 2 currencies. While i beleive all early access games are crap waiting to be sifted for diamonds, i do believe i'm starting to see something sparkle.\n\nas of MARCH 18, 2015. the first thing that greets any player in any game is the title screen. it is a bit bare but this is a vaugely minimalist game so i'll let it slide... and why can't i open the new game tab? my mouse is in the wrong place!?!?! this can be fixed by carefully oppening the options menu and fitting to screen. right, so, new game. the additions of difficulty and length are much appreciated, now on to the game. i'm mixed on the fences, they do help to limit progression, but that is a double edged sword. the GUI is a lot smoother, heros have stats and abilities clearly visible before purchase. the variety of initial quests is a lot larger and epic quests seem much easier. the "Approach" system is much simpler, but i think i liked it better before, but the event system is a fair trade. i also think it's better for kingdoms to be added passively during quests. items have been added and loot being given by quests is very satisfying, it feels like you are really progressing from quest to quest. some sentences seem cut off such as: "earn 500 gold from" .the research system is much improved. with as far as i got, a lot has changed, it became more difficult to make stores, there is an end of the year report which tells you who's winning, over all it is much better and i will probably continue it in the future.","August 10, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

They also made multi-tasking managable by the game.

This being said I quickly ran into some of the same problems that I found the first time around.\n+Fixed the look of the game so it's much smoother.\n+Makes you earn your way to a larger land for your kingdom which I actually enjoy.\n+Tells you what most things do such as skills, very useful as I would have thought sprint had an upside otherwise.\n+Fixed how hard it is to make gold\n+Gives you guidelines/goals to help you grow your town.\n+You can make your town look nearly any way you want over time.\n+Makes fun of it's self.  I've had someone come in my new town and even admit it looks like it's still in aplha.\nCons that I'm still waiting to be fixed.\n-What you bring on a quest may not help at all.  I've done a combo of farm hand and peaceful village once and got a decent score out of it, though when revisiting it later it told me to bring beater weapons and twice that their magic was better.... WHAT?!  I thought I was farming not slaying.\n-Still only faces places south east and south west from what I can see.  Though this is minor.\n-You'll want to stick on easy as it may be a bit insane any other way.  More so if you've played the older versions.\n-They don't tell you what the items you'll take on your quest influence or are effective with.\n-And the final con, for me, is the other version spoiled my taste for this game and I admit I'm simply re-doing this review as it would be unfair to SS not to try after all the hard work they put in.\n\nAll in all I'd say pick it up for 5 bucks heck 7 isn't too bad if you feel like you need a Tycoon game.  Just keep in mind the game is not yet finished so something that bugs you may be fixed, speaking of bugs be careful when naming your town, you may have to restart the game due to your cursor getting glitched.","December 27, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

And well there is still a lot of room for upgrades with that, as it shows, there is so much potential that is showing now, and hopefully it can use the rest of the time it has in early access perfectly.\nLast of all is how it has upgraded so well in its looks and navigation, unlike its original version which had a clunky and broken menu and lacked anything, it now added stuff which are needed, now there is some options still to be added but the important ones are  there, which is great. And also the game is actually possible to navigate, at first it took me about 4 minutes to get into the game, which was a let down at that, but now it is fixed, and takes mere seconds, even less at that, and its worth it.\nNow with all the positives, the game still does have problems, it does feel that is lacks buildings and size, and after a bit I felt that this stuff could've been added when after all this was a problem for people, though I understand that fixing the game was a big thing needed.\n\nSo is  it worth buying RPG Tycoon at the moment?\nYes it is!\nOver the course of 6 months this game has came from being a cluggy bit of a mess to a true and great tycoon game, which is worth £5, after all it goes to help the dev upgrade.\n8.5/10\n\nORIGINAL:\nThough the game is far from finished, this game just doesn't have any fun to it, and that is most likely because it is very buggy and there is nothing to do, but there is still a lot that can be done while it is in Early Access, but for now i recommend people stay away from this until it gets better as at the minute it is just a borefest","August 27, 2014","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Right now, the game's not OVERLY enjoyable for long lengths of time so I would recommend maybe plopping it on your wishlist for now and maybe purchasing it when the next Steam Summer Sale comes along. That leaves plenty of time for new features to flood in. Anyway I'd certainly recommend this game and for the price - not bad!\n\nI give it a 7.5/10","December 29, 2014","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

New build, new bugs. Lots of new and intersting things. LOTS of new and frustrating bugs. Much of the idea of how the game played previously is gone. I ladore aspects of the new build but am remiss to comment because, like game of thrones, i suspect if i love it it will go away.\n\n\n4/6/15 Updated** I have to give it to the guy. Easily the most dedicated solo developer I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. He ligitimately wants to turn out and enjoyable final product that he devotes quite a bit of time to.\n\nThe recent changes in my opinion, move the scope of the game quite a bit and dull it up a touch but those are just asthetic. Having watched his work and progress, i believe he will develop a balance that works. Buy his game at the price of half a movie and youll get two movies worth of time out of it with a developer that deserves your assistance. He's going to make good games, lets help him make a middling one.\n\n\n3/18/15  Updated** The most recent update is lightyears ahead of where this developer was previously. The changes that are being made are game benifitial and working. Game still hanging but that is hardly anything more than an inconvience at this alpha stage. The game is much improved but not enough for me to recommend you buy it. There is hope though that the game will turn out a playable and possibly fun game at the end of his journey at this point.\n\n\n** Original review **\nThe most positive thing i can say is the developer is active in the community. I cant say much gets fixed that people talk about but he adds things  then those things break. Its going to end as a mediocre 1/2 done game in my opinion. Its okay and i have played it but even in Alpha or beta or whatever stage is Give me your money while i putz around my house for the next ten years is... its more broke than many better games at or near its price point.","January 17, 2015","true","20.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Well first off it is in ALPHA! So don't complain or give this a bad review since overall right now even though I have found plenty of bugs. I let the maker of the game know. That is why we got this early access. If you though it was going to be different and a full game in Alpha then you are a idiot.\n\nThis game is a nice throw back to the old Sim's like RC2 and RC1 as well as Pharoh and such based on the graphics. Gameplay is a work in progress but is manageable to work around. Nothing really game breaking since this game is again in Alpha and we are here to report problems.\n\nI would say buy this game and help out and enjoy the growth of a very cool idea.

Then I launched it, the first thing I realised was the beautiful soundtrack, instructional but not too confusing tutorial, and quite nice graphics (I knew the graphics from gameplay and screenshots of course). Next thing I realised was how easy it is for players that haven't played much management simulators or citys building games (like myself) to know how to play. I can definitely see myself playing this a bit more.\n\nPros  Instructional but not boring or confusing tutorial\nClear Interface\nBeautiful Soundtrack\nCheap\nYou have competing Kingdoms\nReplayability Middle Ground  Alright Graphics\nSays it could be buggy but no bugs so far Cons  Noobs (like myself) can find it difficult to keep up happiness and money\nCannot fully rotate buildings\nWas rushed out of early access (says there are bugs that need to be fixed but took it out of early access)\nNo "Move Object" tool Summary/Conclusion RPG Tycoon is a cool indie management simulator/city building game made by Skatanic Studios. Its graphics seem quite nice and are 3D skyview graphics which more games definitely need. The controls are pretty good however the only way you can move is with the LMB and cannot use the keyboard, which some people prefer with city building sims. RPG Tycoon is quite a fun and relaxing game to play on a tired night, and is not too hard either (but not too easy).\n\nOverall I think the game is pretty and fun. 8/10\n\nI review games at these links!

For instance, to place path's at the moment you have to constantly go into the buy menu rathher than just clicking and dragging. And at the moment there is very little in the game. But it does look like it could turn out to be quite good given time. And we all have to remember that the game is being developed by one person instead of a team. I'll probably write a proper review of it when it get's more features. But, as alot of other reviews (and the developer himself) have stated, If you aren't willing to provide feedback for the game then wait for it to get a bit more polished before purchasing it. There are some fairly major bug's i've noticed like heroes dissapearing after sending them to the tavern and, when i reloaded my game the tower of acievments(pimps for you AH fans) dissapeared and can't be rebought.

There is limited playability at the moment, so I would advise against dropping your last precious $5 on it if you are looking for something to provide a lot of near-term entertainment. However, I would keep my eye on the development of this game as it has much potential. If you're interested in supporting that and following along, then maybe that's worth the $5 to you. I don't see myself playing this frequently during Early Access, but I'll still check it out every few months to see how it has evolved.\n\nAny purchase at this point should be seen as an aspirational purchase rather than something you're going to sit down and deeply enjoy, right away. I'd normally try to talk people out of such an investment in a game at this point, but at only $5, it might be worth it to you.","August 21, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It does remind me alot of Game Dev and similar titles, but it has it's own unique perks and quirks. As for it's price tag... right now I think this game is well worth the money. Due to both it's original idea and the already implemented features.\n\nPersonally I am happy to back the developer of this game and am happy with my purchase. The only tip I can give a new player is to read all of the descriptions and use common sense in your judgment calls.\n\nI can't wait to see this game in it's complete form.","August 25, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

[Edit - bottom]\n\nI really want to enjoy this game but.... It makes me rage in less than 10 seconds, for many reasons.\nFirst,to write the town's name, you have to take off the pointer of the namebar or it will always reset.\nSecond, When ever I press ALT or Space, the screen gets redish and I can't get it off.\nThird, I can't demolish dirt paths.\nFourt, I can't even get the clinic at some place because there is no '' square '' to place it there. ( I did have the place for it ). Also, when I change direction of my clinics. It bugs and make it impossible to even see the haf of it and can't place it anywhere else too.\n\nI though after a year it would have been more... fixed than this.... Please I know it is your first game but, before getting new stuff in, Fix everything so it can be playable.\n\n[ Edit ] As of Update to 0.5. Even tho loading files delete them,it really improved, in term of fixed bugs AND the ''story'' , it changed in a very good way, Everything needs to be worked out to gain buildings through out your achievements which is great, not right in the stomach. I see forward to other improvements and modification of the gameplay. Just for that update, I can say that you should buy it on sales until it's low on price, worth it if it continu that way.","April 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

Don't ruin it by behind a mock off of a different game. Don't deny that they aren't similar, because they are. It was one of the first thoughts that came to mind.

Well hello little number maybe a 1 or even a lil .5. Nonetheless this game was there and as I really have enjoyed playing GameDevTycoon. I think this game can really learn a few things from Gamedev...\n\nGraphics- The graphics are good and very reminiscent of old school Runescape. Which plays in very well into the game.\n\nSliders- The sliders don't make much sense and is very vague.. Also are very cumbersome and need some better sound effects the default Window sound is very unappealing.\n\nKnowledge in Game- When you begin the game you are very overwhelmed and yet underwhelmed. You get some basic knowledge and are confused at the same time. You have no idea about what is working within the quests (like within the sliders and what works with what also point allocation).\n\nPoint allocation- The game has a bug where you can adjust the top portion of the allocation system by minusing them and have it return next quest with the points still remaining where you added them last time.\n\nMoney- I had no idea you lost the game when you ran out of money and so I ended the game within 2 mins by trying to build my city in more and adding roads.. To only have the game be all like you suck GG.\n\nVisitors-Their bubbles of text get stuck behind buildings and cannot be read.\n\nQuests and making money- NOOO Clue how to make good money, felt like I’m just waiting for my quests tooooo sllllooowwwwllllyyyy produce the little change each time.. Perhaps needs to be upped a bit? or I'm just a bit inpatient, who knows probably the second. The quests also need to be clearer and more feedback is needed and perhaps a memory system again similar to GameDev...\n\nUI- is very clear and clean but needs some better animations and sound effects. Hopefully they will add in better tutorials and make the game easier to jump in.\n\nQuesting- Please make the UI more fun and clear when your hero is on a quest. You get no idea why points are getting added into the certain places.\n\nAs I said before game looks great, shows a lot of promise and I can't wait for it to be finished to really log in some hours. I hope they change the music to something a lil catchier, add in some better sound effects, update the UI a bit more, and clean up the game all around to be honest. Will play more, look forward to the full release.\n\n\nThanks for reading my rant. (PS: I’ve only spent a few times on this game so read my review with that in mind)\n","August 5, 2014","true","1.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

One major concern is that the placement for the building is kinda off but I am pretty sure that will be fixed in future updates. Of course I have also noticed a few glitches like the quest counting up in the Loot, Influence, and Damage but the quest never progressed. Another is that I would be recieving funds from my establishments but it won't be counted. But these glitches all can be fixed by going back to the main menu the reloading the save, but still pretty annoying. All in all I am throughly impressed with this game and I can't wait for future updates.\n\n0.5 Update\nIt has made so much progress, I am proud to say I am backing this game.

Early access games do have problems! Personally, I have not enjoyed the game as much as I would have liked thus far. I have played it for a decent while on my other PC and to be honest, at the moment, I would wait a while until purchase. This game borrows a lot from Game Dev Tycoon. For example, sliders for quests, points going into bubbles to tell you how well things are going and a lack of a decent tutorial. It is extremely hard to pick up and play as early on you realise gold is limited and have no idea how to get your hands on it. Anyway, the game is new to Steam and therefore forgivable.

There are of course good and bad points to the game, however with most of the bad ones gone; the game has become very enjoyable. I would now happily recommend the game, just read about the current bugs beforehand so you can really enjoy the wonderful game of RPG Tycoon.\nI shall not detail you with what has been fixed as you should no longer have those issues, and so I have listed the bugs and errors that I encountered while playing this time around.\n\nMinor Isues;\n1) Without any load files, the load screen shows a fourth place that is partially outside the box, very minor but I like neatness\n2) Maybe I did not realise how I was playing but suddenly my kingdom had 1% attraction and all three settlement’s had minimal to no “likeness”. This caused me to resort to spamming my kingdom with decorations just to keep a solid income.\n3) Missing sprites when I once tried to use “bread” on a hero, clicking out and clicking back in solved this.\n4) A few text bugs and issues when viewing your heroes\n5) When you find multiple items with the same image, you can see the additional text of the first one, but not the second, this however is only for this moment and can be viewed normally in your inventory\n6) Once when my main hero (The first to hire) went into the “Potion Store” and was finished, his name and a bar was still there above the shop, the hero could do all actions normally and this text issue only disappeared when he returned into the same shop (a few in-game years later)\n\nMajor Issues;\n1) Manually saved and loaded the save file in the second slot (Not Auto-Save), my first 2 heroes that were the quest leaders had returned instantly along with the 2 other heroes that were on the “Epic Quest”, however I could no longer select to do either the “Quick Quest” or “Epic Quest” as I believe the system thinks that they are still on this quest, however with no quest bar at the bottom it could not be fixed. This was a major problem so a long time in-game later I saved it manually again, and loaded it, the issue was fixed, however by then I fired my heroes.\nAll remaining issues were found after the second loading.\n2) The villainy tracker had all reset, as well the bounty level had reset.\n3) The first of each quest type rewarded me with 0 Gold and 0 Followers, each quest after this was normal.\n4) One time my hero just never returned from an “Epic Quest”\n5) Lag started to occur quite a lot.\n6) Upon saving and leaving the game, the title screen had turned black, except from a centre square in the screen big enough to see the game was still running, however I could not click on any buttons as they were inside the black screen. This resulted in me having to change tabs out of the game, and manually closing the application.","May 17, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

There are massive chunks of interface and UI missing that make taking care of your town more tedious than fun. When you have 3 shops, clicking on each of them to see if they need to be leveled up is fine, but by mid-game you've got 15... that's a lot clicking, and the same logic applies to every other element of the game. The descriptions of quests/buildings/and options are often absent or vague. What makes a weapon store different than a bar? Who knows?

For example natural I'd assume we would need food, Weapons, Camping supplies, and Navigation help for hunting because the food would be used for bait, The Weapons to kill animals, the camping supplies for following herds, and the navigation help for finding said herds. But then food just hinders the quest (I assume? It just has food in red) and it's almost impossible to find the right combination. ALSO WHY WOULD YOU MAKE RESEARCH DESCRIPTIONS NOT FIT LIKE HOW!

I'd also like to see the bottom left window only function when a target is clicked instead of hovered over.\nThe top right information feed, feels rather rough, the messages don't need to stay for long and could actually be automatically deleted for you, I'm sure though that the developer is looking at this, with his own solution in mind.\nThe rest of the hud however, is well designed, pleasing to the eyes and gives relevant information.\n\nThe research is good, but feels like it lacks a lot of research, and I'd like to see it play a second role.\n\nThe town management is coming along nicely, and while playing, I actually thought that it was possible to create a self sustaining town, that does not rely on the funds from your heroes.\nI would like to see that be a thing, a self sustaining town, but I'd rather see it as a possible avenue for development in the game that you have to specifically pursue, and not an eventuality that every playthrough will lead to.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nThe game is now at a playable stage, and the game finally has a strong foundation to fall back on, that doesn't take too heavily from other games.\nIt's enjoyable, and in the playthrough that lead to this updated review, I actually sunk a few hours into it all at once.\n\nRating:\nWhat it is: 6.5/10\nWhat it could be: 9/10\n\nI'm excited to see the end product when it leaves early access, I believe it'd net a 7.5/10 at this rate.\n\n********Updated 18/03/2015********\n\n\n\nFirst off, a lot of my old points are still rather relevant, the game hasn't terribly improved, and still stands as one of the more broken Early Access games I've played.\n\nFirst to the bugs:\nI haven't encountered any of the old bugs, but now I've met some of the new ones, one of them is map scrolling, if you roll your cursor to the edge, it scrolls, simple, lots of games have that, but some times when you roll your cursor to one of the edges, it doesn't scroll the map, and you have to jiggle the cursor at the right side of the screen to free it up.\n\nThen there's the auto continue, whenever a message pops up, something in the game will happen for example: auto save and the game will continue without me, while I read, the messages are quite length in this game too, so that creates a problem.\n\nFinally autosaving also flashes the screen, which is insanely annoying.\n\nThe developer has steered away from it's Game Dev Tycoon inspired system, however it's current system isn't very interesting, and is still rather cryptic, because you don't get enough feedback after a quest as to why you got a bad rating, and some times the messages get repeated meaning what could have been a useful third message gets pushed off the table by a message I've already read.\n\nThe game still isn't very interesting, and often puts me asleep, Still not a fan of the art direction, and the gameplay is lacking.\n\n\nAt this time, I do not recommend this game.\n4/10 for the game as is.\n8/10 for the potential game, that I hope it one day becomes.\n\n\n\n\n******First Version******\n\nFirst off, I have to quickly explain:\nNo, I do not hate this game, I actually really really like it and it's concept.\nThe recommendation is in reference to it's playability in the current build.\n\nWith that out of the way.\n\nRPG Tycoon scratches an itch that I love, Management games, I've had a thing for them since I played Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.\nSo the ability to create my own RPG town, send heroes on quests and promote my town sounds like a heavenly game to me.\n\nBut RPG Tycoon is still in early access, the major reason I do not recommend it is bugs, the game is at this current stage full of bugs and glitches, which is not surprising with an Early Access game, that's just early access for you, the developers are still making the game, bugs and glitches are to be expected, But at this time due to some game breaking bugs I can't recommend it.\nThese bugs include (but are only limited to what I've seen thus far)\n-Duplicating heroes\n-Time pausing days not progressing but quests remaining open and progressing without reaching a climax.\n-Saving and Loading does not take the game back to before the bugs occured (not a bug, but is annoying when trying to avoid bugs)\n\n\nAnd with that part out of the way, here is the rest of my thoughts:\nThe concept is great, I can't wait to see this in a playable state.\nThe graphic style itself I can't say I'm a fan of, I'd like it to be different, but at the same time, it doesn't matter, I'll happily ignore that.\nThe Game Dev Tycoon type of direction with quests is both familiar and inviting, making me wish to try the same quest multiple times, however I feel there needs to be a way to investigate these quests to get hints at what are the right and wrong choices.\nThe music is excellent, it reminds me of minecraft but not in a way that feels bland and unoriginal, the music feels like a winner.\nAdd in random events to the final release? that would be amazing.\nI can't wait to see the potential for large towns with sprawlling citizens and several different buildings like blacksmith, tailor and what not.\nI'd like to also request a micromanagement system with the citizens, giving them jobs I mean, and having them live within your city.\n\nI have so many high hopes for this game, and I can't wait until it's in a more playable state so I can sit down for a good while and play it.\nBuy it? please do! the more purchases the more funding, the more funding the quick and better the progression.","August 24, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","13"

Right now, don't buy it, it's too empty.\n--\n\nNow, I've kinda changed my mind. RPG Tycoon has definitely reached the point where it's actually a full fledged game. You start with a very small patch of land on which you can build a couple of base buildings just to attract some adventurers to send questing. You slowly build up from there, trying to attract tourists from other Kingdoms. It's a game of progressive growth with some kingdom management and an interesting questing system based on guessing what are the correct combinations of supplies to bring while doing a specific activity (original yes, fun I don't know yet).

One of those early access games so early in development, it felt like a gyp. It was like that for quite some time up until roughly the second half of 2015. That's when the developer finally got serious working on his game. I've seen RPG Tycoon grow and mature over time to a point where it is now showing promise and potential to be a decent albiet simple and crude management simulator.\n\nIn my previous review, I  did not recommend due to how unstable it was and a memory leak that slowed the game down so much it became unplayable.\n\nSince then, those two issues are gone. I now recommend RPG Tycoon!\n\nWell, as an alpha anyway.\n\nRPG Tycoon is far from complete. Some features are still obviously being worked on. There are still annoying bugs you can't avoid while playing. Game is in need of balance tweaks. Loading save games still has a high risk of causing something to glitch out. Visitors still tend to get frozen in place and never leave.\n\nBut the game is now in a state that I can call playable. Its pretty okay for what it is too.\n\nBasically if you've been eyeballing this game thinking about buying it, I'd say its safe to buy now. The developer is now supporting their game and updates are churning out more frequently. But, obviously, if you're one of those types who can't stand unfinished/buggy games steer clear for the time being. RPG Tycoon has a long way to go still.","June 28, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd also like to see the bottom left window only function when a target is clicked instead of hovered over.\nThe top right information feed, feels rather rough, the messages don't need to stay for long and could actually be automatically deleted for you, I'm sure though that the developer is looking at this, with his own solution in mind.\nThe rest of the hud however, is well designed, pleasing to the eyes and gives relevant information.\n\nThe research is good, but feels like it lacks a lot of research, and I'd like to see it play a second role.\n\nThe town management is coming along nicely, and while playing, I actually thought that it was possible to create a self sustaining town, that does not rely on the funds from your heroes.\nI would like to see that be a thing, a self sustaining town, but I'd rather see it as a possible avenue for development in the game that you have to specifically pursue, and not an eventuality that every playthrough will lead to.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nThe game is now at a playable stage, and the game finally has a strong foundation to fall back on, that doesn't take too heavily from other games.\nIt's enjoyable, and in the playthrough that lead to this updated review, I actually sunk a few hours into it all at once.\n\nRating:\nWhat it is: 6.5/10\nWhat it could be: 9/10\n\nI'm excited to see the end product when it leaves early access, I believe it'd net a 7.5/10 at this rate.\n\n********Updated 18/03/2015********\n\n\n\nFirst off, a lot of my old points are still rather relevant, the game hasn't terribly improved, and still stands as one of the more broken Early Access games I've played.\n\nFirst to the bugs:\nI haven't encountered any of the old bugs, but now I've met some of the new ones, one of them is map scrolling, if you roll your cursor to the edge, it scrolls, simple, lots of games have that, but some times when you roll your cursor to one of the edges, it doesn't scroll the map, and you have to jiggle the cursor at the right side of the screen to free it up.\n\nThen there's the auto continue, whenever a message pops up, something in the game will happen for example: auto save and the game will continue without me, while I read, the messages are quite length in this game too, so that creates a problem.\n\nFinally autosaving also flashes the screen, which is insanely annoying.\n\nThe developer has steered away from it's Game Dev Tycoon inspired system, however it's current system isn't very interesting, and is still rather cryptic, because you don't get enough feedback after a quest as to why you got a bad rating, and some times the messages get repeated meaning what could have been a useful third message gets pushed off the table by a message I've already read.\n\nThe game still isn't very interesting, and often puts me asleep, Still not a fan of the art direction, and the gameplay is lacking.\n\n\nAt this time, I do not recommend this game.\n4/10 for the game as is.\n8/10 for the potential game, that I hope it one day becomes.\n\n\n\n\n******First Version******\n\nFirst off, I have to quickly explain:\nNo, I do not hate this game, I actually really really like it and it's concept.\nThe recommendation is in reference to it's playability in the current build.\n\nWith that out of the way.\n\nRPG Tycoon scratches an itch that I love, Management games, I've had a thing for them since I played Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.\nSo the ability to create my own RPG town, send heroes on quests and promote my town sounds like a heavenly game to me.\n\nBut RPG Tycoon is still in early access, the major reason I do not recommend it is bugs, the game is at this current stage full of bugs and glitches, which is not surprising with an Early Access game, that's just early access for you, the developers are still making the game, bugs and glitches are to be expected, But at this time due to some game breaking bugs I can't recommend it.\nThese bugs include (but are only limited to what I've seen thus far)\n-Duplicating heroes\n-Time pausing days not progressing but quests remaining open and progressing without reaching a climax.\n-Saving and Loading does not take the game back to before the bugs occured (not a bug, but is annoying when trying to avoid bugs)\n\n\nAnd with that part out of the way, here is the rest of my thoughts:\nThe concept is great, I can't wait to see this in a playable state.\nThe graphic style itself I can't say I'm a fan of, I'd like it to be different, but at the same time, it doesn't matter, I'll happily ignore that.\nThe Game Dev Tycoon type of direction with quests is both familiar and inviting, making me wish to try the same quest multiple times, however I feel there needs to be a way to investigate these quests to get hints at what are the right and wrong choices.\nThe music is excellent, it reminds me of minecraft but not in a way that feels bland and unoriginal, the music feels like a winner.\nAdd in random events to the final release? that would be amazing.\nI can't wait to see the potential for large towns with sprawlling citizens and several different buildings like blacksmith, tailor and what not.\nI'd like to also request a micromanagement system with the citizens, giving them jobs I mean, and having them live within your city.\n\nI have so many high hopes for this game, and I can't wait until it's in a more playable state so I can sit down for a good while and play it.\nBuy it? please do! the more purchases the more funding, the more funding the quick and better the progression.","August 24, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","13"

Solid gameplay and alot going on at once keeps your attention and you don't get bored\n\n3. Easy controls allthough a dropdown legend of shortcuts for each tab would be desirable.\n\nI could go on and on to be honest, i have a review on youtube which i will leave on my community page for you guys to see if you wanna see how the game actually runs. But overall i really like this game it has alot of really solid area's. It looks good doesn't cause any problems with framerates. Has alot to do and it quite difficult especially when you get further down the line and get more heroes.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nI would like there to be more of a D&D approach to the mid quest events. It would be nice to read the event as if it were said by a dungeonmaster. Other than that no complaints well worth the price.","February 23","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It turned out to be a little diferent from what i first invisioned, simppler i guess, but definitly unquestionably absolutely more entertaining. Not frustrating at all, always adding chalange and constantly giving the player something to look forward to.\nGood job lads!\n\nSo,"UPDATED REVIEW":\nIt's a "SimHeros" type of game in the prespective of a city manager. imagine, Farmville with a much faster pace and you manage the heroic part of a kingdom instead of farming tomatoes and eggplants.\nYou are the leader of a brand new kingdom, your objective is becoming the most glorious and recognised kingdom of the land (you compete with other AI kingdoms).\nIn order to progress you need to complete quests (loads and loads...), take care of you towns and manage you "microkingdom".\nThe questing is basically assigning a hero or group of heroes to a specific quest, considering the particular equipment and stats combination to get the best result possible. Quests and your heroes quest performance are central to the game. It's how you gain fame a level up your kingdom, allowing more buildings, more heroes, more buildings....\nIn your kingdom, well, Townville... Build building, make money, buld more buildings, add abilities and great stuff, build more buildings....\nEverything is very fast paced, and it gets faster with each kingdom leveling up... You easily lose track of time playing this puppie.... Very simple... very addictive.\nNot a masterpiece, but it's worth your money, specially if you are someone that played #something#ville, #something#clickers, and likes to manage eficiently... cof cof... i'm very very tidy and efficient... You should listen to me. :P\n\nTHE LAME EXCUSE OF AN REVIEW I MADE BEFORE SEEING THE LIGHT\n(aka "before edit"):\n"From the trailer and description i pictured a really interesting game. Mixing up RPG and Fantasy elements with strategy all glued up with a nice touch of "Simcity". The ideia blew up my mind, i started imagining Strategic Skyrim runned from the skies... With Minecraft looks...\nBut the truth is that, as the player, we can do very little. Recruit heroes, send them in quests, and find the right combination of skills per quest per location... Over and over again, until you have money to buy some new building and unlock some new quest type or income source... It has some other minor features, but it all comes to the same "quest routine".\nYou no visibility at all of the quest themselves, no management options (of any kind)of the kingdom or the buildings or anything exept the heroes.\nIt feels like... Theme Hospital with no hospital to run...\n\nMaybe it's just me, maybe i created unreasonable expectations but... I must confess i'm really disapointed at this game. It fell very far from what it promissed (what i imagined at least) to deliver.\n\nI do realise it's a pre-release, that it's supposed to be buggy and limited on several features... And it is... But even if this game comes to a stage where it can be considered "finished" i really cant picture it as somethink that can cativate me for more than 30 minutes. As i see it, it is just to limited, to basic in principle. With no potential to evolve into something much greater than what it is right now.\n\nSo, as an "as is" conclusion comment, i's a game built over a very promissing and attractive ideia that produces a limited, repetitive and somewhat furstrating experience to the player.\nAnd i really hope i'm proven wrong, but i dont see this going nowhere. :/"","August 10, 2014","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

The game doesn't function well as a town builder (I'll go back to SimCity SNES for satisfying town building).\n\nI bought the game thinking I would be able to create some really awesome fantasy town where I put in most of my effort trying to perfect the shops and inns where famous warriors prepare. It's half correct in that I got sort of a town builder and sort of a hero micro-manager.\n\nMy last note is that you are playing a game where you play as the heroes... kind of, but you don't see anything that they're doing regardless of dictating everything they do and how they grow. They all wanted raises because they were unhappy because I couldn't afford to upgrade the town or put in decorations because I couldn't afford to put my money towards positive investments such as quests. My two heroes were constantly healing so they could go on quests that earned nothing anyways. Boring townbuilder because it tries to hard to be a RPG hero Manager instead of an RPG Tycoon.","March 15","false","0.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll go back in to play and I will be pushed back by a lot of progress and I'll forget how I got to where I'd been so I just start over which is really annoying after the 5th time.
