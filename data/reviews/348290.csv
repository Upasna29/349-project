It's basically a mobile game adapted to PC - definitely not worth the $3, which sounds a bit harsh, but... there's just no gameplay. Sure, there's a tiny bit of management re: building rooms and elevating mood, but with all the clicking patients to make them happy, etc. it screams mobile. The music is repetitive, the levels are fairly boring. You can't draw your own room boundaries, it's nowhere near complex and yeah. Just not for me.\n\nIf you like not being challenged, buy it. If you're looking for something like Theme Hospital, turn around and keep walkin'.","March 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 290 of 308 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","290","308","11","0"

If I could give it a neutral rating, I would. But because I expect more out of my Steam games (than mere mobile ports and because seemingly, there is little to no developer attention given to this game any more, I have to give it a negative review).  Don't let that dissuade from the game if you just want a quick little casual game to pass the time with however.\n\nThe game intends to be a silly, casual, pc port of the not so well received mobile version (the mobile version is riddled with negative ratings due to stability, bug, and lack of developer attention on issues). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cccp.manager.java&hl=en\n\nOn with the nitty gritty....\n\nPROSDecent graphics\nQuirky dialog and diseases\nFun to focus the attention where you like via your research room (Lab)\nWhile you don't have room dimension control, you do have complete control over the hallways/lobby areas\nNo bugs or stability issues that ruined the mobile version, however there is at least 1 instance of incomplete text (text_placeholder) in a description of an item.\nNo Microtransactions (like there are in the mobile game)\n\nCONSIt's a direct mobile port. While microtransactions were taken out, not much else was done to make it more of a pc game (but then, most mobile ports don't make that sort of effort anyway).  One of the issues that turned me off was that you have to click "bubbles" to receive money (from machines) and fix the moods of some patients.  It's obviously intended for finger tapping, but you use your mouse/pointer instead.\nIt's not optimzed for PC. In the later levels when you have A LOT of patients swarming your hospital, it can decrease your FPS quite a bit. I can play high end graphic games all day without issue yet with this little "app" my fps decreases to the point that trying to accurately hit those bubbles can be quite frustrating.\nThere is a pause feature, regular speed, and fast speed. Because so much can quickly happen on the map at once, it would be nice to have a "slow speed." Without it, it can be pretty hectic and I hate having to pause just to catch up.\nYou can decide what type of room goes into which room slot, but your room slots on each map are already decided for you. This means no customization in as far as room size or actual placement, you are limited to the map's layout itself.\nIt's important to understand that this is not a business sim. It isn't intended to be one. It would be like saying that the mobile app Airport Controller (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.logisoft.aircontrol&hl=en) is intended to be an air traffic controler simulator. No...Hospital Manager is an arcade game with the backdrop of a hospital.  It's all "finger placement" and "finger tap" but with a mouse for the PC version.\n\nThis might be more fun on a tablet, but then you'd probably be buying the seemingly abandoned mobile version of the game.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you want a casual, arcade game with a hospital as the backdrop, and don't mind the low fps at times when things get hectic, go for it. If you are expecting something more sophisticated like an actual simulator or even something with more options/features/customization such as Theme Hospital, then you probably will be disappointed and should stay away.","March 25, 2015","false","1.7"," 113 of 136 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","113","136","2","0"

You complete missions and can earn up to 3 stars on each. (Not very challenging at all). There isn't that many missions to do. I was hoping you'd be able to create your own hospital and see how long you can go with random challenges happening here and there (survivor mode if you would). There unfortunately isn't thus making this game dissapointing. Probably good for kids though. Cheap cost, and you get what you pay for.\n\nPS- There's a much older game extremely identical to this one (most likely the predecessor to this) that you are able to do "survivor mode". Theme Hospital<<< get that game instead if you can find it.","March 26, 2015","false","8.9"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","46","60","2","1"

For a sim it is very fast and you never really feel close to your hospital. When it feels like you got it finally running, the mission ends and you start a new one - disappointing.... And each hospital is very small, the places to build rooms predefined, so you can never be creative - you just build each room once, like you should and the biggest impact one the game you have by research and training your team. Also the qualification of the staff when you get them is very different, so you also need a lot of luck - something you dont want in a simulation game.\n\nSo it never fits in the shoes of Theme Hospital - but at least the diseases are funny like in the original - but that not enough. My suggestion: Wait for a steam sale and buy it for 5 Euro/Dollar - but dont pay more.","April 6, 2015","false","3.1"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","37","45","0","0"

From diagnosis, treatment and restroom facilities.\n\nThe reason the game is satirical is you are not treating any sort of typical 'real life' ailments. You sort out Zombies, possessions and some sort of affliction in which people moonwalk whilst wearing an unconvincing Michael Jackson get up. Among many other sorts of silly ailments.\n\nThe treatments of these ailments is equally silly. If someone walks in holding their amputated leg, send them to “surgery” which is actually just a huge sewing machine. Are you a zombie? Well hypnosis is the answer (that one actually kind of makes sense if you use the colloquialism definition of Zombie in where someone is predisposed with something relatively unimportant. However the sprite is most certainly a traditional zombie.)\n\nAll of that on its face its actually an interesting premise. I don't NEED a serious hospital simulator. I just want a good one. You'll need to manage patient moods, doctors training and maintenance workers as well as clowns. However the clown is more of a middle man between doctor and patient rather than a new age Patch Adams.\n\nHere are the main reasons why this game is not good\n\n- You cannot build the hospital. They are all pre built and because some issues arise in which multiple types of diseases show up you need multiple types of treatment rooms however there are not enough rooms to satisfy the demand. So you must now manage changing over rooms do deal with new things. Instead of making an actual functioning hospital.\n\n- There is no sandbox. The only mode is mission challenges.\n\n- It gets needlessly hectic. Constant pop ups telling you things you are already working on or things you can do nothing about until you have more money.\n\n- Staff management, research, and doctor training happens too often. You have to research diseases in order to increase the percentage your doctors will be able to diagnosis the disease properly. I had to research the zombie disease upwards of seven times in one mission just to get it at a reasonable diagnosis level to the other diseases in the hospital at the time.\n\n- The art repeats, there are only two doctor skins. This is a minor complaint. But as the game gets so hectic so quickly it makes it much more difficult to remember who is who and what everyones level is, so that in some vain hope of trying to keep the order I attempted keep all my doctors on the same skill level. So that I don't know.. I could make a successful hospital.\n\nTHE GIST\nIt isn't a bad game but its far from good.  The satire nature of it I'm okay with. However in the actual gameplay of the game, the 'character' it tries to maintain with sewing machine surgery tables, hypnotizing zombies and attempting séances for the downtrodden and possessed it all falls flat.\n","February 24","false","1.5"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

Hospital Manager is easy to get into as the first four missions are tutorial and explains all the basics you need to get going. It is a light bit of fun and some of the medical conditions are interesting. The first actual mission that you will get a 1-3 star rating out of is Mission 5 'Cursed Hospital'. All missions can be passed on first attempt if you are careful though you may not get a good star rating until your refine some techniques. The only mission that gave me significant issue attaining a 3 star rating was mission 11 'Fairy Tale'. This mission disallows you to have a negative bank balance which makes investment in treatment rooms more strategic especially with reguard to end of month payments maintaining a positive balance. I had to play it several times to make the end goal of 30,000 credit prior to April 1st. Other missions of note (ones that I will drop you a hint of two about how to pass). Mission 12 has zombies which vomit everywhere but it doesnt matter if the hospital is unclean. Mission 15 'Quarenteen' has an odd wing off to the left, that is the one you want to contain the parasites as you treat and research the condition. Mission 16 'Sacred Elephant' I recommend you pause at the very beginning and rearrange the existing hospital assets to configurations more suited to expediant care delivery. Mission 17 'Rural Threat' in the last month the Exo condition pops up which takes time and money to treat and a 3500 investment in a treatment room. Mission 18 'Energy 9000' (AKA Brawndo) very easy just deal with speed delivery. Mission 19 'Seasonal Virus' The parasites are back so section off part of the hospital to prevent the infected from mingling.

If ever there was a flat middle of the road game, this is it. It's cheap to buy, and fans of Theme Hospital, like myself, might get a small amount of nostalgia. But, it's definately not on the same quality level as Theme Hospital. So far, all the missions are VERY short, you have no layout input, research system is very basic, training system is even more basic. Really the difficult part of the game (which is mostly easy) is getting through the rushes. Yeah, I know that's no difference than Theme Hospital, but So far, I've only had at most 3 diseases to deal with at any one time. I picked yes only because the price is so cheap ($3 currently, $6 when not on sale).","March 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","8","22","2","0"

You simply start each level with empty square rooms all the same size already placed, and you choose what room goes into what empty room.\n\nThis one also consists of much shorter "levels" that get progressively more involved it seems, where as Theme Hospital just let you keep building on the same hospital and expanding it out over time (from what i remember of it)\n\nThe object of this game is to make money, keep the reputation of the hospital up by satisfying patients quickly, keeping it clean, and providing them services like benches, soda machines, restrooms, etc.\n\nYou'll hire doctors and spend money learning and advancing your hospitals skills through research.  You can also hire janitors and clowns to keep waiting patients entertained.  There are some rather silly and ridiculous costs however, such as a clown costing you more then double that of a hiring a good general practice physician.\n\nAll-in-all, after my first 20 minutes, it seems like it's a game that's worth it's price tag, especially at it's current 50% sale.  However it's not likely a game most people will play for more then an hour or two.","March 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 54 of 200 people (27%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","27","54","200","10","4"

Clear and colourful.\n- Pretty unique symptoms that I found funny sometimes.\n- Some animations for various rooms are pretty cool. (Such as a sewing machine for surgery)\n- Every character has a bust, including patient types. I like the art style.\n\nCONS:\n- Main 2 characters are pretty... stupid. The female looks like a Hippy with a syringe, and the male looks like he belongs in a nerd show or his mothers basement. In short; neither look qualified to guide you in running a hospital. Also, humour gets stale pretty fast.\n- Pre-built sections. If you want to build a room, you can only choose from selections given. This makes later levels extremely tedious since you have to start sacrificing rooms for other rooms. Want to help that annoying group of patients? better remove my research facility because why not.\n- Having to keep rebuying the same furniture every level. In order to unlock better benches, vending machines and stuff, you spend your in-game money to unlock them. This resets every level, so it becomes pointless later. And tedious.\n- Can't assign extra staff. If you surgeon takes a break, your surgery is left unattended. This if awful when your staff like to take breaks just as an event of a bajillion patients want to come in.\n- AI is pretty dumb. My Janitors seemed to want to avoid the rubbish and puke throughout my hospital instead of picking it up.\n\n\nIn short: The game itself is enjoyable to start out, but it becomes tedious (not hard, tedious) later on once you realise certain mechanics don't work or all freedom of build is removed.","December 3, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is divided in a number of levels where you build rooms and hire staff to treat the patients that come to you with their ailments. You cure the patients by first diagnosing and subsequently treating them. Both actions reward you with money to improve the hospital and reputation.\nYou can improve the hospital by upgrading the staff, (re)decorating the hallways to keep the waiting patients happy or by spending money on research.\nA certain amount of reputation is needed to complete the level. You gain reputation by diagnosing and curing patients and lose reputation when patients walk out on you.\n\nWhy I do not recommend this game\nLet me start of by writing about what I like first. I do like the way the game does not take itself seriously, opting for a comical take on the hospital simulator. This ranges from the over the top injuries the patients have to the proposed treatments and the vibrant colours used, as wel as the notion that no matter how bad the injury may be, enough benches, flower pots and clowns on site will keep the patients happy. I personally like this kind of humour.\n\nThis, however, leaves a lot to dislike for me. For starters, The layout of the hospital is predetermined and you cannot choose the size and content of the rooms you build and can only build in predetermined spots, severely limiting player creativity. After the room has been built you need to pick a staff member. They have three attributes (speed of treatment, profit per patient and number of patients helped before the doctor needs a break), but some staff are twice or even three times as good as others, whilst costing less in wages.\nDuring gameplay you get frequent (and I mean frequent) popups with tips or pointers, but they take up a rather large portion of the screen and hinder gameplay when you are zoomed in. There is no way of disabling the popups.\nAlso worth mentioning is that this is a mobile port and it clearly shows. Aside from the removal of the microtransactions the game is identical to the mobile version. This means that all the busywork in the form of tapping is still in place, therefore each level forces the player to constantly click on vending machines, staff and patients.\n\nI would also like to draw your attention to the inaccuracies written down in the "Key Features" on the Store Page. For instance, this game has no 'comprehensive management' in any way, shape or form. Just build rooms, hire staff, decorate the halls and keep the research going, whilst doing your busywork and closing the popups. And their claim that this is a 'nonlinear adventure' just boils down to cause and effect: If you choose to, let's say, hire a clown in January he starts working in January. If you however hire the clown a month later he starts working in February. Seriously? This is worth mentioning as a Key Feature?\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, this game is not good. It is a mobile port with shallow gameplay, almost no management whatsoever and severely limiting player creativity, with a nonsensical Store Page to boot. Not recommended.","January 4","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So if you're looking to buy it for the same reason I was then I suggest you instal the HD textures for Theme hospital instead and keep playing it because its much better then this game.","January 9","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is too easy and the only game-mode available is target oriented. There is no option to just run your hospital, expand it and see where you can get, as there is in Theme Hospital.","January 16","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do enjoy it for what it is and found it entertaining. The pop-ups from the characters every couple of seconde was extremely irritating. I wouldn't compare it to other hospital games because it is its own game. So if you want to play something short and easy while your bored that you don't have to invest a lot of time in, download it. I played it when I wanted to take a break from doing hw or studying because the levels were nice and short. I would wiat until it's on sale though.","May 7","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
