It's a story about identity and friendship and queerness and love, and feeling alone and left out. It's about wanting to be good, but not being able to because the world is cruel.\n\nAevee Bee's writing and Mia Schwartz's drawings and Alec Lambert's music channel a mix of anxiety and innocence that those who were bad kids or who still are will recognize. The story echoes teenage feelings of isolation and longing, and fraught love and friendship, and not knowing who you are and being sort of scared to find out. It's only about an hour long, but in that short time, the characters Venus, Jupiter, and Neptune are all beautifully realized, and I played through it several times (during its initial release on DateNighto) to make different choices and learn more about each of them.\n\nThe world is cruel, and tells us that we're bad, but we can fight against the actual, literal Devil and maybe we can stop believing them.","February 16","true","3.5"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/optimisticDuelist/recommended/435300/","optimisticDuelist","Rose Of Nobility","http://steamcommunity.com/id/optimisticDuelist/","187 products in account","Listen: We know the devil is an exercise in transcendence. Every line of dialogue sings. Every description shines. Every moment of comfort or explosion of anguish is captivating in it's visceral feeling--the characters are named after planets for good reason. Each is a world unto themselves, and the depth of feeling that their interactions convey move like storms and hurricanes and gamma flares--all the force of the universe condensed to three hearts.\n\nI know I sound ridiculous here--hyperbolic to the point of insanity. But there's nothing else I can say. To say that the writing sounds like if you knitted a quilt of Stephen King descriptions with magical girl tropes does a disservice to We Know the Devil--if only because King couldn't write an LGBT character well if his life depended on it.\n\nThis game plucked me from the lofty self-security and happiness of adulthood and tore me all the way down to when I was a scared little boy, staying up at night watching for night terrors that I feared less than I feared the knowing light of God.\n\nIt reminded me what it's like to be small, to be brittle, to feel like you've got poison in your veins that you can't escape. To be sick to death of your life and your family and your religion and teachers and "friends", and most of all of yourself. It set me on fire with creative energy like I've never really felt before. It made me realize that all my joy and my love for people is useless, worthless, if I don't do something with it.\n\nIt was a wake-up call to the fact that I need to do more to try and help the lonely kids that are still out there--the ones so much like who I used to be.\n\nIf you've ever even wondered if you were queer, play this.\nIf you've ever felt so much as a minor tick of annoyance at the System telling you What You Should Do, play this.\nIf you've ever felt regret after hurting someone you realized you could have loved, play this.\n\nAnd if none of that applies to you, play it anyway, and do so with an open heart. I guarantee this will teach you more about what it's like to be queer--or hell, even just an unhappy teenager--than a million essays or documentaries or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hollywood movies could teach you.\n\nIf I have anything like criticism for this game, there's only two nitpicks:\n\n1) The visual glitches when you fast foward can be weird and distracting. They always fixed themselves before I reached a new scene, but I could really see them hurting someone's experience if they got unlucky. I hope they fix them later.\n\n2)  Occasional typos and what seem like misused grammar at a few points are stutters in what is otherwise one of the best written works I've ever experienced. Frankly, I wish I could offer my volunteer services to just suggest edits for all of those things myself, I'd be only too happy. Most other fiction, I could just brush right by it--but with writing this good, all the small details that don't add up hit me like a screeching chalkboard.\n\nRegardless, don't let either of those dissuade you. It's so, so worth it. Please know the devil, she's so ♥♥♥♥ing great.","February 19","true","4.8"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

I don't think I'm really the target audience for this game. I bought this under the pretense that it was a horror game. The description itself, on the store page, makes it out to be. I knew, going into this, that it had a lot to do with sexual/gender identity. And that's cool! But, I was still expecting a horror game.\n\nThis was not a horror game.\n\nThe writing was extremely vague, and even obtuse at times. I mean hell, we'll even ignore the grammatical issues for now. But honestly I had a very hard time following what was going on and what the actual story was about. I had to look up a synopsis afterward.\n\nAnd then I realized this game isn't for me. It never WAS for me. How could it be? Without spoiling anything, let's just say it's simply not a subject or topic that I could have any possible understanding of. I've read a lot of reviews and have seen a lot of people saying how personal this game was to them, and they seemed to get the message loud and clear. But I didn't get that message, and I can't.\n\nI played through one of the endings and thought about refunding it. But I saw someone say, "no, play through all the ends and get the true end, and then you'll understand". And so I did. I have to say, it didn't change my opinion on the matter. It felt pretty unsatisfying.\n\nI don't want to this to be seen as a slight or anything against the game developers. Because, honestly, my major issue with the game is the way it was advertised, not the actual content therein. Again, the store page description REALLY makes it out like this game is something it's not, and it's somewhat misleading. I'm going to reiterate. This was not a horror game. If I had known that, I probably wouldn't have bought this in the first place.\n","February 21","false","2.0"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","36","53","2","3"

So, so, excited. I didn’t know much, but I was in love with the aesthetic, and the premise of this seemingly mundane but also paranormal world where you can contact God and the Devil from a summer camp seemed amazingly interesting. However, the entire experience was pretty disappointing for me. In short, the writing is vague, the setting is extremely interesting at first but terribly fleshed out, and everything simply seems. Stunted. Like it was written for a game jam in a day or a week and not expanded at all for the final release. In general it has a fantastic idea and premise, but the length makes it difficult to really feel attached to the characters or really understand why the things that happen to them, happen to them.\n\nThat’s the short version. Now I’m going to do a breakdown of what I saw as the good and the bad of We Know the Devil. From here on out there may be spoilers, you’ve been warned.\n\nThe one undeniably good point that must be mentioned about We Know the Devil is the atmosphere. The music is absolutely perfect, nice synth that sets the tone without seeming like it’s trying too hard to be spooky scary. The sketchy and monochrome style for the character art was a wonderful fit, and I found the sprites pretty expressive when they needed to be. I didn’t expect to like the photo backgrounds, but I actually do feel like they added a lot of character.\n\nThe setting and background is where we begin to hit the snags. In the beginning of the game we’re placed in a summer camp with these three teenagers, with no real clue as to why they’re here or what they’re doing. They run into background characters that they know but we as the audience do not, and they easily use complex-sounding terminology that leaves the player clueless. This is one of the things that helps to set up the aforementioned fantastic atmosphere for me; it left me wanting to know more about this camp and it’s goings-on. However that never came. I didn’t even get an explanation of what these children were doing at camp, or even how or why it was decided that they should go to this creepy abandoned cabin to meet the devil other than “plot reasons.”\n\nThis is my main problem with We Know the Devil. Things happen because they happen. Jupiter and Neptune have a mutual crush on each other which is barely foreshadowed previous to the Seven Minutes in Heaven scene and from which… nothing seems to come. Venus, whose main problem appeared to be her tendency to be an extreme doormat, very suddenly exhibits body image issues and is revealed to be trans. Neptune has a lingering cough of various degrees of severity throughout the game, and which Venus seems to know the cause of, which is never expanded upon. Ever. While I was interested and wanted to know more at the beginning, by the end I began to fear that there was nothing more. That it was all nothing but pretty packaging with nothing inside.\n\nThis sudden and inexplicable chain of events is combined with a very vague, at times totally incomprehensible writing style that made many of the more pivotal moments very difficult to understand. Much of that is because the game has a very particular tone which is reflected in the writing, which I appreciate. I enjoyed the way each character has a very separate but at the same time very believable diction and speaking style which seemed very teenager-y. However, I believe that style was substituted for clarity in some situations where it should not have been. At the end of the true ending Venus… finds an arm? Rips off her arm? I consulted a friend and she thought that Neptune was in fact the one that ripped off Venus’ arm. The writing was simply not very well edited, if it was at all. I found far too many typos than should be in the re-release of a game that was released in September of last year. Even in the more mundane sections there were many clunky phrases that I believe could have been improved and clarified without taking anything away from the final project.\n\nIn many ways I think that We Know the Devil just seems rushed. The premise and atmosphere are both great, the endings would be fantastic if they had clearer writing and more foreshadowing, and all of the visuals are charming and spectacular. In particular I found the true ending to be a fantastic idea - that in the “best” ending, where the characters are happiest and able to be the most true to themselves, they in fact have to embrace the devil, and that may not be a bad thing. However it fell flat because of how absolutely incomprehensible much of the writing was. Seriously, it was vague as all get-out, and it just wasn’t fun to read.\n\nHowever, all in all, I’m very excited to see more from this team. As stated many times before, the atmosphere was fantastic, and though I’m not a fan of the execution I find the basic idea to be positively intriguing. Despite all of my negativity I do not find We Know the Devil to be a bad game, per say, just... not particularly good. I can’t wait to see the next piece to come, with the team having learned what to continue doing and what to perhaps change for their next title.\n\nAs a side note, while this may simply be because of the recent move to Steam, from a gameplay standpoint this is far, far buggier than I find acceptable out of any visual novel. I’ve seen regular reports of fast-forwarding making character sprites glitch, and for myself on multiple occasions the entire game would simply short out, with the screen going white and myself unable to continue. The latter glitch happened at two points, once whenever I tried to access the Jupiter + Neptune Seven Minutes in Heaven section (this was a minor inconvenience, though it was one of the few scenes I was genuinely invested in), and once directly following the ending credits. The latter glitch made it so that the game did not recognize me as having ever actually finished a single route, which made it impossible for me access the true ending. I haven’t seen any other reports of these issues, but if they are common, I hope they are fixed relatively soon.","February 17","false","2.2"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","30","48","0","3"

What lies within and rears its head as you explore the multiple alternatives the game presents you, is what it really means to tell you. Its about the self, and the form the world forces it to adapt to.

This makes a big difference in how the game comes across, and it's a good one. As an LGBT person myself, this game was relatable to me on a level I can't explain.

As a member of the LGBT+ community, I was looking forward to this, but it doesn't want you to know what's going on. Usually, that's not a problem for me (I love Baroque and I love Kafka and some seriously obtuse indie bands), but this was more reminiscent of when I was seventeen and tried really hard to be deep about things and cared more about myself than an audience, which was fine, because I wasn't publishing anything.\n\nBut this is published and with the way it's written, it's really inaccessible. I went through, trying to think of my high school students playing this (I was an English teacher for a while) and I just imagine them giving me the Look and leaving me with a silent class for 30 minutes because they wouldn't know what to say. The only reason I knew there were LGBT+ themes in it was the marketing done prior and word of mouth from friends. If I hadn't known that already, I wouldn't have known that was the approach to the story while I played it.\n\nI'm glad there are people that love it. Maybe I'm too trained to be critical when approaching written pieces because of my schooling and perhaps this needs to be approached at its face instead of being picked through, but I think the author really needs to think about how much they're writing for themselves and how much they are wanting to write for other people. Who is their audience? What are they meant to get from this? Would a person be able to get what the author intends for them to get from this without discussion boards, prior marketing, etc.? Does the material by itself deliver what it needs to deliver?\n\nThere is a lot of potential here. There are a lot of good elements here. I think, ultimately, all that it needs is the author stepping back away from the story and looking at it from the eye of a reader. A good revision and I think there would be a lot of great things that could come out of this.","March 18","false","1.7"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","0"

However, I want to avoid spoilers so this review may be a little vague.\nThere are a lot of subtle things going on with the writing, from the world building to what the characters are going through, that there ends up being a lot you can miss during your first playthrough - so playing through it three times to get the various endings becomes more of a boon than anything. Being able to catch how things tie together, and seeing the three protagonists' stories in different ways, is a really cool aspect of the game. I'm really happy to see that they made replaying the game so worth it. (They also included a "skip" button, for the parts you've already seen - something that helped a GREAT DEAL since now I didn't have to rewatch the same non-changing scenes 3+ times to see the other paths in the game.)\nThe game deals with some interesting issues, set in a reality similar to our own - except for certain things, one of which being that god and the devil are real, and can talk to people through the radio. There's a lot of hints about the world building, though it is just vague enough it lets the player put the pieces together themselves.\nThe endings are spooky in a really good way. The true ending is something, I think, that could foster a lot of interesting discussions and interpretations. Even after the game's ended, there is a lot to think about in it and a lot to talk about.\nAll the characters are very strong, and while I liked them all I can see others possibly disliking some or all of them. They each have their own distinct personality, though, and contrast nicely against one another.\nThere is so much good in this game, and I really enjoyed playing it. Definitely worth checking out.","February 17","true","2.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's a story that makes you think and analyze a little what you're reading; so I think if you like this narrative or not is up to you. Personally I felt frustrated at first because I didn't understand ♥♥♥♥, but then I put two and two together and really enjoyed the game.\n\nI really loved the characters, they're awesomely well written!

Some basic notes:\n\n-- This is a visual novel, and pretty much entirely story based. Don't expect exploration/gameplay.\n-- There are four endings, and to get the most out of the story you will definitely want to get all of them. My first playthrough took about 45 minutes, and getting all the endings took about two hours in total (you can fastforward through repeated sections on subsequent playthroughs). I'd recommend saving the "balanced" ending for last (this will make sense once you play the game).\n-- The writing can get pretty symbolic/abstract at times. It's very accessible and surprisingly funny for the most part, but it also deliberately gets very weird at certain points. I'd argue that it's still pretty easy to understand the writer's intention, especially once you've gotten a couple of different endings, but if you just don't like weird prose then this may not be the game for you.\n\nSo, with that out of the way: this is a game about three kids who spend one night at summer camp in an isolated cabin, waiting for the devil to show up. It's about how they feel about themselves, and how they relate to one another. I don't want to talk too much about the thematic stuff for fear of spoilers, but if you can remember being a kid and being afraid that there is something irreparably wrong with you, something that you can't even talk about for fear that your friends will turn on you once they know, you will get a lot out of We Know the Devil. I found it to be genuinely beautiful, and personal in a way that very few games attempt. If that sounds intriguing to you, I can't recommend it enough.","February 18","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My mother would occasionally decide that yes, this week we’ll be going to church. Every Sunday. For real. She’d pick a church that looked interesting (as long as it wasn’t Catholic) and we’d attend for a few weeks until she worked on a Sunday or was too tired, and the ideal would fall apart. I had the building blocks. I had the cultural osmosis. But I did not have the real experience.\n\nI have a degree in religious studies (sort of) which has led me into a very atypical relationship with it. I love religion, the same way that someone loves science fiction movies. Every day I am a happily non-denominational agnostic, educating people on comparative religious views and why we should say “happy holidays” instead of “merry christmas”. A former roommate has politely asked me on at least one occasion to stop talking about religion. It wasn’t until much later that I understood why. From top to bottom, We Know The Devil made me think of her.\n\nI played We Know The Devil on the Date Nighto browser app. It is by Aevee Bee, Mia Schwartz, and Alec Lambert. It’s a small visual novel game with four routes, and to talk about it too much might ruin many things so I’ll try to keep it brief. In We Know The Devil, the Devil is real and summer campers are magical girls-in-training using magic radios.\n\nSounds cute? It isn’t, really.\n\nTo me, this game is about what you believe, especially when you’re young. If your parents have trained you – indoctrinated you – to believe the devil is real, how could you deny it? If Evil is real and you want to be good, how do you reconcile your feelings of envy or of anger? The cast is made of kids still deep under the scrutiny of their parents, not quite with the age and the freedom to decide these things for themselves.\n\nThe game is structured with the idea that knowing that in a group of three, two of you will be closer than the other. Each of the primary routes ends with one of the characters being isolated and left out, alone to think and let the dark one in. Each one is terrible and knows precisely how. As teenagers they are obsessed with themselves and covering up the right things to censor the ways they are seen. But the Devil sees it all, don’t they? God sees it all.\n\nWe Know The Devil helped me to understand where my roommate was coming from. She grew up under a devout Catholic mother in a home where Evil and the Devil were very real. Where my sympathy toward religion was based on theory and storytelling, her horror came from the same roots as Venus, Jupiter and Neptune’s fears. I can only imagine what their experiences were actually like.\n\nPlease play We Know The Devil. I am very happy with this game and it makes me excited about the direction of works made by Date Nighto. Although please, please get a proofreader. I’ll do it if I have to.","May 18","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's getting all endings while still having left the window open while doing other things) and once you've finished one ending, you've honestly seen 70% of the game's content, leaving you to skip through the entire game being the exact as before same until you have to make a new choice or actually get to the new ending, which only last about a paragraph's worth or so for both of those. Sure, length might not be everything, but when you're just flying through the game it doesn't make it feel like you've been stuck in this cabin for 12 hours like it should, especially in something that seems to want to pull you into its atmosphere as much as We Know the Devil does.

I've beaten the game.  If that's not enough to make you reconsider purchasing this game, read onward.\nFirst off, lets get into the most circle-jerked over aspect, the characters. Talk about uninteresting teenage dribble. Okay Date Nighto: lemme drop a bomb on ya. Making your uninteresting protaganists gay DOESN'T make them suddenly likeable or interesting, especially when every line of dialouge is written either like a 13 year old's attempt at poetry or a 15 year old's text message. Don't listen to all the positive reviewers praising the writing just for being "progressive" (even though the sexuality is barely explored, it's merely there), the writing is sub par and just flat out boring for the most part. That's not to say there weren't parts I didn't like, for example, I enjoyed the ending of the "lukewarm, I spit you out" path where they have to "drain the impurities" (Wow, how deep, I bet some edgy middle schooler wrote a paper about this scene) out of their friend Neptune I think her name was (Hey, gimme a break, none of them were memorable in the slightest). Some of the dialouge that she spouted while she was corrupted by the devil was passable to say the most, now if it only lasted longer than 4 or 5 minutes before the game ended. During this scene, the actually good dialouge is being bogged down with the author desperately trying to seem "deep" and the atrocious punctuation and text message esque dialouge. If you're looking for good character development, a good plot, or even an interesting character, you've come to the wrong place (Unless you're interested in the one quasi-interesting character, the captain, but even then he gets a criminally small amount of screentime).\nNow onto the things I didn't really mind.\nThe art was pretty and the music was a bit samey and unvaried, but for the most part okay.\nThat's it.\nDon't buy this game.","February 21","false","1.1"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","3","18","0","0"

It needs a copy editor. If your game is text-based, for the love of God get the text right. Typos are not allowed, especially if a game's story is already obscure. Which leads to point two...\n2. This game is very obscure. The story actively does not like you. It will not tell you things you want to know. It will not tell you what has happened, who these people are, what is going on, where we are, when we are, why this is, what's the point, sometimes it won't even tell you what you are seeing right now. The story is minimalist, sometimes to a fault.\n\nSo there's two bad things about this game. My recommendation falls on every single thing else.\n\nFirst off, this is some really good writing. Don't get me wrong; it's sort of thing written in heady days of late youth when emotions are right on the surface of your skin and always get mixed up with your sensations. But, man, is it some stellar writing. Some of the prose here is downright beatific. When it hits its peaks, it's numinous. Thanks to the short runtime of the game (which I count as a benefit, not a mark against it), you will be eating the writing up like a meal you've not had in two decades. Enjoy it.\n\nSecond, the visuals and sounds are, like the writing, minimal and thankfully not distracting except for one shock track which always starts off as if it were poorly edited in. The mix of simple cut-out characters over rustic backgrounds is all the story needs. The jarring, industrial soundtrack fits the mood of the game perfectly.\n\nThird, the characters are bleeding-heart open to the reader. There is no dullness in them, no fluff. Every line of dialogue matters and every action matters. What I'm saying is they are honesty interesting and you care about them and junk.\n\nFinally, while I feel the game's religious overtones are treated more as stage-dressing than anything meaningful, they are darn good stage-dressing and fit perfectly. The atmosphere of this game is holy as your heart in a prayer and thick as communion wine. It's a sacrament that will move you.\n\nThis game is good. It's short, fierce, and damnably honest. There is no excess or baggage. The game intends to give you a moment of transcendence and leave you panting with your feet on the ground ten minutes later. You will have that transcendence.","February 21","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story and setting is as murky as the night-time woods, and the wonderfully blaring soundtrack is somehow both nostalgic and frightening. Foreboding menace never seems to leave, and the Devil always seems to lurk nearby.\n\nHOWEVER, the game does come with a few issues, varying in severity depending on what kind of person you are. There's a fair few typos, enough to be noticeable. The language can sometimes drift into Sword & Sworcery/tumblr "quirky" which can undercut the drama, causing one or two eye-rolls. The game can be very oblique at times, and without repeat playthroughs a lot is going to be lost. With these factors combined, I could imagine the game being quite intolerable to the pedantic and impatient.\n\nBut go in with an open mind and heart and you'll find characters and situations that just gets it. It's authentic and relatable, even for those without any sort of queer experience. You're sure to find at least some part of a younger, confused self with Jupiter, Neptune and Venus, deep in those dark woods.\nAnd that sounds pretty gay. But it's a pretty gay game. So what can you do.\nGet the soundtrack.","May 11","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's really, really good.\n\nWKTD is short (Steam tells me it took me 4 hours to play through all the routes, and then replay a few with friends), and not terrifically text-heavy, which was great for me, as a person who generally finds VNs a bit of a slog to get through. It's worth your time though! The dialogue is nice and concise; pretty much every line felt like it was advancing the plot or telling me something interesting about the characters, exposition is light, and the worldbuilding-y bits are very vague. Definitely a game where you should see all the endings - there're some things to be pieced together and revealed from each one.\n\nIt's also got a lot of punch. The art and music are great. The characters are strong. They have really big flaws. Their relationships are compelling. The world is strange and unnerving and still mundane and it all comes together into this complete atmosphere of quietly anxious horror and lighthearted-but-sincere teen insecurity.\n\nIf as a teen you were: sad, angry, gay, trans, a girl, a freak, very uncomfortable, very frightened, or any combination/all of the above you should play this game because it's about being undeniably weird and bad and different and knowing it, and what comes next.","June 2","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
