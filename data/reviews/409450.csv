This is an underrepresented genre on Steam, which is actually rather surprising. Wizardry, The Bard's Tale, Might & Magic, and numerous other grid-based franchises got their start on computers, so one would assume there'd be more games to "carry the torch". It's understandable, considering how niche the genre has become, but I can't get enough of them. Managames' The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an extremely adept dungeon-crawler, and does more than enough to quench anyone's thirst.\n\nConsidering the genre, you can't go into this game expecting much in the way of plot. You're several miles deep in a labyrinthian prison, and all of the in-mates have broken free. There are also a plethora of fell-beasts inhabitating the halls because...why not? It's on you to put together a party of four to find the prisoners and escape this nightmare. Like other dungeon-crawlers, this game emphasizes exploration and combat above all else. Your survival is dependent on coming to grips with the battle-system, finding better loot, and never taking anything for granted.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of this game is the class-system. Each class is denoted by their role in battle. Basically you'll want a party consisting of a tank, two damage dealers, and a healer. These roles are self-explanatory, and utilizing them to their fullest extent is mandatory in order to progress. I really like this system, because everyone has to pull their own weight. In RPGs, there tends to be times where party-members aren't really doing anything. They're just another bum with a sword, and you invest in their growth until eventually they learn a spell, or get some important piece of equipment that makes them really useful. Not so with this game, everyone has to play their part, or the entire party will be wiped out.\n\nCombat itself is "real-time with pauses", which suits the class-system just fine. Most abilities operate on cool-down timers, so it's up to you to rotate through them, while paying attention to the current situation. The tank has numerous methods for pulling aggro, but you still have to keep your over-zealous mages in check, because they can get crushed in a few hits. You also have to pay attention to what the enemy is doing. Their next move is always shown on-screen, so you have ample time to prepare. Over time, you might find that certain strategies are effective at dealing with most mobs of monsters, but you always have to take great care in handling Elite foes and bosses. Every boss in this game has a particularly unique aspect that makes for fresh and exciting battles. There are also a handful of instances where moving around can be advantageous, so that's worth keeping in mind as well.\n\nThis game's approach to difficulty is very fluid. There will come a time where you'll feel like you're truly stuck. You've exhausted every available tactic, found the best equipment possible, but you just can't seem to beat that next boss. This is the part where you decide on what to do next. The difficulty in this game is thoroughly balanced, so it shouldn't be impossible for a decent party. However, if that hopeless feeling gets the better of you, the difficulty can be customized at any time. So if you think you could beat the boss if he had 10, 5, or even 1% less health, then sure...go for it. You can always re-adjust the difficulty later. Alternatively, if things are getting too easy (or not punishing enough), you can raise the settings.\n\nPlaying around with the difficulty sliders is also helpful if you're using different parties. If for example you wanted a party of four damage-dealers, you could adjust the settings until that becomes an actually viable tactic. It's a neat idea, and while I find the relationship between tanks, healers, and damage dealers to be far more exciting, the level of freedom is still welcome. Experimenting with the difficulty and how it affects various party make-ups can be compelling in itself. There is still plenty of challenge for the purists, who would rather focus on improving their tactics than take the easy way out. Best of all, this system completely defeats the purpose of grinding. Not that you would if you could anyway, since there are a limited number of monsters on every level. Still, it has all of the functionality of making the game easier, but without the large time investment. The 20+ hours you invest into a play-through of this game are going to be spent purely adventuring, not running in-between tiles to fight random encounters.\n\nAnother particularly nice attribute of this game is that you won't spend a lot of the time saving & reloading. When it comes to dungeon-crawlers, I tend to play very conservatively. If somebody dies, I reload my last save. If I get back-attacked and I know somebody won't survive the encounter, I reload my last save. The stats I gain from my level-up aren't good enough? Yep, that last save is getting reloaded for certain. It gets annoying after awhile. With this game however, it isn't really necessary. For one, everyone receives experience, even if they lose all of their HP during battle. Characters that are knocked out also recovery shortly afterwards, and HP/MP replenishes quickly. This, combined with the lack of load-times when moving between levels, makes the game really appealing to play. While there are brutally powerful attacks, there's nothing that can really be considered an insta-death spell. If your party is wiped out, you can't blame the Gods of RNG.\n\nThe dungeons in this game are all very good. While combat is definitely favored, there are some puzzles to figure out, and even a few devious ones that lead to substantial gear-upgrades. Each level has unique qualities that help it stand out, and the designs don't go overboard, so nothing ever feels like a gimmick. This creates a very natural sense of exploration. It's rewarding to poke around, and since every floor takes about an hour or so to complete, you can make substantial progress in a reasonable amount of time. Also, keep in mind that the time spent on each level can extend dramatically, depending on your difficulty settings.\n\nWith its great battle-system, unique approach to difficulty, and a sizable amount of content, The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an easy recommendation.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","November 25, 2015","true","37.4"," 110 of 127 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","110","127","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/409450/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","TLDR: If you like dungeon crawlers (as I do) this one is totally worth picking up. Its not as much of a masterpiece as Dungeon Master or Legend of Grimrock, but its still really good.\n\n\n\nThe plot - its your first day as a guard at a dungeon where the worlds worst inmates are kept. Theres a brief intro, during which you can create a character as you go down the elevator to your post, talking to a trustee of some kind. You can also skip the intro, and after viewing it once, Id recommend you skip it as you get much more control over the initial character's (the one that's "you") creation that way. Of course, something goes horribly wrong once you settle into your bunk for the night...First day on the job and something has happened. All the prisoners were let out and have fled into the tunnels around the dungeon complex. The fat a**hole warden assigns you to go get them back, along with 3 other guards. The dungeon must be attached to Undermountain or something...because the starting intro looks like you're going down into Black Mesa and this place is HUGE. Who goes "yeah, lets build a dungeon with the worlds worst criminals next to tunnels into god knows where". Apparently, these guys.\n\nYou have 4 char slots to fill, a tank, a healer, and two damagers. The races are basic fantasy, human, dwarf, elf, dark elf, and halfling. Theres also 4 classes Warrior, mage, healer and rogue. However, each class has 3 subclasses, which provides a slightly different take on that type of class. For instance, a healer Druid relies on strong HoT spells, a Priest has instant but weaker straigh heals and protection spells and a healer Necromancer's skills rely on pulling health from the enemy to heal. The subclass options are really cool. I like all the different options, theres pretty much a party for every playstyle.\n\nOne thing I really like is the Duelist - a Rogue tank that relies on speed and quickness to avoid being hit along with "threat boosting" techniques to tank. Thats way cooler than your stereotypical "brick in platemail" tank.\n\nCombat can be confusing at first but is cool once you get the hang of it. Space pauses, like Baldur's Gate, and you can queue up to 3 abilities per party member. You can pause at any time, which is great and avoids the step dance annoyance of games like LoG (a great dungeon crawler in its own right). Abilities run on cooldowns like WoW or Diablo, and as your characters level, you get to choose talents from a talent tree to improve your arsenal of abilities. I just wish that when targeting enemies, the "red aura" around the enemy to show they are targeted was a different color for each player and appeared every time you paused. Its annoying to have to remember who was attacking where in the heat of battle, as all that it shows is a red glow over the enemy being targetted..\n\nGraphics are good for the genre,  and sounds are your typical dungeon noises, bumps, sword clangs, spells firing grunts and so on. The writing isnt great, but Ive seen much worse. Hey, at least your characters talk amongst themselves, and really, people dont play dungeon crawlers for the dialogue. Its servicable, and (IMHO) its much better than crawlers with no dialogue at all.\n\nThis is a solid dungeon crawler, and Id recommend it for any fans of the genre. I love grid based realtime dungeon crawlers, and there hasnt been much decent to speak of lately in the genre besides the two LoGs. This one is totally worth it, and I love the addition of the "action pause" combat. I dont know how many times I got frustrated by LoG/LoG II because my disability prevented me from playing in realtime as smoothly as the game wanted me to, THotDG solves all that","November 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 66 of 85 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","66","85","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crawleyhere/recommended/409450/","crawleyhere","Crawley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crawleyhere/","582 products in account","I've been playing grid-based RPG's since the 70's starting with the Wizardy series and this is one of the better ones. This dungeon crawler more akin to games like the original Dungeon Master, Black Crypt, Eye of the Beholder, and more recently Legend of Grimrock.\n\nIt has all the tropes that those games have but adds two differences. One is a pretty extensive class selection within the tank, healer, mage, and theif roles. Each of those roles has 3 different classes to choose within them and each one has a different ability tree you'll go down. Best yet you can change your class on the fly. So if you find your tank isn't working so well as a Paladin you can just switch over to a Protector class and try that one out.\n\nThe other difference is the ability to pause combat.\n\nTypically in these games all fighting is done in real-time. So you're kiting around the monsters and at the same time trying to trigger attacks or cast spells. It's sometimes difficult work. In Dungeon Guardians you can pause the battle, queue up your attacks/heals and then keep fighting.\n\nThis actually turns battles more in to toe-to-toe fights where the tank maintaining agro and the healer keeping up with damage is prime importance. But you'll still have instances where you need to menuever out of the way of attacks.\n\nThere are some other neat innovations with this game too for the genre. Levels will have both mini-bosses and at the very end of them regular bosses. The boss battles, particularly the ones at the end of the level, are all pretty unique and require different tactics to complete. Thankfully your party will offer up some helpful advice for how the battle might go so you can plan ahead - or you can skip those conversations and go in blind. I have to say the boss battles were all a lot of fun.\n\nAs you go through the games 20 levels you're introduced to new monsters each level which keeps things fresh. And every 3 or so levels new tile sets. You'll also start the levels with a blank map. But in each level you can find a map that will fill in automatically. If you really hunt around you can find a second map on the level which will show the entire map, including all the secret areas - although getting in to those secret areas can sometimes be difficult to figure out even when you know where they are.\n\nEach level usually has one big puzzle to solve. These are totally skippable but if you figuring them out you'll be rewarded with some Epic or sometimes Legendary gear that will really help your characters. I for one loved solving the puzzles. Most were pretty creative so we pretty happy when I would find the puzzle room.\n\nThe story for the game is somewhat throwaway but I loved the bantering the party does at the start of each level and before the boss battles. It did help to add some flavor to what would normally be generic party members.\n\nThe game took me 56 hrs to complete and that was being somewhat of a stickler at trying to find all the hidden areas and solving the optional puzzles. I was really happy with the game overall it's one of the better ones in this dungeon crawler genre. I look forward to the next one.","December 5, 2015","true","56.5"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","51","63","0","0"

Rings a bell? Stirs some memories? Pick it up immediately. Otherwise read on.\n\nNote: This review has been reviewed (ugh...) after completing the game on Mercenary difficulty. The time recorded was not all spent on the game, but I'd say it took me about 60 hours in total. Due to the difficulty setting, a fair number of save/loads were needed.\n\nAside from the usual aspects of grid-based dungeon crawler, the game is... weird. In an interesting way.\n\nLet me say it first, some people compare this to Legend of Grimrock - and they're not exactly right. The look and feel are rather similar, but combat mechanics here are ways deeper. The puzzles here are a lot clearer (exactly as they should be by my impression) as well.\n\nYou feel like you're in control of a party of newbs just jumped out of World of Warcraft and into some outworldly multi-tiered dungeon. But you have to control all four of them alone. And that's where the ultimate use of a tactical pause comes very handy.\n\nThe balance overall feels very fine, your DD have to manage aggro carefully, and your healer has to conserve mana (unless you run with a druid). The balance of specializations looks a tiny bit off to me at the moment but respec feature comes very handy (albeit way too limited to really employ it as a way to modify tactics on the fly).\n\nThere's no front or back row (oh thank God for that), but as such there's no way to save your casters' arses other than careful aggro management.\n\nThe mapping feature is totally awesome. When you first enter the level, you have no way to map it. When you find the first map of the level, you get an automap showing where you've been up to the point. And with the second map (usually pretty well hidden, and not on every level) comes the full map with all secrets revealed. But it's totally your choice if you want to pick up one or both of them.\n\nAh yes, the loot is randomized, but not totally. You will always get items fitting your charaters in their current specs (but the questions of usefulnesss still stands). The best loot (Epic and Legendary) is always hidden from plain sight. The best possible dropped loot is Rare.\n\nOverall, I totally recommend this game to dungeon crawler fans,\nI only wish the dev opened up respec for free (at least on harder difficulties where it is a necessity sometimes). And please, disable respec in mid-fight :) It feels a bit strange switching your tank and DD roles in the midst of a heated bossfight.","November 9, 2015","true","141.1"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","48","62","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ai_hia/recommended/409450/","ai_hia","Ai Hia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ai_hia/","35 products in account","My first impressions are good. This is as close as it gets to the original Dungeon Master experience I had on Atari ST back in the days - only with more up to date graphics/sounds/display. Obviously there's no AAA production values to be found here, but that's not what you come here for. You come for the thrill of not knowing what you're going to stumble upon as you roam through the dungeon, sometimes carefully planning your moves, sometimes indulging into leaps of faith as you dash through.\n\nThe ability to pause the game at any time makes the combat system both easier and more tactical - there's less of an urge to blow any damage right away, and more of an incentive to choose your strikes wisely.\n\nYou can save your game at any point, which diminishes the frustration of making a wrong move - to the extent that you saved before! Perhaps the real wrong move is in not saving regularly :).\n\nI have only been playing in the easiest difficulty level so far and didn't receive life-threatening damage, so I cannot comment on the game difficulty yet. But there's a large amount of difficulty levels to choose from so I assume that you'll find whichever difficulty suits you best.","November 6, 2015","true","1.7"," 56 of 79 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","56","79","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/illustriousjfunk/recommended/409450/","illustriousjfunk","illustrious.jfunk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/illustriousjfunk/","310 products in account","Dungeon Master / Eye of the Beholder / Legend of Grimrock dungeon crawl, but with pausable tank/healer/damage based combat mechanics replacing the real time "square dance" action combat of those titles.  So far I love it.\n\nI'm a classic cRPG fan going all the way back to Wizardry.  I love the aforementioned games, but I'm an old fart that doesn't fancy real time combat.  Wizardry's "choose your actions up front, then watch the turn unfold" is probably my favorite of all time...it combined turn based mechanics while adding a little bit of unpredictable chaos by not having direct control of each action sequentially.    I can handle square-dance RT combat  (played Grimrock on Hard & Old-school with my graph paper and colored pencils), but turn-based is what I prefer.\n\nFDG is a great compromise between the two.  Has the "feel" of EoB without the silly square-dance routine that quite frankly never made any sense in an RPG anyway.  The "wow" style combat is actually more interesting as a pausable single-player experience than it's ever been in multiplayer for me. It gives the same feel of planning your moves and managing the party as a TB game, while the queueing of actions and watching it play out until you need to intervene helps keep things moving along at a rapid clip for those that might not have the patience for a tranditional TB system.\n\nNote to people who are real-time square dance fans: this is NOT an option in this game.  The WoW-style combat is NOT optional.  Resetting ability timers during movement prevent you from using this tactic.  Do NOT buy this game if you want to "stick and move" around your foes, you'll be upset.  Other than the strategically placed "dodge" of a special boss ability here and there, you'll be standing toe-to-toe using your tank/healer/damage skills to figure out the "puzzle" of defeating each particular enemy.\n\nBottom line, it's Eye of the Beholder with pausable WoW combat, and it does exactly that with great success.  If that sounds good to you, you'll love it.  If either Tank/Healer/Damage combat OR the inability to "square dance" your way through battles sounds annoying or stupid to you, you'll hate it.\n\n","April 1","true","12.4"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/forzatoro/recommended/409450/","forzatoro","Bob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/forzatoro/","75 products in account","Dungeon crawlersThe vast majority of people on this planet don’t know, and will never know, the beauty of it. Every time I play one, I feel I belong to a secret society. Is it all nostalgia? The countless days, nights and weeks playing FTL’s Dungeon Master back in the late 80’s on my Atari ST? Or is it simply a matter of taste, this genre rubbing me the right way? I'm not sure, but I will do my best to analyse my thoughts about this game, The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians (TFotDG), created by French indie developer Mana Games.\n\nI had the pleasure to compose the music for the main menu and the in-game environmental audio tracks. In addition, being the main beta-tester, I was granted the opportunity to plunge myself down into this dark mystery half a year before the official release. If I was frenetically bug-hunting 25% of the time, I was happily exploring, puzzle-solving and monster-bashing the other 75. I’ve played this game for many hours, completed it, and recently started it all over again.\n\nThe game mechanic similarities with Dungeon Master are, on the surface, obvious; you control a party of 4 heroes, orientating (in First Person View) through a grid-based dungeon, solving puzzles, finding keys and secrets, swinging swords and axes, shooting fireballs, drinking potions, finding loot for upgrades, avoiding trapdoors and being freaked out by horrific monsters along the way.\n\nThere are, though, some significant differences. One of them is the way we fight.\n\nCombat systemThe combat is based on the “tank/damage dealer/healer” mechanism, which invites the player to approach battles with a more strategic view compared to the “hit-strafe-hit-strafe”-tactic (dancing around your enemy) found in Dungeon Master and some other grid-based dungeon crawlers.\n\nIn TFotDG, you fight most of your battles positioning your party right in front of your enemy, standing your ground. There are a few exceptions, though, as when you try to dodge the Evil Watchers’ fireballs, or if you try to avoid a certain attack by your enemy. With this system, the player conducts each individual party member to perform certain abilities, such as various attacks, healing/damage spells, buffs and much more. You want your tank to generate enough threat to keep the enemies targeting him, leaving the remaining party (healer and damage dealers) alone to focus on healing the tank (and other members when necessary) and attacking the enemy with melee and spellcasting.\n\nKeeping the enemies from attacking certain party members plays a big part in your eventual success. This makes for very interesting battles along the way, as the heroes learn more abilities for every gained level, while your enemies are getting stronger. To sum it up, the combat system is more MMO-based compared to most grid-based dungeon crawlers. On med/high difficulty settings, it’s more than often necessary to use the manual Pause function, which allows the player to completely halt the game, analysing the situation, queue abilities, assign potions to drink, and then unpause to see the action play through, until you wish to pause again. This may sound like interrupting gameplay flow for some players, but because of the difficulty level in some fights, it’s necessary, and in the end it becomes a natural part of game, another skill to master.\n\nThe player has 4 classes to choose from; the Warrior, the Healer, the Mage & the Rogue. Each class has 3 specializations represented by a talent tree, and each specialization offers you its own set of abilities, which gives you a total of 12 base build-ups. In addition, your guardians can choose freely to spend their talent points in any of the 3 specializations belonging to their class, allowing much variety for your individual members.\n\nMissionYour mission (should you choose to accept it) is to bring back 15 prisoners, who all broke out on the very first night you arrived to the prison for work. What a nice coincidence! Opposite to most dungeon crawlers, where you descend in each level, in TFotDG you initiate your quest from the very bottom floor, where the prison is located, and work yourself upwards, ascending through the game. The dungeon itself is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, I’ve ever explored. To give you an estimate, it’s almost double the size of Dungeon Master. Now, that is value for the money.\n\nLess puzzles, more combatThere are enough monsters (no respawning btw) lurking in every possible corner to keep your pulse high and forehead sweaty. At the end of each level, there’s a Boss, whose difficult level is significantly higher than the normal monsters, with a few Bosses being very much stronger. There are 7 difficulty levels in the game (all fully customizable), and a couple of Boss fights forced me to lower the difficulty level to be able to defeat them. This left me with a bit of bad taste in my mouth, because it felt like cheating, and beating a Boss on a lower difficulty setting than you wish to play on, doesn’t feel rewarding. Having said that, most Bosses and monsters are well balanced, and who wants to play an easy game anyway? I prefer “too hard” over “too easy”.\n\nMana Games presents the game as “less puzzles, more combat”, describing that most of the puzzles aren’t necessary to complete the game, but usually reward you with some nice loot, although I found myself wishing the loot could’ve been better in some situations. Having banged my head against the wall for quite some time trying to solve a trapdoor puzzle to get across a room, it’s a pretty hard punch in the face not getting an upgrade for any of your 4 characters. But in the end, loot is random, thus adding to reality and surprises.\n\nAtmosphere is everythingThe feeling of “being there” means almost everything in games like TFotDG, and it really succeeds in achieving that feel. Knowing your position and bearing, keeping your back safe, looking for hidden buttons on mossy walls and analysing the haunting environment ahead. All these things become an obsession. You will revisit many labyrinth corridors during your mission, looking for secrets and hidden treasure, and there’s a certain feel when becoming “homey” in safe areas you’ve already cleared from enemies and monsters.\nIt becomes a “safe haven”, and knowing the way back from where you came from can many times save your life, when you need to retreat from a group of a Cave Monsters or a poisonous Spider Queen. That’s what "keeping your back safe” is all about. TFotDG is definitely not the type of game where you just storm forward recklessly, pretending you’re Rambo. Of course, you can set the difficulty level so low that you actually can play like that, but that’s not the main intention of this game.\n\nConclusionI’m having a blast playing this game. It’s certainly a game that requires some time getting into. The combat system, including targeting enemies and timing your abilities, takes some getting used to. I can imagine players with low experience of this kind of game struggling in the beginning. That’s where the customizable difficulty settings come in – find your levels, play the game, get better, and when you’re ready for a challenge, raise the difficulty.\nThe game is not perfect (it has some bugs), but with less than two weeks after official Steam release, the developer has been very responsive to players’ bug reports, suggestions and feedback, releasing patches literally every day, not only fixing bugs but also enhancing the game in various aspects.\n\nI highly recommend this game. Not only for the obvious freaks like myself out there, but I’m sure classic MMO/RPG players enjoy this as well, as it has influences from more than one genre. If atmosphere, mystery, puzzles or intense combat is an important ingredient for you when playing games, this will be your thing.","November 15, 2015","true","79.0"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","36","49","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shimaaji/recommended/409450/","shimaaji","Urisk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shimaaji/","1792 products in account","Please note the following points before reading the rest of my review:\n- I haven't finished the game yet. I'm through slightly more than 50% of the Dungeon levels, which is probably a little less than 50% of the total playtime, since the first few levels were less complex.\n- I have more playtime than I can reasonably have accumulated on release day. I've bought the game through the developers' shop and activated it on Steam a few days ago. I didn't receive a review copy but instead paid full price. So this review is by no means biased by having gotten something for free. ;)\n\nNow that that's out of the way back to the game:\n\nGameplay:\nFirst and foremost it is a grid based dungeon crawler that apparently draws significant inspiration from genre classics like Dungeon Master. There are no outdoor areas. The game (in contrast to for example earlier Might and Magic titles) is played in real time, meaning monsters will move and act even when the player doesn't do anything, but here an active pause function was implemented. This allows for a much more tactical combat experience than can be found in some other, more 'retro-ish' dungeon crawlers like Might and Magic X Legacy or Legend of Grimrock for example, where modern computer RPG features like active pause, hotkeys and quickbars where deliberately ommited to provide a gameplay experience closer to "the classics of old". Also in other regards there are nice comfort features that you could use. For example when you mouse-over a key on the map screen the place where you picked it up will be highlighted on the map. (EDIT: In my original review I mentioned at this place, that progress-relevant items like keys can potentially be almost invisible on the ground IF dropped in a very dark corner of a room falling close to a gap or stairs for example. This has since be fixed by a patch implementing an optional highlighting option for dropped loot, which can be switched on in the options ... just making the game even better.)\nThe only thing I'm not so sure about is the number of classes. Since I'm still in my first playthrough it's hard to say, but there are only four classes. Even though the skill trees are quite varied and for example the man at arms may be played as a damage dealer or a tank... For longevity I think some more exotic classes would have been nice. (To be fair however: The classes in this game are MUCH more complex than in other retro-ish dungeon crawlers and I guess balancing additional classes would be quite a bit of work ... but still, would be nice. ;) )\n\nVisuals:\nOverall the game provides a quite modern look while still reproducing the atmosphere in classic dungeon crawlers. If I were to compare The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians to other recent high profile grid based dungeon crawlers I'd say it's mostly on par with them, though if you are really looking at them comparing little details there might be a very minor lack of polish here. (One example would be: At the start of the game you go down to the bottom of the dungeon via elevator passing multiple levels and also some cross-bracings ... and that's where the edge of the platform merely clips brazenly through the cross bracings. ;) ) Once the intro sequence was over and I started playing I quickly got absorbed in the game to the point where I completely stopped noticing these miniscule hickups which are VERY rare anyway. The only thing that got a little bit 'more' negative after playing the first three levels was the lack of variety in wall textures within one texture set, which became apparent once I started spending more time searching for hidden switches, but I'd just say it's "noticeable, but not problematic". The different sets after clearing a few levels are very varied though and all are incredibly pretty and convey a very different atmosphere every time you change the 'area'.\nAlso the spell effects and illumination look very nice. It's just incredible when you play in a dimly lit room and rain down fire on an entire group of enemies, temporarily lighting up everything just to see the ash of your incinierated foes fall to the ground while the dungeon (and your room) returns to it original lighting conditions.\n\nSound design:\nThe sounds works very well with the game and overall the ambient soundeffects are very atmospheric and do a great job forming the overall positive picture.\n\nBugs:\nThe only one I'm still having right now is that 5.1 digital surround sound via HDMI (from an nvidia GTX 970) doesn't work, but that's a Unity thing: Search their developer support Forums and you'll find out that most developers ultimately "fix" the problem by using an original Creative Labs Soundblaster card, because the audio component of Unity just is very, very bad.\nTwo other minor problems I had were so little I might not have noticed them had I not deliberately looked for problems. One was fixed before I could report it and the other one was addressed by the developer right away, who by the way is very responsive and friendly.\n\nConclusion: (note: this is prelminary, since I haven't finished the game!)\nThe Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is a lot of fun. It's by no means an easy game, but it offers very comprehensive difficulty settings, which will allow the most casual of players to still enjoy the game while pure masochists will be served just as well. The atmosphere of the game quickly sucked me in. The representation of the deep dungeon and the sense of being lost in those tunnels ist just that strong and from what I've played so far I truly think it might just be one of the best grid based dungeon crawlers of the last few years.\n\n(Also note that the game offers a map editor, but I didn't have time to check it our yet.)","November 6, 2015","true","21.5"," 42 of 60 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","42","60","3","0"

When playing on higher difficulty lvl the game is really challenging and forces you to time skills properly otherwise you will end up dead.

As a huge fan of the old Dungeon Master & Chaos Strikes Back games i like this type of game and i must admit i did put in a few thousand hours in to WoW. This game is thier love child. Take the general gameplay of DM and add in the skill trees and the ability to look around in a more 3d like environment and this is what you get. The addition of being able to stop time and stack up to three commends for each of your four man party means you dont get swamped trying to comtrol four characters in a battle. The boss fights make this even more important due to another WoW like idea of boss special tactics. Watch for the bosses special attacks and either counter them or get out of the way.\n\nMy only very minor annoyance is that i turned on a lot of the auto pause features for my first try as i expected to be swamped and need the help but i just end up looking at it and wondering why its paused this time? Either i'm missing something obvious or it might just be better to only enable the more important options so its a little less confusing.

But there's an active pause to help you to handle all this. Also, there are many helpers in the game options, with auto pauses and other stuff.\n\nYou might want to read carefully each ability description as understanding what everything does and how everything works together is essential to beat the strongest monsters.\n\nWe have to optimize the damage output, the healing, the damage mitigation and the tank aggro, while watching from tricky attacks of the enemies, so at the hardest difficulty levels, the game is very challenging.\n\nSo far, every boss fight has been different for me, each requiring a special and different strategy to beat them and really testing the endurance of my team.\n\nCharacter building is done little touch after little touch. You won't raise your damage by 50% every 30 minutes in this game. But the party does get stronger with time, and it feels really earned, unlike speedy RPGs.\n\nExploration is nice as well, but there's almost no puzzles, which is a plus if you're not a big fan of puzzles like me.\n\nYou have to find the map in each level to activate the automapping, which is a nice touch for spicying up the exploration, or you can just turn it on in the menus if it gets too hard, up to you.\n\nThere's a lot of secrets to find, but they are all in logical places, like dead-ends.\n\nTL;DR: overall, it's an interesting and different take on the classic Dungeon Crawling, with a lot of challenging combat. The experience starts weirdly and slowly but gets deeper level after level.

Everything is set on a grid, but the game plays in real-time, though you can pause it at any time by hitting space. In combat this is more or less a requirement to keep track of what's happening.\n\nI'm playing on Warrior difficulty (1 up from default), and there you really have to pick your battles. If you just burst into a room and charge the first monsters you see, chances are that you will get flanked by another patrol. Elite and Boss monsters really require some thought into how to counter their special moves.\n\nThere are 12 classes in the game, with 3 variations of 4 base classes: Warrior, Rogue, Cleric and Mage. Each class has a primary role in the party: the Tank-Healer-Damage trinity, though each class has different skills that can change how they fulfill their role. A Ranger is pretty good at dealing ranged damage to a single target, while a Man-At-Arms might be better at dealing melee damage to a group, and a Warlock is has more of a focus on weaking enemies with damage over time.\n\nI like that there are some interesting class choices. For example: the healer in my party is a Necromancer, who suck the life out of his enemies to heal his allies.\n\nFor a game that was just released and developed by a single person, I am impressed with how well done and stable it is.\n\nI've recorded some gameplay footage of the early game to show what the game is about:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdljYIBwo7w\n\nUpdate 1, 3 weeks after my initial review: the developer has done a great job supporting the game after release. Bugs and balance issues have been resolved, and a lot of nice quality of life features have been added.\n\nUpdate 2, another 3 weeks have passed: I have reached dungeon level 6, and the level design is still varied, with every level "feeling" different from the previous one. Every level adds a few new monsters to the roster, slowly increasing the variety and complexity of combat encounters. The game has definitely increased in difficulty, making it a pretty good challenge on Warrior difficulty (1 up from normal).","November 6, 2015","true","49.7"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","23","36","0","0"

But despite the similarities on the surface, there are enough differences that it stands on it's own. There's a strong focus on combat, and your party has several skills, with more added as you level.  Party members have designated roles.  Tank, Healer, DPS.  It's hard to keep up with battle in real time, so basic gameplay involves a lot of pausing battles to queue up your party's skills.  Quite different from the constant dancing around and slashing I did in LoG.\n\nThe dungeon you have to explore is massive.  I recommend turning on auto-mapping in the options, even if the game doesn't recommend it.  The floors are just too big to keep in your head.\n\nOverall, it's quite satisfying.

The combat system is quite a different than that of most other games, more automated in some ways but also more demanding of attention - the feedback isn't great, and it's easy to lose track of who's doing what in the middle of a fight. But the level designs are competent, the enemies look good, and while it doesn't feel quite as polished as Legend of Grimrock (particularly LoG2) - for instance, it can be difficult to see items dropped by defeated enemies - it's still a very professional effort.","November 16, 2015","true","8.5"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","1"

I am nearly at the end.\n\nThe Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an excellent interpretation of the good old dungeoneering concept - the dungeon crawler; with the added feature of highly strategic combat and something called "threat level" to keep enemies distracted while the rest of the party moves in to defeat them. This makes for a very challenging experience. If you are familiar with the old classics - Stonkeep/DM/DM2/Chaos Strikes Back/MM/Black Crypt/EOB, and more recently Grimrock, etc - you might want to give this one a chance. Just dont go expecting it is like those games - it is and yet it is not. It is its own.\n\nWithout a doubt, when you figure out the combat mechanics, and how timing plays a critical role in all this, the game truly opens up. This is how it was for me. I played warrior difficulty about halfway through the game but then lowered it because it became frustrating - nothing wrong with the game, just my personal playstyle. I dare say Dungeon Guardians is one of the better games of this genre that I have played since the glorious 80:s. At the discussions forum there are also tips for new player, in regards to how combat works etc.\n\nMany classes to choose from and oportunities to spread skillpoints across skilltrees to customise characters and talents (there is also the option to reroll points at later stages in the game, if you are unhappy with current choices). Numerous opponents and monsters to test your abilities and lots of loot to improve your stats.\n\nOther pros: Nice gfx, steam workshop for modifications, and a very responsive developer if you have questions.\n\nSome other things I liked about this game: characters sometimes have short conversations or comment on whats going on, ocassionally they give you tips before a bossfight you may or may not want to heed - good for immersion as you head deeper into this huge dungeon. Also, the fact that you have find the maps before you can actually see where you are at, that makes it more challenging (you usually have to work hard to get that precious automap, both of them, particularly at the lower levels!) Inventory is shared between characters in your party rather that each having their own.\n\nThe Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is not original or good because it happens to be a dungeon crawler, its a highly likeable, enjoyable and addictive experience mostly due to its detailed execution - the polished touches addes by its creator/developer - and the fact that it simply happens to be a fun game overall, irrespective of genres. It could have been called Milkshake for all I care.\n\nPlus - its the only game I have ever been attacked by something called a "Hell Mushroom". Will we see them in the sequel, I wonder? Perhaps there will shall see an achievement for defeating such an abomination!\n\n\n\n","March 14","true","72.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The highlights are the combat, leveling, gear upgrades and exploration. The initial thought when playing is this game is similar to Legend of Grimrock. The movement system looks similar, and some of the dungeon basics look the same.  However, that could be said for most dungeon-crawling games. I believe the graphics and animations are better in TFotDG. The combat is far superior. Wheras Grimrock forces your party to avoid toe-to-toe fights, this game encourages it. Your tanks can actually tank. Then can grab aggro from other party members. This game is almost like a single-player mmo.\n\nThis game is light on puzzles, which was my number one complaint with both Grimrock games. The excessive puzzles slowed the game down too much. This game is much faster paced. There are a few puzzles, but they are not crippling.  There is a skill tree system, and you can build your rogue as a tank, or DPS, your warrior can be a tank or a paladin or other DPS. There are different play styles for each class, depending on how you build your character, which is another huge bonus.\n\nThe developer has been very active, addressing any requests or bugs.  This game is well worth the asking price, and if it goes on sale, it's simply a steal.","November 11, 2015","true","52.0"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

Where LoG was mostly puzzle solving, this game is mostly combat oriented with elements borrowed from the MMO genre.\n\nIt has the typical MMO party dynamics fighter/tank aggro type, healer, and damage dealers. Abilities have timers with various lengths so you have to manage your abilites and time them strategically to keep your party alive. Typically you make your way through the dungeon and its encounters until you meet that levels boss encounter, which can be tricky to overcome.\n\nGraphics are fairly good for this type of game, though character portraits are woefully few.

Almost  every killed group of monsters drops a various item behind. There is always slightly better item on the next level. That's why I had no reason to solve various puzzles in the game to get a next “special” item, which will superseded with a new one on the next dungeon level.\n- Various puzzles without a minimal clue how to solve them and without any story behind of them.\n- Well the story...:) There is almost no story it all... it is very thin and not really motivating.\n- It is not possible to escape fights and run at all. The grid system works not the same way like in Grimrock. There you can also win by moving and attacking monsters from their sides, during they movements to approach you for front attacks.

There are two types of cooldowns, the ability and the gobal.  With gobal, you can get haste to lower it so you can get to other skills more quickly, HOWEVER, you have to be in attack range to do so, otherwise your gobal just resets to max and once your back in range of an enemy, it restarts.  This is amazingly stupid and makes it near impossible to kite when needed.  All the boss fights play out like a WoW boss fight with a trick or two you need to watch for.  Example :  Bone Dragon, there is a purple mist and a green mist each at the far center of a square room, need to run into it to get a dmg reduction buff for 2 long cast time ablilities.  While I'm side running to get one or the other, my gobals stop, even though most of my dots that HAVE RANGE BTW cant cast cause the gobal stops.  Broken system, not a bad idea at all for a game, but needs to have a few things checked.  Gobals shouldnt stop unless your character gets CC'd in some way for example.","March 17","false","11.8"," 4 of 21 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","4","21","0","4"

The bug had me originally playing on mercenary difficulty which is a scale of 1:1 whilst saying it was on adventure difficulty which is 0.5:1. At proper adventure difficulty the game was easy and I would have to increase it back up to provide any real challenge. I do not like the implementation of the difficulty scaling on gameplay however, as it is heavily biased toward the enemy HP and damage, with no increase for the player party in defensive or offensive ability, making the game back to where I started at being ridiculously OP in enemy favour at 1:1 scale. Also as others have noted the level design is uninspiring, barring the slight 3D walkway system mentioned in my original post. I also do not favour the combat system employed here, finding it rather limited in strategic options when compared to other games of this genre old and new (to clarify a little it is really just a pause and play system with cooldown timers, not really a turn based system like as in you take a turn then opponant takes a turn, and only a real time system if you don't pause. However unless you play on some ridiculously easy setting you won't be able to play without constant pause/unpause, also it pretty much a stand in front of the enemy untill battle resolved system without any possibility of movement based tactics). IMHO you would be better served aquiring an excellent title like Legend Of Grimrock II, which is far superior in all counts and is hard to pull yourself away from. Whereas I am not even inspired to crank this one up anymore and can only see it gathering dust in my library, just as well it was only cheap. So some people may have some fun with this, but I hope this review was of help to those seasoned gamers of RPG and dungeon crawlers who really want to know if they should waste their time with it or not:)\n\nP.S. I've also blocked the dev from making any more comments in this thread, as he's wasting my time and energy after I told him the conversation was over. But he can't accept that and wants to keep having his little hissy fit, and now he rekons I've been lying about what he said, however all his comments are there for anyone who wants to be bothered reading them. And yeah I called him a needy little crybaby about 60% into the thread when he had become overbearing and harassing, but if the shoe fits then wear it right? And didn't his mammy teach him that "sticks and stones can break your bones but names can never hurt you"? So if he's so bothered by it, then it must be because he has a guilty conscience! And to give you an idea of how he twists everything, in his "EDIT" to his response he claims I am deleting "all" his comments, but in fact I only removed the last few. That kinda of overstatement and misreading of facts started in his very first posts to me as you can read for yourself. Also take note of how he's attempted to take over the thread like it was his avenue for selling his game and ideas, however Valve in their infinite wisdom have elected to make me the thread moderator because it is my review of the game, and my opinion of it is not up for question. People can take it or leave it, as is their individual perogative:)\n\nOriginal review started here:\n\nA different take on the Dungeon Master/Grimrock style of first person party based dungeon crawler. However I found the combat to be poorly balanced and party make up fairly redundant e.g. If you have a party that'd be balanced from a roleplaying point of view Tank + Healer + Magic User + Rogue you will find your tank is to soft to tank, and your healer cannot heal fast enough, your casters spells do little damage and your rogue has no real ability to wrest the aggro away from your tank if needed. In most cases when coming across a boss, the boss could use its abilities in very rapid succession, certainly much faster than you could use yours. Also the bosses could do attacks with damage of 50+ to 100 HP when your attacks can only do tiny amounts like 5/10/25 maybe some with damage over time like bleeding, but so could some of the boss attacks on you cause you to bleed. Add to that the fact that at lvl 2 my tank only had 210HP even with gear boosting his stamina/HP, while the same lvl 2 boss has 2000-2500HP you can see why it is ridiculously OP, given that other members in your party have less HP than your tank (like 100-150HP) a boss could take 2 swings to render a party member unconsious and useless, those 2 swings taking less time than you can even put a heal on them or pull the aggro off them. And even your tank could be put out  by some of the bosses attacks that deal around 100HP by just 2-3 hits. The dev rekons that this game is not a hit and then dodge type game, but rather a stand in front of the enemy until battle resolved type game. However such tactics will surely result in a quick demise on your part as its not possible to interrupt the enemys attacks quickly or often enough without filling your party with specific character types that have that kind of ability, thus making other character types redundant EDIT: (apperantly you can't do this as the interrupt ability is tied to the whole party, not one specific party member therefore you can only wait for the cooldown to expire, which is quite a while under the pause/unpause system in the game). I had to employ some dodging type tactics, but was ultimately defeated from using this tactic by a boss that could move and shadow my every move so quickly that he'd be in the opposite square almost before I could get there, so the game was reading my keypresses and working to defeat me by pretending my enemy had some kind of ESP as to where I'd move? Even trying to stand and fight this enemy, I had only managed to reduce his HP's to about 65% his original total before my tank went down, and my healer and magic user had all but exhausted their mana pool, but without my tank it was game over anyway!\nAnd BTW if you retreat/run away to regenerate/heal the enemys HP regenerate as well, so you might as well heal to full and start the battle from scratch.\n\nI also found the party member selection in your party, and targeting the enemy in the rear positions of an enemy party a little bit clumsy and awkward. Inventory and map/skill managment were not that intuitive or good as the originals in this class of game either.\n\nIn final analysis the game has some nice touches graphics and sound wise, also it is the first time I have seen 3 dimensional level design in this type of crawler (there are places where paths cross overhead and enemys can fire down or up at you and visa versa), but to recommend it even at the current price, there would need to be some serious balancing done. In fact overall it feels like a game half done gameplay wise, like it had some nice ideas but they were never really explored or developed fully.\n\nEDIT UPDATE: It seems there was a bug in my game showing Adventurer difficulty when in fact I was playing Mercenary difficulty (adventurer should only be 0.50 scaling), my review may change after I have had a chance to check out the fixed difficulty setting.","November 14, 2015","false","14.7"," 19 of 55 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","19","55","0","57"

It has traditional grid based movement/maps and a wide variety of character classes which use WoW-like talent trees and abilities complete with aggro management, healing and dps roles.  Combat is toe-to-toe slogging it out in pausable real-time battles rather than the poke and dodge style of the grid style games (see Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder, Legend of Grimrock) which it emulates.\n\nThe game falls short in a few areas such as inventory/item management and mapping.  Although the game has an automap you cannot use it until you find the map object on each level.  This means you can't make any in-game notes about things you find until after you have located the map.  Once you have the map it works as expected automatically filling in the areas you visited before finding it.  The map object was a terrible idea and should have been left out.\n\nInventory is also quirky.  You must drag items (which have a WoW-like spew of stats and bonuses) into the inventory before they can be equipped and for better or worse there is only a single shared invetory for the entire party.\n\nCombat is hit and miss (no pun intended).  It mostly auto attacks for you while you juggle the use of special abilities to keep track of healing, dps and aggro for your group.  Characters will not start attacking a new target on their own when their current target dies so you also have to watch out for the little eyeball icon which indicates a character is idle.  Combat can be paused by pressing space and skills can be queued up but given the large number of skills and characters propensity to end up just sitting around idle it feels very chaotic and almost out of your hands.  Just like WoW you will likely find yourself watching health/mana bars and skill timers to the exclusion of the rest of the screen.  The good news is that staring at the bars may take your mind off the crudeness of the graphics.\n\nPersoanlly the game does not appeal to me.  I would instead strongly reccomend getting Legend of Grimrock 1 and or 2 instead of this or even looking online for now ancient games such as the Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder games for something more enjoyable.\n\n\n","January 13","false","2.1"," 6 of 26 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","6","26","0","3"

But combat is more akin to the M&M; when you encounter a foe you just root yourself on the spot and choose which abilities to use at which time. This dilutes the tactics aspect of the game as most of the time you just use the best dps ability on your damage dealers and keep your tank topped on health with your healer. Level design is also a little bit uninspired, at least the three first levels are mostly just huge labyrinths. There is a try at some dialogue at the beginning of the game to explain the setting but it is horrendously bad. It would have been better just to stumble upon this labyrinth than to suffer through that "dialogue".\n\nI can't recommend this game to anyone except to the most hardcore fans of the genre. Players new to the genre should check Grimrock series or Might & Magic X. Everything here feels uninspired. But still after all this negativity, there is some charm to it. I'll probably continue to play this and see does it get better further on.","November 9, 2015","false","6.1"," 23 of 65 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","23","65","3","5"
