Probably the second one.\n\nA nice, small cat needs to be let into the house and you have to build various rube goldberg machines in order to let her in. As you do this, the cat will MEOW at you in a pleading PLEASE HELP ME sort of way in order to encourage you. She also scratches on the door, which always makes me nervous cause I'm afraid poor cat will get a splinter. Anyhow, thus motivated, you win and get stars. You use those things to buy cosmetics for your cat that no real cat would ever agree to wear.\n\nThe game is free and doesn't charge you for anything you need though. And do other puzzle games have cats in them? No. Therefore this is a great game. And if you do get suckered into doing the microtransactions, 15% of the money goes towards helping cats. So it's win-win.\n\nI thus give this game a 10/10.

This game was a rollercoaster, it's true meaning still remains as an enigma. The old woman represents life and death, the cat represents the grim reaper coming to take this elderly woman's soul. The elaborate device to open the door is the old woman's attempts at escaping the reality of her impending death. The player is merely the force to open this woman's eyes so she may accept her fate.

It doesn't change the gameplay and is completely optional. You also have the ability to buy more items to use in any given level. You can buy more stars with real currency, but from what I've seen, this is optional.\n\nIt's obviously just a port of a mobile game, which shows in some areas.

I recieved a cat named Van Gogh. His hobby was wrestling. This gave him the ability to fight back against the deadly enemy in the game, but to no avail.\n\nThe only enemy in this game is the Cat Flap. It is a dangerous adversary. If you encounter it on a door, you will not be able to let yourself in. This is where the "Yarn" mechanic comes in.\n\nIf you use the Yarn to trigger a mechanism used to open the Cat Flap, it will be defeated, giving you entry. This is where the game gets really deep. The next level, you are on the other side of the door again, and will have to find a way to open the Cat Flap again.\n\nMy theory for this is that the Cat is in a permanent coma, caused by an accident involving a particularly deadly Cat Flap. The Cat then associated the Cat Flap as the adversary, and itself as the Hero. In it's coma, it is in a situation in which it must triumph over the deadly Cat Flap constantly. Whenever he triumphs, however, he is brought back to the beginning. This represents how the Cat Flap will never be defeated. It is a neverending cycle, and the death of the Cat is the only escape. The Cat does not have the ability to end it's own life, though. He will never escape. The constant hope of maybe, just maybe being able to escape this purgatory one day is the only thing keeping him going. But he won't. He never will.\n\nAs soon as this finally clicked in my head, I finally realized how much of a masterpiece this game was. A free masterpiece. You can download it right now.\n\nWould you like to experience a deep, terrifying and possibly depressing story about a cat?\n\nGet this game.\n\n","May 2","true","0.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","84","16","19","21","1"

So it becomes more a case of trial and error - you place objects roughly where you think the ball will contact them, then adjust these objects' placements accordingly after you "test out" how the ball will actually fall the first time round. So most of the time you'll require more than 1 try before you can perfect the placement.\n\nEach level has "bonus stars" located around the room, so you approximately know what path you should let the ball take on its way down.\n\nI lasted several levels before I decided to uninstall due to utter tedium.\n\nThe game also keeps bugging you to "buy stuff" for your kitty from the shop, which I found a tad annoying.","March 25","false","0.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It took on the approch to be a crazy machine game but failed to do so and is really dull. The hints in the game aren't hints, this old lady comes along and solves the puzzle and the microtransactions are really poor. you can pay upto $20 I belive to add some sunglasses or something to that little cat which you see the side of so you can barely see the clothing on it which walks across the screen slower then someone with no legs and attempts to climb into this basket. The diffucutly isn't really there. I find i restart once or twice before solving the puzzle but crazy machines on other hand has a nice diffuculty level that isn't to easy nor very hard. another thing that annoys me is when you finish 5 levels you go up a floor, you see two floors at once but instead of a nice scrolling effect to go up 1 floor it goes there immedently and i find going to a level 5 levels ahead where im at and i get confused. even better, later on you have to use the stars you get for completing a level earlier on and spend them to unlock more, i understand if it was a requirement to have minimun of said stars but to take them away, this means if you're to intrested putting hats on your cat likes its TF2 your screwed.\n\nIf you want to play a 2D puzzle game like this, pick up crazy machines its cheap and a lot more fun.","August 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 48 of 87 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","48","87","6","1"

The objective of the game being to let your little bundle of satanic creation through the door by solving physics based puzzles where occasionally the physics are quite questionable. You have a limited number of items to solve each puzzle with unless you fork out real money to have unlimited items in that one stage. The puzzles are easy enough for the most part unless you can't think higher than on a 5th grade level ( I know I can't ). But short and sweet it's a simple puzzle game through and through and it's obvious that it was meant to be on a mobile platform IE all the micro-transactions. All this aside the game is decent at time wasting in short bursts the game itself is really nothing to write hom about with it's medicre modeling and somewhat muddy looking graphics. Otherwise for free it's worth looking at. I can say 2 good things about this game. It has a fantastic trailer and I can really appreciate that they donate a portion of each purchase to animal shelters. 6/10 Not bad but if you want to donate you can donate the full dollar amount to a local shelter or simply find a site online.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/369400/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","It's the age-old story we're all so familiar with. A little kitty has gone out for a night on the lash with its mates, gotten absolutely f*cking slaughtered, against all odds, has somehow managed to stumble its way back home again in one piece, but wouldn't you know it, has only gone and forgotten their keys and locked themselves out. Euurrrgh, classic kitty! It's a good job you're still at home inside, then, and are able to set up an elaborate array of contraptions that will eventually open the door for our sh*t-faced feline and let it sleep off its inevitable hangover!\n\nLet the Cat in is a single screen, free-to-play puzzle game where a cat waits outside a door that's connected to a series of levers or pulleys that a ball must make contact with to activate and open. In each stage, the ball (or sometimes several) begins suspended in the air and the game paused. Given a limited, pre-set selection of items, you must place and position these items to allow the ball to get from its starting point to the handle that will then open the door, interacting with any objects it needs to or collecting the optional three stars along the way. Unpause the game and let the ball do its thing, hoping that you've placed everything for it to hit all its targets. If you haven't, simply pause/reset it again and tweak the positions of your placements until you've found the right ones, then do it all again in the next stage.\n\nThere's a nice choice of different objects to play around with, from basic ramps or simple books to knock over or additional, bigger balls to hit multiple targets, to slightly more adventurous items like springs or conveyor belts. When I first looked at the game on the Store page I was a little worried that the wealth of choice and freedom to place anything wherever you wanted would be overwhelming. That, when given so many options, you really wouldn't be able to choose any and would be left scratching your head wondering what to do with everything and where it should go. But, thankfully, between the limited number of items you're given for each puzzle, and the already laid out, fixed starting structures in every stage, it's set up in such a way that you'll at least have some vague direction of what to do in most levels, and the real challenge will be finessing the precise placement to make the ball go exactly where you want it to. It also helps that there are multiple ways to complete most stages, and in many cases, if you're crafty (or lucky) enough it's possible to do it using only a single item.\n\nThe three stars you can collect in every stage act as the game's currency which can be used to purchase hints. Well, I say hints, it actually auto places all the objects so all you have to do is unpause and watch the puzzle play itself. Or if that's too cheap for your liking, you can always use them to buy extra items to merely make things a little easier on yourself. Or better yet, if you just really like cats, they can be used to unlock more, as well as some snazzy little clothing accessories for them. As well as collecting stars in-game, you can also purchase them with real money (some of the proceeds of which apparently go to charity), but unless you're really bad at the game, or really intent on making those kitties look fab-u-lous, I always found the case to be that I had an abundance of them and never had to pay a single penny to complete the game. Well, sort of complete it.\n\nAs it stands right now at time of writing, the game hasn't been updated in almost six months, and the promised additional puzzles have yet to materialise and the developers nowhere to be seen either here or on its App Store page where it's also available. There could be many perfectly good reasons why the developer hasn't been able to get around to working on it in a while, but until proven otherwise, you should probably consider the game to be abandoned for now and impossible for achievement hunters to legitimately complete as a result. For everyone else, they probably won't care and will be happy with the 143 stages that are available and the many free hours of play they'll be able to get out of it.\n\n[For a third time now Steam has decided it won't publish a review to includea paragraph.

You can use 5 stars to get a hint as they call it but, it will put down all the objects that be able to get the 3 stars you can get in the maps/doors. In total there are You can also get passed some of the maps with only 1 object used and it will give you some achievements by doing this. There are 21 achievements in this game and their not too hard to get, most of them atleast. You can get more points with a better solution. There are 160 ingame door but, the 140 to 160 doors are not opend at the time of this review.

However, due to developers who have not updated this game in half a year (last update September 2015), the game cannot be 100%'d at this point in time.\n\nThis game is similar to Bad Ratz (which I have not played, but have seen gameplay of)....nearly identical as a matter of fact.  It's essentially a PG-13  version of Bad Rats, only without the violence and obvious PETA complaints.  Graphics seem better too.   Anyone who reviewed this game as "Bad Cats" is pretty much right.\n\nPROS:\nFree\nAchievements\nFree daily stars for cosmetics\n15% of all proceeds you pay go to cat shelter organizations.\nEasy to pick up and play\nMeme-worthy trailer with a singing grandma with a CG cat\n\nCONS:\nDevs abandoned this game, so it cannot be 100%'d\nYou have to wait 30 minutes for each new hint for a level (Free hint every 30 minutes)\n"Grandma" pesters you if you take too many tries, basically telling you to pay 5 stars for a hint (You can ignore her, but it does get annoying)\n\nA decent casual game with some achievements you can take away from it.  But it's not complete.  It's unknown if devs will come back to it.  As of right now, it seems to be one of many abandoned titles on Steam.\n\n\n7/10  Bad Rats, but free....and more aesthetically pleasing.","February 18","true","17.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

This game features a very in depth storyline, one more advanced than Skyrim. With approximately 160 high intensity missions about a woman too lazy to open the door, yet is able to build a Rube Goldberg machine. The cat customisation is more in depth than that of Need For Speed 2015. Would definitely put this game up there with the ratings of Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto V. 10 out of 10. Would build a machine more complex than the TARDIS itself to let a cat inside the house.","March 26","true","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I saw the scratches and paintings of cats on the wall. An assortment of random broken shelves with a green yarn ball on one. She told me to build more shelves into certain places, so I did.\n\nSuddenly, I heard scratches on the door. The scratches would grow louder, and this little animals' yell. The door was locked, what is this lady gonna do? In a moment of many thoughts running through my head, the yarn ball rolled down the shelves and turned a switch to open the door.\n\nA little tuxedo cat walked in, all innocent. I went into another room, only it being the same room I was in a moment ago. The scratches grew loud on the door again, so I did the same. The cat walked in, and started speaking in its devilish voice.\n\nIt forced me to take a picture of it, and I had to purchase a bow tie for it. It wanted to be shown as "Cute" and that's why I had to take that photograph.\n\nEvery room I went, I was back where I previously was, the cat was wanting all sorts of hats and other accesories. I kept having to go to the shop to get what it wants, but it kept wishing for more! I couldn't take it, I ran, got in my car and didn't look back.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AvidLebon/recommended/369400/","AvidLebon","AvidLebon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AvidLebon/","60 products in account","This game loads halfway off the screen at a resolution WAY too big for my laptop screen. There is no option to change the game resolution, which is pretty much a basic assumed standard for any game: not having it is very poor design and will severely limit the game's audience.  I can't see all of the screen to see what buttons are on the bottom or side edge that isn't on the screen. This makes the game nearly unplayable- I don't even know what additional buttons are at the bottom of the screen, and looks awful.\n\nMicrotransactions I've seen so far include the ability to purchase more shelves (you get 3 per level I believe), unlocking levels, and purchasing outfits and friends for your cat. I THOUGHT I purchased a second animal but I have no idea how to access it. The cat itself is kind of annoying because it won't stop making noises, it sounds like someone in the room has a stuffy nose and keeps snorting their mucus non-stop over and over again-that in and of itself is kind of nausiating and I really don't want to play this game anymore :[. The old lady won't stop acting like a shoulder surfing friend that keeps wanting to solve the puzzle for you- a better script would be to show her offering a solution once and then you know you've got the option and after it plays once NEVER AGAIN- unless this game is made for goldfish. This may actually be a game for goldfish. Having her pop up every 30 seconds is aggrivating! At least if you go to the options you can turn off the sound effects.\n\n\nYou've got nothing to lose by downloading it than a temporary bit of hard drive space, perhaps your screen will match up to the default this game is set at.","November 18, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely not true-to-life.\n-Not many options (music on/off, sound on/off, no video options other than high/medium/low)\n\nFun, pretty well designed, just not for me.

This is a meditation on the ennui of an elderly woman driven mad by grief and loneliness.\n\nDay after day of letting the cat in and out of the house, she passes the time trying despretly to save the landscapes of her mind by building little puzzles to solve.  A book shelf here, some twine and pullies there.  Who's to say she can't?  No one visits her and so no one can see.\n\nYou're able to buy other cats, but never at the same time.  You can dress the cats with stars you either win or buy via micro-payment.  See, after enough time, the old woman forgets what her cat even looks like.  Its personality may change like it's clothes and the weather, but it still wants in and Grandma needs new ways to keep from going mad.\n\nThe number of levels is many, growing upwards and upwards.  She only bought a two story house.  Why are there so many floors?  Is the house building itself?  Are the puzzles building themselves?  So many stairs, thinks the old woman.  My hip could never take that many stairs.\n\nSo, in summery, this isn't just another clone of the incredible machine.  This is a masterpiece of psychological expression.  Maybe, one day at the top of the tower, you might save this poor old woman from the labyrinth of her mind.\n\nOr get lost yourself.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA!  10/10","September 28, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Watch out, the old lady will regularly give you the passive-aggressive "hint" in her sometimes a little broken English. She also talks about her grandson and other people that we never actually see. I'm pretty sure she's senile, which would explain why she spends her day locking out her only friend, the cat, with ridiculously complex, home-alone-style contraptions and then calling you to fix them.\nThe cat itself is not much better: spoiled, constantly asking you to buy expensive things, and just endlessly vain, but what else do you expect from a cat. I'm pretty sure it's a metaphor for modern man's endless, yet ultimately fruitless endeavor to find satisfaction in acquiring more and more materialistic goods. You know, no matter how many bow ties and angel wings you buy, in the end, you always get locked out from that cushy basket.\nIt's a great game if you ironically like cute kitten themed games... or if you just really, really like cats.\n","October 1, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raindancer/recommended/369400/","raindancer","RainDancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raindancer/","213 products in account","Cute and fun little puzzle game. You are helping a...apparently rather creative and eccentric older lady let her cat in, but seemingly just walking over and opening the darn door (or changing the catflap to one the cat can actually open)is just way too conventional and normal for her, and so you have to set up objects in order to cause a series of chain reactions in various elaborate contraptions she has set up in order to open a catflap which seemingly will not open otherwise in order to let the kitty into the house.\n\nThe graphics are bright and cute, the puzzles vary in difficulty but solvable without being frustrating (at least as far as I've progressed) the music is cheerful and fitting ,and its completely free unless you choose to spend money in game (and 15% of all/any proceeds go to a cat rescue so the game is helping to save real cats )\n\nOnly a couple of minor gripes spring to mind..\n1. Probably me being silly but where the heck is the quit option? So far I return to main menu , hit the windows icon on my keyboard and close the window, which seems to work fine but that can't be how you're supposed to exit the game.\n2. A hint system should really just give hints, not automatically solve the puzzle for you.\n\nThis is probably a game better dipped in and out of and played in short bursts, but all in all this is a fun little puzzle game and if you like the genre (and cats!) I would happily recommend giving it a try :)\n\n","September 5, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a casual game that doesn't try to be competitive.\n\nPROs\n+Game is pretty much freeware. Purchases are mostly cosmetic, and most people won't ever need to buy extra hints considering how many free ones the game gives you.\n+It's a solid and enjoyable "The Amazing machine" Clone.\n*Note that the above two pros are the main reason I am giving this a positive review, as this game is essentially a free TAA which makes it worth the download and try just for that alone.\n+You get stars ( In game currency ) for free just by collecting them in game, which means you could even grind it out and get the cosmetics for free. Overall very generous business model.\n+There are more than one ways to solve many of the puzzles, with extra score given to you if you manage to figure out ways to beat a level without using all the items it gives you. This is the correct way a TAA clone should be as it encourages the player to find their own way as opposed to just the developers way. This also adds replay value as you can try to go back and see if you can beat the level again using a more efficient method for a higher score.\n+Can be enjoyed within relatively short time\n+Part of profits are donated to helping homeless cats. Some people may decry this as trying to take advantage of cat lovers, but when you consider that this games business model is already a great deal that's probably not the case.\n+Visuals and sound manage to be charming despite being low end\n+Small download size\n+Hats\n\nCONs\n-It's a mobile port and doesn't try to hide it. The game even advertises to you that you can also get it on your iPad with the app store. Pfffft.\n-Why no Android?\n-Being a mobile port also means low end 6th/5th generation gaming standards. The game seriously looks like it could be a minigame for the original PS2 Kingdom Hearts. Graphics are color map only, no specular lighting, minimal variety to sound effects, etc. The whole game could have been made in the late 90's and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.\n-Using a hint is pretty much just skipping the level.\n-A huge part of your score is really just a random bonus you have no control over. Some people may not mind it, but it can be a little silly at times if you are trying to place on the leaderboards.\n-Hats\n\nOverall 8/10 - a fun little game to play when you only have 10-15 minutes to spare.","August 29, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't really care for cats, though I had someone who does see, and they love the game.\n\nOverall, not my taste in puzzles. A little too easy, and luck based to figure it out. And some of them, you have to angle it just right to get all of the stars.\n\nTo be honest, if there was only one thing that I would change. It would be the cat walking speed, and maybe just do a quick finish.

This is a meditation on the ennui of an elderly woman driven mad by grief and loneliness.\n\nDay after day of letting the cat in and out of the house, she passes the time trying despretly to save the landscapes of her mind by building little puzzles to solve.  A book shelf here, some twine and pullies there.  Who's to say she can't?  No one visits her and so no one can see.\n\nYou're able to buy other cats, but never at the same time.  You can dress the cats with stars you either win or buy via micro-payment.  See, after enough time, the old woman forgets what her cat even looks like.  Its personality may change like it's clothes and the weather, but it still wants in and Grandma needs new ways to keep from going mad.\n\nThe number of levels is many, growing upwards and upwards.  She only bought a two story house.  Why are there so many floors?  Is the house building itself?  Are the puzzles building themselves?  So many stairs, thinks the old woman.  My hip could never take that many stairs.\n\nSo, in summery, this isn't just another clone of the incredible machine.  This is a masterpiece of psychological expression.  Maybe, one day at the top of the tower, you might save this poor old woman from the labyrinth of her mind.\n\nOr get lost yourself.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA!  10/10","September 28, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a meditation on the ennui of an elderly woman driven mad by grief and loneliness.\n\nDay after day of letting the cat in and out of the house, she passes the time trying despretly to save the landscapes of her mind by building little puzzles to solve.  A book shelf here, some twine and pullies there.  Who's to say she can't?  No one visits her and so no one can see.\n\nYou're able to buy other cats, but never at the same time.  You can dress the cats with stars you either win or buy via micro-payment.  See, after enough time, the old woman forgets what her cat even looks like.  Its personality may change like it's clothes and the weather, but it still wants in and Grandma needs new ways to keep from going mad.\n\nThe number of levels is many, growing upwards and upwards.  She only bought a two story house.  Why are there so many floors?  Is the house building itself?  Are the puzzles building themselves?  So many stairs, thinks the old woman.  My hip could never take that many stairs.\n\nSo, in summery, this isn't just another clone of the incredible machine.  This is a masterpiece of psychological expression.  Maybe, one day at the top of the tower, you might save this poor old woman from the labyrinth of her mind.\n\nOr get lost yourself.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA!  10/10","September 28, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I especially like the 3D models used.\n\n- Some players have huge scores on the leader boards because they had the patiens to go through 20-30 levels.\n\n- Lots and lots of levels.\n\n- There is a storm outside the window when you enter the main menu screen.\n\n- Strategic game.\n\n- People vote for the most stupid games that are on steam green light.\n\n- This game is not stupid.\n\nI recommend this game to those who love kitties and love strategey. All though I do not recommend to those with low patiens, for their sake to not get frustrated like me.\n\n\n10/10 I would try to test my nerves when I'm bored.","March 8","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wait. scratch that. It's actually the greatest thing that mankind has ever created, period. Never before has a game mixed a nuanced story, complex characters, spectacular gameplay and awe-inspiring graphics in such an amazing fashion before.  The graphics in particular are so good that they sometimes cause the frame rate to drop, thanks to their overwhelming brilliance. Not that this is a bad thing- this simply gives you more time to admire this magnum opus in utter awe and joy. Not to mention that this game provides a fascinating insight into topics such as the human spirit and conciousness, morality, discrimination, credibility and existence itself. It truly saddens me that there are some critics who deny this game's brilliance, but the truth remains: 'Let The Cat In' is an absolute masterpiece, that will indisputably be glorified by future generations until the end of time. It's  up there with other classics such as 'The Slaughtering Grounds' and 'Air Control'. This game gets a 40,000,000,000,000/10 from me. Cat is love.

I don't really care for cats, though I had someone who does see, and they love the game.\n\nOverall, not my taste in puzzles. A little too easy, and luck based to figure it out. And some of them, you have to angle it just right to get all of the stars.\n\nTo be honest, if there was only one thing that I would change. It would be the cat walking speed, and maybe just do a quick finish. And if I had to say there is a game already like this, I'd call it cut the rope","January 5","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good to waste some time in the main mode, but I honestly had more fun just messing with my cat. If puzzle games are your kind of thing, go for it. It's adorable, got fairly good levels, and it has KITTENS. FREAKING KITTENS. I'll probably keep this in my library if I ever get bored, but in all honesty it's not that good.","April 8","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
