Extensive control issues, numerous bugs, and horrible optimization make this a buggy unplayble mess.\n\nRuns at 30fps on my GTX980 and it's not because the framerate is locked - I mean it seems like it's locked at 60 but that's not the point - it just runs like ♥♥♥.\n\nIt looks polished but it doesn't PLAY polished and none are more frustrated than me that that's the case.\n\nA lot of ♥♥♥♥ has been made about the price point - I don't really mind since farming games like this has always been an EXTREMELY small niche and someones gotta get paid.... but the game needs work.... lots of work.\n\nIf they can get the game running at a decent level I'll change my recommendation but as it is I cant recommend it because I don't want to play it in its current state.","November 23, 2015","false","6.1"," 172 of 191 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","172","191","2","7"

The game we've all been waiting for. I found myself waking up, watering plants, then going to sleep until the next day, rinse and repeat. There's really nothing else to it than that, sure you can go mining (the levels on the mine repeat themselves occasionally, including all the crap you left on the floor) but you cant use the ores to make anything like in HM games, you just sell them for next to nothing, better off spending money farming. Animals are broken, you can buy a chicken, and yes it will eventually lay eggs after it's happy, but you can't incubate the eggs, they disappear the next day, so if you want multiple chickens you have to keep buying more, which is against the point to begin with, you would never see your money back from that.\n\nCows are useless, by the time I got the money to buy one it wouldn't give me milk, even after getting its happiness up to a certain point there was still nothing. On the last day of episode one some of your animals just randomly go missing (it even says at the top of the screen, as if it's some sort of story plot) but you never see them again, its never mentioned again, your animals are just gone.\n\nThe story is what kept me playing, I love story driven games, it allowed me to struggle my way past the insane amount of incomplete, and honestly I like the story, when I was at work I would keep thinking to myself "man I wonder what will happen next" and I wasn't disappointed, however a game that plays similar to HM you don't expect an ominous "TO BE CONTINUED" in your face after you begin Fall, it's just ridiculous.\n\nAs much as I played this game, and as much as I'd love to play the rest, in it's current position it is just not worth it, let alone worth the DLC. The problem is that I haven't seen much progression in this game for the past 2 years that i've watched it. I no longer see any game breaking bugs, sure some bugs that require you to save and restart, but nothing that kills your save files anymore, at least that hurdle was jumped over.\n\nUltimately I highly suggest saving your money for now, it's not worth it and you WILL be disappointed.","December 28, 2015","false","37.0"," 76 of 85 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","76","85","5","1"

I don't usually write reviews, but I'm writing this hoping that it will help someone else out.\nThe game design overall for Wild Season is fantastic...feels just like a mobile Harvest Moon game.\nJust that overall could sell me. I bought the game and immediately regretted it. (Or at least within the hour)\nWithin 24 hours I had refunded the game.\nI understand it is in Alpha (SINCE APRIL 2015 MAY I ADD) so it became very clear to me that "What you see is what you get" with this game. I would play an entire day, struggle to get the game to actually save, and then when my character finally went to sleep...I would wake up the following day and the day would repeat...everything I had done was erased.\nRandom lag in areas...unclear goals. Delay lag.\nOverall I give it 2/5 Stars. Dissapointed. Hope this helps you make up your mind as to purchasing this game or not.\n\nTLDR; The game idea is great, but the game itself lags too frequently..causing data to sometimes not save.

I can even accept that no one is ever where they are suppose to be (I'm talking to you store owners... 9-5 means 9-5 not 10 and only 10... maybe but fridays only... one day a month) but do the towns folk really have to treat the player like absolute garbage?

I've played every Harvest Moon since the first and I've been waiting a long time for someone to bring something similar to PC and when I saw it happening by fans of the original Harvest moons I was more than excited.\n\nI first tried the game in Alpha stage when it was pretty much unplayable, but the involvement from the developers kept me interested so periodically I would drop back in and try it out over and over but that seems to be my problem. If you were to ask me how the game has advanced since Alpha I couldn't tell you. The controls are unbearable, and I mean to the point you want to pull your hair out. Figuring out which button does what will put you in the mood to rage and that's before you even get into the gameplay. (It seems on the last update they've informed us they have hired two new members of the team to sort these control issues out so hopefully this could be changing in the near future)\nOnce I managed to work out the controls well enough to input my name and such I was forced to watch the unskippable prologue bit before being led to my farm. Then the game crashed.\nLoaded it up again, and the game crashed on the menu screen. Now I've found crashing to be a frequent problem for this game which is expected in early access, but not being able to skip the start up dialogue makes it really, really unappealing for me. Now when it crashes before I've had the chance to save it I don't even bother trying again.\nNow I'm sure the actual gameplay is great, following the blogs and podcasts you can see how much effort the developers are putting into it. There are tonnes of villagers, crops, animals and what seems to be a great (and mysterious) story but I can't see myself ever loving the game.\n\nI think what I found appealing about Harvest Moon and similar games was the simplicity. Though the tasks could be seen as repetitive for boring the game kept you playing. This game seems to lack that charm.\nThere are too many small bothersome things that bug me as I play. Having to constantly hold a button to run, not being able to change direction when running without first stopping, animations that seem to go on far too long, unfriendly villagers and the lack of overall polish in the game all put me off.\nMy biggest problem is the game feels like it's made by an amateur indie studio. I'm sure there are loads of people out there who love this game, I'm just not one of them. For me the game doesn't feel like it's in Beta which makes me a little worried for the final state BUT I will be keeping my eye on it and I don't see it as a wasted investment because I know one day when it's released I will give it another try.\n\nI finally see why the developer of Stardew Valley has waiting so long to release his game. I think games like this need to be played in their full state or not at all and despite the fact there are a tonne of good reviews I honestly think if the game was as good as those people were saying they would have clocked in far more than 1-2 hours. I play Harvest Moon for 3-4 hours at a single time.\n\nMaybe by release Wild Season will be worth the money but right now, I'd advise you to hold onto your money and wait until it's out of development.","May 18, 2015","false","1.1"," 79 of 123 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","79","123","2","0"

When this game came out in alpha I expected there to be bugs, what I didn't expect was a game so buggy that you couldn't play it, developers telling you that the game works if you played it in quick play mode and having issues that made it so that I could play further into the game in the demo than the version I had payed for.\n\nWith the official release I expected there to be significant refinement and to finally be able to play the game I had payed for. Sadly, the game still runs slow, and feels patched together, as though some areas have been spruced up and others haven't. In other words this game now feels like an alpha release. The game that was released as an alpha release should have just been given for free, as it was unplayable. I have lost all respect for this game and the developers, who when explaining their choice to make it episodic suddenly, kept referring to the fact that they need more money. I felt like this was a punch in the face when I had already payed them and had been given an unplayable game that has only just now been elevated to the point where I could call it a buggy alpha that needs testing.

At its current state, the game is pretty buggy and needs a lot of fine-tuning. Currently the gameplay and controls are a bit frustrating. This game is a farming life sim, yet I found it difficult to work on my farm for extended periods of time because of how slow it took for my character to perform actions. Sometimes it took more than a couple of seconds for my character to pick up weeds or crops and then put them away in my bag. Even working on a 3x3 plot is time-staking. This is a shame because I was looking more forward to the farming-sim aspect of the game than the RPG/ Visual Novel aspect of the game.\n\nThe controls also need to be better mapped AND/OR better noted ingame. WASD for movement was fairly easy to figure out but J K L for actions was not as obvious. This should have been told from the beginning, not an hour into the game.\n\nThere are also a lot of immoveable cutscenes from the very start. I understand this is also a visual novel and an RPG so there are bound to be many cutscenes to move along the story, However I wish the game wouldn't heavily depend on cutscenes to progress. Even just letting me open the door myself when someone knocks on my house door, or entering a store and walking towards the NPCs myself would be better than waiting constantly for the cutscenes to end and for me to finally do something and move around. All the cutscenes made me feel very constrained and I would have liked the option to meet the characters at my own pace.\n\nOne thing I really like about the game is the story and characters. I'd certainly like to know why the townpeoples are acting so xenophobic and what my farm has to do with anything. Some of the characters are very charming and interesting. Your task is not just maintaining your farm; it also includes building platonic or romantic relationships with your neighbors. But once again while I'd love to explore more into the story's lore and story, the poor controls make it difficult for me to play for a long period of time.\n\nI like the concept of this game, and personally I think this game would be a lot more enjoyable if the developers fixed the controls. However this game needs a lot of work. At the current stage of development, I cannot find myself recommending this game.","November 5, 2015","false","1.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

I had no clue what to do at first until I left the room you start in and then I met a guy called Frank who led me through a farming tutorial. After I planted some seeds and watered them I didn't really know what to do. I met a woman who asked me to leave town and then the game suggested I go to bed. The next day I still didn't know what to do...\n\nYou can wander around the world much like an RPGMaker game. It seems somewhat open world and you can go and talk to people around town. There's a LOT of dialog - perhaps a bit much. Lots of clicking to read it all and you can't skip it. I got kinda bored.\n\nThe interface is somewhat clunky. It appears to be keyboard controlled and there are a few action keys but it doesn't say what they are for so there's some trial and error. One annoying thing is that when planting and watering crops you have to position yourself very precisely in order to tend the farm tiles you want.\n\nI'm sure there's a lot more depth to this game further in but it didn't hold my attention long enough to continue.","November 5, 2015","false","1.3"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","21","30","2","0"

It does have an interesting story, and it really caught my attention, but to be honest, do not buy it. Let me list why:\n\n1. Millions of bugs. This game is so full of bugs you would think they were a rotting corpse full of maggots. From NPCs walking through walls to text jumps to invisibile objects, even missing textures.\n2. The game ends in the middle of Fall. Spoilers. You have two seasons to play, both of which are extremely boring. There is no building expansion, nothing to use building materials on, and nothing to buy other than more seeds. I spent the last 10 days in the episode sleeping, not even going outside.\n3. Everything is glitchy. The main menu, the in game menus, the lag of the keyboard input and mouse input.\n4. The developers act like they don't really care that they sold a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game. "We will be focusing on episode 2". How about you refund episode 1, fix the ♥♥♥♥ing thing, then worry about episode 2.\n5. No use for ores, enjoy your base level tools until future episodes, at which point they will glitch into a giant dong and go straight into your ♥♥♥.\n\nSeriously, do not waste your money. Get stardew valley, a game made a single person that is infinately better than this. Literally the only thing this game has going for it is the story arc. You'll even save a dollar by buying stardew.\n\nI will not be buying any other games from this developer until they stop reading from EA's playbook.\n\nUPDATE: I have since requested a steam refund on the basis of an incomplete game post 1.0 release and developers not supporting the unfinished product.","March 20","false","11.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The new update didn't really change the quality of gameplay due to the new bugs. They're still asking for 20$ for two seasons worth of gameplay, when you can't even continue at the end of episode 1 without paying for more of the game.

Yes, this game is still in early access and it shows. There were a few things that I came across which I believe need to be fixed before I can fully enjoy this game.  To name a few issues , the frame rate, the characters skip around the screen with movements like a bad horror movie. There also seems to be quest updates and completions of the same thing repeatedly. One of the major issues I had was the lack of instruction or misdirection (the mayor tells you to go south east when you're meant to go south west). I didn’t know how to save my progress after putting in over an hour into the game and when it came around to planting my seeds I couldn’t get around to doing just that. I couldn’t find help in game and online has yet to post any useful information. But put a side the pixilated opening animation and misdirection of the characters and you have what will eventually be a great game. I can see this being one of those games people call a hidden gem. The story actually kept me in the game to see what was going on with the farm and why people wanted my character to leave. The music and art was good for this particular game. Of course I have to add that the game being made with Unity was a good choice. Simply because I have played plenty of games and every game made with Unity worked perfectly. As far as not crashing, freezing or not running the game at all. But to put in my two cents , Wild Seasons  is definitely worth buying , just wait until after early access.

I originally had mixed feelings about this game, believing it to be another run-of-the-mill RPG Maker game using a new Unity skin. However, this game sets itself apart with Harvest Moon-like gameplay elements providing a breath of fresh air in a sea of stale indie games. Be aware that this review is based off of an early access product.\n\nThe story is about a young up-and-comer who recieves a "new" farm in a colorful community. What begins as farming sim slowly introduces scents of mystery as the entire town seems to want you gone. Not if you have anything to say about it....\n\n==== Current State of the Game ====Although Wild Season shows great promise and interesting gameplay mechanics, it is still full of minor bugs and absent of many fairly basic game options. Below is a list of noticeable bugs (none that are game-breaking) and important suggestions.\n\nBugs: Mary is shown to be stuck in a visual loop going into the door next to the bar, inside of the inn. The same loop happens to Barry when he appears. The loop breaks after some dialogue\n"Esc" does not consistently bring up the primary game menu\nSame visual loop as described above occurs to the mayor when entering the clinic\nController does not work when keyboard is shown to choose a name\nController won't highlight a save slot unless mouse hovers over it first\nSuggestions: In the inventory menu screen, visually show the active tab for controller users\nInclude an explanation of the save feature\nHighlight the icons (even without an item equipped) when scrolling through the toolbar using a controller\nAllow a controller to scroll up and down through the Notebook\nAdd a Quit or Save & Quit feature to the Bed menu\nEnsure that there won't be any possibilities of corrupt save files or save discontinuities (stated outright in the beginning of the game)\nImplement Steam Cloud if saving may be problematic\nStore the save file in a common location as many other games for personal backups\n==== Early Access ====For those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present and game mechanics to be missing. With that in mind, I would not recommend purchasing the game at this point in time unless you are able to tolerate minor bugs and an unfinished, yet growing story. However, if you do purchase this game, you will be given a chance to help the developers shape the future of Wild Season.

It is not bad enough to give it a thumbs down but has too many bugs / incomplete features to give it a thumbs up.\nSo, maybe consider buying this ONLY IF you want to play this game while it is in development AND IF you can get it during a sale.\n\n+ Nice and cute JRPG style graphics\n+ Day and night transition.\n+ There *seemed* to be plenty to do (though I didn't get to do much during my playthrough).\n+ A lot of NPCs, which hopefully will be woven into the story.\n+ Interesting storyline (for me, this is the main selling point).\n+ Dialogues with NPCs add to the suspense.\n+ Relaxing background music\n\n- Buggy. Eg. Invisible characters with dialogues.\n- Sometimes 'Esc' doesn't bring up the menu. Had to Alt-F4 to quit.\n- Weird one: I cannot get the character to go to sleep? None of my action keys worked.\n- Keystrokes sometimes do not register.\n- Non-intuitive controls. Should make use of LMB and RMB.\n- Unclear about save function. Does it auto-save? If not, where is the manual save button? Though to be fair, my game resumed from where it left off when I last quit.\n- No clear quests outline (so I just wandered around town).\n- Very pricey at $30 base price. Especially IF the devs decide to increase the price of the final product.\n\nThe game is still in EA so I understand it's a work in progress and taking this into consideration, I won't give it a thumbs down. I think it has potential to be good game if and when the bugs are fixed.\n\nHowever, I can only recommend it if you can get it at a discounted price ($30 base price at time of writing) because I don't think the gameplay can justify the price tag.\n\nMy Rating: 5/10","November 4, 2015","true","1.9"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","32","53","2","0"

After spending more time with this game, and figuring out a few stuffs, including how the save system works I’ve decided to revise my review, and hopefully this will correct my previous mistakes.\n\nPlot  – The story starts slow, it does take time before you see how it unfolds. The first part is quite too long for an introduction, you’ll be reading many dialogue lines before you could get your hands on the game and start playing. You can see notification on the right that you have completed a quest, but there is no actual UI that shows what your quest was or what your current one is. But there is a journal that shows your progress instead. So far as I’ve noticed, there is an event or happening at least once each day. So other than taking care of your farm, you’ll have something to look forward to the next day.\n\nThere are times that the people you have met in town before, will no longer remember you once you talked to them again, therefore resetting the conversation.\n\nGraphics and Sounds  - The game was made in Unity, and so far it isn't that heavy in terms of graphics. My laptop can handle the game, but there are some noticeable lags and fps drops at some points of the game. Graphical errors also appear during conversations, i.e. an NPC goes through a wall or an NPC cannot be seen physically but they do have a dialogue. I’m not sure if it’s intentional that you can go through the NPCs, but it does take time trying to chase the NPC you’re trying to talk to. There are also invisible blocks that don’t let you pass through on the edges near the exit of the map. B\n\nThe game starts with a nostalgic soundtrack, for me it reminds me of the game I used to play on my GBA. It is a nice addition that a different soundtrack plays on different areas, but other than that, I suggest that they add an ambient sound as that would make players more comfortable rather than just having a music playing over and over again.\n\nEnvironment and Design  – The game may look like a mobile game, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad one. The areas are well designed, enough clutter so that it doesn’t feel flat or too boring in the eyes. Probably one way to improve this, is allow the players to inspect the objects in front of them and maybe just show a dialogue or description about that specific object.\n\nOn the world map, I think there should be a label to see what area that is. And maybe add some signs on how to get there, because I personally had a hard time going to the port. I didn’t know that there is a passage on the east side of the town.  But other than that, I think the areas are placed ideally.\n\nGameplay  – It’s the game that I’ve been wanting to have on Steam, a casual game that allows you to manage a farm where you can grow some crops, take care of farm animals, do fishing, and as well as mining. And then it also comes with a story, where you get to meet the people who live nearby and participate in different yearly events.\n\nControls  – The control option states the action keys, but it does not tell what it exactly does in-game. At first, you’ll probably press all keys to figure out its function.  The game also has a delay on registering the keys you’ve pressed, specifically on menus and when doing tasks on your farm i.e. tilling, watering, harvesting, picking up, etc. And with the gameplay this game offers, it is probably the best to play this game using a controller.\n\nConclusion  – Sure, this game has its downs but nonetheless it is still a great game. Besides the game is still in Early Access, and so far, the developer has been very active on the discussion boards. Even if you’re not amused of how the game looks right now, I hope you stay tuned and be updated with upcoming changes.\n\nAnd for me, a few polishes and fixes this can turn out a very great game.","November 4, 2015","true","6.2"," 31 of 52 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","31","52","2","0"

I must admit I was getting a bit bored walking around for an hour meeting characters but nothing happening. It wasn't until about 70 minutes in that the game started warming up and the story started developing. I am intrigued to see where the story goes so I will definitely have another go to see where it heads. The music is quite pleasant and relaxing and the interface is okay once you get used to it. I am a bit of an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ so it would be very welcoming to see some achievements introduced and of course cards will always boost sales and is welcomed.  So Far So good. I think you need a lot of patience with these type of games but if you like farming sims with a lot of character talk (not always meaningful) then this is certainly worth a look. I will update when I play more. I have played a lot more now and I am enjoying it more. The story is developing and my farm is looking a bit more healthier.

I followed up on the forums, gave a bunch of my opinions, reported tons of bugs but after so long I feel I have to give this a negative review (might change in the future).\n\nI got this game because I loved Harvest Moon, as probably most of you interested in this game love too. But hold your horses, this is in my opinion, so far, a backward step comparing to HM and the future doesn't look so bright for Wild Season as months since this was released as an Early Access it is still completely unplayable. The developers said even the little story it has in so far will be remade and there isn't anything else to do rather than literaly plant things down.\n\nMonths in so far and the single biggest thing people have been asking nonstop on forums is the controller support as keyboard controls have gone from horrible to bad. Still no controller support...\n\nThere is nothing to do around. HM revolves around exploration of a magical and charming town/surroundings full of mystical surprises that slowly the player gets to know and unlock. Wild Season is a big emptyness with nothing to unlock or do during your days. I know this is an early access, but even as an early access you should have things to do, whats the point of releasing an early access if you're still in early alpha with no real gameplay?\n\nSo basicaly in your very first free day in the game you can explore everything, talk to everyone and still won't even be night time, meaning you will have to go to bed early and all the following days there won't be any point revisiting any of those spots because nothing changes and again, there's literally nothing to do. So you use all your stamina and go rest for the next day.\n\nUpdates are in such a slow pace, that in order to fix a major bug, it takes at least two weeks (probably more) to be fixed.\nThere is a number of annoying little things you can't get around. The game itself seems very unresponsive and slow, hitbox to interact with NPCs is hard to find, so when an NPC is walking around it's almost a challenge to talk to them, can't read most signs, most NPCs are uninteresting and for me it has been more of a drag than a pleasure to play.\n\nSo far, comparing to Harvest Moon, a 1999 game, the only progress I noticed were the graphics (which comes with tons of problems/bugs), in other aspects, from what I experienced, this is a step backward.\n\nThis review might seem harsh, but I feel it's my responsibility to make sure developers think twice before releasing completely unplayable games so that they make some $$ and don't really deliver what was promised. So DON'T buy this game until it's fully functional and playable because there is a huge chance you will be disappointed.","August 15, 2015","false","5.5"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","33","57","0","0"

The graphical presentation is cute enough, but in a more imaginative approach to the genre the backdrop teases a more sinister backbone with its setting and characters.\n\nUnfortunately Wild Season is bedecked with far too many bugs, glitches and control issues to sustain any length of playing time. For those reasons alone, on top of the somewhat demanding fee, Wild Season cannot be recommended.\n\nThe positive, however, is that the developers communicate often with customers: they display tireless dedication with their continuous updates, with many of the player feedback being immediately acknowledged and applied in quick fashion. The overall vision of Wild Season is assuredly fun if the developers can iron out the kinks and continue to work towards filling in the major blanks missing in this early access version.","October 27, 2015","false","6.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

I did like the game, and I left a fairly long and detailed review about what I liked and didn't like, giving the game an over all positive review as an EA game that needed work but had value and promise.\n\nThen they shipped that buggy, content poor beta as the 1.0 final version, AND made the game episodic. These are both terrible ideas, the game is no where near finished and ending a Harvest Moon type game with a cliff hanger is stupid. I updated my review but left it over all positive.\n\nNow they are trying to recruit professional people to submit CV and portfolio to then work for free on things like THE STORY OF THE GAME. They claim they have enough money to finish, but at the same time not enough money to hire the 4-6 people they apparently need to do work they have not done. Which is especially galling because this game was Kickstarted, and raised nearly $50000 two years ago. Lots of those backers never even got Steam keys, by the way.\n\n\nTLDR: the slow development of this game cannot be excused as incompetency, after all these years and repeated schemes I personally believe this product is produced as a deliberate SCAM and that you should AVOID AT ALL COSTS.","January 26","false","5.5"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","20","33","2","0"

There's a rather mysterious story to keep things moving together, which works alright.\nWhile this is not particularly my kind of game, it does it's best to keep you hooked and you can see right away that the developer has put a lot of effort into it.\nIt's still absolutely filled with bugs, but as long as the game stays in early access, I don't think that's something to be upset about.\n\nI kinda liked the art style they are going for. It's somewhat reminiscent of those older flash games you used to play when you were young, with a bit of JRPG anime and portable console nostalgia thrown into the mix.\nMusic sets the mood just fine and the sound effects are on point.\nAnimation quality is somewhat above your standard indie JRPG quality, but nothing to be exited about (bugs really bother here right now).\n\nRight now I've seen quite a few things that definitely need to addressed on the way, and as this kind of games only work with constant playtime and player progression, I can't recommend to throw in your game time hours just yet.\n\nStill, as a whole, I think fans of the genre will be pleased to have this on PC once it's finished and achieves the console-like quality it's clear it's aiming for. It will definitely have it's place at the steam store if it ultimately gets there, so thumbs up for the dev and the hard work that awaits!\n\nFinal veredict: Wait for early access to end if you expect the full experience right from the start.

Glitched animations, misspelled/missing words, and the list goes on. This, however, is an early access title, which makes these issue completely reasonable. The game is generally enjoyable but suffers severely from a lack of of one important feature. There is no option (that I can find) to change the speed of, or skip, the dialogue. This would be much less of an issue if there wasn't such a huge amount of it! So far I know that  all of the townspeople are hiding something  , based on the fact that they talk and talk and TALK while telling me absolutely nothing! For me personally, this means that when the game updates and my save files are broken (which is expected and completely understandable), I most likely will not be playing the game again due to the absurd amount of time it takes to complete the intro/tutorial. The good thing about all of this dialogue is the are that goes with it. Each character has their own portrait with varying expressions based on what is being said, in addition to emote bubbles of characters' heads are they move around int he world.\n\nThe gameplay is enjoyable, and has a very Harvest Moon/ Rune Factory vibe. I look forward to seeing how the skill and combat systems work.\n\n\n\nIn short, this is a fun game with beautiful art, fun gameplay, and a lot of potential, but suffers from a lengthy tutorial that can't be skipped. I would only recommend buying this game if you're willing to take the chance on early access and will enjoy playing the game as it is now.","November 4, 2015","true","1.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zomby2d/recommended/328220/","zomby2d","Zomby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zomby2d/","5114 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWild Season is a story-centric farming simulator with a lot of potential. You just invested all your money into the purchase of a farm which turns out to be not quite what you expected, in a town full of people who clearly do not want you around. You now have to try and restore the farm while figuring out why the community is so hostile towards you.\n\nThe art style is well-done and reminiscent of classic jRPG titles. The sprites and characters are beautifully drawn. The music is nice and suits the game very well. Sound effects are also decent and get the job done.\n\nThere is a good number of NPCs and locations to visit, friends to be made as well as people trying to convince you to leave town.\n\nThe pace of the game is quite slow and while it's okay when working on your farm, people who aren't fans of visual novels will probably be put off by the lengthy dialogues sequences. Between the intro and the tutorial, it will take you over 30 minutes before you can actually start to play on a new game. While it does a good job of setting the back story, this should definitely be reworked to get the player into the game sooner. (You can bypass most of it with the Quick Start menu option, but then you don't get to choose your character's name and characteristics.)\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the game is still in early access and a lot of bugs are currently present in the game as well as large chunks of contents missing. Interactions with other NPCs are limited and they don't remember your past conversations between sessions. There's a lot of features mentioned at some point in the game that don't seem to be implemented yet. Also, saving the game doesn't always seem to work so you need to double check if you don't want to have to revert to the last auto-save. The developers appear to be active and are adding depth to the game and fixing bugs, so it look like it's headed in the right way.\n\nControls currently feel very disconnected. Using the keyboard and mouse doesn't quite feel right, yet when playing with a controller it doesn't feel very responsive. Plus, not everything is currently mapped to the controller so I end up going back and forth between the keyboard and mouse  and the controller. Some actions, like closing an inventory window are mapped to the same button as using the tools, so you often end up spending energy needlessly by swinging your tools around when you simply want to close a dialog.\n\nOverall the game is nice and, with the right tweaking, can really evolve into something worth playing. Right now, I can only recommend this game if you want to support the developer and don't mind playing it in it's unfinished state. The price tag for this game seems quite steep for what you're currently getting and even for the final product, I would expect the sweet spot for a game like this to be around the $20 mark.","November 4, 2015","true","4.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Before I mention anything else, I should say that I like that there is support for same-sex relationships (since I'm not straight.)\n\nGetting used to PC controls was hard at first, and the default controls are a bit inconvenient, but they can be changed, so that's not an issue. But that's not the fault of the developers.\n\nWhile there is still some missing content (for instance, areas of the map that are inaccessible) I expect them to open up in a later update.\n\nTwo things I noticed: After saving and exiting the game, the next time I started it up most of the NPCs had forgotten who I was! I had to reintroduce myself to them. Also, my character (a male) is referred to as a female by some of them (another issue I expect to be fixed in a coming update.)\n\nBesides that, the nostalgia is real. It reminds me of the older HM games (before the focus seemed to shift) which I really, really like. If you're already into these types of games, get it while it's discounted.","November 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

I got my beta copy for review purpose, and went onto my journey of Wild Season.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the concept of Wild Season, it is all about the farm life and having a social and love life next to it. Maintain your land, plant seeds, water your plants and harvest. Trying to earn some money, socialize with the townspeople (and of course potential mates), cook, watch tv, play with the farm animals like chicken, cows and a horse. Or just go on an adventure deep into the woods to find yourself some special herbs, to use for cooking. A recipe for a lot of hours of well spend fun if you ask me.\n\nThe developers express that this is a beta game, so it was to be expected that it is full of bugs. Some of these bugs really make it hard to enjoy this game at the time.

The UI is weird, movements are buggy and sometiems completely unresponsive, you can't do much of anything either. On top of the fact that, if you bought this game during the kickstarter or soon after, you were promsied a full game, not episodes. An episodic farming simulator doesn't even make sense.

I love Harvest Moon, and the idea of Harvest Moon with some lurking, dread secret sounded wonderful to me.\n\nBut part of the charm of games like Harvest Moon is the environment. Simply walking around and enjoying the small town. It needs to be a character, too. And there are some enjoyable visuals in certain areas. But much of the town is blank space, making it hard to navigate. You shouldn't feel lost in a tiny, homey town.\n\nAlso, while I like the idea of the townspeople not wanting to have you there, in practice, it doesn't lead to them being likeable or interesting characters. This sort of thing could be used to build intrigue, with glimpses of who they really are peeking out between the cracks. But I never got the mystery-solving itch. I just wanted to leave. It's also easy to either sleep through cut scenes, or cause weird bugs when the game insists on showing them anyway.\n\nCurrently, this game is episodic, which boggles my mind. A farming simulator is a time-eater. This genre is not one meant to be broken up into little bits. And after a kickstarter and early access, this game should be complete. Worse still, the game is buggy, and core elements of gameplay are still being built.\n\nI'll praise Quickfire for not giving up on the game, as they still do regular updates. It's the sort of thing where I'm tempted to leave a "don't buy it yet" sort of review. Because I want to view this game as a work in progress. But Wild Season isn't in early access anymore, and the game is still being debugged. And I can't recommend a game based on hope. I dropped $30 on the game before it went episodic, and feel incredibly foolish having done so. It doesn't deliver on the simple pleasure of growing lots of different crops. It doesn't feel like I've been invited or challenged to solve an interesting mystery. I don't care about the characters. The ads and information released by Quickfire make it look like there's so much to this game, but in my playthrough, it just didn't deliver on any of it. I appreciate them working hard to try to deliver their own spin on Harvest Moon, but your money would be better spent on a copy of virtually any other Harvest Moon game.","April 8","false","9.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoeLE/recommended/328220/","NoeLE","NoelElbisnes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoeLE/","1509 products in account","First of all, I can't clearly say that I'm a huge admirer of farming/grinding games, so my impressions might not convey what I actually felt while playing this. Still, I was quite surprised to see how many possibilities are there, and can certainly say that one won't get bored soon enough and will find some in-game activity to enjoy with.\n\nWild Season is still in Early Access phase, so of course, you can expect some "issues" which can slightly distort gaming experience. Although, so far I haven't met anything critical which would affect the session. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that once I was a witness to the bug whether characters were continuously going through the door, sort of being stuck there, but dialogues went just fine, so it wasn't a real problem.\n\nIt cannot be denied that I actually loved artwork and character portraits which, being a cliche to mention, still feel really nicely done and look rather lively. However, I think that some of used assets could be sharper, while some can say they seem a bit blurry. Same goes for the fonts, and perhaps dialogue windows as well.\n\nYou won't find a lot of witty dialogues, but they can't be referred as "fillers like" or blank, just to be, too. Town and its outskirts are big enough, so there is a lot of place for you to hang around. Although, there is only one jiggle melody playing for each location, and I must say, you may not feel satisfied while listening for it over and over again.\n\nThe only noticeable flaw I've met is the quite distracting beginning of the game. Not by a matter of the story, but mostly for its unhelpful introductory part. You are following numerous cutscenes and dialogues, but don't get explained what it is for and whether you should do "this" or "that". Tasks-to-do keep appearing in the right corner of the screen, but there doesn't seem to be any quest log, so you could check whatever activity you should be doing. Also, short controls guide would come very handy, as you may change buttons for actions, but nothing tells you what each action does. You may not even learn that you can save the progress unless you go next to a bed in your house and randomly press "J" on it. Also, some commands like toggling of "running mode" aren't listed at all, so you might take a time to figure that it goes by "R".\n\nMeantime, I would really love to be able to use my mouse instead of a keyboard for some activities. since you have to handle both left and right of letters keyboard while still controlling the mouse for dragging items and some other things. In addition, sometimes it's required to press action button twice in order to perform something, and skipping dialogues with a button doesn't work very well.\n\nLong story short, while not covering all aspects of Wild Season and not advancing too far in the story, I've tried to shed some light on it. If you are a fan of Harvest Moon and acknowledged with words such as farming/gathering not only in real life but in-game as well, you might want to try out this project and maybe find it addictive enough to play on a regular basis. Otherwise, you may prefer waiting for a sale, and for a game to meet further development. Still, despite some minor [for me] issues, WS has a lot of potential and with necessary effort and polishing it can certainly become one of a few gems you rarely meet this time, not a big one, but one which is absolutely worth meeting with.\n\n--- --- --- --- --- --- ---\n\n"Delight gauge" of this game - ... 63%\n\n--- "Entertaining, relaxing and intriguing story which starts from a young man willing to start it whole over, overcoming life like obstacles, evil intentions of other residents and lots, lots of annoying weeds and ends with a story you create by your own hands.

The story is slow to start, dialogue heavy and surprisingly intriguing. All is not what it seems on this lonely farm...\n\nThe landscapes and artwork are beatifully drawn and very nice to take in. A lot of effort has been put into creating detail in the backgrounds and prety much every aspect of the presentation, which is also very nice.\n\nThere is a lot to do from day to day, but the activities are of the relaxing kind, so don't expect anything too exciting.\n\nThe quest log could be a bit more informative, especially during the early stages when you can't really do any farming/activities yet and there are no hints as to what you should be doing. I think an explanation of where and when to manually save would be useful too. I didn't encounter any major bugs, but I needed to press the keys many many times before dialog boxes with the leaves would advance. The only other glitches I came across were the occasional piece of dialog appearing two or three times instead of once, and the mayor who came in and out of the door 25 times while introducing himself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Locke_VI/recommended/328220/","Locke_VI","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Locke_VI/","1641 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst Impressions Review\n\nStory:\n\nThe story seems very nice so far. You play as an inexperienced farm owner, living in a town full of people who are polite, but strangely cold and standoffish.  Why do the townsfolk distrust and dislike you so much? Will they help you with your farm, despite their feelings and your lack of experience?  Will you be able to do this on your own if they don't help? The story is well written, and more than enough to make me want to keep playing.  But there's just so...much...dialogue....   The dialogue text appears on the screen slowly, and I read fast. With no option to speed up the dialogue or skip parts of it, getting through the game's opening can feel like a real chore.  There is however a quick start option, so you can skip the opening scenes completely and go straight to the game.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nIt's mostly the typical farm sim stuff:  You plant crops, raise animals, clean up your farm and do other management type chores.  Fans of the genre will feel right at home here, and newcomers will be able to get into it easily.  The tutorials can be a bit wordy, but most game tutorials have that problem, and it's not as bad as many.  I haven't run into any major glitches yet.\n\n\nGraphics and Sound:\n\nThe graphics are very cute, colorful and 16bit-looking. They fit with the gameplay and story very well, and bring in a huge nostalgia factor, for me at least. I feel like I'm playing a Game Boy Advance or SNES again. The music fits too:  Simple, relaxing tunes that make you feel like you're living a country life.\n\n\nControls:\n\nI played using a mouse and keyboard, and the controls seem to work well enough.  I did have one pretty frustrating issue:  I started playing in windowed mode, and after going through a good 40 minutes of story, I figured out that about half of the controls weren't working.  I restarted (quickplay this time) in fullscreen, and everything worked fine.\n\n\nMenu Options:\n\nThe game has the option to raise and lower the volume for music and SFX.  You can also change between a few resolutions and play in full screen or windowed.  Some more resolution options might be nice, but I can't think of much else you'd need for a game like this. Again, I hope they add an option to speed up text for dialogue.  Slowly reading through the opening scenes can be a little painful.\n\n\nEarly Access Notes:\n\nWild Season is currently an Early Access game, meaning there will be bugs and glitches, your save file may or may not get wiped at some point, and things may not always work the way they should.  This is true for ALL early access games!  Sadly, there will be people who buy the game on a whim without understanding what early access is, and give a negative review based on things the devs haven't gotten around to implementing or fixing yet.  Please don't be one of those people!  You should only buy this game if you enjoy the genre, want to support the project, are willing to put up with glitches, and are interested in providing polite feedback and helpful criticism. Early access is for patient and understanding gamers.\n\n\nRating:\n\nI won't give a rating on Wild Season yet, since it's an early access game and any rating would likely change based on how the game changes.  I will say that's it's a fun little farming sim with cute graphics, good gameplay, nice music and a entertaining story. There are glitches here and there, probably even some that I haven't seen yet. But looking around, I've found that the devs respond quickly to community posts, and there are updates on a fairly regular basis. More than that, I feel like there's a lot of love and hard work being put into this game, and in my opinion, the effort is worth supporting.","November 3, 2015","true","1.7"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

Hopefully my last.\n\nI want to preface this by saying that I'm an absolute Harvest Moon FANatic. I own nearly all of them, and spent an obscene chunk of my life playing them.\n\nI've always wanted to have a Harvest Moon game on PC as I have a ridiculous amount of consoles and handhelds just trying to keep up with this series of games.\n\nI also want to say that I have very high hopes for Wild Season. I seriously, truly do. But that being said this attempt at bringing a Harvest Moon game to the PC has serious issues that forbid me from recommending this attempt to anyone.\n\nFirst, the development seems very lackluster and uninspired. Even now the development cycle is going to longer and longer delays in producing any tangible work.\n\nThe developers spend most of their time touring around touting the game, but spend very little time ON the game. Their twitch feeds spend the bulk of their time also either just talking about the places they've visited or other games, such as the last one where they spent more time talking about how much they wanted to play Cities Skyline then any interest in the development of their own game.\n\nThey're a small indie group trying to charge a Triple A price for a concept in which they have little to no apparent interest in developing, prefering rather to use their current  barely functional mock-up to boastfully party down on the convention circuit. Just where is the money that the backers really going for?\n\nI truly do hope that a good Harvest Moon game does come to the PC, and I honestly do hope that Wild Season, Stardew Valley and World's Dawn does finally break the curse of failed attempts to bring a HM game to PC.\n\nBut currently, with the slowing development, erratic developer interest, and money flowing to everything EXCEPT game development I can not, in good faith, recommend this project to any of my fellow Harvest Moon fanatics.","May 23, 2015","false","2.7"," 38 of 70 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","38","70","3","0"

However, this game is still early access, and it is not without the bugs that early access typically has. Even with these bugs, the game has frequent updates and the devs are very responsive/involved with the community via forums and social media outlets. I strongly recommend this if you go into this full knowing that you will have some errors from time to time, even save file ruining ones. In terms of gameplay, it is also not without its faults. Maybe it'd feel a lot smoother for someone who is using a gamepad, i'm not sure ! But as someone who is playing this game with (mostly) a keyboard & mouse, changing keybindings is virtually inevitable. Though in my opinion, that shouldn't deter you from all the other strengths this game has to offer ! The characters are very nicely written out with interactive dialogue, it has some mechanics (that i wont mention for spoilers) I haven't seen in farming simulators yet, and the music/map layouts gives a nice jab of nostalgia for veteran harvest moon players (:","October 15, 2015","true","32.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Just started and I find the townspeople very suspicous. Also at the start of the game I could find no way to quit the game hmmm.\nNow as for the farm, the first thing I can see is that they have taken a lot of inspiration from harvest moon, which is awesome. Unfortunatly though as although it felt very harvest moon like, the farm itself was very jaring with how tiny and wierd everything is. Hopefuly the game mechanics are fine (haven't got that far yet), as all it means then is tweeking the farm to make it feel more friendly and not some zoomed out lifeless landscape. Funny I say lifeless considering the condition you find your farm in, in harvest moon, yet despite that the farm always felt full of life.

It is a very easy going farming sim with a lot of depth and extra things to do to keep you busy (I have hardly scratched the surface). The gameplay is smooth and maybe a little bit repetitive but i suspect you get that with most farming sims ;) It has a large variety of crops to plant, as well as trees and animals, fishing, cooking, mining and horse racing. I'm glad it isnt time based like other flash farming sims. It also seems to have a story to it :D\n\nThe music is nice enough, though I would prefer more tracks rather than the one on loop, There are several bugs, though none are game breaking (small graphics glitches and the occasional pathing issue) and it is lacking any tutorial on the mechanics, so there is a slight learning curve. The controls were pretty clunky, though the gamepad works great. The artwork is cute and easy to look at.\n\nI will definitely be putting more time into this one!\n\nEdit - It seems game saves don't remember who you have met, or what part of the story/quest you were in. Game breaking, so beware :P\n\nEdit 2 - Save games have been fixed!","November 3, 2015","true","7.6"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

You will get my honest feelings about the game (both good and bad).---\n\nI want to start out by saying Yes I know this game is in early access. It feels very much like an snes rpg. Music is about what you'd expect and graphics the same.  It has an interesting little story and the controls are ok. The downside is that much like a previous reviewer "Mooji" noted, there are areas where npc's are getting stuck in doors and maybe an option to save could be added a little earlier on in the tutorial (unless I just didn't know how to do so???). The price is a little more than I would pay for a title like this but if the developers continue to update and add new features (multiplayer would be cool), then I would say pick it up during a sale and enjoy. Again please take into consideration this is a review for an early access game. While reading other reviews it seems the developers are updating frequently and plan to make this a great title with many new features.\n\nEdit: Seems the way to save early is by pressing J facing the bed in your home. Don't know if it was just added or was always there but this is good to know!","November 3, 2015","true","1.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

There's only 1 resolution option, but the menu for it is there so I'm guessing that they will add more options later. I liked that the game worked fine in both full screen and windowed mode, there are so many little unity engine games on steam that go ape ♥♥♥♥ if you try to alt tab and this one is not one of them. (Hell Hearthstone doesn't alt tab properly, so Blizzard could learn a thing or two)\n\nThe Engine of the game is very cute and pleasant, and so is the background music.\n\nI like that the game is not just about spam farming and harvesting so it isn't just a farmville clone on steam, there are other interactions with people in town, and a bit of a story going on.\n\nThe story and npc interaction is very J-RPG like and is fluid, though maybe a bit wordy, there was a funny little glitch when I spammed an action button to go ahead, and an npc called Barry or something kept going in and out of a door real fast, but I did not encounter any other mishaps.\n\nSo I loved everything so far, the menu was great, everything was responsive and I like the look of the game and the soundtrack. Here's where I encountered the first little negative thing. When you're actually farming, tilling, removing obstructions, the game controls are a little less smooth, you have to be in the exact right spot to do things, you have to aim very carefully and might miss a few times, that is not a huge deal in general, but considering you will need to spam actions and do a lot of repetitive plantings etc. it could get a little frustrating.\n\nIn General as an EA game it's very polished, and I would highly recommend it for people who like these little filler games.\nThis is a review after playing for a somewhat short time, I have gone through the tutorials and done some basic things in the game, so I haven't yet gone in depth, I may update this review in the future and flesh it out some more.\n\nPros.\n-Nice look\n-Good background music\n-Plenty of content\n\nCons.\n-have to aim actions very minutely, easy to miss target, can get frustrating at times\n\n7/10","November 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","1"

Normally I only play games with a strong narrative aspect, so the original Harvest Moon games, while fun to me when I was younger, were somewhat difficult for me to stick with because they couldn't hold my interest for long periods of time. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Wild Season does have an overarching mystery story--I bought the farm and moved into the town like normal, BUT, from the beginning it was pretty clear that a lot of people were UNHAPPY about the fact that I moved in. Some of them even asked me outright to leave, which only makes me more interested to find out what it is they're all hiding! Even so, a lot of the characters are really fun to interact with, and have their own unique personalities and ways of speaking. The dialogue definitely doesn't suffer from the usual cliches, so I enjoyed talking to everyone I encountered.\n\nThe art and the animation is great; everything looks super clear, and is the HD quality we deserve from a 2D game in this decade. I wasn't able to test all of the features yet, but my farming ventures seemed to go fine, and so did the couple of times I tried fishing.\n\nAlthough I did encounter both major and minor bugs from time to time, from what I've seen, the devs are constantly releasing updates to fix them, and they also respond quickly to questions! The game is in Early Access and still unfinished, but even so, I'm happy with what I've experienced so far, and I'll be waiting on tenterhooks for the full release.

There's an interesting story, and the farm management is solid. There's very few options for this type of game on PC, and Wild Season does it well. It definitely needs more work, but with time it could be a great game.\n\nThe game has a little bit of an issue with the controls, the defaul mapping isn't ideal (however, it can be changed) and it's a little unusual how you have to hold down the key for a little longer than you'd instinctively expect. I've encountered a few minor bugs, but nothing game breaking. There's a few other annoyances, like some animations lasting a little bit too long.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this to anyone who likes this genre of game. However, the game is in Early Access and is not finished yet. This is definitely noticable, so if you're the type that would rather wait for a game to be fully polished and complete then grab it in the future. If you're willing to give it a go right now, and can get past the things mentioned above, you should find it an enjoyable experience.","November 5, 2015","true","1.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It reminds me of Harvest Moon which is a good thing since those games are amazing. Despite Wild Season currently being only available via Early Access, I can already tell from the little that I have played, that this game is very ambitious and will go very far. Not only does it give you a farm to manage with a quirky back story, but it also includes other various activities around the town for you interact with. In my opinion this gives the town a vibrant atmosphere and makes things feel alive. You are not just limited to a game that revolves around repetitive farming duties like most other similar titles in the genre. You will meet several NPCs around town, all with their own unique personalities and there is also potential for you to meet a person of interest and develop a relationship.\n\nA couple negatives at the moment are the slightly laggy control of the character inventory menu when selecting items and also the character you play seem to move quite inaccurately. I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to save the game as well. Such is the nature of Early Access games so I am sure all these minor issues will be fixed as development continues. I am now eagerly awaiting its final release as I can see this becoming one of those addictive games that I get engrossed with on a daily basis. I definitely recommend this game.","November 8, 2015","true","1.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

I absolutely love the art and the story. It's a game I could easily get lost in, like Friends of Mineral Town. From the farming to the interactions, it's all quite wonderful.\n\nHowever, at present, there are quite a few game stalling bugs. The animals are a bit broken. My chicken never produced eggs then invariably vanished and I can't progress any deeper in the mine beyond the first "level" or my game froze, forcing me to restart. Despite this, I was still hooked and I was willing to put up with it. I didn't care because the game was just too wonderful.\n\nWhy am I not playing now? Because, unfortunately, there is a bit of a bug where the game will not load a save file. Instead, it's a black screen. So that's a bit of a miss for me.\n\nEven so, I would STILL recommend this game. I reported the bug and the developer responded within the day. They've been really active in their own community, seem intent on finishing this game, and it's simply a great play. If you can stand the bugs, and want to support what I feel is a true Harvest Moon game that calls to the roots of that genre, then by all means. Otherwise, wait for the game to be finished. <3\n\nEither way, it's a wonderful game and I'm in love.

I love the Harvest Moon series and even just picked up Stories of Seasons for the 3DS. I purchesed this hoping for a PC one I can play either at home or on the laptop while on the go, but as soon as I launch the game, the main menu comes up, and everything seems fine, but I can't do anything. Mouse, game pad, keyboard....Nothing works! For $30, I'd like to play something, even if its buggy or choppy, but to be able to do nothing isn't right. Tried ajusting the settings as intructed to beta, but even after the updates, still fails to respond. I'm hoping the game is patched and updated soon so I can enjoy it. I have high hopes for it!.\n\n\nUpdate! 11/27/2015\n\nOk, full release, and I can now play. Good start. A bit slow response, but controller supported and sound seems to be there. Music ok. Went through the menu's, options and the like are ok. Started game, again, a bit touchy, but all in all, going ok. Speeding up now, I get to start playing, saved my game, which also is touchy but works, and step outside to start first full day. I meet the guy that will be picking up what I ship and offers to show me how to farm. I have a sickle and a hoe with some seeds now. I do the first part, but when the secound part comes up, he gives me a hoe...which now is no longer in my inventory. So in short, can't complete the totorial. So I reload and try to skip it, but once again, when he hands me the tools that I can use, the hoe once again vanishes from use/inventory. Can't farm, when the most important tool, the hoe, is not avalible, makes things kind of hard ha ha. Still, as said, the game is a bit choppy, but does seem like it'll hold promise like the old SNES Harvest Moon with some updated art work. Currently sits at ver 1.0, and I've sent the developer some notes, so hopefully they look into them. I'll update again when the game is patched...soon I hope ha ha.","April 18, 2015","false","2.6"," 29 of 59 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","29","59","3","4"

The introduction and beginning of the story nearly hooked me, but there was slightly too much repetition with some of the dialogue.\n\nOptions + Controls\nThe options menu is simple and clean; you can change the sound, and rebind the key controls. While in-game, you can't access the options menu until you receive an item from a NPC. This is a nice idea, but not really user-friendly. The NPCs teach you the basics, but you have to figure out for yourself which buttons to press. It would be nice to be able to move your character around or interact with objects using your mouse, because the controls can sometimes be slightly annoying.\n\nBugs\nCame across a few visual bugs, such as the weather staying grim throughout a couple of summer days,  sometimes NPCs glitch in and out of the doorways, and the response time while fishing is too slow to get a proper result.\nOther Problems ...\nThere are some things that you would expect to be able to do or interact with, but can't. Like being able to place chopped wood where there's an image of a wood pile. Being able to adjust the text speed would also be nice; I accidentally clicked on a few dialogue options when skipping text.\n\nPrice\nEven with the Early Access discount, I can't help but feel that the price is too high. 3 hours into the game, and I don't feel engaged enough with the story or gameplay to recommend any of my friends to buy it.\n\nMy overall impressions of Wild Season is kind of average.\nIt is in early access, so maybe there will still be features added later on. I want to recommend it, but at the same time I want to shake it like a cassette tape. I'll probably put more time into it, but for now, it's a hit and miss.","November 5, 2015","false","3.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Adding extra skills in the form of cooking, mining and fishing, there are a lot of extra activities to fill up your time after you're done taking care of the crops.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is that it allows your character to be female or male, and the townsfolk include several different eligible bachelors and bachelorettes. Add to it a plot regarding a secret of the town, and it's clear that this has had a lot of effort and care poured into it.\n\nBut I feel I must repeat: currently this is still decidedly unfinished, and players are acting as playtesters. If you don't mind bugs and rough edges, you can find a lot of fun, but if you want your game experience unspoiled, I advise waiting.","November 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

I'm only a few hours in, and I'm already more invested in the story and characters than I ever have in harvest moon games. The gameplay is also more rewarding and less grueling. It has all the makings of an amazing farming rpg.  I did however,  run into many bugs including one that I haven't been able to play on from.\n\nFor example: often characters who I've meet and interacted with on several occasions will seemingly forget we've ever even met. My chickens don't do anything and I have no way of checking their stats. I can't figure out how to get upgrades from the carpenter. My primary task button never seems to work I have to press it an average of 10 times before I can even speak to someone, etc etc.\n\nThe bug that broke the game for me was the quest,\n\n\n(SPOILERS!!!!!!!)\n\n\n\n\nwhen I had to ask people about the doctor's disappearance. After I'd ask, the screen would go black and stay that way and I'd be forced to load an earlier save. Also I couldn't get passed the quest when you help Panca search Ponco's room. Nothing in his room would trigger a progression in the quest.\n\nI'm really looking to play this game after a few more updates. I'm sure once it's playable it will be worth the money I spent on it!","November 1, 2015","true","13.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Didn´t play long enough yet to go through all content but there seems a lot to do. Off course you have your farm but also a town with quite a few locations, horse racing-betting and for so far I´ve seen a nice story and lot´s of npc. Graphics are simple but very nice.\n\nCurrent state\n\nOn the other hand this is an early access build and there are still some things that need polishing.\n\nMost anoying is that it looks like keys are not always responding. Maybe it´s just me not standing exactly in the right position, but if it´s mentioned in some other reviews i hope the devs will look after it.\n\nOther point is that you have to click a lot during conversations with npc's to get to the next page. It hapen't me quite a few times i clicked to fast and skipped the screen were i had to choose a response without knowing which option i had chosen. Maybe the devs kan think of something smart to prevent this.\n\nAlso i hope steam achivements will be added in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nNice promising game for everyone who loves farming games. At this moment I think asking price is (even with EA discount) to high for it's current state. But it's well worth to put on your wishlist and pick it up when development is a little further.","November 6, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's too early to tell as I barely got through the intro. The pacing of the game is extremely slow. Part of the reason is development of the back story (the visual novel portion of the game) but also due to the interface being "clunky". For reference, I use a 360 controller which is my preference for a game of a more casual nature. It would be nice to be able to do everything with a controller but that's not the case. While movement & menu selection are mapped, navigating the journal is not and also typing your character's name has to be done with the keyboard. So sometime I go back & forth between controller & keyboard. At the moment dialogue progression can be a chore. At times you can fastforward with a press of a button and at other times you sit and wait as if it's timed (a bit too slow for my taste).\n\nSo far I think the game is okay. It doesn't draw me in as I'd hope. Graphic wise it is comparable to most other games of this genre: characters are cute/cartoon-like. Music is pleasant but could definitely use more variety. Control seems smooth and responsive enough: movement at least.\n\nI will edit this review once I get more game time.\n","November 6, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moetietsinvullen/recommended/328220/","moetietsinvullen","The Unguided","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moetietsinvullen/","4550 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWild Season is a game with a ton of potential. It does a lot of things well, but there is still a lot of work to be done. There aren't many games in its category, so I am happy the developers took the opportunity to make this game.\n\nYou start off creating your character. An introduction video tells you who you are, someone who can't find a job. So you decide to buy a farm in the middle of nowhere and start a new life. On your way there you crash your car. Luckily, someone's there to save you and you wake up in the remote town you were headed.\n\nIt being in Early Access, there are a lot of problems with the game. But I did find it to be enjoyable during my brief play-through. As I said earlier, a lot is done well. From reading the forums, I have understood that the €28 price mark is a mistake and that the discount price is its 'real' price.\n\nI think this game is great, the entire atmosphere of the game is lovely and there is plenty to do already. But you would have to accept that there is still a lot of work to be done. This game is obviously still a work in progress. So for that, I think €15 is stretching it in its current state. If the game gets to be finished, I would definitely recommend it.\n\n6/10 (taking into consideration it's still EA).\n\nPros:\n+ Get to choose to be male or female, name, birthday and even blood type.\n+ Lovely graphics!\n+ The musical tracks, albeit monotonous after a while, were very pleasant. I think they fit the game great.\n+ Some people have complained about a lot of dialogue, which is true there is a lot of it. But this is a story-driven RPG, it's required for a game like this. I personally enjoyed it a lot. The dialogues and jokes were done really well! Whoever did the writing also had a lot of eye for detail.\n+ The game doesn't hold your hand, there's a lot of self-exploration. I think this is great, because games today all have a baby-sitter function. Don't expect that here!\n+ During my play-through I felt I had plenty to do. There are a lot of NPCs to interact with, and getting to know better. You can mine for things like ore and diamonds, manage your farm (cut weed, plant seeds, water your plants), and even fishing.\n+ Has a neat quest log and journal in one. A World Map that I had to use A LOT. An inventory and your character's profile.\n+ Controls for the keyboard are rebindable.\n+ There's a toolbar at the bottom of your screen with all of your tools (mining pick, fishing rod, plant seeds, watering can, scythe, hammer and more). The actionbar is binded to numbers so you can equip them without having to go into your inventory.\n+ Works with a wireless X360 controller. I thought this played a lot better for this type of game than a KB.\n+ Has a stamina system where actions such as mining, drain your stamina and your character becomes tired. This adds a bit of realism and challenge to the game. You can't just spam actions, there are consequences. Your character expresses his/her exhaustion with animations which are very cute, nice job! Sleeping and food help you restore your stamina back up.\n+ I like that there's day/night transition, with appropriate crickets sound during night.\n\nCons:\n- Can't adjust your character's physical appearance, such as hair colour. Would be great if this could be added in the future.\n- This game REALLY needs a reliable way to speed up text. Whether that's a slider option within the menu (1.5x, 2x etc), or just pressing a button to instantly jump to the end of a conversation bubble. The latter already seems to be in place for the controller. Pressing the A button seems to jump to the end of the bubble? But half the time it just jumps straight to the next bubble, it just doesn't feel reliable enough. Maybe a slider would be a better solution, if pressing a button proves to be too difficult to fine-tune? Or perhaps both, so the players can decide for themselves?\n- It happens way too often that controls aren't responding, leading me to bashing the different action keys. For example if I want to start a conversation, or simply cut the weed on my land.\n- Talking about cutting stuff, why after scavenging something do I have to press the action key again to put it into my inventory? I assume it's meant to be a choice whether you want to keep the item or not, but I didn't find any way to discard something straight after scavenging. Now all that happens is me running around with an item over my head until I put it into my inventory.\n- I feel like the keyboard controls would benefit a lot from the mouse being used more. Also, the game doesn't seem to recognize the mouse cursor that well. For example when saving: http://i.imgur.com/EFPz601.png\n- I like that with the controller I can use both the stick and the d-pad, how come the same isn't the case for KB with WASD and arrows? I know you can rebind them, but why not just bind both of them? There are, albeit on rare occasion, moments when I'd like to switch between both. I feel there shouldn't be any issue to simply add this to the game.\n- The controls for the controller aren't very intuitive. With some getting used to, they are certainly usable but I found these specifically to be very annoying:\n* I couldn't open the main menu, even though start button seems logical. So I had to press ESC on my keyboard instead.\n* X to go 'back' instead of B? I find that extremely confusing.\n* LB and RB is used to switch between toolbar items, but within the in-game menus I suddenly have to use LT and RT to switch menus? Some consistency here would be nice.\n* If I could rebind everything myself it would be fine, but I couldn't find a way to do this for the controller.\n- Requires a lot of manual saving to continue where you left off, because loading the automatic save made the game unplayable for me. All I would see is a black screen, forcing me to hard-close the game. Loading my manual saves works fine though.\n- That's why it would also be nice if you could save anywhere, and not just by sleeping in your bed. Saves a lot of travelling back and worth (there's a reason why HM02 was invented you know!).\n- Meaningless descriptions for the control keys (action1, action2). These really need more meaningful names so you know what you're binding your keys to. Like 'interact' for action1 and 'use item' for action2. These might not be the best either, but it says a lot more than just 'action1'.\n- A lot of door glitches, sprite models just running back and forth between doors while talking to you. But I assume these are high on the 'to fix' list.\n- The sound of waves in the port, or on the beach, is making me DEAF. Even when all volumes are set to 0%, the volume doesn't change whatsoever.\n- I like the addition of the sound of crickets during night, if it weren't for the obvious looping. The looping makes it sound really annoying, I think because it ends so abruptly. I think having a longer track, so the looping doesn't happen every 2 seconds, would help with this.\n- Didn't notice any other SFX sounds? I would love for there to be a sound when talking to NPCs, like a lot of other old school RPGs. Maybe even for entering buildings (door sound). Why exactly is there an SFX slider?\n\nRemarks:\n* With the keyboard: My character moves faster when sprinting diagonally. I find that this works out pleasantly, because moving around takes a lot of time. But on the controller this does not happen, so I assume it's a bug. I welcome it though.\n* With the keyboard: My character sprints automatically in the direction I'm holding, even when I release the sprint key. But considering this does not happen with the controller, this has to be a bug. As someone prone to RSI though, I found this to be very helpful, because it relieves stress from my hand. So I hope this can become an actual feature of the game. (Perhaps a controls option with a check mark that says "hold sprint button" so people can choose for themselves?)","November 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I recommend it because I have faith that issues will be fixed and improve the gameplay, and the story already has me intrigued.\n\n(Hopefully spoiler-free ahead)\n\nAlright, I've played through to the end of the episode. Some of the things people have complained about as bugs are more due to to impatience. It *is* possible to clear stumps & boulders; it just takes a while. Chickens *do* produce eggs; you have to actually feed them. Fishing it not bugged, it just takes actual skill. (I didn't buy other animals, so I can't speak to them.)\n\nThat said, there are bugs, but none I found game breaking. Mostly over- and -undersensitive controls, and shopkeepers who don't like to wait on you (but given that the town doesn't want you there, I see that more as a flavoring feature than a bug :P )\n\nDoes the game need work? Yes. It currently takes some creative thinking & planning to get your seeds where you want them. There's no way to store lots of lumber & stone for eventually upgrading your farm. However, you can't do that yet anyway, so that's academic. Hopefully that feature comes in the next story update (see: the town wants you out). It's very difficult to make friends, especially if you want to get to know the two 'acceptable' outsiders. (Again, Town. Hates. You. explains a lot in-story.) There are story actions you can do before you do the *other* story action needed to make them count. Smaller features, like the TV and cooking (I think), aren't working yet.\n\nIt is a lot more difficult than your average Harvest Moon, but I enjoyed that. The story actually kept me guessing on the details of the reveal. And so far, it is more involved than "take over defunct farm, revive it, find friends & spouse". At the same time, it has the classic elements of "take over defunct farm, revive it, (try to) find friends & spouse". (I'm hoping they add a particular bachelor in a future update.)\n\nLet's just say it takes a standard HM template and turns it sideways. For an indie attempt, it's coming along nicely.\n\nHowever, there is currently no playing after the reveal at the end of the episode. If you hate the idea of episodic gameplay or think it's not a good format for this type of game, hold off. If you like the idea of sitting on a cliffhanger, give this one a shot.\n\nI, for one, can't wait to see where it goes.\n\n8/10 would purchase\n\n(KickStarter backer)","December 22, 2015","true","195.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

The game has to be one of the most fun RPG maker games I've ever played and is truly impressive considering it was made using that platform. On the other hand there are so many bugs and issues with the game that it is hard to reccommend it at the moment. Some of these issues can be forgived as the game is in early access, but it seems as though the developer should have fixed some of these problems before putting it up on Steam.\n\nPros\n\n- Amazing visual style and graphic design. Honestly, the visuals are probably the best part about this game.\n- Very familiar "Harvest Moon" style gameplay.\n- Fairly interesting story.\n- Developer appears to be working to fix issues and bugs.\n\nCons\n\n- Insane amount of bugs (Often I'd find myself walking through walls and other people, cutscenes glitching out, etc.)\n- Wonky Controls (For example, the only way to save is by pressing "J" while facing foward in a bed. Planting crops is also difficult alot of the time as a result of these controls.)\n- Very Dialouge Heavy at beginning of game. Takes about an hour or so to get into any real gameplay.\n- High Cost (Even while it is on sale at the moment for $16.49. For the regular cost of $29.99, it is even more ridiculous. I mean honestly, go buy Cities: Skylines or something.)\n- Very Repetitive Music (What little music is in the game is actually pretty good, but it loops wayyyyy to often.)\n\nOverall Wild Season is a game that shows a lot of potential, but for the state that the game is in at the moment and the fairly high pricetag I don't believe it is worth your purchase. In the game's current state, I would only reccommend if you have an obession with Harvest Moon, or if it is on extremely high discount.\n\nVisGaming Rating- 5/10","November 7, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bleedoop/recommended/328220/","bleedoop","Helvetica Standard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bleedoop/","71 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs a Harvest Moon fan I really recommend this game. This is the "Harvest Moon" game that I would believe those whove played Friends of Mineral Town and Back to Nature would enjoy. As did Friends of Mineral Town, Wild Season is bringing in all what makes the RPG Farming Simulation genre good and addicting. In its current state it is still heavily buggy and lacking in many areas but judging what I can see in game, I believe it is headed in the right direction. With a bit more polishing and a whole lot more content I would really think this will be one of the best RPG Farming Sim games available.\n\n+Great Farming Action\nIts not like Farmville or anything like those online clicker games. Its old school RPG Farming. How it should be. Youve got a variation of crops and trees. Using different (hopefully upgradeable) tools you tend to them, from plowing to watering to sowing and eventually selling them for profit. Not only that, you also have a variety farm animals to tend to such as cows and chickens.\n\n+Active-Time Farming\nTime moves on as you do things in the game and in this certain characters will have their own schedules and  will be found in different differnt places in differet times of the day. As more work is to be done in your farm youll have less time to do other errands like buying seeds, getting your groceries, wooing women and celebrating birthdays.\nAnd when I said birthdays, yes, there are birthdays. Other than an active clock to keep you on your toes, there is also a calander that shows you the season, holidays and events. Most crops only grow on certain seasons so you need to work hard and quick to get the most profit since they wither as the season ends.\nTime really adds to the game and makes it more immersive.\n\n+Alot of characters\nYour Farm is not only the place youll be in for the entirety of the game. Youll get to visit the town and meet the colorful (and friendly?) townspeople. The Townspeople provide you with what you need such as seeds and farm animals, if you have the coin. There are characters that are viable for marriage too.\n\n+/-Nice Artstyle\nThe game has an interesting artstyle similar to that of the old handheld Harvest Moon Games (sort of like RPG makers-esque). That is a cute and colorful and kinda tiny. It does look nice but its honestly nothing we havent seen before. Im sort of hopeful of changes to be had in some areas, like it just feels sort of flat (I know its a 2d game) and lifeless.\n\n+/- Decent Soundtrack\nWild Season got it right to get the sound of an anime RPG farming sim but its sort of lacking. Like footstep noises and such. It may sound like a nitpick but things like these and to the immersion and it just sounds sort of really quiet without those. Sometimes the soundtrack repeats cut and the repeat doesnt sound seemless.\n\n-Buggy as all hell\nAs do most Early Access games, Wild Season is really buggy. From messy button inputs to characters that seem to be out of place this is what truly breaks the game. The controls are sometimes unresponsive and characters just bug in and out (sometimes they get stuck in a loop within conversations/cutscenes and you cant progress.\n\n-Really expensive\nAs of the state of the game it does not really justify its hefty price tag.\n\nOverall the game is fun but it heavily needs more work. I am excited to see it finished.\n\n8/10\n","November 9, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This game went from a Beta/EA release, to an episode release, but it's still VERY unplolished, and I mean things from bugs (I gave Will a gift and he was just so damn happy he spazzed off of the screen, I mean literally his sprite spazzed completely out of the shop and I didn't see him again the rest of the day) to even grammatical and spelling mistakes. And yeah, it sucks from a gaming point of view to only be able to play to a certain point then have to wait for an indefinite time for the next episode just to continue but-\n\nWith that said-\n\nI really enjoyed playing this. It's a nice change from the generic Harvest Moon, tho yes the style is similiar, the story is a complete new expierience. The story is really interesting, and when you find out the secret- tho im sad we have to wait for the next episode- it just makes it that much better and sets it apart from other farming games completely.  Yeah, I was really excited about the same sex marriage/romance option, which isn't implemented in episode 1, but it and other things will be added as the story progresses in other episodes i'm assuming. And also hoping there is like an 'endless/seamless' way to play at some point, if not when all the episodes are out. (Meaning, even after the story, you can continue to play the game)\n\nI've read a lot about the price being too steep as well. I bought it when it first was put on steam. So, as far as I know, all the episodes will just be added for me, not having to buy them. The way i've seen/read, this is SORT OF like the 'base' game, and the episodes will just expand it (More story, more areas, etc). So if you can't justify the price, think of it like that. Base games are always higher than expansions.\n\nSo the cons aren't the best, but I do believe the it's a GOOD game as is, and it has an epic amount of potential with the next episodes, as well as fixing some bugs with this one, to be a GREAT game.\n\n\nOverall, I personally think it's worth it. It's got a long way to go, and I know it's being worked on as quick as it can (I'm also hoping it's finished or the episodes release in a decent amount of time, not 5-6 months in between, i'm eager to find out more about the story and do other things in the game as well), but i'm happy with my purchase.\n\n\nAlso, my first real review so i'm sorry it's all over the damn place. Just kinda upset me people were giving it a lot of hate, given the circumstances, when I think it's good. o-(*^*)-o","November 27, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I go crazy for anything like Harvest Moon, though I do appreciate that this is NOT Harvest Moon, it is a completely separate game and should be critiqued as such.\n\nI'll start with what is, by far, my favourite thing about this game. The characters. I REALLY like how unique and different each character is from one and other, I find myself getting more and more invested in them and the story the more I play. I find myself feeling differently about certain characters at various points in the plot, maybe suddenly someones motives become clear or even more clouded, maybe they spoke to you slightly differently and your character picks up on it. There's so much going on in terms of plot and people, which makes it a winner in my book. I do however, have one critisism, as you progress and talk to people they might give you clues about what they, or maybe others, like to receive as gifts, I just wish these clues were a little more obvious, and if there are obvious clues, I haven't seen them just yet. Also, I can't end this part without mentioning how happy I am that the Bachelors (and bachelorettes if you roll that way) are so much more age appropriate than in the HM games, I know that you never really get given any ages in HM but just the fact that they LOOK older, it makes my little heart so happy!\n\nNow, I suppose I COULD comment on plot but, honestly, I don't really want to; mostly because I'm still experiencing it for myself but it's also hard to give an honest review of the plot, in my opinion, unless you have seen the whole thing in it's entirety. So far, all I can really say about this games plot is that it sucks you in, stick with it, follow the story, and you'll see exactly what I meant when I wrote about the games characters.\n\nThe only glaring problems, for me, are the bugs and keeping in mind this game is still early access, I have to say, they're not actually THAT bad. I mean there are some that really 'bug' me (not even a little sorry for that) but all in all, none are game breaking and I have yet to encounter any that can't be fixed by a simple save + restart. Yeah it's a pain but it's early access! There is one, however, that I havent been able to solve for myself and that is the issues I've been having with the stores, all (barring the animal, general and now Lilly's store) dont actually seem to be interactable, which is annoying because as it stands, I have no way to recover my stamina. I did have the same bother with Lilly initially but that seems to have corrected itself somehow?\n\nAll in all, I love this game and if you enjoy Harvest Moon, odds are you will too! I, personally, am enjoying playing it now, as is, BUT don't let the fact that it's not complete put you off, it's a fantastic game with an excellent story and I am addicted!","December 29, 2015","true","21.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I'd scrap the car,leave town and then sell the deed to some megacorp like walmart or monsanto and laugh all the way to the bank while the town gets some long overdue scrutiny.\n\n2. triggers for cutscenes either went off early or never went off at all. especially when the runt tells you to leave in the beginning.\n\n3.I didn't care for the player character models but that's a personal peeve of mine and I won't ding the devs for it.\n\n4. a sandbox mode where there's no story and the townsfolk don't all act like they all need to be burned at the stake would just be fine with me.\n\n5. Minions! Farming is hard work and would be nice to hire some expendable hired hands to help out with the daily grind! Sending them to do chores or get supplies from the detestable townsfolk would do wonders.\n\n6. controls need to be fine tuned and simplified.\n\nTLDR:Serious potential in this game but marred by bugs and painful storyline. keep an eye on this game but waait for a sale.","November 13, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","3","9","3","0"

As of right now there are a lot of bugs that need to be reworked but if you dont mind the whole having to chase down an NPC to get their AI on the right track, the rest is a piece of cake from what I have encountered. I made a quick list of the things that have made me shake my head to the things that I have liked in the game and while I do vote to recommend this game, I cannot say I 100% recommend this game in its current state.\n\nCons:\n- The NPC AI have them running off the map, its a pain to attempt to catch them\n- Sometimes you get stuck on the door frames of the house but thats normally caused from sprinting\n- The stacking system is a bit flawed when it comes to resources but its simply a pain\n- NPC normally get stuck or you are unable to find them\n- Fishing is a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥, the bar that you need to get into the red area is off but a few seconds so you have an awkward timing.\n- You cant really tell some of the enterance ways from an exit in town\n(List will be updated as I play)\n\nPros:\n- The story makes you wonder at the start, I find it pretty interesting.\n- It does have a very strong feel linked to Harvest moon.\n- On a personal level, the graphics are 'cute' to me.\n- Harvest works for the most part though its a bit awkward to have to not just harvest the plants with your hands.\n- The days are long letting you have more time to find people and talk to them as well as tend to the farm and animals.\n- Map is pretty big so lots to explore.\n( Shall be updated in the future!)","February 9","true","3.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The story is just interesting enough that I want to keep playing it but it's also spaced out enough that I can keep farming like I want to. I'm also pretty impressed with the actual logic used for the crops, correct seasons, the actual image for them looking accurate (I work in agriculture so that's important to me). I haven't gotten around to the animals yet.\n\nI will say there's some little bugs here and there but they don't really affect gameplay that much.

Its an absolute rip off of harvest moon and I couldn't be happier.  The game features improved graphics yet a lot of the same game play as HM and i am absolutely loving it so far.

Im recording it and uploading so if your interested in a more indepth playthrough click this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaVrv-qNUco\n\nAnd now the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n*Insane Nostalgia: Not really a pro for new players but this was the king of them all before Animal Crossing and even           then it held its own, if you EVER played a Harvest Moon and enjoyed it its pretty much a requirement of your childhood to purchase this game.\n*New Story: Everything I've seen so far actually indicates the same story however none of the town members seem to be happy you've moved in so you can absolutely smell something is coming.\n\nCons:\n*Weird Audio: If you watch my playthrough you'll see what I mean.  I started with really nice audio, set my name and everything and the next second I couldn't hear myself think.  It was only when I got to the very end of all the text that I could access my settings and that heavenly audio button.\n*Controls: The Tutorial doesn't actually walk you through what buttons to press.  Its J, K and L just incase your wondering.   I changed mine back to the good old emulator set up of Z, X and C however it doesnt tell you any of this which can be a bit annoying when Frank is giving you the farming tutorial.\n*Cutscene: This is just my own complaint but at the very beginning I skipped the entire Intro thinking clicking would only go to the next text box.  Call me an idiot but they should change the skip to an actual button or something that says 'Click To Skip'\n\nAll in all this game is amazing, the developers seem involved with their community and are constantly updatiing.

Since it IS in its early stage, Wild Season is plagued by hilariously wonky bugs and glitches in which I actually I had to stop playing it after 3 or 4 days. However, it shares the same addictive qualities as the beloved Harvest Moon games with, of course, its own spin on it.\n\nWhat separates Wild Season's storyline from HM is its dark, suspenseful storyline. When you first start, you'll quickly notice that everyone in this town hates you. While the filler of the game is farming, taking care of animals, etc the storyline keeps you hooked to find out the answers and improve your relationships. Wild Season has done a good job on character development giving each NPC unique, intriguing personalities.\n\nOne of the unique features of Wild Season is its quest board where NPC's enlist your help by putting up timed errands. Problem is there are just too many bugs and glitches it's almost unplayeable. The funniest glitch that made me laugh was seemingly switching bodies with an NPC in front of me during a quest. Keyboard shortcuts don't register right away so I had to spam a key like 10 times to talk to NPC's.\n\nThe game needs a bit more polishing before it's truly ready. Moreover, the way the game is right now doesn't justify its absurdly high price of $30. I would ONLY recommend this game if it's on sale.\n\nCheck out the full review on my blog: http://tokyobat.com/harvest-moon-for-pc-wild-season-indie-game-on-steam/","November 10, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The games a lot of fun and very similar to harvest moon and Rune factory if you've played any of those kind of games. The game does have bugs but it's releiving to know that the devs are actually working on this game and getting rid of the bugs to make the game more enjoyable. There are a couple of minor bugs that you might run into but nothing that makes the game "unplayable". The "unplayable" bugs have already been patched for the most part so you don't have to stress out about that. Currently where the game is right now i would suggest it if you don't mind a couple bugs and just enjoy the aspects of farming in harvest moon like i do.","December 4, 2015","true","5.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

There was no initial story or background information (unless you skip that when using quick start) and the characters' names were boring along with the dialogue. The farming part of this game was cool, so I started clearing and planting and watering, etc. but after about 20 minutes of this I'd had enough I couldn't take the music anymore! I mean it sounds great and feels great to play this kind of a game with this kind of music, but it's just one tune on repeat, I did notice when I was exploring different areas had different music on occasion, but it was still just a different tune on repeat. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game just yet. Obviously I will continue to play this game as it updates and will revise my opinion accordingly with changes, this really is a neat game.","November 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","4","13","2","0"

Okay, yeah, the controls are a slight annoyance, but if they're that bad for you, you can remap them. Okay, yeah, I don't always agree with the Episodic format. In some siutations it works others it doesn't. All in all, though... I didn't find it too bad.\n\nThe few minor glitches I found weren't as game breaking as some would lead you to believe (for me, I had a few instances of things disappearing from my inventory, but upon adding something else to my bags, POOF! it's back). And I never once found the instance of people 'forgetting me'.\n\nThat being said, there are a few things that do bug me more then others. The collision detection on some things (ore rocks in the mine, the hit locations for your hoe, axe, sickle, hammer and watering can) can be a mild annoyance, but it's not something that takes away from the soul of the game. That soul is - at it's roots - it's the Harvest Moon we've always wanted. I love Harvest Moon and Rune Factory - it's the whole reason I jumped to buy this game, even before seeing the epidosdic format - and I think that the developers honestly love the series as well. It's Harvest Moon taking place in that seedy little town you're not so sure is as 'upstanding' as everyone says.\n\nOn the whole, I think this game has potential - and even though the 'pay for more content' deal caught me completely off guard as I didn't read much past that it was basically Harvest Moon - I will continue to buy the DLC. Some of you will disagree with me, others will agree, but as I stated before, the heart and soul of the game is there... and it is good. A little bit of elbow grease and some love, and this game has the potential to shine brighter then most of the Harvest Moon games, if you'll excuse my pretentiousness.","December 4, 2015","true","5.6"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

As advertised, the game plays ALOT like a visual novel. The first hour of the game is FILLED with text. Once the setting is established, you finally get to roam around and tend to your farm. (this consists of clearing out the weeds, logs, rocks in your farm. Plowing your farm, adding seeds, and watering crops. Each time you do an action, your energy meter depletes and once it is low enough, you have to sleep, which is a decent mechanic). I like the night and day transitions as well. It is an early access games, so there are a few bugs. The mouse support does not seem to function well. Talking to people sometimes requires you to spam the action button, which is "J".\n\nI would describe this game as a visual novel with farming, fishing, and horse racing as mini games. This game lacks stimulation which is a worrying trend for visual novel developers due to the Steam refunds. $16.49 is way too expensive for this game.... let alone $30. At the time of this review, games like The Banner Saga are on sale for like $5. I know some people will like this game and I wish there was a neutral button for this review, but I cannot recommend it for everyone.\n\nsort of SPOILERS BELOW:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHaha... the game abruptly ended when I chose to sell the farm. I don't think you should have this option in the game and if you are going to included it, make a proper ending for it. Show what happens.. dont just cut to the title screen. It just seems lazy and only gives off the illusion that decisions matter. With this, the game just ending and the player got a crap ending after reading an hour of text.. they aren't going to feel good about it, so why include this in the game... ?\n","November 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

I can't believe they decided to split up what little was there and leave those few that believed in the game without the content they were promised. Now, if they wanted to get the game that they bought, they have to buy it again as "seasons". Yeah, great.\n\nMy review:\nThis game is in a very early state of development and its current price is simply too high. It has, however, a lot of potential in my opinion. In its current state, I was not able to find any way to pause the game, the dialogue and scripted scenes are too long and there is no "skip" buttom for dialogues. In fact, I had to do some "key smashing" just so I could proceed to the next line of dialogue, as it sometimes just wouldn't work.\n\nPros:\n\n- Really nice style (Old-school feel, beautiful world design)\n- Interesting story\n\nCons:\n\n- Price\n- Unskippable, long dialogue scenes\n- Lack of real gameplay for the first 20 minutes\n- The game uses a lot of resources, not well optimized yet\n\n\nAs I've said though, most of these issues are probably due to the early state of development.

Controller support however is abismal and causes conflicts with keyboard input, so I suggest just using the keys. The layout is sorta goofy, but it's simple enough to grasp and not specifically bad just different from most games that I've palyed. I'm liking it so far, but for the uninitiated: the first half hour or better will be NOTHING but dialogue. Personally I find this infuruating, as I would rather be abe to skip quickly, or put it all in a cutscene or some kind...that I can also skip. This is a minor complaint however, and if you are a Harvest Moon fan you are probably rolling your eyes right now.\n\n[Refer to edit] I've been waiting for this game for a while, but can't even play it because the controls just won't work. I loaded it up, and got all the way to the farm then the inventory opened somehow (don't know what button I pushed, because it wouldn't let me exit the inventory). I pushed every single key on the keyboard and every button on my controller and could not leave the inventory.\n\nSo I alt-tabbed and killed the game, and relaunched it. Got to the main menu, and now zero input is recognized. Menu music is playing, the cursor isn't hung, but you can't select anything on the menu and the only thing to do is kill it again.

Also the darkness that sets in when nighttime comes was still there on the next day.\nI really hope there'll be a way to change stuff like the resolution and make it windowed rather than fullscreen because I don't have a very good computer and I would love to play this without having lag. Another I would love to see in the options is the ability to change the controls so that instead of needing to use certain keys I can change them to my preference. (Another thing, my game had no sound at all except for in the title screen but I don't know if that's because it'll come in a later patch or it's a bug ^^; )\n\nApart from all that, I do really like the game; the art style is so beautiful and I really like the story line that's building up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/recommended/328220/","Apokalupsis","✫ Aionion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/","447 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVERY early access game...one of the earliest. The game probably should not be on Steam's EA yet it is so early in development. And for the current asking price? Absolutely not.\n\nFirst off, the player is forced to wait through about 15-20 minutes of forced dialog and linear movement exploration. To be clear, there is NOTHING to do during the first 15-20 mins of the game other than click the dialog forward or move to the next building because you are forced to meet the inhabitants. I've never played a game like that, it lost my attention and interest very quickly as a result.\n\nWhen you finally do get to learning about farming (cleaning up your field), you are told to weed it using your sickle. The problem is, nowhere is it explained how to actually use it (make it work). Clicking Mouse 1 and Mouse 2 does nothing. Nor does spacebar or Enter.\n\nApparently there are quests to help guide the player through the tutorial, but you cannot access them!  All you see on the side is the title of the quest, most of them using the identical title btw (which prevents them from being anything meaningful). It pops up when it is new and when it is completed. But disappears in between. You have no idea what to do because clicking on them does nothing and there is no Quest Log like there is in 100% of every other game that uses quests as a mechanic.\n\nThere is no in-game help, no keyboard settings or keybindings to look at. I had to search the forum for the answer, and seemingly, it's the "K" key.\n\nOnce in game, there's no way to exit other than ALT-TAB and close window. ESC does nothing. There is no saving. Plenty of bugs, plenty of non-working gameplay elements, plenty of forced dialog...the devs forgot one of the most important things for a game: fun.  And I had none of it with this game unfortunately. Perhaps when it is further developed it may be different, but as it stands now, I certainly would not recommend this game, especially for the absolutely crazy asking price. There are so many better early access and indie games that are this price or cheaper. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for the current asking price of this game.\n\nI don't mind the simple graphics, I don't necessarily mind having NO sound in the game (apparently it's disabled due to bugs, which just furthers my point as to just how early this game is in development, but there needs to at least be some meaningful, working gameplay elements to consider this a game. As of right now, it's merely an interactive e-book.\n\nStay away until it is further developed. It has a long road ahead of it.","November 3, 2015","false","0.9"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","7","27","0","2"

I've had black screen a couple of times and have had to restart the game (thank god for autosave) and then I've had issues with the controls just not working at all after I loaded a save game, I couldnt move my character at all. It is still early access so glitches are going to happen but it's still a little rough to get through when trying to complete a quest or move along in the storyline. I think it's worth a shot for anyone who is willing to deal with some errors because other than that the characters are pretty interesting and the game has a lot of potential. Sometimes the conversation is a little redundant but I'm sure there'll be much more content when the game is 100% finished. And the price is a little more reasonable now than before. As far as early access games go, i say it's a 7/10\n\nUpdate 11/27/15\nEpisode 1 Review\n\nEpisode 1 is complete, but it could still use some more content. Maybe some more quests for the town board or the ability to start romancing characters or at least befriend them. I've tried to give gifts to a few different characters but I couldnt tell if they liked them or not, or how to find out what they like. There should be changing dialogue as well, most characters repeat their normal dialogue for the rest of the episode after talking to them a few times and it doesn't feel very realistic. The conversation with the town characters and how it changes is part of the charm of games like Harvest Moon. I also bought a cow and it didnt move or do anything but eat, I'm not sure if animals were a feature in this episode but i think they should be, especially as a complete episode. Also, maybe adding some more items to the shops. Other than all of those things the storyline is getting interesting and I noticed some changes that were made; but between the storyline and farming I don't think I should ever be too bored and I ended up sleeping early on many of the days waiting for the storyline to progress because there was not much else to do.\n\nUpdate 1/15/15\nI'm trying to stay positive about this game with all the negativity surrounding it, but I'm about to just be done with it. It doesn't really make sense to me that the devs can set up a page to purchase a DLC for the rest of the episodes without even a progress update since the first episode. Hopefully they can pull it off because I already put money into it, but I'm honestly kind of losing interest in it anyway. If you haven't bought episode one already, keep your money until they decide to put a decent amount of content out.","October 23, 2015","false","42.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would give a sideways thumb if I could.\n\nRather than just another flash/facebook farming game, Wild Season is a farming sim with a VN hook. The filler gameplay is much of what you'd expect from a Farming Sim (clearing, planting, expanding, etc), but the storyline adds a reason to continue and grow.  Even as you strive to build up your dusty little rock of a farm into a glowing field of green, much of the focus is on exploring the mysteriously isolated town you have suddenly found yourself a part of.\n\nAll in all, Wild Season is a game with promise, but is the very definition of 'Early Access' - multiple bugs are readily apparent (as of 11/4/15) so only buy at this time if you want to support the devs, contribute to the game's progress, or try it out early while builds become more solid.\n\nCurrent Bugs/Issues:  There are some graphical hitches with character text alternating speeds and animations repeating strangely (characters dashing in-and-out of closed doors several times before they enter), along with various other gameplay bugs. Additionally, the controls still need a great deal of love - it seems to want to be controller-friendly (and given the 3/4 overhead classic rpg feel, it should be), but many controls are not intuitive or simply do not work without a keyboard and mouse - the 9 hotkeys and menus for instance. However, the mouse/keyboard don't feel quite right either, with movement issues and action delays, so you seem to need 4 hands to use all three inputs at once.  Targeting plots on your farm is also a bit of a chore, and character text does not always respond to a button push, which immediately breaks immersion (and makes the many text-boxes in the long intro rather painful to get through).\n\nIn the end, Wild Season might be worth a go - but ONLY if you can tolerate early, still-glitchy builds (especially at the current $16 price point, which is high for an unpolished game).  Judging it as a released product, I have to give a thumbs down, but the devs seem to be actively fixing reported bugs and other issues every week, and listening to all feedback given. So, the game may be worth it eventually, but if you want to buy a finished, product to enjoy fully now, you should probably wait until forum topics and recent reviews can confirm a complete, relatively bug-free experience.\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.","November 3, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This applies to v0.7.0.12, which is current as of 10/7/2015.\n\nUpdate 2 (June 2, 2016): I'm switching to negative. I've held off on replaying this game hoping there would be new content to entice me, but it's been nearly 8 months since I first played and patches are still focusing on bugfixes. That isn't a bad thing and better than no patches at all, but it really shows this wasn't ready to leave EA. While they've lowered the price and remarketed the game as episode 1 with promises of future episodes, so you at least get what you pay for, the lack of new episodes since release has left me uncertain of the game's future.\n\n--\n\nUpdate (game left EA): I've played a bit since launch and I have to say I'm surprised at how smooth it feels now compared to just a few weeks ago. Player animations are fluid, no more weird flickeriness, controller support was greatly improved but there's still some controller issues with certain menus. I said before that it was apparent it was unfinished and I meant it. When they announced out of nowhere that the game was out of EA I was skeptical at how much they could do in three weeks, but it looks like they really did a lot! When I get the time I'll try to play through again, see if I can get further than before and re-write this review.\n\n--\n\nI started playing in the afternoon and ended up playing throughout the evening. The artwork is great, sitting in a happy median between high res and retro aesthetic. I enjoyed my time with it, but unfortunately was halted by a bug that hindered my progression. I'll have to reload from earlier to continue. It's definitely a game to look out for, and issues seem to be getting ironed out left and right, but in its current state it might be a bit too buggy to fully enjoy. If you're looking for a polished game then you'll likely want to wait until closer to launch. I look forward to following the progression of this game.\n\nWhat immediately sets it apart from "just another Harvest Moon clone" is that it's very story driven. You're the city slicker invading the peaceful little town of Bedford Valley and nearly everyone is weary of you moving in. Every character has a distinct personality, down to their mannerism of speech. You soon learn of the other recent arrival in town, a replacement doctor for the clinic, and the mysterious, perhaps devious event in the town's recent history. Instead of just sleeping the days away after tending to my farm I was interacting with people and attending the town's festivities (which even include horse races that you can wager on). Unfortunately as the mystery was starting to unravel, I ran into the aforementioned bug.\n\nIt's very rough around the edges in its current state, but playable. When you start the game you're advised that updates to the game will likely render previous saves incompatible, which for a story driven game may be a deal-breaker as you invest time in progressing the plot unlike sandbox or other multiplayer EA games. There are lots of minor issues that make it apparent that this game is beta/EA/unfinished, but very little that actually matters from my time with it. One humorous example was when I got a call from one of the girls while I was harvesting turnips and happened to have one in my hands. We ended up going to the beach, and the whole time I was still holding the turnip over my head.\n\nMy previous experience with the Harvest Moon franchise is only the SNES game and the heavily-stripped-down-but-almost-the-same GBC version. It's refreshing to play something that's more than just "grind crops to shower the lady you fancy in gifts so she'll dance with you at the festival and marry you so she'll stand still in your home". I actually want to know more about Bedford Valley and its residents.","November 7, 2015","false","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
