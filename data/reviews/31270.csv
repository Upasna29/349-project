I live and breathe puzzles, but that's not to say that I'll take whatever I can get. My feelings towards the core factor of the game, puzzles, in Puzzle Agent are a bit mixed, but lean way more towards the positive end than the negative.\nLet's start with the negative. First off, some puzzle instructions are a bit difficult to understand or are surprisingly vague. However, this only happened to me a few times, and was far from the majority. Secondly, there were some jigsaw puzzles that, if you've played the Professor Layton games, are like the ones where you have to fit items into an area without them overlapping. There are a few here too, but it's odd in pieces automatically click together when placed correctly, and they STAY together, which greatly lessens the challenge. Those puzzles could definitely benefit from a better system, especially one where the general shape of objects were outlined and could snap together even if they weren't placed correctly.\nOther than that, I found the puzzles enjoyable. A few were quite easy, yes, but others took me a few tries and for some, I had to pull out a good ol' fashioned piece of paper and pen to plot it out Layton-style. Frankly, I don't understand how some people claim to have spent so many hints trying to solve them; I ended up using only 5 or 6 throughout the entire thing. There are 35 puzzles in all - I'll get to that in a moment - with 3 hints per puzzle, so with well over 100 hints you can imagine that 5 is far from a lot. To each their own, I suppose.\nI've also seen people claim that the puzzles are placed erratically and interrupt the story, but honestly? I've felt that numerable times playing Professor Layton. That is the consequence of puzzle games. They WILL interrupt the story if you choose to do the non-plot-important puzzles, and even some of the necessary ones. That's just how it is. However, especially during the climax of the game, the puzzles begin to weave into the story a bit more cleanly than before, and in my experience, are appropriately some of the easier ones, so you can get through to the ending quicker without having to spend half an hour on one puzzle.\nI think the game's biggest downfall for me, personally, is LENGTH. It is simply too short. Like I said before, there are only 35 puzzles. The average Professor Layton has over 100. It only took me a few hours to get through the entire game, and it leaves you on a VERY unsatisfying cliffhanger ending. Granted, it does pick up again in the sequel, but it literally goes right from the climax to ending in the first, with practically no conclusion. It was surprising, to say the least. Once the credits popped up I said "that's it?" out loud. I was genuinely surprised.\nIt's a bit cheap to me to separate these two games when it certainly feels like it should be only one, twice-as-long game, but I have no played the second as of yet, so I have no info on how the story of that unfolds or if it is completely related. At the very least, there should be a package including both games so it can be one long, consecutive playthrough without people having to wait until they get money (i.e., me) to finish a story that should have been wrapped up already.\nThe art style, characters, storyline (it's one of the "out there" kind of stories, but it's strangely fun at the same time despite its absurdity), and audio are superb. Music matches the in-game events wonderfully, but don't distract during a puzzle, as it should. I enjoyed the protagonist and the supporting cast, and their voice acting was wonderful as well.\nI fully recommend this game to new players of puzzle games, or veterans of the Professor Layton series. It may be a bit clunkier than the latter in some respects, but it is definitely worth a good playthrough. You're bound to get some enjoyment out of it.\n\nEDIT: Oops, I believe there are actually about 37 puzzles in the game; I had missed two during my first playthrough. Also, I'm going to add that I am currently on my third playthrough of the game, and I still enjoy it. I'm going to add that the game is somewhat fast-paced, or at least the cutscenes are, so even though puzzles will be extraordinarily easy to solve, I'd recommend multiple plays because I've noticed several things that I didn't recognize the first time around, buuut perhaps that was because I was intentionally reading into things because I was analyzing Nelson Tether's character a bit. In any case, definitely worth another look at if you enjoy playing it.\nOne final point I'd like to bring up is that of the somewhat "rating" system assigned to the puzzles. Depending on how many wrong answers you give (resulting in the anger of millions of taxpayers) and how many hints you use, you get assigned a rating of sorts. Perhaps unintentionally, but hilariously, there is some pressure on the player to answer correctly on the first go, so you can expect to unconsciously triple-check your answers before you submit. It's really not something to fret about - at least to me, it's more humorous than anything else.","July 24, 2015","true","13.9"," 50 of 51 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","50","51","2","0"

The story was engaging and the air of mystery about it kept me wanting to solve the puzzles. The puzzles were fairly difficult at times (I was being kind of lazy though because I wanted to see more of the story). The difficulty level of the puzzles varied throughout the game. The end puzzles were no harder than the beginning ones. I will say that there were a few "light" jumpscares (if I can use the term "light" in regards to jumpscares) which while not particularly horrifying, were just enough to leave you with an eerie feeling. To be perfectly honest I bought it on sale and there is nothing I feel the need to complain about. Overall it was very enjoyable as a casual and lighthearted game.","December 29, 2014","true","6.7"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","30","30","2","0"

Some of the puzzles actually gave me a headache, and I had to sit down and scribble on a bunch of post-it notes. The story is actually really compelling, compelling enough for me to want to buy the second game.\nSadly, this game is very short, since most puzzles were quite easy to solve (some are actually jigsaw puzzles, come on...). Also, I cannot say I recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic-style point-and-click adventure like Monkey Island, Edna & Harvey, and such. This really is more like a stripped down point-and-click game, where all focus is on separate puzzles. This means no items and inventory, and no multi-room puzzles (the most challenging and best puzzles, IMO).\n\nThis game could be better if the developers would have made the puzzles harder. Perhaps even adding a couple of puzzles. But I suppose that for the itty bitty price tag, it was totally worth it.\n\nLong story short: Good game, great story, could be better though if it was longer and harder (that's what she said).","May 1, 2014","true","5.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","1"

The puzzles are fairly easy (with one or two exceptions which are QUITE obtuse), and shouldn't cause most people much trouble. Furthermore, it's worth noting that the game is rather short, and the story ends rather abruptly (to be continued in the sequel). It's not a "to be continued," mind you, but....well, you'll see.\n\nThe story is....weird. It is to be experienced. It's kinda the point, and is rather surreal (in a literal sense). I found it amusing, but my sense of humor is nicely warped, so that's not too surprising.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kilbyashi/recommended/31270/","Kilbyashi","Kilbyashi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kilbyashi/","232 products in account","Warning: some non-plot related spoilers ahead. Do not read if you want to be completely surprised by the game.\n\nPuzzle Agent is a fantastic idea on paper: a hybrid between Joel and Ethan Coen's Fargo and solving puzzles. It is Professor Layton game set in the snowy midwest with plenty of hot dish of "you betcha" remarks added for fun.\n\nAt first glance, it certainly looks like it will deliver on its promise. While the humor is somewhat subdued (there are no character moments as genuinely funny as the ones found in Fargo) and the story takes its time getting interesting, the art style is appealing and the voice acting is fun. The music is also pitch-perfect, setting the mood to exactly the right type in each scene.\n\nBut a game like this is ultimately going to succeed or fail based on its puzzles. And that's where Puzzle Agent drops the ball. The puzzle quality and difficulty is all over the place. Some puzzles are clever exercises, such as the fuse box puzzle where players must figure out the correct pattern for the missing fuse and another where players must find the missing gnome on a shelf using an earlier picture negative of the shelf. But others are so simplistic that they belong in a Highlights magazine, such as a riddle about how many socks must be drawn from a drawer to guarantee a match and a "follow the curvy line in a crowd of lines" puzzle). Also boring: several jigsaw-style puzzles where objects automatically snap when they come close to each other, making the challenge negligible. Several puzzles are reused, but luckily, those are usually the more solid (if traditional) puzzles with (somewhat) progressively harder variants.\n\nMaking things worse is how some classic puzzles are shoehorned into odd themes (at one point, the lead character stumbles on a closed store, leading into a "draw a line from spot to spot without hitting a barrier" puzzle themed as football players practicing while working at a glass store - talk about a stretch). But some puzzles are just downright awful - the worst is probably convoluted puzzle involving fish eating other fish inside that personally took me spending two of my three allowed hints to even understand what the written instructions meant. A close runner-up is a puzzle about using a series of statements to determine who won an arm wrestling tournament - a puzzle that neglects to mention the format of the tournament in posing the question, making it solvable only for those who make that assumption (I'll save players some time: it's a single-elimination event, not a round-robin affair).\n\nEven at a low price, I can't really recommend Puzzle Agent. The story is good, but not good enough that it is worth slogging through the puzzles (even if they can be solved very quickly with the ample hints available). As this review should make obvious, it isn't that great for fans of puzzles - a cheap newsstand puzzle magazine has puzzles of better quality. Puzzle Agent is a great idea, but it simply fails to deliver in execution.\n\nEDIT: After playing Puzzle Agent 2 (which I purchased at the same time as the first), I would now advise adventure game fans to skip the first one and go straight to the "just good enough to recommend" sequel. Everyone else should probably skip the series entirely.","December 7, 2013","false","5.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Done in collaboration with Oscar nominated cartoonist Graham Annable, Puzzle Agent is great looking puzzle adventure game.\n\nThere are two aspects to Puzzle Agent. First is story and atmosphere. Dark, twisted humor and eerie characters will immediately remind you of Twin Peaks and other Lynch's works. Although the animation is crude (on purpose) and the whole style might belong in children's books, the atmosphere is horrific in all the right ways.\n\nYou are Agent Tethers of US Department of Puzzle Research. Tethers arrives to small, isolated town of Scoggins where nothing is what it seems and myths are colliding with reality. You will move around and experience the wild story by clicking on objects and talking with people. There are no multi branching dialogues and you may skip most of them, but that would be such a shame.\n\nWhen it comes to puzzles, they're gradually getting more and more difficult, although never impossible to crack. Various types of puzzles are contained within Puzzle Agent: visual, mathematical and logical are all in there. Players need to complete 24 puzzles to complete the game, but at least 10 optional puzzles are available. Game also has a great hint system.\n\nPuzzle Agent is truly a great indie game all lovers of wacky cartoon style, David Lynch, eerie atmosphere and puzzling will learn to love.\n\n***\n\nHey, you've liked this review?

It also makes a foray into nordic culture, which I very much enjoyed. There is something intensely creepy about gnomes. The serious nature of detective work, mixed in with comedy makes for a very enjoyable play-through.\n\nThe gameplay involves either moving around the environment, point&click style, or solving puzzles Professor Layton style. If you've ever played one of those games on the Nintendo DS, you will find the play style very familiar. The environment is easy to move around, it has puzzles hidden in it, and the ui is very intuitive. As for the puzzles, there are 3 main types: Logic, Jigsaw and Grids. The logic and grid puzzles are very good and challenging, and provide a satisfying feeling when completed. The jigsaw puzzles, less so (the pieces just seem to auto-snap together far too easily for my taste).\n\nThe art in this game is very expressive. I didn't think it possible to show such a range of emotions on the characters, but somehow they pulled it off, from deadpan stares, to sheer terror, to being entranced it all looks very high quality and really adds to immersion and the personality of the characters. The environment also looks very nice, with a very "northern" and cold feeling. As for the sound, the voice acting is all top-notch, as are the various music themes that play throughout.\n\nThere was one puzzle which bugged out once, but my only major complaint with this game is that it is quite short.

I loved the Sam & Max series from Telltale, and have heard great things about Monkey Island and some of their other episodic game series. I bought Puzzle Agent because I thought it would be similar to that format: casual, short, point-and-click, humorous. There was also a puzzle or two in Sam & Max that actually made me think.\n\nThis game is not like that. In Sam & Max, the puzzles are smoothly embedded directly into gameplay. You take this bowling ball, you click on this window, and you drop it on the guy below. You pick up the bowling ball of your own accord and can carry it wherever you want, for as long as you want, until you figure out what to do with it. If you can't figure it out, you can turn on various hint levels and the character dialogue will release a little more information to help you. But here, the general gameplay is too easy, showing you exactly where to click with no setting to turn this off. It feels like you are in a level that teaches you how to play, but it's like that all the time.\n\nOnce you get into a puzzle, gameplay is halted until you complete it, which is annoying, and on top of that, it is oftentimes a stretch in relating the puzzle to the actual game in the first place (making them seem pointless). Frequently they don't give you enough information to complete the puzzle without a hint, or it isn't well-explained, and when they are, they are so easy, they could be for children or teens. Plus, the puzzle formats are the same thing over and over again - you endlessly rotate tiles, literally connect dots, and do logic problems like in math class at school. A lot of time is spent tallying your score from these dumb things, surprisingly.

Of the 37 that I've solved, I'd say only 5 to 8 were both fresh and challenging. The rest were either much too easy or felt really, really old. Far too many puzzles involved rotating tiles on a grid to form a loopy picture, or jigsaws of some sort. These were really not fun at all (but easy so at least you could get rid of most of them fast). When there was difficulty involved, it's unfortunately often because of poorly written instructions.\n\nAnother problem is the humour. It works occasionally. But 50% of the "jokes" involve characters staring at the main protagonist in silence when asked questions. Let me underline that: 50%!!! It's not exactly hilarious the first time, and it becomes completely, utterly stupid after a while.\n\nIt's not all bad. Like I said, a small number of puzzles were inventive. I also kind of liked the story (bar the humour), although I wish one shouldn't have to play the second episode to see the conclusion. (I won't!).\n\nThe art style is pleasant, but inconsistent, at least on PC. It's mostly "blurred/irregular lines", like in some comics, but then some stuff gets drawn with geometric precision, causing a very unaesthetic clash of styles. The animation is also very stiff, but I think that's on purpose. It may or may not bother you.\n\nIf there is one thing that I feel is wholly praise-worthy, it's the audio department. I loved the music. It sounds like a subtler version of Danny Elfman and admirably suits the story. And while the dialogues won't leave a lasting impression because of average to poor writing, the voice actors themselves made a commendably good job despite the material at hand.\n\nNow, I'll be honest: I don't think puzzle adventure games have a bright future. It's a genre that is great in theory, but never works in practice. You'll always get more, better designed puzzles in a magazine (like GAMES Magazine) and the stories in those video games will always feel tacked on. I didn't like Puzzle Agent, but I didn't like Professor Layton either. However, if you absolutely must play a game from that narrow genre, well, Layton has better puzzles.","November 30, 2013","false","3.7"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","0"

It's a point-and-click adventure game, but the story weaves in 20 logic puzzles that match the theme of the game.\n\nThere's not a lot of pointing and clicking -- mostly, the game moves along quickly from puzzle to puzzle.\n\nWhat's interesting, though, is that the storyline is surprisingly creepy. It's like a very good episode of The X-Files (or Fringe, for you youngsters out there). This is not good material for little kids. It gets a bit intense.\n\nThe puzzles in Puzzle Agent aren't terribly difficult, which I think is a good thing for this game. Huge roadblocks would only get in the way. Instead, the adventure and the puzzles create a framework for a pretty good story, and it moves along at a good clip.

How about quirky, point-n-click adventure games? Or Professor Layton, perhaps? If your answer to any of these questions is 'yes', then Puzzle Agent is the game for you. This game is basically a minified version of the tried and true Professor Layton formula - walk around, talk to people, and solve puzzles to unravel a deeper mystery - only for PC. It's also a very short game (it will take around 3 hours to finish), but it also has a pretty low price tag. I approve of both of these things. Add to that a pretty cool animation style and a strange, unpredictable plot, and you've got a nice little treat for puzzle fans. The only slight issue I found was that the puzzles were really easy. I mean, REALLY easy. But even so, it was still fun to play. All in all, Puzzle Agent is a nice, refreshing, casual game, perfect for whiling away a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Big mistake! I would never have thought that this game would be as charming, atmospheric and entertaining as it turned out to be.\n\nI do not want to spoil much, so I am keeping this vague - but you really want to grab this if you have a knack for "Twin Peaks" or maybe "X-Files". The game starts off normal enough, but quickly moves into "weird"-territory, a point at which it becomes super-entertaining cause the writing is surprisingly fun and some of the cutscenes are hilarious. I was equally frightened as well as entertained whenever the hero of the story would scream in panic - I love those scenes, they are silly, terrifiying and absurd all at once! An excellent mix! Same goes for the townsfolk who are all a bunch of loonies - I love 'em all. In fact, I was so invested in the ongoing mystery and characters - I didn't quite mind the "actual" game which is basically a bunch of logic-puzzles thrown together, in many cases directly tied to the current situation the hero finds himself in.\n\nA lot of those puzzles are kind of easy or to put it another way pretty straightforward. A bunch of them however are annoying, suffering from a too vague description or being way more complex than the rest - luckily you can unlock up to three hints per puzzle so getting really badly stuck is next to impossible. A lot of the puzzles are over really quickly too, and there is very little repetition going on - so the game stays fresh till the end. Unfortunately the ride is over way fast, so playing it short sessions helped me stretching it out over a couple of evenings - but it could be an excellent rainy sunday afternoon game - finished in a single session.\n\nThe only real issue I have with the game other than some inbalances in the puzzle-difficulty-department is the somewhat lacking animation quality - the game could have used a few more frames of animations at various points. But that's about it - Puzzle Agent is "sleeper hit" if I ever saw one, well worth it in my opinion. Gotta grab the sequel and get some closure cause this one ends on a really bad cliffhanger!","January 24, 2014","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Certain puzzles reminded me of SAT logic questions back from my high school days, so I suppose it takes a certain kind of person to enjoy them. I recommend using a notepad, since many puzzles with a logical process of elimination or others with more visual elements are made easier this way. The puzzles are also graphically unappealing - the in-game story / adventure sections give way to single static screens for each puzzle, without any moving elements (uncontrolled by the player at least) and an overall board game-type look.\n\nThe biggest problem though is that the puzzle design just isn't very good. A few puzzles have a set of "rules" that must be followed to successfully complete them. Unfortunately, certain rules are vague and open to different interpretations, and others are entirely ommitted (unintentionally) and must be discovered by submitting an incorrect answer. An example of this would be a sequence of platform movements to build a bridge - ommitted rules include "all platforms move at the same time", and "platforms stop moving once they reach a destination". I know that's a bit hard to visualize if you haven't played the game, but I felt like I should give an example.\n\nIn at least two specific puzzles I can remember, I submitted absolutely correct answers that followed every rule provided by the game, but were not the solutions the game was looking for. Those are disappointing oversights for a game built around only a handful of puzzles (just over 30). And there are 4 or 5 puzzles that involve assembling objects like a jigsaw - these can all be easily and quickly cheated without any effort by dragging a piece around the screen until it snaps together with another, and repeating until the puzzle builds itself.\n\nPuzzle Agent's shortcomings in puzzle-solving are offset by the fact that there is no real penalty for wrong answers. They reduce your score, but perfect scores are not rewarded by anything at all, so no one save the most addictive completionists will care.\n\nWhat elevates the game from "bad" is the story, which I found charming and mysterious. I'm a sucker for the Mountain Town with a Secret kind of vibe. The voice acting isn't better than okay, and the game also struggles with its tone - it jumps from dark and mysterious to silly and unbelievable - but it's still sort of fun.\n\n(At one point you distract someone pointing a gun at you by throwing a crossword puzzle at him, and he just can't help himself from filling out a crossword puzzle, can he? It's looney, I guess.)\n\nFair warning though: the game ends on a cliffhanger without revealing its mysteries, so it feels more like Episode 1 to the sequel's Episode 2 rather than a self-contained full story.\n\nAnother warning: Puzzle Agent 2 does not work on any Mac OSX released since mid-2013. This is not a problem that is likely to be fixed, so if you're strictly a Mac user, DO NOT invest any time into this game, since you will be left without the story's conclusion. This is another example of the Steam Store's lack of quality control, and Mac's terrible habit of compatibility issues with each new OSX release. Who's to blame but everybody I suppose?\n\nSo in short, there's nothing really *bad* about this game, but it's not great. Definitely not worth a full-price purchase, but if picked up on mega sale, it makes for a reasonable distraction when you have nothing to do.\n\n\n5/10","February 18, 2014","false","4.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game isn't exactly much of a puzzler, as most of its puzzles can be solved within a minute. As if that didn't' allow you to barge through them quick enough, the hint system makes it really easy to cheat through puzzles. While I do commend the hint system for being very well developed and fair for both puzzle noobs and puzzle experts, I feel as though it allows for the pace of the game to be sped up a lot.\nThe quality of the puzzles was the real disappointing thing, but there is enough variety in the puzzles to keep you from being bored. If only the difficulty was increased a little bit, that would have made the gameplay of Puzzle Agent amazing.\n\nBeing a point-and-click puzzle game, Puzzle Agent relies on its story to keep the gamer engaged. The story is weird, eerie, and feels like it was a mix of Stephen King and CreepyPasta. While I was a bit disappointed with the story's ending, after some thought it really was the best way they could have ended the story.\n\nThus, while Puzzle Agent is nowhere near the best puzzle game, it is worth the $5 and definitely worth picking up on sale.","December 29, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The humor in the game is excellent and made me laugh more than a few times, the puzzles were very entertaining and many of them towards the end were complex (but not too complex to not enjoy them), the mystery of the story grew and grew as I went on and it ended really captivating me. The whole thing develops much more than what originally meets the eye, and with help of complex characters, the game kept me going and I ended up staying up two hours longer than planned just to finish it. The one complaint I have about the game is that the game ending was lackluster and left on a bit of a cliffhanger. It felt more like a first chapter than an entire game, which I can't be too surprised by because it was made by TellTale, a company, with titles like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us that come with chapters or installments.

My main issue is that a lot of the puzzles' instructions weren't very clear, although this seems to be common judging from other reviews. All in all, it is a great game despite these minor flaws, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!","September 12, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A great little game for short breaks.\n\nWhat really excels here is story, atmosphere and music. The puzzles are not that hard, nor really replayable, and not what sells this game. They are just a simple distractions from the main story, even though cute and fitting well with the style of the game. They are never hard work or annoying, just small amusements.\n\nEven though animations are very simple, and not  captured in the highest resolution, they still convey the atmosphere and story really well. There is lots of weird humor and bizarre "horror", and the music is just perfect. Voice acting is really great as well and the rest of the game feels very polished.\n\nThe game is quite short, but also quite cheap. The story does leave a lot of loose ends, but the end still feels quite satiesfying. I guess the story continues in puzzle Agent 2, but I have yet to try that.\n\nWell reckommended. Perfect game to ease your mind and put you in another universe for small moments.","February 13","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So far I'd guess I'm about halfway through and there was only one puzzle I legitimately could not figure out how to solve. All the others I didn't follow the directions correctly, because they're just so bad sometimes. Also in puzzles where you rearrange tiles and such, in Professor Layton it would automatically submit it and tell you you're right, but in this game you still have to submit it. It just adds to the confusion of whether or not you did it right.\n\nI thought the writing was funny, art style appealing, and puzzles fun when I could actually try one without wondering what the heck it wants me to do.\n\n\n\n","December 1, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Duh. It's not a classic point n click adventure game though. While those games had their puzzles integrated into the world, in Puzzle Agent you go through a story, while talking to people and often stopping to solve isolated puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are usually solvable without having to resort to adventure game "logic". The instructions could be clearer sometimes, but other than that they suit the game nicely, allowing for a relaxed gameplay of going through a story while solving entertaining puzzles. As for the story, it's mostly on the funny side of things, doing a good job of accompanying the gameplay.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a somewhat short (2-3 hours) relaxing experience, the game is quite good.

It's funny, not too long (and not too short), puzzles are enjoyable, story is great (and the writing even better), audio is awesome and, most important: it's fast paced. What I mean is that most of Telltale games will have you watching the character move/talk for 30 seconds, then you make ONE, just one click and you'll be watching for 30 seconds more. That doesn't happen here, hence, my favorite.\n\nTwo important bad points are that the puzzles are not that varied (you have like 5 "puzzle types", like rotating squares or connecting things with wires, and then you have 10 puzzles each type) and that some puzzles are just bad made/bad described so they're pretty much unsolvable without using a "hint" (and I found this important because it'll be written down on your history that you used a "hint" on that puzzle).\n\nI highly recommend this as well as its sequel (which follows on the same story, concluding it and is just like this one plus some new "puzzles types").","January 13, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustyblue/recommended/31270/","dustyblue","DustyBlue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustyblue/","2247 products in account","People seem to generally overlook this game when it comes to Telltale. It's a really funny, charming game. It's got a Fargo/Twin Peaks thing going on with a cute chalky visual style and animation with a lot of fun, challenging puzzles, sort of like Professor Layton. It's also quite creepy and very atmospheric at times, despite its cute and comedic style. You play a puzzle division FBI agent sent to investigate an eraser factory that has stopped production in the strange town of Scoggins, where everyone has some insane addiction to puzzles. I found it to be really engaging and the pacing and challenge was just right. The puzzles are very fair, and you can collect usable hints in the form of chewed up gum.\n\nOnly downsides are that it is a little on the short side and it ends strangely suddenly, perhaps anti-climactically. It feels like there was still more story to tell. Perhaps this is a cliffhanger for Puzzle Agent 2 to continue further. I don't know, I haven't played Puzzle Agent 2 yet, but now I definitely want to. If you like mysteries and point-and-click adventure games or puzzles, this game is very much worth a look, and $5 is a good price for it.","May 19, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can't see any reason to praise this game. The game is impossible to lose or even screw up, you play for points. If you beat it once you can perfect score the game on your second try.\n\nThe Bad:\nWeak story- when you first say "I wonder if this is what's going on", it is.\nEasy Puzzles- At least half are impossible to not get a perfect score on, like tile flips, pathways, and puzzle piecing items together\nNo Exploration- The game litterally tells you by dialouge "I should go here next and talk to ______" abd incase you forget there's a log. Also going to places you have no reason to check out seldom results in anything, no new dialouge, no new puzzles, nada; just worthless gum.\nNo characterization- everyone is static and sterotypical. If you play this and think, "he looks bad but he may be good" no he's bad. Infact this is the only cliche missing, a good guy you don't trust at first.\nReused "jumpscare"- The quotes should say it all\nAwful Tease- You're told to stay out of the woods at night, but the game has no timer and it never transitions to night. You are done before evening. How am I supposed to be scared of the dark woods and a possibly evil entity if I never have to encouter the scenario?\n\nThe good\nKilled a few hours\nI only wasted $1.50\nI jumped once, then they reused the startle, so...\n\nReally it was the fact that you knew where to go and who to talk to at all times that killed me.

I thought it was Rab Butler sending me snapchat messages about his illiterate wife. However, the message was from a myseterious source, claiming that there was a problem with some NHS legislation. I haven't been prime minister for a long time so I though nothing of it. That was until I saw the contact number the message was sent from: 80085. I smirked at first, thinking it was a prank message, but then I remembered; The co-ordinates of my treasure were oddly similar to the text message. I threw on my bowler hat and picked up my cane, ignoring the bus that had just arrived. I ran as quickly as I could to Hyde Park, without the aid of public transport to aid in my camoflage, and reached the last known location of my stash. I took my remote detonator out of my pocket and blew open the ground beneath me. My fears were confirmed when I noticed that the chest that normally housed my gold bars was absent and a note was left in its place: "I have the gold now Clem. If you ever want to see it again meet me at the Old Docks at midnight tonight." The note was unmarked and had the vague scent of lacquer oil. Now I don't know if you're familiar with your wood preservation techniques but this type of lacquer is used to protect sporting instruments from decay. It was at that point that I realised who was responsible for this heinous crime. I quickly went home and assembled the cabinet. I told them my predicament and they said that they would be willing to help, if I got a new dishwasher for the house. So after much screaming and Bevan nose-breakings, I agreed to buy 4 and a half cases of Carlsberg Export for the house to share. I actually got a great deal on 'em because they were 1 for 1.5 at Morrison's. A plan was set up; They would wait by the dock with a collection of blunt instruments and I would approach the area at the specified time.\n\nAs the event horizon drew near positions were met and I waited near the solitary lampost. A cloaked figure rose from the shadows and addressed me with chilling clarity. I identified myself and just as he was about to speak, I gave the signal and everyone jumped out at once. Except for Roy Jenkins, but then that's what I get for putting non-cabinet members in my plans. They beat him to within an inch of his life. He sat there motionless, his shoulders heaving under the stress of his laboured breathing. "Why?" he asked, as if I was under trial. "You stole my gold; You tell me." I replied. He said that he didn't steal the gold, but that it was stolen by my arch-nemesis. Embarrassingly, I was unsure of who this was. I asked him and he said one simple word: "Wood." I knew what that mean. It was all clear now. I knew what had to be done. The lacquer oil, the wooden dock, the missing wooden chest. Something was oddly connected about all of these things, and I knew what. For some time now, the future cabinet has been leaving me distracting emails about how eventually I will fall, but I haven't read them for two reasons: For one, I don't negotiate with terror♥♥♥♥♥ and two, I have a monopoly on the timber industry, so they've been using wood-based threats for years to "Send me a message." Up to this point I ignored them, but now I knew what had to be done. I had to investigate this further and figure out who had it in for me for so long. I would not rest until the identity of my greatest foe was revealed.\n\n\n...\n\n\nOh ♥♥♥♥ yeah, Puzzle Agent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/31270/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","This game is very... fine. I have a lot of small gripes about it but they're mostly inconsequential in the end, it's a decent adventure game and it's a decent story with decent puzzles. But it never goes beyond decent. I'm fine with the art style for the most part but when the images are blown up to large proportions they look very blurry and ugly. Some of the puzzles are vague or give vague instructions, resulting in either the need for a hint or the solution being marked as wrong because of the missing information. There's a weird awkward pause after dialogue ends quite frequently that feels... off. The characters just stand there unmoving for a second or two. The game's pretty short, too, completed in around three hours without any difficulty. There's never any mystery where to go, the game always guides you. The endgame feels like it just... happens. There's a small puzzle gauntlet and a non-ending that doesn't resolve any of the game's mysteries. I figure the second game will do so, but... don't. Keep your games self-contained, PLEASE. I have the second game already so I'll probably just play it soon and all but yeah... not a good way to end a game. Also plot-wise there's a point where you're forced to walk into an obvious trap without questioning a thing, which is lazy writing if you ask me.\n\nDespite all my small gripes... it's fine overall. The puzzle variety is decent though some get repeated like three times in a game with only 37 puzzles, which is eehh. The puzzle design is for the most part decent, though fairly easy. The plot's fine except for the ending. There's a neat thing where your puzzles get interrupted a few times. The horror elements here are used pretty well. The art style is unique and works well enough. The voice acting's pretty good. I like this game, I don't love this game, it's not very expensive and you can get it on sale dirt-cheap, check it out if you want your puzzle fix with a side of mystery novel.","July 20, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Normally, it\'s either good, or bad, too hard, too easy, too short, or too expensive.\n\nHowever, in this case, the reason I recommend it, is because I won it on {LINK REMOVED}steamgifts.com.\n\nAbout the game: Graphically, there\'s nothing wrong with it. The graphics are a bit kiddy for me, but not overly so. Also, the story in the movies you get through the game is very entertaining, and more scary, then I want to admit.\n\nThe puzzles itself aren\'t that great. The biggest difficulty with them is: what are they asking you exactly? Birds on a wire, or crows, put everything on a plate, or put everything on a plate in their order, but you can fit them together like puzzle pieces? The puzzles itself don\'t seem to have too much to do with the mystery/story, which is a shame.\n\nThe idea of the game is amazing! FBI agent in charge of puzzles! It\'s both hilarious, and serious at the same time.\n\nAnd eventually, the time this took, probably wasn\'t the fastest you can do it in, but it\'s a great ballparc figure for it. Don\'t expect too long to finish this game.\n\nIn the end, I did enjoy it immensely, but with all the great investigation hints, I found, that weren\'t used at all in a final huge puzzle, and the time it took to finish this game, I am glad I got it free!","June 1","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearboots/recommended/31270/","bearboots","Bearboots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearboots/","90 products in account","I just played through this game start to finish in four hours and here are my thoughts.\n\nPuzzle agent has the potential to be a good game but falls short. I started playing and found certain dialogue genuinely funny but as the story progressed and became more ridiculous I lost complete interest in the story itself. Now I'm not against a 'random' or 'quirky' storyline, in fact there are many games that have thrived under that direction - however these stories work because you are invested in the characters and want to see them develop regardless of how outlandish the story may seem.\n\nJust for example - there is a cutscene where you are carried off into the woods by gnomes and wake up in a space shuttle in zero gravity where you need to solve a puzzle to get out, once you solve the puzzle you wake up in the lodge. That's it - there is no explanation given as to why you were there and it is literally never addressed again. I was thinking - are you trying to be random? funny?? Oh and before you go there this isn't a case of 'it was all just a dream'. Apart from the random story line this game has provided me with what is possibly the most unsatisfying ending I've ever experienced in a game. The ending was so frustrating that it may have encourage me to purchase puzzle agent 2 just to see what happens but because I wasn't at all invested in the lead character (heck I've already forgotten his name) lets call him detective mcgee that I wouldn't play puzzle agent 2 even if it promised a satisfying conclusion.\n\nThat all being said, this is a puzzle game which means that the puzzles should be worth while. Yes and no. The original puzzles are clever and original - however they tend to repeat themselves and the final three puzzles of the game are hilariously easy. Also there is one particular puzzle that is unclear and could be interpreted several different ways.\n\nSo to conclude I would only recommend this game if you are a serious fan of puzzle games - if not go pick up a copy of Lyne for a dollar more and focus more on the puzzles than any actual story.\n\n3/10","February 15, 2015","false","7.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YeGuilty/recommended/31270/","YeGuilty","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YeGuilty/","737 products in account","Before starting this review, I would like to mention that this game is short, even for point-and-click standards. It's about two and a half hours long if you don't get stuck, and as such, I would really only suggest it on sale. I picked it up from Green Man Gaming for about $1 with my credit, and I can calmly say I was happily surprised.\n\nPuzzle Agent is a rather unconventional point-and-click game, with a highly intriguing story, wonderful atmosphere, and great art style. I say unconventional as instead of the normal collecting objects for puzzles, you're flat out given varied puzzles, that are different every time. Are you doing a traditional puzzle? Solving a mystery? Ordering logs so you reach your destination? The variety is very nice, and keeps things fresh.\n\nThe story is incredibly well written, and full of twists and turns along the way. I won't really spoil much about it, however, this game does end on a cliffhanger that honestly turns this game into a vastly extended demo for its sequel, which is much more fleshed out, and has about double the playtime. With that being said, though, I didn't hate the ending, but it was just there. The buildup to it is great, but there are loose ends everywhere.\n\nWith as many bad things as I can say about the ending, though, the atmosphere of the game is amazing. The seemingly-normal town of Scoggins is full of intriguing characters, and it just feels right. The way people speak, the way things look, the unsettling feeling of being alone in an empty world, it's absolutely amazing, and I really wish there were more than two games in this franchise, so I could explore Scoggins more.\n\nGraphically, the game looks great. Graham Annable's art style gives the game a really unique feel, and just adds on to the atmosphere even more. There's not really much else that I can say about it, it's shown off in the screenshots incredibly well, and looks very nice.\n\nAll in all, I would highly suggest this game on sale. If it were a longer game, I'd suggest it at an even higher price than it currently is when it's not on sale. You owe it to yourself to check this game out some day, it's worth it.","May 16, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME.","August 22, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

PA1’s score and voice acting are top-notch and Brad Neely webisode worthy; the gameplay—if a bit simple—is well-paced, brisk, and surprisingly organic, given the strictures of graduating from static puzzle to static puzzle. Further episodes should endeavor to develop and differentiate the puzzle mechanics.\n\nPA’s concept, vibe, and production values add up to the kind of brief but fully-envisioned storytelling experience that indies are best-suited to deliver.

The puzzles also got repetitive, with a core of 4-5 bread-n-butter type puzzles.\n\nFun for any casual gamer, who likes to solve puzzles.\n\n3/5","December 12, 2011","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Puzzle Agent is a very likeable point & click adventure with a mystery twist. The game is very well produced with a coherent and engaging story which might make you feel somewhat guilty towards the end.\n\nFeatures of Note+ Very cute pencil graphics produced by a 3D engine\n+ Puzzles, think Professor Layton\n+ Almost completely mouse controlled except for spacebar pausing the game whenever\n+ Very good voice acting\n+ Charming and mysterious story\n+ Unlimited pre-chewed gum\n\n! Weak premise\n! Space pauses sequences, why not right-click?\n! Left-click advances dialogue\n! Left-click reveals interactive areas nearby\n! Wasting virtual tax payer money\n! No save-states, maybe owed to the puzzle evaluation approach\n\n- Sequences unskippable\n- Broken puzzles: e.g. multiple solutions but not all accepted\n\nWeak PremiseWhen arriving at the hotel Nelson Tethers explains to Martha Garret the FBI had to send him to Scoggins because all prior contacts have been answered in puzzles. Given that the FBI apparently has a Department of Puzzle Research why haven't those answers been sent to Nelson's office?\n\nWasting Tax MoneyFor some reason every solution attempt to a puzzle Nelson submits costs 75642.98$ of tax payer money. This is somewhat irritating.\n\nLacking Puzzle ExplanationAfter solving a puzzle the player can click a "How?" button supposedly to get an explanation for the solution to the puzzle just solved. That explanation may be lacking as it does not completely explain how to find the solution and how to exclude other solutions, and sometimes it's just a thank-you note. This, I find, is only a problem because of the following section, broken puzzles. Why else would you read the explanation?\nHints appear to be rather giving away the solution than explain how to understand rules of a puzzle.\n\nBroken PuzzleThere is a number of puzzles I consider broken, e.g. their rules allow for multiple solutions but not every solution will be accepted. So far the only puzzle allowing as per rules more than one solution and also accepting them is "Directions & Detours" (2 solutions as explained in the "How?"). Also there are puzzles just not sufficiently explained.\nThis means there are puzzles that may not be solved without hints at the first attempt having you restart the game if you want the perfect result.\nFor specifics see the corresponding discussion.","July 6, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Twin Peaks/Fargo/X-Files style plot is enhanced by some good writing and voice acting that sells the characters. Graham Annables art also helps to give it a distinct style. It's a very simple point and click where dialogue progresses the story and unlocks puzzles, some of which are also found in the environment. Most of the puzzles are fairly easy, and even the harder ones can be due to the rules being unclear, but they were still plenty of fun. Overall it should run you about 4 hours depending on how quickly you get through the puzzles, with not much replayability unless you want to run through the story again.\n\nThe game suffers from a very anti-climactic ending, but I've been told the sequel helps to wrap the story up.

I played this blind with no idea about prequels, sequels or any other information pertaining to anything else but this game.\n\nPuzzle Agent is an incredibly hilarious, adorable, and witty with a worth while storyline that has kept me on edge.\nThe art is (from what I gathered) a renowned artist who hold an incredibly charming and emotionally deep visuals that helps connect the player to the characters of the story. The storyline (revolving around Agent Tethers) is put into a supernatural thriller, turned suspense, turned murder mystery, turned supernatural horror, turned suspense, and then turned supernatural thriller once again. I honestly couldn't put my finger on the damn theme of the story until I completed the game. Which for me, is a good thing.\n\nThe puzzles have been the chunk of game play. The puzzles range from laughably elementary upwards to rage quit level for difficulty. The puzzles all vary from connecting point A to point B without crossing the variable, creating a path that allows you to move to destination while passing objectives, and so much more. If not for the varying level of difficulty and types of puzzles, the story would be much shorter than it already is.\n\nMy only significant negative to this game: It feels short. Unless this was intended as part of a series of games to help shift focus from storyline to storyline, without knowing prior to playing this game, it feels very short. I completed this around four hours with puzzles taking the majority of the time being spent since I wanted to learn from the puzzles, not just complete for the sake of getting it over with.\n\nHighly recommend this to anyone who is down for a good brain teaser with a pretty intense storyline as the back drop.","December 26, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some require some fairly deep logic, others are pretty obvious. The rotating block puzzels and assembly puzzles that keep coming up are somewhat of a chore, as they don't tend to involve deeper logic, just rearranging until you get it right. Some puzzels are genuinely interesting though.\nThe story is servicable and somewhat interesting, though it ends with more questions than answers. It opens up some interesting tangents, then never explains the loose ends. I understand the episodic approach, but it ends just as suddenly as it starts, leaving the feeling htat this is only half of a game.\nThe addition of a "hard mode" with the same puzzle mechanics reworked into harder puzzles would be nice. There are several puzzles that are there just for the enjoyment of the puzzles themselves.\nIn the end, the game will only take about 3 hours to complete.

(Final verdict is at the bottom.)\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nIf you've ever played a Professor Layton game, then you should already have a good idea of exactly how the game plays. The major difference is, fewer and lower quality puzzles. Due to the similarities, Layton is what I'll be comparing it to, because if you have played a Layton game, that is what you'll be comparing it to as you play.\n\nThe puzzles themselves aren't the best and are not always explained well. There are also weird fluctuations in difficulty; first you're solving puzzles that could easily appear in "Jump Start 4th Grade", and the next puzzle could just as easily be the most difficult the game has to offer. But then, I didn't really find any puzzle to be incredibly challenging or interesting.\n\nThe worst are the "jigsaw" type puzzles, in which you need to arrange a set of objects into a particular shape with no overlapping pieces. Poor hit detection means you'll always be grabbing pieces you didn't mean to grab, and the pieces snap together when you correctly combine two adjacent pieces, meaning you'll more often than not find the solution mostly by accident and trial-and-error, which means you get no satisfaction from finding the solution.\n\nThis game does have two mechanics that the Layton series does not. The first is actually one I greatly appreciate: a click on a non-interactive part of the screen will reveal interactive bits close by. If you've ever played a Layton game and missed a hint coin because your stylus was juuuust a bit to the left of where it was, you'll appreciate this mechanic as much as I did. The second mechanic isn't as great: occasionally, when solving a puzzle, the puzzle will be "broken", and you'll need to track down the piece that went missing before you can solve the puzzle. Basically, this means a puzzle can be interrupted by a bit of story or another puzzle, after which you will need to solve the first puzzle over again from the beginning. It's interesting, and it did its job of freaking me right the heck out the first time it happened, but it gets frustrating fast. Thankfully, this is a rare occurrence.\n\n\nSTORY:\nThe story is actually pretty interesting, and is mostly why I enjoyed the game as much as I did. I'm not going to spoil it here, There are some issues with it, though.\n\nFirst, the story is completely linear. After completing your objective at location A, you are immediately prompted to go to location B. This would be fine if the game just simply brought you to location B, but you are instead given a selection of where you would like to go. Now, perhaps I could have explored around a bit, maybe try to find some hidden puzzles, but I had no incentive to do so, as the story was too compelling and the puzzles too lackluster. There may be more to it than I'm giving it credit for, but the only way I would raise my score to 6/10 would be if straying from the suggested storyline led to multiple endings--a possibility I haven't explored, but it seems highly unlikely.\n\nThe story is fairly short, and I was able to beat the game in a few hours. In mystery stories like this, I like to try to figure it out before the detective does, without the solution being super obvious. This story never gave me an opportunity to do that, reserving itself for an ending I did not see coming. But, in doing so, it committed the greatest sin...\n\n...it ended on a cliffhanger. Like all cliffhangers, this did its job of leaving me unsatisfied, stuck in a state of anticipation, wanting to see what came next...which is why, immediately after writing this review, I am going to play Puzzle Agent 2. The main takeaway is: THIS IS NOT A STANDALONE GAME. By personal preference, I hate reading stories that stop in the middle; to any likeminded folks, I advise you not to buy this game unless you are also buying Puzzle Agent 2. I was surprised they weren't offered in a bundle.\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nIf you liked Layton to the extent that you've ever gazed longingly at your cartridge of Curious Village as your head rest on your pillow, until your eyes could stay open no more, and you drifted off into slumber with visions of puzzles in your mind...you might consider buying this game during a sale, then beat it before the sale ends (easy enough) and decide if you want to buy the sequel. Otherwise, pass it by.","June 20, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The most awful are those food/object puzzles, which are made of shapes you need to move in the right place to find the final placement for the whole lot, but the puzzle pieces act as magnets so it's quite lame and not fun at all.\n\nThe plot isn't really catching, you can see there's an idea behind and some humor which still serves to nothing cause both the characters and the whole plot are pretty much undeveloped, and you get to know next to nothing about Scoggings. You can see several locations on the map you will never have a chance to drive to (well unless you're given a chance in PA2 but that would still make PA a really brief experience).\n\nThe adventure pace is kind of dumbed down by the puzzles, you can't really enjoy playing through the game.

The puzzles in this game had much fewer types than I would've liked. And while there are no sliding block puzzles, doing twisting puzzles or tangrams (that auto-lock) gets pretty repetitive after the fourth one. Some of the descriptions seemed too vague as well, making hints almost needed to help explain what I needed to do (or what I was doing wrong). Hints in this game are given in the form of chewed gum stuck to walls, which I liked since it actually makes sense (despite being disgusting). Clicking on nothing important on the screen sends out a wave that reveals interactive things on the screen and gum, which I also liked. The story, writing, voice acting, and crayon-like art stye were all very pleasing, and the skippy animations only helped it remind me of an old computer game like Putt Putt (or my computer was having trouble processing it, but I didn't seem that way). However, it was all short-lived, as I completed the game in about five hours (and I bet you could do it more quickly).\nOverall, Puzzle Agent had its flaws in terms of puzzle type variety and descriptions, but it was still a nice game to play through.

As always with Telltale, voice acting is top notch, but this time they use crayon style graphics to set up a casual atmosphere that really gives this game a leisurely feel.\n\nEach puzzle is self-contained so there are no multi-level puzzles. It differs from traditional point-and-click puzzle adventures where you usually have to find several items or perform a specific sequence of actions before you can advance. Most of the puzzles are on the easy side, but they do throw in a few brainteasers that aren't obvious at first. There is a hint system which, if used, lowers your ranking for that specific puzzle, same as if you submit a wrong answer--although it is completely casual so there is really no reason to care about rank anyway.\n\nPuzzle gamers will certainly enjoy this.","January 6, 2012","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Naturally, being a Telltale game, the story is pretty interesting and fairly goofy. It's short; I completed it in 3 hours. However, the tragedy of this game is that it's a puzzle game with sub-par puzzle gameplay.\n\nSeveral of the puzzles are very poorly made. They're ambiguous, and you need to make odd assumptions about the puzzles for them to make any sense. Most of the rest of the puzzles are dead simple. There are one or two genuinely difficult puzzles, but it's hard to identify them among the poorly-made ones, and you just start assuming that they didn't tell you enough on every hard puzzle. It's really just a sign of incredibly careless puzzle design, and it would make Professor Layton cry. The "How?" button is useless.\n\nUltimately, I can recommend the game's short story, but it's sure to ♥♥♥♥ off any puzzle enthusiasts. Try not to pay any money for this one... should be easy since Telltale loves giving it away.","July 28, 2012","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(all of which btw are easily solvable in 1-2 minutes) What I got was a game that was beautifully animated and expertly voice acted. The story is what really took me off guard. The plot is deceptively sinister. I didn't see what was really going on until the last few frames and then it was a "what have i done?!" moment. I played this at night alone, and there were plenty of moments where the game caught me offguard and made my heart stop for a second. The story has enough quirky and silly elements to keep it from being scary, but the game has its moments, and it does those exceptionally well. It is heavily influenced by Twin Peaks which is always a good thing. There is even a "lodge". Highly reccomended for anyone wanting a well told story that is dark and humerous at the same time.","June 20, 2012","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Telltale software usually create adventures on well-known existing properties such as Monkey Island and Back to the Future, but this is the brainchild of Graham Annable, an employee at Telltale and the author of 'Grickle.'\n\nThroughout the game you are given a series of puzzles that you must complete to further the plot, these can range from extremely easy, to easy. There may be one or two you get stumped on, but there's a hint system if this is the case; 3 hints to each puzzle (with the third one practically giving you the answer).\n\nAs for the actual story, it has a surreal charm to it, sometimes humerous, sometimes downright creepy. One of the cited influences is the movie 'Fargo' and it shows. The plot is rather simplistic and silly, but the journey is extremely captivating. Puzzle Agent, for me, ends up being greater than the sum of its parts.","January 5, 2012","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recently, I decided to play through a lot of my unplayed games. Most of them were mediocre, decent or awful but this game really stood out. I love puzzle games, especially games like this in the same vein as the Professor Layton series.\n\nPros:\n1. A story that really kept my interest.\n2. A lot of funny lines.\n3. Fun puzzles and interesting gameplay elements (like gum being used for hints)\n4. I actually really liked the art style. I thought it fit the game perfectly.\n5. Seriously fantastic voice acting. Some of the best I've heard.\n\nCons:\n1. A few of the puzzles were very badly worded with their instructions. Some of them I was unsure what I was supposed to be solving.\n\nSome may say it was too short, but this is a Telltale game. They usually do episodic games, so its about what I expected and if it had been too much longer it might have started to feel less interesting.\n\nI highly reccomend this game to anyone that vaguley likes puzzles and/or gnomes.","January 13, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this at night alone, and there were plenty of moments where the game caught me offguard and made my heart stop for a second. The story has enough quirky and silly elements to keep it from being scary, but the game has its moments, and it does those exceptionally well. It is heavily influenced by Twin Peaks which is always a good thing. There is even a "lodge".

Puzzle Agent is a game about, you guessed it, an agent that solves puzzles. Ok my discription is a bit shallow but it is the truth. The game starts out by introducing us to our protagonist, Agent Nelson Tethers of the Department of Puzzle Solving. You start off bye doing a puzzle and you get a message that an eraser factory has closed and you need to get it back open. When you get there you realize that things arn't that ordinary. Past this point in the story i'll be giving out spoilers so I guess I can stop hear. Gameplay wise, it's a point and click adventure puzzle game. You go around, find answers, and solve PUZZLES. Even though it sound light heartened the game has an air of mystery to it and can even feel dark. The story is so good that I listened to every line of dialouge. Even though this game is humorous it still keeps a dark and mysterious tone. The visuals were pleasing and the story was good. My only complaint is that the ending seems shallow and kind of hollow. It made me feel like my adventure was all for nothing. Still  , Puzzle Agent is a good game and I give it a 7/10.","March 22, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play Nelson Tethers, FBI Agent, who is dispatched to a small town to investigate a disturbance in their eraser factory.  This game lifts Layton's point & click adventure with non-sequitur puzzles almost entirely, right down to a town full of puzzle obsessed residents.  Even for those who like Layton (like me), nobody gets that excited to solve a sliding block puzzle, so don't get too excited about the gameplay.  Where the game shines, much like Layton, is in its presentation.  Puzzle Agent has a beautiful pastel artstyle, a haunting soundtrack, and a bizarre story that is very reminiscent of Twin Peaks. Like all good point & click adventure games, Puzzle Agent sets you in a story with interesting characters you want to talk to, and locales you want to explore.  Any David Lynch fan will appreciate the way it blends comedy of the absurd with dark and disturbing themes.

I rushed through puzzles just to get to the next cut scene, which in hindsight is one of the glaring problems with the game. The gameplay itself is actually pretty boring and entirely unchallenging. There were a few promising aspects to it that got my hopes up, but overall most of the puzzles put me to sleep. Finally the ending to the story, ended up being somewhat of a let down. It leads me to believe that the game was probably rushed for release and never ended up being truly finished. The graphics of the game could’ve fit well with it’s charming story and lore, but often it was pixelated and blurry instead of looking hand-drawn like intended.

(Final verdict is at the bottom.)\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nIf you've ever played a Professor Layton game, then you should already have a good idea of exactly how the game plays. The major difference is, fewer and lower quality puzzles. Due to the similarities, Layton is what I'll be comparing it to, because if you have played a Layton game, that is what you'll be comparing it to as you play.\n\nThe puzzles themselves aren't the best and are not always explained well. There are also weird fluctuations in difficulty; first you're solving puzzles that could easily appear in "Jump Start 4th Grade", and the next puzzle could just as easily be the most difficult the game has to offer. But then, I didn't really find any puzzle to be incredibly challenging or interesting.\n\nThe worst are the "jigsaw" type puzzles, in which you need to arrange a set of objects into a particular shape with no overlapping pieces. Poor hit detection means you'll always be grabbing pieces you didn't mean to grab, and the pieces snap together when you correctly combine two adjacent pieces, meaning you'll more often than not find the solution mostly by accident and trial-and-error, which means you get no satisfaction from finding the solution.\n\nThis game does have two mechanics that the Layton series does not. The first is actually one I greatly appreciate: a click on a non-interactive part of the screen will reveal interactive bits close by. If you've ever played a Layton game and missed a hint coin because your stylus was juuuust a bit to the left of where it was, you'll appreciate this mechanic as much as I did. The second mechanic isn't as great: occasionally, when solving a puzzle, the puzzle will be "broken", and you'll need to track down the piece that went missing before you can solve the puzzle. Basically, this means a puzzle can be interrupted by a bit of story or another puzzle, after which you will need to solve the first puzzle over again from the beginning. It's interesting, and it did its job of freaking me right the heck out the first time it happened, but it gets frustrating fast. Thankfully, this is a rare occurrence.\n\n\nSTORY:\nThe story is actually pretty interesting, and is mostly why I enjoyed the game as much as I did. I'm not going to spoil it here, There are some issues with it, though.\n\nFirst, the story is completely linear. After completing your objective at location A, you are immediately prompted to go to location B. This would be fine if the game just simply brought you to location B, but you are instead given a selection of where you would like to go. Now, perhaps I could have explored around a bit, maybe try to find some hidden puzzles, but I had no incentive to do so, as the story was too compelling and the puzzles too lackluster. There may be more to it than I'm giving it credit for, but the only way I would raise my score to 6/10 would be if straying from the suggested storyline led to multiple endings--a possibility I haven't explored, but it seems highly unlikely.\n\nThe story is fairly short, and I was able to beat the game in a few hours. In mystery stories like this, I like to try to figure it out before the detective does, without the solution being super obvious. This story never gave me an opportunity to do that, reserving itself for an ending I did not see coming. But, in doing so, it committed the greatest sin...\n\n...it ended on a cliffhanger. Like all cliffhangers, this did its job of leaving me unsatisfied, stuck in a state of anticipation, wanting to see what came next...which is why, immediately after writing this review, I am going to play Puzzle Agent 2. The main takeaway is: THIS IS NOT A STANDALONE GAME. By personal preference, I hate reading stories that stop in the middle; to any likeminded folks, I advise you not to buy this game unless you are also buying Puzzle Agent 2. I was surprised they weren't offered in a bundle.\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nIf you liked Layton to the extent that you've ever gazed longingly at your cartridge of Curious Village as your head rest on your pillow, until your eyes could stay open no more, and you drifted off into slumber with visions of puzzles in your mind...you might consider buying this game during a sale, then beat it before the sale ends (easy enough) and decide if you want to buy the sequel. Otherwise, pass it by.","June 20, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recently, I decided to play through a lot of my unplayed games. Most of them were mediocre, decent or awful but this game really stood out.

Fun puzzles and interesting gameplay elements (like gum being used for hints)\n4. I actually really liked the art style. I thought it fit the game perfectly.\n5. Seriously fantastic voice acting.

Some require some fairly deep logic, others are pretty obvious. The rotating block puzzels and assembly puzzles that keep coming up are somewhat of a chore, as they don't tend to involve deeper logic, just rearranging until you get it right. Some puzzels are genuinely interesting though.\nThe story is servicable and somewhat interesting, though it ends with more questions than answers. It opens up some interesting tangents, then never explains the loose ends. I understand the episodic approach, but it ends just as suddenly as it starts, leaving the feeling htat this is only half of a game.\nThe addition of a "hard mode" with the same puzzle mechanics reworked into harder puzzles would be nice. There are several puzzles that are there just for the enjoyment of the puzzles themselves.\nIn the end, the game will only take about 3 hours to complete.

It's got some good brain teasers in it, but the animation is slow, and I mean slow. The point and click adventure elements were a real turn off for me. I found myself just clicking through conversations because they are slow and the individual staements I can read in a second, and then you're waiting for the speaker to catch up to you. Should have forgone the voice acting and just went with text bubbles. Would have saved them a lot of time and effort, because I wasn't listening to any of it. Then you have to sit through slow animations, which is sad because the animation is not anything spectacular. The artwork is cute, but kind of looks like a blown out tattoo on larger, HD screens. For a dollar or two this might be fun to play on a road trip when you're stuck in the car, otherwise there are better puzzle games out there. I would suggest it for little kids, but the puzzles are going to be too difficult for some. The only thing I thought was itneresting about the game was the laughable amount of money the FBI is spending on solving puzzles.

This coming from a poor man who hasn't played Layton. So... pretty good! As with games of this nature, there's not much in the way of replay value, because once you figure out how to solve a puzzle once, it's pretty easy to remember on any subsequent playthrough. The art style is neat, but sometimes the limited animation makes it seem...incomplete. Dialogue and pacing is funny, in a sort of charmingly awkward way. The story, on the other hand, makes a big deal about SEEMING like it's going somewhere, but the ending leaves you with more questions than answers.

It's got some good brain teasers in it, but the animation is slow, and I mean slow. The point and click adventure elements were a real turn off for me. I found myself just clicking through conversations because they are slow and the individual staements I can read in a second, and then you're waiting for the speaker to catch up to you. Should have forgone the voice acting and just went with text bubbles. Would have saved them a lot of time and effort, because I wasn't listening to any of it. Then you have to sit through slow animations, which is sad because the animation is not anything spectacular. The artwork is cute, but kind of looks like a blown out tattoo on larger, HD screens. For a dollar or two this might be fun to play on a road trip when you're stuck in the car, otherwise there are better puzzle games out there. I would suggest it for little kids, but the puzzles are going to be too difficult for some. The only thing I thought was itneresting about the game was the laughable amount of money the FBI is spending on solving puzzles.

The story appears to be Twin Peaks crossed with Fargo, and just as it starts to get going, the game ends abuptly.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly repetitive - many of them either very obvious or solveable via trial-and-error with no real "puzzle" quality. The better challenges are let down by ambiguous instructions that leave out key details, leaving you submitting a very plausible solution only to be told you are wrong.\n\nI completed the game in about 3 hours. The length of play is due to how slowly the animations run and the incredibly drawn-out nature of the in-game conversations. If it ran things at a normal speed, this is little more than an hour of gameplay to a proficient puzzler. The slow drawl was immensely irritating at times, and interfered with attempts to build tension in the story - just as things get interesting, the painfully drawn-out action elicits an overwhelming sense of boredom.\n\nI like what they tried to do here. I don't like the finished game. The story was full of potential but never came anywhere near a climax or a resolution. The puzzles were very hit-and-miss, some of them very clever, but others very bland. The load times were ridiculous for a game that didn't seem to need any sort of heavy processing power, too.\n\nOh, and there is zero replay value here.\n\nGlad I bought it on sale, and it wasn't terrible enough to give up on. I saw the game through to the end, but I doubt I'll play it again. Given the opportunity, I wouldn't buy it again, even on sale.","October 28, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Final verdict is at the bottom.)\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nIf you've ever played a Professor Layton game, then you should already have a good idea of exactly how the game plays. The major difference is, fewer and lower quality puzzles. Due to the similarities, Layton is what I'll be comparing it to, because if you have played a Layton game, that is what you'll be comparing it to as you play.\n\nThe puzzles themselves aren't the best and are not always explained well. There are also weird fluctuations in difficulty; first you're solving puzzles that could easily appear in "Jump Start 4th Grade", and the next puzzle could just as easily be the most difficult the game has to offer. But then, I didn't really find any puzzle to be incredibly challenging or interesting.\n\nThe worst are the "jigsaw" type puzzles, in which you need to arrange a set of objects into a particular shape with no overlapping pieces. Poor hit detection means you'll always be grabbing pieces you didn't mean to grab, and the pieces snap together when you correctly combine two adjacent pieces, meaning you'll more often than not find the solution mostly by accident and trial-and-error, which means you get no satisfaction from finding the solution.\n\nThis game does have two mechanics that the Layton series does not. The first is actually one I greatly appreciate: a click on a non-interactive part of the screen will reveal interactive bits close by. If you've ever played a Layton game and missed a hint coin because your stylus was juuuust a bit to the left of where it was, you'll appreciate this mechanic as much as I did. The second mechanic isn't as great: occasionally, when solving a puzzle, the puzzle will be "broken", and you'll need to track down the piece that went missing before you can solve the puzzle. Basically, this means a puzzle can be interrupted by a bit of story or another puzzle, after which you will need to solve the first puzzle over again from the beginning. It's interesting, and it did its job of freaking me right the heck out the first time it happened, but it gets frustrating fast. Thankfully, this is a rare occurrence.\n\n\nSTORY:\nThe story is actually pretty interesting, and is mostly why I enjoyed the game as much as I did. I'm not going to spoil it here, There are some issues with it, though.\n\nFirst, the story is completely linear. After completing your objective at location A, you are immediately prompted to go to location B. This would be fine if the game just simply brought you to location B, but you are instead given a selection of where you would like to go. Now, perhaps I could have explored around a bit, maybe try to find some hidden puzzles, but I had no incentive to do so, as the story was too compelling and the puzzles too lackluster. There may be more to it than I'm giving it credit for, but the only way I would raise my score to 6/10 would be if straying from the suggested storyline led to multiple endings--a possibility I haven't explored, but it seems highly unlikely.\n\nThe story is fairly short, and I was able to beat the game in a few hours. In mystery stories like this, I like to try to figure it out before the detective does, without the solution being super obvious. This story never gave me an opportunity to do that, reserving itself for an ending I did not see coming. But, in doing so, it committed the greatest sin...\n\n...it ended on a cliffhanger. Like all cliffhangers, this did its job of leaving me unsatisfied, stuck in a state of anticipation, wanting to see what came next...which is why, immediately after writing this review, I am going to play Puzzle Agent 2. The main takeaway is: THIS IS NOT A STANDALONE GAME. By personal preference, I hate reading stories that stop in the middle; to any likeminded folks, I advise you not to buy this game unless you are also buying Puzzle Agent 2. I was surprised they weren't offered in a bundle.\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nIf you liked Layton to the extent that you've ever gazed longingly at your cartridge of Curious Village as your head rest on your pillow, until your eyes could stay open no more, and you drifted off into slumber with visions of puzzles in your mind...you might consider buying this game during a sale, then beat it before the sale ends (easy enough) and decide if you want to buy the sequel. Otherwise, pass it by.","June 20, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Twin Peaks/Fargo/X-Files style plot is enhanced by some good writing and voice acting that sells the characters. Graham Annables art also helps to give it a distinct style. It's a very simple point and click where dialogue progresses the story and unlocks puzzles, some of which are also found in the environment. Most of the puzzles are fairly easy, and even the harder ones can be due to the rules being unclear, but they were still plenty of fun. Overall it should run you about 4 hours depending on how quickly you get through the puzzles, with not much replayability unless you want to run through the story again.\n\nThe game suffers from a very anti-climactic ending, but I've been told the sequel helps to wrap the story up.

It just has it all - the humor, the mystery, the odd characters, the chills-down-your-spine moments...\n\nThe puzzles are diverse in types and difficulty and even though some are a bit catchy and vaguely described, I didn't find myself being too frustrated about it. One or two hints usually got me unstuck and on the right track. Other puzzles are way too easy and not much of a challenge, but I think that this brings a balance into the game, so you don't spend too much time solving hard puzzles and you can enjoy the story as well.\nThe story itself is interesting and it kept me speculating the whole time, but I'm not really sure that the cliffhanger ending was a good idea. Because of that, I wouldn't recommend buying this game without getting Puzzle Agent 2 as well.\n\nOverall, the game is somewhat short and fast-paced, with only 40-ish puzzles, but it is immersive and worth its price. I personally don't see too much replay value, because there is only one path through the story, there are no hard to find puzzles that require replaying the game several times and, with the lack of achievements, mastering all the puzzles doesn't seem as satisfying. I will probably replay it at some point in the future though, if I feel like I've missed or forgotten something from the puzzles and the story.\n\nOff to Puzzle Agent 2!","September 8, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are maddeningly inconsistent. Sometimes they are adequate to understand the puzzle, sometimes they are so completely vague that I couldn't even understand the basic requirements. On those puzzles I had to lose a turn "submitting" an answer just to see the playing field. No, that's not part of the puzzle.\n\nDon't let that keep you from playing. You can circumvent the broken puzzles by using hints to help understand the vague directions, though it reveals some of the puzzl-y part of the puzzle, not just the missing directions. Oh well. But once you understand the puzzle requirements, what it's asking you to do, you can then engage in the challenge of solving it.

I gave up after trying the bug puzzle in the restaurant, after talking with Glori the first time.\nAlso, this is the first game that I've seen like this, with puzzles as the main way of advancing through a story. I liked the idea, and I got it during the Christmas sale for $1.24. I thought, "Great, a way to exercise my brain with some puzzles."\nI was wrong.\nIt was good near the beginning. I liked the crossword puzzle. Then I'm off for a trip to somewhere in Maine or Canada, and I do a puzzle to go in a complete circle. I get in the hotel and have to chew ABC gum to get hints (ew!). I head to the factory to do a puzzle to find out when the boom ocurred, and I got it right on an educated guess. No actual times are really given, and you aren't told how long shifts are. Then I am told by the Sheriff to go to the restaurant, and I see another place highlighted on the map. What's up with that? I head to restaurant anyway. I talk with the Sheriff at his table, and do a puzzle resembling Winnie the Pooh and them going in circles following Heffalump tracks, where each picture had one more pair of tracks than the last. That was a good puzzle, but quick. Then I talk with Glori. She has a plate full of random food, but they all somehow fit in nooks and crannies. OK, then I talk with her and then I do another puzzle which reminds me of a logic puzzle with the patrons getting certain foods, and each patron looks like a food. It took me a full three minutes to realize the man on the left represented a buffalo, and the woman he was with, a fish. I use a hint to figure out where the onions went, and then the fish and then something else. But the last three foods I put on plates in a complete guess. There was no logical way that I could figure out to place all the foods in the correct spots. So I do that puzzle and get "Top Agent" or whatever. Since I want to get all the info I can, I talk with Darrel and Daryl in the booth of the restaurant. I then am told to put bugs into squares or rectangles. I spent 3 wrong answers on it and gave up. I figured out how to make five quadrilaterals to fit all the bugs in, but I did not have all the boxes in the grid contained in the created boxes. If all boxes had to be used, why not say it in the rules or info? And when I hit the quit button, Agent Tethers said something about stopping the puzzle because it was "creeping him out." Is he afraid of bugs? That line doesn't make sense to me, but that was just a caviat.\nOverall, I think the game had good merit but lost me with confusing puzzles and weird, unnecessary ones that somehow fit into the timeline. So, I can not imagine buying this game for $4.99 and getting the experience that I have gotten. So thanks Telltale Games, makers of Minecraft: Story Mode, Jackbox Party Pack, and other, better games out there, but this didn't wow me like I expected.","January 6","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tabascofanatikerin/recommended/31270/","tabascofanatikerin","Tabascofanatikerin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tabascofanatikerin/","210 products in account",""Puzzle Agent" is a quite short but entertaining puzzle/adventure mix that lets you be Agent Tethers who has to solve a mysterious case about what seems to be an accident in an eraser factory. Or was it even an accident as everyone says?\n\nThe game is pretty much all about solving puzzles - some easy, some pretty tricky - and the rest is changing locations, taking a look at suspicious objects, picking up gums (you'll need gums as "puzzle hint providers") and asking characters a few questions. You can't die in the game or let a "Game Over" end it but every puzzle you solve influences the costs on the US-American taxpayers and your reputation as a puzzle agent, it's a kind of work record (so the less tries and hints you need to solve a puzzle the better agent you are obviously). So despite of the crime elements in the story it's more a relaxing than a stressing puzzle game but that doesn't say that the story is boring.\nThe story is sometimes suspenseful and sometimes funny so it helps to keep you on the puzzles.\n\nThe sketchy graphics may seem unfinished or unusual but they still look fine and especially the unique character designs (done by Graham Annable who also co-directed the Oscar-nominated animated movie "The Boxtrolls") make the game. The music is great, the melodies will certainly stick in your head but for good reasons and they support the sinister atmosphere.\n\nAs I said it is quite a short game but if you have a few bucks to spend and you want a little adventure game to challenge your brain cells this game is for you. Personally, I already plan to buy the sequel in the near future.","July 26, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're an FBI agent in a little town in Minnesota trying to uncover the mystery of a recent accident at the local eraser factory. The plot is odd but amusing. I found myself smirking in amusement and sheer confusion as to what was happening at some points. I feel that, for me, this was the driving force of Puzzle Agent. The peculiarity of the plot continually peaked my curiosity as I solved puzzles. I wanted to know more about the bizarre going ons of this small Minnesota town.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are rather straightforward, save for a couple that had me stumped. Each puzzle is graded as it's solved--taking how many attempts and hints it took for you to solve it. I found the majority of the brain teasers to be enjoyable and at a pretty comfortable level. The few I had difficulty with I can blame on the presentation of the puzzles. You're given rules to each puzzle before you try your hand at it, and sometimes the developers did poorly in explaining how it was supposed to work. This happens especially near the end of the game when you face your greatest challenges. Overall, I didn't find it overly frustrating. That's not to say that no puzzles got the better of me because of their clever designs, because there were a few that did. Those were my favorite because it made me smile when I realized what I had missed.\n\nThe game ends on a cliffhanger and I find myself debating if I want the second instalment of the series. I can tell you now that I will someday. It's only a matter of time before my curiousity of what the hell was going on in that town gets the better of me. This game is for puzzle lovers only. There's no other gameplay, hardly any exploration and the graphics are the equivalent of a stop-motion film. If you enjoy an intellectual challenge then I can certainly recommend this one to you--but only when it's on sale.","January 6","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you feel like it should be more like Wallace and Gromit with sparkles of Fargo? Do you like weird ♥♥♥♥ scaling up in your mystery stories? Well, you found a treasure.\n\n\nThe game is a point-and-click Puzzle game that sepparates its puzzles from the world - meaning no "clicking on every little thing on the ground and combining them in the inventory" bullcrap of Adventure games.\nIf you like wasting times on stupid logical and mathematical puzzles in magazines, you are going to have a pretty fun times. I am not that much of a puzzle person and I enjoy every single one of these. The puzzles are fairly easy, but sometimes your logical part doesn'tt click immediately. The hint system works great if you get a bit stuck, though.\nWhat the game excels in is its setting and characters. The townsfolk are all very interesting and have different enjoyable quirks about them. They make the mystery of their town one of the most gripping short mysteries in games.\nNow, you do have plenty of puzzles, though half of them are only on the side, but the story and dialogue isn't that long. It's about half an hour if you take the gameplay away, so you get about an episode of a TV show. But damn, is it worth it. It presents a lot of questions, answers most, but keeps the good ones a mystery and ends (in my opinion, which probably differs a lot from the majority) perfectly. And even if you don't like unanwsered mysteries, you can just get Puzle Agent 2.\n\nAnd oh god, the eyes...","January 14","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or was it even an accident as everyone says?\n\nThe game is pretty much all about solving puzzles - some easy, some pretty tricky - and the rest is changing locations, taking a look at suspicious objects, picking up gums (you'll need gums as "puzzle hint providers") and asking characters a few questions. You can't die in the game or let a "Game Over" end it but every puzzle you solve influences the costs on the US-American taxpayers and your reputation as a puzzle agent, it's a kind of work record (so the less tries and hints you need to solve a puzzle the better agent you are obviously). So despite of the crime elements in the story it's more a relaxing than a stressing puzzle game but that doesn't say that the story is boring.\nThe story is sometimes suspenseful and sometimes funny so it helps to keep you on the puzzles.\n\nThe sketchy graphics may seem unfinished or unusual but they still look fine and especially the unique character designs (done by Graham Annable who also co-directed the Oscar-nominated animated movie "The Boxtrolls") make the game. The music is great, the melodies will certainly stick in your head but for good reasons and they support the sinister atmosphere.\n\nAs I said it is quite a short game but if you have a few bucks to spend and you want a little adventure game to challenge your brain cells this game is for you. Personally, I already plan to buy the sequel in the near future.","July 26, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not Professor Layton. This game makes you assume - a lot. There were puzzles that took me ages to do, because I didn't understand the instructions. Games in particular: the arm wrestling one, the crow-counting one, the fish-key one. These were insanely difficult for me, because the instructions were unclear.\n\nI'm typically a completionist when it comes to puzzle games like this. "Aw ♥♥♥♥, I messed up, I'll just redo it." No, you have to restart the entire game in order to get a perfect ranking. Nah, no thanks. You can pick up hints in the from of gum, which is available arbitrarily and everywhere. Go into a diner, get gum, leave diner, go to woods, get gum, leave woods, go back to diner, get more gum. It kind of defeats the purpose of having a finite, countable amount of hints, when they're infinite. Why bother toughing out a battle with little health when you have 30 potions and that chest replenishes potions when you leave the room?\n\nAlso, super did not appreciate the jump scares. What the ♥♥♥♥. Why would you put jump scares in a puzzle game. It only happened a few times, but enough to make me aggrivated. I get it, it's spooky atmosphere. You don't have to rip me away from the middle of a puzzle to make it creepy.

This is not Professor Layton. This game makes you assume - a lot. There were puzzles that took me ages to do, because I didn't understand the instructions. Games in particular: the arm wrestling one, the crow-counting one, the fish-key one. These were insanely difficult for me, because the instructions were unclear.\n\nI'm typically a completionist when it comes to puzzle games like this. "Aw ♥♥♥♥, I messed up, I'll just redo it." No, you have to restart the entire game in order to get a perfect ranking. Nah, no thanks. You can pick up hints in the from of gum, which is available arbitrarily and everywhere. Go into a diner, get gum, leave diner, go to woods, get gum, leave woods, go back to diner, get more gum. It kind of defeats the purpose of having a finite, countable amount of hints, when they're infinite. Why bother toughing out a battle with little health when you have 30 potions and that chest replenishes potions when you leave the room?\n\nAlso, super did not appreciate the jump scares. What the ♥♥♥♥. Why would you put jump scares in a puzzle game. It only happened a few times, but enough to make me aggrivated. I get it, it's spooky atmosphere. You don't have to rip me away from the middle of a puzzle to make it creepy.

But since you bought a game called Puzzle Agent, presumably you're mainly interested in the puzzles, so that's okay.\n\nWhere the game fails is that too many of the puzzles are poorly described: either the rules, or the goals aren't clear. For instance, in one puzzle, you have to place tiles to form a path through a forest, to a goal, without meeting any monsters. Except that it's not enough that there be a monster-free path to the goal: none of the branches may lead to a monster, something that the game doesn't make clear.\nIn another, you have terminals on a circuit board, and have to form an electrical connection between them. After banging my head against this puzzle for half an hour, I bought hints and learned that the electrical circuits already printed on the board were purely for decoration, and not part of the puzzle at all.\n\nWith some additional playtesting, and tweaking of the puzzle descriptions, the game could be much better.","May 21","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a very quick, charming game, with an intriguing plot. Though the plot is somewhat whimsical, laying somewhere between Twin Peaks and Gravity Falls, it often does feel quite heavy and is always driving. The plot threads reveal themselves nicely, and the atmosphere, sometimes humorous and sometimes ominous, is well delivered.\n\nHowever, I do think the game lacks resolution and feels like it drops a lot of what is happening very suddenly. Perhaps this is all addressed in the sequel? Still, I can't quite decide if the lack of resolution is affective or disaffecting.\n\nFurthermore, this game is basically fully animated and voice acted with a unique look and feel. The acting is mostly good going on great. The choppy, sketchy animation style is tonally versatile and a pleasure to look at - furthermore the occasional moments of typical Paradox 3d visuals fit quite nicely.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the puzzles are often very fun, but sometimes initially ambiguously worded. They do ramp up in difficulty from simplistic to quite challenging, but I never found the puzzles annoying.\n\nSo, overall, very fun, incredibly intriguing game, much in the vein of Myst. Definitely worth it.","May 30","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then jumpscares happened.\nBack to the review, I enjoyed every bit of this game, story is awesome, and is not finished, but we have Puzzle Agent 2. The game is a bit short, but it definetly worth it's 5€ price tag.","June 4","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In at least 3 puzzles, there is more than one possible answer, so you have to keep guessing until you tell the game the one it wants you to find.\n\nGood fun, but definitely more frustrating than it needs to be.","June 1","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it is quite old now, it\'s story with the \"Hidden People\", otherwise known as \"Sentient Garden Gnomes\" is rather engaging. The graphics are unique to say the least. There is little replay value however, and unless you are determined to get \"Top Agent\" status, it will probably last you 2-3 hours.","May 31","true","39.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've solved about 6 so far, and none have taken more than a few minutes. The dialogue is starting to get boring to me as I realize that the actual puzzle part of the game (the reason I bought this) is not that fun. I have started clicking to skip through the dialogue scenes. I would only possibly recommend this game for middle age kids.","June 3","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
