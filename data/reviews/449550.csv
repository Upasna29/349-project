Okay, here goes...\n\nThe original Chicken Invaders is a simple freeware game which bears a certain similarity to space invaders, with chickens instead of bug-like aliens, interspersed with the occasional rain of asteroids, and simplistic boss fights against giant chickens.  The chickens do not advance down the screen, but simply pelt you with eggs, which for some reason are quite capable of blowing up your ship.\n\nThis game is an improvement over the original.  It features different chicken formations and behaviours, different types of chicken, a set number of waves, and a few different types of weapon to choose from, which are occasionally dropped as powerups.  For some reason, all of the chickens wear an assortment of sweaters and cardigans.  As in the original game, every chicken you blow up drops a freshly roasted drumstick, which you can catch for bonus points, although sometimes they will drop a shower of coins, or even a whole roast chicken, which is worth a lot more.\n\nYour goal is to free the entire solar system from chicken dominion.  You start at Pluto and every tenth wave you encounter a boss fight, after which you advancce to the next planet, eventually arriving at the final battle near the Sun.  Every time you move on to the next area, a short, humorous cutscene plays.\n\nIts a simple game with a silly sense of humour.  It's cheap too, so if you want something fun to pass a few minutes, its definitely worth a play.  You're unlikely to complete it in one sitting, but this doesn't matter as it saves your game automatically, allowing you to pick up where you left off.\n\nJust remember, don't get egg on your face.  (I'm so, so sorry)","March 16","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
