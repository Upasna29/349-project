"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KleineErdbeere/recommended/405370/","KleineErdbeere","Little Strawberry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KleineErdbeere/","490 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSolid and polished foundation for a game that is similiar to other sandboxy games, however providing you with actual goals.  The controls feel tight and responsive, no real bugs and it runs pretty smooth. However there's an infurating stuttering that happens when the world chunks are being loaded and it somewhat persists even if they're loaded into the ram, otherwise the world generally loads really quickly (2 seconds). The combat system has some depth to it that doesn't just make it a simple button smasher, supported by the skill system that lets you put chips into some sort of memory bank that serve as skills that you can execute if you don't lose your combo, including a stealth system to avoid enemies.\n\nThe only real "issue" it has, is the lack of content, which should not be a suprise if you're reading the statement on the store page. Otherwise the game pretty much feels complete. You won't see any placeholders and it generally has decently high quality models, sound and music. So all the developers really have to do is add quests, blueprints and enemy variety.","October 23, 2015","true","1.6"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","22","32","2","2"

So you need to explore the terrain to find the cure"\n\nAt this moment in time I've explored a large chunk of the map.\n\nThe only gameplay that exists is a limited crafting system (which you collect from the terrain and robots)\nTo upgrade your character you aquire "Chips" these permanently upgrade your character using "slots".\n\nThe start of the game is interesting... until you learn the only things that exist are "1 ship per island", X batteries per island for the beacon. Endless respawning robots. Nodes that respawn over a limited amount of time.\n\nThe games asthetics are amazing... just at this current time.\n\nThis isn't a game that lasts over a couple of hours.\nThough i give them respect for the game mechanics... just that the game needs more substance.\n\nOnly buy the game if you want to support the developers make something special.\nBeyond that don't buy the game if you are expecting a complete game.\nTreat this like you are "Kickstarting" the game :P\n\nUpdate: With the recent release of the PERMANENT storm (ugh...) the game has become more of a task to play. In the past the storm was something that would pass over after a small amount of time.\nSure it adds to the challenge, but it makes the game a lesser shell of what it once was.","October 29, 2015","true","2.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

While the combat could use a little more variety, it works well for the most part even though I think the robots are a little too powerful to start the game. The other mechanics work well together and could develop into a good game. The art style/graphics are also quite nice for this stage in Early Access.\n\nThe only real issue with the game right now is the lack of story content. Very little of the story appears to be in the game at this time. This means that there isn't much structure to the game. For the most part you just explore the planet looking for materials to craft things with. The game also has quite a bit of grinding right now. Since I had quite a bit of fun with the game, when the developers add more content I think the game will get quite a bit better.\n\nIf the concept interests you and you are willing to explore the planet while waiting for new content to be added, I think you can have some fun with the game. Otherwise if you have any interest in the game's concept I would at least keep an eye on the game's development.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Preview [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 22, 2015","true","2.1"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","26","43","5","1"

I did I short run and I'm amazed by the quality of this product.\nThe game is unique and beautiful, so much that I'd like to touch it...I'd like to touch every surface inside this world.\nIt is clearly a work of love. And what's most important, the Developers are present and actively listen the community; I have seen myself some of my suggestion implemented, and this even before I purchased this product.\nThe art style, the effects, the immersion...are wonderful, and the software runs nice and smooth even in its alpha state.\nJoin us in this stormy world, because this is truly one of the few offers that ennoble the concept of Early Access.","December 22, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I'm giving it a 3/5, it's still in early access and a work in progress but I can see it becoming a good game.\n\nHumanity is threatened by a virus and you have to travel to the planet Arcania where some of the flora may be able to save mankind. The planet has been abandoned since the working drones turned against humans. You crash land and have to find the others. During your search you gather plants and resources to do some crafting and improve your station.\n\nWithin the last month in a half or so I've seen a couple updates that have fixed things that seriously annoyed me. The lightning was the worst thing EVER! It did not act like lightning and instead followed you in a chain of about 6 lightning strikes. They have changed it to where lightning strikes randomly and not in chains so if you get out of it's way your safe. Thank you, thank you, thank you. They also made the haze in between the tempest and your weather controlled areas thinner and the fog less thick and less blue so you can see where you're going better.\n\nIn one of the last updates they changed the drones to look more animal-like which is nice since there's a little more variety in how they look and how they attack. You are also able to tame some of the drones now which is cool. However, they took out the working drones so the story makes less sense.  The story doesn't seem to be complete yet so hopefully that'll become clearer in later updates.\n\nSome of the controls are kinda funky and the interface could use some work. Being able to see the names of items and maybe a short description when you hover over them would be great. Since it's in early access your bound to come across some bugs. Some are kind of amusing, like leaves fluttering through my station above the clouds, and others are annoying, like my equipped items saying their equipped after I collect them off of my dead body but not being visible on my hotbar (Unequipping one item and re-equipping it seems to make all of them visible again). I would recommend getting the game to support the developers or if it's on sale because it looks promising, but it's just not there yet.\n\nHave Fun Gamers!","February 7","true","8.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It has a very steep learning curve, once you figure out what is meant to be happening it is an enjoyable game. A couple of negatives - some of the places you need to access are almost impossible to reach without upgrading your oxygen levels, and finding the items to do this can be difficult (especially when you dont know what you are looking for or where to find it on the map); and in the storms you can be hit by things which kill you almost instantly, which I think is silly given it is difficult enough to get through the storms and avoid the bad machines all whilst having enough oxygen to get back to the station. It is also not always obvious what is killing you. All in all though I like this game and am looking forward to the future developments.","January 24","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
