Although the game is short, it makes up for that with incredible gameplay, and a proof of concept that I hope inspires more people to create games that provide this sort of expirience.\n\nIf you play this game, I would highly recommend turning off any and all communcation software to make sure you get the most immersion possible. If not, just don't give any hints or commands to the other person that could make the expirience worse. If you're in the same room as the person you're playing with, then don't let any possible frustration with the Oracle show through to the other person. On the (slightly) bad side, there are a few glitches in the game, but they have been addressed by the developers, so if you follow their instruction, nothing should go wrong.\n\nIf you just want a short amazing game for you and a friend, download this game. You have nothing to lose, since the game is free, so just play it!","May 28","true","1.2"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","25","26","0","2"

Less than an hour for both play throughs. There are bugs and it crashed a couple of times while playing the game (Mostly during the start of the game.) None of these were really a big deal. One of the bugs was while the beacon is active, The Monster noises would not play. It is a tiny issue (It really didn't slow us down.) but when half the game revolves around sound. It makes it difficult to get immersed.\n\nDespite all that I highly recommend you play this game anyways. The Concept behind it is amazing and despite the few bugs and crashes we experienced. We legitamitly had fun. Especially when we swapped roles.\n\nThis game has potential and I hope the developers fix the bugs, and take this a step further.","May 29","true","1.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

At least you don't have to pay for the game.\n\nThe Soldier has a crossbow but cannot hear sounds and the Oracle has a staff but cannot see anything. The Soldier leads the Oracle by placing beacons that make sound that the Oracle can hear. The Oracle can hear where monsters are and then hit them with a staff which makes it visible to the Soldier. The game progresses by completing a task that gives the Oracle a key that opens different gates. So far this game seems interesting, right? Unfortunately the game is incredibly short. Spoiler alert: You defeat a monster, solve a puzzle, defeat two more monsters, and the game ends. It may sound like I'm oversimplifying but I'm not. The game takes about 5 minutes to complete. What happens when you beat the game? A cutscene plays where the camera just flies back through the island to the starting point. That's all. The only part I had difficulty on was the puzzle and the only hard part about that was leading the Oracle to different points. My friend and I spent more time trying to figure out how to set up a server (you need Hamachi unless you are on a local network) than we did actually playing the game.","May 28","false","1.1"," 31 of 57 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","31","57","2","0"

Don't get me wrong: I love the game, but it is on the short side, and isn't something you can play endlessly over and over again. (I have 27 minutes logged from playing both characters once)\n\nThis game has an amazing idea in play. The deaf leading the blind, and vice-versa in situations. For a free to play title, and despite its short length, I'm very impressed with this game. You choose either the deaf Soldier who can see, but cannot hear a thing (armed with a crossbow), or you choose the blind Oracle who can hear, but cannot see (armed with a spell-casting staff). The Soldier leads the Oracle through the level using a beacon that's mute to him, but emits a distinct sound to the Oracle. You solve puzzles together that involve the Soldier leading the Oracle to the puzzle to activate it together, but be wary as there are invisible monsters in the game that only the Oracle can hear to which they must zap it in order to reveal its location for the Soldier to kill. Upon death, the monsters drop gate keys only the Oracle can pick up that open gates to advance the level.\n\nLike I said, this game is very short, but enjoyable in this concept. If they added random level generation, the replayability of this game would soar. However, I recommend this game to anyone who has a buddy to play with (over LAN/Hamachi, etc) that's intrigued by the game's mechanics. It's free, so there's really not a whole lot you can complain about. Glitches? Maybe some clipping issues in the level, but nothing game-breaking to be honest.\n\nWell, what are you waiting for?

The audio is good enough to be playable and not be frustrating,  having surround or virtual surround makes the game slightly easier.

And when my friend hosted a game i couldn't choose oracle, because i would have sound, but no visuals (kept seeing the character screen). I'm not trying to be negative here, but i really hope the creators can fix these bugs, because i really, and i mean really, want to continue playing this game.

For the price of free, I recommend anyone able to run this game with LAN (real or simulated) to give it a try.","May 28","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gameplay wise my only complaint is that you are at no real disadvantage for being deaf especially since there is music being played for the deaf person at all times. The only thing you cannot do while deaf is hear the monsters. The blind member is at far more of a disadvantage as he cannot do ANY thing without the deaf.

The concept is excellent, but the game itself is very short and simple. A more detailed soundscape for the oracle would've been a nice addition. My partner also suggested perhaps making it so you have to listen for and follow the soldier's footsteps, with an extra button for the soldier to call out to the oracle.\n\nWe played local co-op, so we didn't have the difficulty in setup that a lot of people did. There was a little trouble connecting servers when we swapped roles, but that's it. I might've been soured on on the game a little more if we'd had to go through extensive trouble to even play it.\n\nRegardless, this is an interesting concept, with an alright execution.

The concept is excellent, but the game itself is very short and simple. A more detailed soundscape for the oracle would've been a nice addition. My partner also suggested perhaps making it so you have to listen for and follow the soldier's footsteps, with an extra button for the soldier to call out to the oracle.\n\nWe played local co-op, so we didn't have the difficulty in setup that a lot of people did. There was a little trouble connecting servers when we swapped roles, but that's it. I might've been soured on on the game a little more if we'd had to go through extensive trouble to even play it.\n\nRegardless, this is an interesting concept, with an alright execution. I would love to see a version that is more fleshed out.\n\np.s. The opening theme is lovely, and the logo is very clever. Good job there.","May 28","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played oracle first, than warrior, and I have to say, it was stressful as oracle, aha.\n\nMy friend and I used Hamachi to play and it works perfectly fine! We did have some issues trying to connect a game, but after closing the program and relaunching, it was fine. We had no trouble with the tutorial, and if you guys have trouble running hamachi, feel free to comment and ask.\n\nThe graphics are stylized but still beautiful, and the little music there was pretty (I launch the game just to listen to the music, honestly). I personally really like the title menu music. The game doesn't have much of a plot, but whatever does happen really makes me curious. Why did a blind oracle and deaf soldier come to this island? What are these paintings on the cave walls? Does anyone still live on this island? Why are the monsters invisible unless revealed by magic? What exactly is the thing at the end? Who knows, honestly.\n\nHowever, I really enjoyed the game, despite how short it was. If there was a paid game based on this concept and these characters with plot and etc, I would honestly buy it.","May 28","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For one, the sound of the beacon is obnoxious, especially when trying to hear the growling of a monster. Secondly I dont recommend doing a playthrough of the game as the oracle. (it would be pretty boring.) Also as the oracle since you can see the monster upon casting a spell I wish you could do the same for the soldier (other player) and maybe even use it to see small bits of the terrain, because at the beginning you might run into alot of walls. As for playing as the soldier I dont have much to complain about. At the same time theres nothing that great about it that is worth being said. As for the game overall, I wish it was longer. In itself it takes about 30 minutes to get through, but if you add on the bumping into walls (if playing as oracle), waiting for the oracle (if playing as soldier) crashes/bugs forcing you to restart, (and since I beat it without headphones making it slightly more difficult) it takes between 45 minutes and an hour to play (and if your like me you probably want to play again as the other role, taking a total of about 2 hours, give or take a few minutes) So overall this game ISN'T the best, but it DOES have the potential to be something more. So if you have the patience and maturity, go ahead and play. If not, go watch jacksepticeye play Goat Simulator DLC or Riddle School or some ♥♥♥♥. You don't have to play.  peace!! >:P","May 31","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is alot of negative reviews, mostly saying that it was too short and is too buggy plus it crashes. It would be an issue if it wasn't free to play, but it is, so at least you didn't lose anything, except time if you don't enjoy it. I never experienced any bugs but it did crash once in the loading screen on my 2nd run. Alot of people say don't use anything to talk to one another, but I find it funner this way, as long as you don't give hints. It requires evolve, hamachi, or anything like that. I really reccomend this game, I find oracle to be alot of fun. I hope they make a 2nd one of make this one longer.","June 5","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
