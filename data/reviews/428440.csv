Initially I was not too sure about trying out another Zombie-FPS but I can't deny that I found myself playing this game more than I first expected to.\nSmooth gameplay and steady advancement through the story made it suprisingly fun to play.\nEspecially the fact that you can blow every single zombie to pieces makes it fun to even just keep running around and killing zombies all day long instead of actually progressing through the story :P\nThe game really knows how to set the mood when it comes to level design, for example by making the deserted city at the 2nd part of the story rather dark and gloomy and adding to the atmosphere by adding constant, heavy rain, giving it a way more secluded and opressive feeling.\n\nI admit that the battle mechanics lack a little bit of depth and occasionally though the wall clipping enemies can be a little annoying but the simplicity of the fights has still somehow a almost classic and satisfying feeling to it.\n\nOverall I would rate the game 6.5 out of 10 and some things that should be improved soon would be:\n-splash damage of the rocket launcher\n-enemies occasionally clipping through walls\n-possiblity to change setting ingame without having to return to the main menu\n-maybe slightly different sounds for dfferent types of weapons\n\nBesides this the game feels rather well balanced, not making any weapon too OP or way weaker than others.\nConsidering that the things I disliked about the game can be easily fixed, I have no doubts that this game has a bright future once it takes care of the earlier mentioned problems ^_^","April 11","true","3.5"," 92 of 126 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","92","126","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/428440/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Chasing Dead is an action zombie game with some great features and some downsides.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You are a marine called Jake. You suddenly wake up on a plane that is going to crash. It would've been just an ordinary mission for a regular US marine, but there are also zombies on the plane. After landing the plane, your missions take place on a parallel Earth. Walking across it, you encounter many zombies that you have to kill.\n\nPros:    Cutscenes | Cutscenes are on a surprisingly high level. You rarely see such high-quality ones even in AAA games. They are acted by real people and have pretty cool sound effects.\nGraphic Style | This game, in my opinion, looks quite good. Some areas look better than other ones, but there certainly aren't any bad ones. There are some little cons, though, which I am going to describe later.\nStoryline | The story is quite detailed and the whole game is kind of based on it. It's true that the whole zombie thing is a little bit over-used in the current game industry, but this one is still good enough to be worth trying.\nWeapons | There are quite a few weapons in this game, such as revolvers and shotguns, but you can also use your legs and arms to hurt zombies with your great strength.\nSounds | As mentioned in the Cutscenes part, the sound effects are pretty good and the music in the background also makes the action more fun.\nLinux, MacOS | Chasing Dead supports all three biggest operating systems. Yay.\nSteam Integration | This game also includes Achievements and Trading Cards.\nCons:    Pricing | I have to say that I was quite surprised by the price of this game. Some games of much higher quality have lower prices so I see no reason why this game is so costly. There was obviously a lot of effort put into the game, but that doesn't always justify the price.\nUPDATE (March 9, 2016): The price was lowered to 10$/€. It's much better now.\nAnimations | Well, there aren't many. When you're reloading your gun, you hold it completely still, only the bullet count on the bottom of the screen changes its value.\nHitboxes | When you shoot a zombie, the game sometimes doesn't detect the hit on the enemy and no damage is done to it. This can be adapted to, when you figure out where you have to shoot for it to work, but that doesn't make it good.\nBugs | There are some bugs across the game. IMO they're not such a big issue, but I know it bothers some people.\nSettings | You can barely set anything in the options menu. You can't set the resolution you want (although Unity makes it the way you would want it on most cases).\nThe final verdict:This was a weird review for me to do, but I have to say that despite game's flaws, I enjoyed playing it, I really did. The cutscenes are just way better than you would expect and the gameplay is just difficult enough to make you keep trying and trying. I don't agree on the price so much, but I know some people love shooters like this one so it might be worth checking out and considering buying it on a sale.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","March 7","true","6.3"," 99 of 145 people (68%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","68","99","145","15","2"

What it brings back is the glory of the 90's action movie aesthetics, the thrill of survival. This game feels like you're being hunted.\n\nSpeaking of the aesthetics, the game looks gorgeous. Guns give off bright muzzle flashes, zombies go down in a heap of blood, and the levels feel like a breathing world. With the rain pounding down on you and the undending sirens wailing, there's clear love given to the world. There's no dull navel-gazing that modern zombie media goes through. We came here to KILL ZOMBIES, not sob over how 'everything's changed' and 'how did this happen'.\n\nWhat other zombie games, even games like Left4Dead, fail to do is give  you the fear of the unknown. If you've played those games, you know which enemies are coming, you know the map layout, you know the screams and repetitive cries that certain zombies give. You know which corpses will pop-up and shout "Boo!"\n\nHere is where the terror begins. There are zombies hidden around every corner, behind the brush, the table, the wall. And they're not screeching like idiots like in other games. They stay silent until close, with the backgroud howls distracting you until that happens. A great move by the designers.\n\nFor $9.99? It's worth the price for making zombies scary again.","April 10","true","5.7"," 87 of 126 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","87","126","2","0"

The story is pretty straight forward and features a bunch of really unexpected locations and enemies. At some point in the game I'm pretty sure that I killed an invisible Zombie and then ate his heart to gain more health. Hilarity ensues! Also, each level comes with live-action cutscenes that are super fun to watch. I really enjoyed watching those a lot, they kind of have their own charm.\n\nAs you can see on the Store Page, the developers of Chasing Dead are also listening to their players. They rolled out several Bug fixes and adjusted their price to 9,99€ which is totally fine for a game that keeps you entertained for a few hours and lets you burst down hell of a lot of Zombies with many weapons. So far I've found a Nailed Baseball Bat, Rocket Launcher, Flamethrower, Shotguns and of course a few Rifles.\n\nThe gore mechanics of Chasing Dead are pleasing, as the models of Zombies missing half a face or half of their body actually look very good. I also liked small details, like Zombie heads that stick to your Knife after you gave them a beating. When you run around, shooting mutants and other enemies they usually go flying and get dismembered which is exactly the thing that I want in a game like this.\n\nThe only thing that bugged me a little is the AI which sometimes tends to act a little stupid, but then again it's not too bad to ruin my experience of mowing down hordes of Zombies. There also were some issues with the Hitbox, but as I'm writing this it actually got fixed.\n\nWhat I liked\nEntertaining story that is played out by real actors and are fun to watch\nLots of enemy variety (Mutants, Invisibles, even a Tiger!)\nBoss fights, Vehicles\nGore effects\nRegular Updates\nFair pricing\n\nWhat I didn't like\nAI issues\nHitbox issues\n\nThe biggest issue that players had with the game seemed to be its original price and with that being adjusted I don't see a problem recommending Chasing Dead to those who enjoy Zombie settings and B movie quality cutscenes.","March 10","true","4.1"," 67 of 96 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","67","96","8","0"

Can't get any worse can it? Except there's zombies on the plane that you have to kill.\n\nProsBGM: 2020 does a great job with the BGM, perfect for a zombie game.\nCutscenes/Dialogue: The cutscenes and dialogue in this game really surprised me - along the lines of what I'd expect from an AAA game.\nStory: The storyline is really entertaining and fun as well.\nEnemies: Lots of variety in enemies (zombie in a bikini anyone?) and boss fights.\n\nConsRecoil: I didn't like that after firing your weapon, the crosshair doesn't reset back at the original position.\nOptions: Not able to edit options while in game and not very configurable even when you access it through the main menu.\nMelee attacks: Melee attacks just feels a little clunky to me.\n\nOverallEven though I had some trouble at the start (you guys may want to add in pop-up help boxes in the plane to help new players), I really enjoyed playing it. The gameplay is challenging enough to give you a sense of satisfaction and the storyline keeps you playing. Would recommend this game to fans of the genre; it has the potential to be great if the game is further developed.","March 11","true","8.2"," 60 of 87 people (69%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","69","60","87","10","0"

How I perceived this game whether it’s positively or negatively is entirely up to me.\n\nChasing Dead is a Zombie FPS that sets on a duplicated earth that appeared near our planet. The US government sent agents and scientist to investigate the planet, you play as Jake who is a marine to retrieve any data left by the scientist and agents in this monster infested planet\n\nPROS\n\nGraphics – While there are few areas that looks mediocre overall the graphics are pretty good compared to the other games.\n\nPlot – While there are many games that uses zombie as a storyline, Chasing Dead still keeps up with the trend and did it decently.\n\nWeapons – A huge arsenal of weapons are available to kill zombies you can even use your arms to kill zombies.\n\nCutscene – By far the best thing about the game. Cutscenes are made by real life actors which is unique in this time since most games tend to do the cutscenes by CG and cutscenes are delivered with excellent dialogue and sound effects which makes it great.\n\nCONS\n\nHand Combat – Although hand combat is present in the game, it really feels clunky and unresponsive at some time during the gameplay\n\nSounds – Weapon sound effects are kind of similar to each other it needs to be fixed.\n\nAnimation – For a FPS a reloading animation is a-must but it looks bad right now and I hoped it would be fix in the later patches.\n\nOverall – For its Price Chasing Dead is a good game despite its bugs and somewhat mediocre animation and sounds but I think there’s still a huge potential on improving this game. I’ll give it 7.5/10\n","March 30","true","1.2"," 81 of 123 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","81","123","3","0"

After fighting himself through the airplane, he jumped of just to figure out that there are even more zombies coming for him.\n\nChasing Dead shines in setting a mood right for a horror game. It has superb background music that really gets your adrenaline pumping and keeps you on your toes. Combined with some nice jump scares it really reminds me at the old days when I was playing Resident Evil 4:) And there are not that much games that manage to do that.\n\nThe voice acting, especially the dialog between Jack and his friend, is topnotch and up there with any AAA title.\nDuring the cutscenes that you get after completing mission you see real person talking to you. Usually I wouldn't be a fan of that idea but they managed to surprise me ;P The style of the cutscenes really fit the style of the game and they underline the already great horror setting of the game.\n\nThe graphics of the game are decent, nothing special but not bad either. One thing that surprised me tho that the game  supported a nativ 21:9 ratio, something that isn't even supported in all AAA titles ;). It is what you would expect from an indie game. Talking of indie games, it does also have a limited amount of setting that you can play around with. You can rebind your keys which is a good thing and switch between preset graphic settings. The only thing that is missing is a mouse sensitivity slider, the option to turn off mouse acceleration and a fov slider.\nBut that's nothing that they cant add through a future patch, also if you choose to play with a controller then it's no problem at all.\n\nSo bottom line is that if you are looking for a great zombie horror game that manages to actually set up a horrifying mood then definitely buy this game!","March 10","true","2.4"," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","39","52","7","0"

I guess the hate train didn't find this game yet. It's not terrible. It's actually one of the more solid indie FPSes on Steam that isn't the same old generic arena shooter crap. And that ridiculous live action dialog between and during levels reminds me of Resident Evil, rofl.\n\nObvious glitches due to whatever engine this is and some things could use rebalancing, but the soundtrack is spot on. The story offers no explanation what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, ever, from the very beginning, and the levels are more or less short, but I think this game could turn in to something.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the game seems very stable, more or less. Driving HUMVEEs is jacked up and there are no physics to it though. You can walk through walls sometimes and walk through doors. Occasionally I have encountered glitches where if you fail or die, a door that was opened right when a checkpoint saved will not be open and cannot be opened, but you can glitch through it or pick quest items up through a wall.\n\nThe gunplay is more or less solid. There are some issues with insane recoil on the M4, and the MP5 model appears to be a Colt SMG as far as you can see, but the only weapon related issues with guns are that sometimes if you are trying to hide behind a wall, there is an invisible hitbox on the wall that stops you from shooting through where you obviously should be able to - something that has pretty much disappeared from game design in the past decade. Other than that the Titan boss moves way too fast and can hit you even when you are inside buildings, and occasionally the nail bat doesn't hit at all, but it's otherwise seemingly functional.\n\nThe developer seems to be working on the game on a regular basis, as well, so that's always a good sign.\n\nI do have to say this though: why does every sci-fi shooter have to take place in Russia? The game description acts like "This game takes place all over the world." No it doesn't. It takes place in Russia. Not only that, but in the most overused stereotypical part of Russia possible - Ukraine and Chernobyl. Yea, I get it, Ukraine and Afghanistan are their own countries now. They are still basically Russia.  Pripyat, Chernobyl, Afghanistan, Ukraine, come on man - all Russia or former Russia.","April 17","true","2.7"," 46 of 64 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","46","64","0","0"

This game propose a different style to this genre and i think it's really good.An indie game that evolves the zombie game mechanics but with some flaw that can solve with a pair of updates.\n\nI enjoyed , by the way , this game and i just write this review after the first three levels but i think i will finish it later.I must say , i have noticed that the devs are updating periodically this game and listen the feedbacks to improve this product. This is really interesting , if you considering that many games after their release are abandoned and never updated.\n\nPros\nVariety of zombies  There are many kinds of zombies, i have enjoyed in particular the kind of invisible zombies , where you need to be really careful to spot and shoot them.Every type of zombies has his particular weak spot.Some zombie has a bulletproof jacket so you need to shoot their head to kill them.I think they can add some kind of zombie in some update to make the game more challenging. I would like too if they make them run more faster and add more crowds in the levels to make the game more adrenalinic.	Cutscenes This is the first time after many years that i see again cutscenes with real actors. I must add that they are very good to act and not some cheap actor that just look the screen and read something. Of course , i liked much the hot chicks in the cutscenes , many games should do that too.	Story The game merges the zombie movie with aliens in a nice B-Movie background. I liked that too much and the way the story evolves is very entertaining.\nCons\nBugs I noticed a pair of times bugs with the hitbox. If i try to hit zombies with knife , not always the hits do damage. I don't know why i can't open menu pressing ESC button , so i had to close the game pressing Alt+F4.I think a good update can solve it.	Add more zombies Good variety of zombies but i think that there aren't enough in every level to feel the game adrenalinic like a classic zombie games. I have found them a bit slow for my taste. Improve the number and speed of the zombies.	Can't reload while running I think it's important for a zombie game run to avoid the damage and reloading after emptied a cartridge on a zombie crowd.Please fix this feature i think it's fundamental for the game.	Reduce lightings of the game I have found the torch in every level but i think it's very useless because i can see clearly without it , even in underground levels. Reduce the lighting in restricted space so it can be more worth to use it and can be a little more scary to play.\nIn substance , a promising indie game with a B-Movie background and some particular feature.I think it's worth the try.They have also reduced the price , listening the reviewers' feedback, and they're periodically updating this game.\n\nI had the code of the game by the developers for reviewal purpose. The objectivity of the review is not affected by this aspect.","March 9","true","1.1"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","30","38","0","0"

One of the First Game that caught my attention was the indie production Chasing dead, what can i say? Its intense and it has no mercy and it is pretty demanding, even on low difficulty. When you like movie’s like The Virus or Planet Terror, this Game should be your choice.\nThey feature a big amount of weapons, you get an open world with a good pace, classic gameplay features like health containers from dead enemies or you find loot spots like in a survival game. A lot of guns literally from your feet to a flamethrower. You’re going to see a lot of different enemy types and a lot of open world locations, all over the world.\nThe idea in using real actors, adds a lot to the game. It brings storytelling to a higher level, that’s more that you can expect out of an indie development. Honestly, how many Triple-A title bring such an immersive impact into a game and this is just a little indie game studio.\nI like it and I like indie productions, where you can see their’ afford in making a full game and NOT just an early access bonanza that haunted you for years.\n\nDeutsch:\n\nIch habe nach einem Horror-Shooter gesucht und hab mich durch den Steamshop gegraben und habe Chasing dead gefunden. Als Freund von classischen Filmen wie The Virus oder Planet Terror, hat mir die Szenarie sehr gefallen.\nDas Spiel bietet erstaunlich viele Waffen und eine open World, die einem nichts schenkt. Auch klassische Elemente wie Bosskämpfe oder Gesundheitsbehälter von toten Gegnern, bringen einen schon einmal in schwitzen, selbst auf niedrigem Schwierigkeitsgrad. Es gibt viele Gegnertypen und möglichkeiten diese zu töten. Von Fusstriten, über div. Schusswaffen bis zum Flammenwerfer ist alles dabei.\nWirklich erstaunt, hat mich dass sie echte Schauspieler für Ihre Zwischensequenzen benutzt haben. Das hilft beim erzählen der Geschichte und hilft dem Spiel mehr als nur den Charme, einer Indie Produktion zu geben.\nMir gefällt es und ich mag Indie Produktion, die viel wollen. Man sieht den Aufwand den sie betreiben.","March 5","true","2.7"," 38 of 53 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","38","53","0","0"

Chasing Dead is a FPS/Sci-Fi Horror game. It's got a unique story.\n\nThe story overall was quite cool and it drew me in as I like Zombie games and I'm willing to try a new one out.

The boss was quite interesting and fun to play against. There are a few glitches here and there but nothing a patch can't fix. The detection on picking up items was a bit weird, but once again can be easily fixed. The visuals are good looking, and the guns sound good too.\n\nOverall this game is quite fun, and if the developers continue to stick with and support the game, it can be pretty good.

The game starts with many cutscenes which develop the story but you soon find your character Jake heading to the alternate earth where he immediately finds action in the form of a zombie infested plane.\n\nThe combat was decent although controller support should now be automatic for this type of game and I was shocked to see it missing. Great weapon selection although on the plane there seemed to be a few too many autmatic weapons lying around for a commercial flight. :) The plane boss was unique as it phased in and out almost Predator like which was challenging.\n\nMy major beef is that the game is glitchy. I lost count of how many zombies were stuck in seats or in walls and I also found that simple tasks like picking up weapons are hit and miss. Sometimes you have to be pointed in precisely the right direction to grab something which can be frustrating when you have attackers coming at you from 3 different directions.\n\nGraphics are good and sound effects are ok although gunfire sounds a little off to me. The inclusion of hot looking women thoughout the game doesn't hurt this games cause any. :D\n\nConceptually Chasing Dead is a breath of fresh air but it suffers from some playability issues which can be overcome if the developers continue to stick with and support the game. Clean up the glitches... add controller support and they could have something special here. Keeping my fingers crossed that this happens.\n\nI gave this game a positive review... but just.","March 5","true","7.4"," 42 of 62 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","42","62","8","2"

Nevertheless sadly eventhough teh game is decent, its not that impressive at its current state.\n\nFirst thing that catched my eye and peaked my interests were the awesome cutscenes and the story, but as soon as the gameplay started, the bar lowered down quite a bit.\n\nGraphic models are great, but textures are effects starts to look bit outdated and definitely need more polishing\n\nSo. About gameplay, this is where it gets interesting and my thoughts are mixed. Goods : It is challenging, you may repeat first level once or even a few times before you actually understand on how to kill something. Another surprise came in first ground level. While you're taking down helicopter, It has a healthbar?\nReally?! I thought we left that back in the 90's, Why would i need to shoot 9 rockets to take it down o.O\nOn the Bright side, everything else is good, you can chop and massacre zombies and thats whats great.\n\nOverall thoughts are mixed.

The premise is excellent and even the movie scenes are good in an ultra B Movie kind of way but thats where my enjoyment with Chasing Dead Ends. I really wanted to like this game sooooo much but it really isnt what it first seems.\n\nI am not a game hater. If you look at most of my Steam reviews most are positive but this one really left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nUpon beginning the first level there is no guide to controls and after finally realising that F1 gives you a rather rudimentary list of controls I finally worked out that F is pick stuff up... Cycle through weapons is normal but if you run out of ammo you can only get back to your knife by pressing H... which is cumbersome and odd....\n\nThese issues aside I quickly relaised that collision detection was horrible making the knife virtually useless as most of the time I missed the enemy and ended up being killed. This continues throughtout with clipping issues, wierd bugs and lets not forget poppin that would make a UK cafe chain proud (big props if you get the reference)\n\nEnemies have this wierd spawn mechanic where they spawn in groups... the exact same groups... on the Game's second level (which is ripped straight out of Unity and can be seen in other low budget "indie" titles) everytime an emey group spawns you get 2 police officers, a woman in yellow, a woman in brown, a skinless zombie and a little girl..... every single time.\n\nThe graphics are weak even on max settings and the screenshots on Steam Have been Photoshopped to hell and back to look much much better...\n\nThere is lots of wierd graphical issues to do with the flashlight and lots of bizarre water textures everywhere.\n\nThe Game does not explain what to do or where to go and only displays markers when you are literally on an objective.... and not in a ging back to basics making games hard again type of way just a bad bad way.\n\nThe game feels super cheap but looking at the price tag makes me hurl with disbelief this is how much the game costs.\n\nI cannot... not... recommend this game enough. I know its an indie dev and I know it has a B Movie kind of vibe but ripping off indie assets straight out of unity and a plethora of lazy decisions and programming makes this a tough sell at $25!!!!\n\nSo much promise and so disappointing.\n\nFor our video footage please check out our examines video here: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-examines/160304_game-tutor-examines-chasing-dead\n\nIf you check the comments section I have posted some updates to this review.\n\nI WAS PROVIDED A REVIEW CODE BY THE DEVELOPER FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRODUCING A REVIEW.

Well, a bit longer than that.  I stopped partway through writing this review and tried another level.  Nope.  I bought this on sale of $9.99 and wish I hadn't.    Glad I didn't pay the normal $24+\n\nLikes\n- Price\n- FPS\n\nDislikes\n- Worst voiceover's I think I've ever heard in a game.  If you are going to add voice to the game it has to be good.  Imagine if Erica had voiced GlaDOS (Portal)...\n- When Erica was speaking in between levels II nearly broke my Esc key trying to get her to stop.  Nope.   Being forced to listen to the  horrible dialouge that didn't seem to add any meaningful content to the game really turned me off.  Bored, tired, "I don't want to be here" inflection.   I would have rather just read the text, which was different than what she was stumbling through anyway.  Lena wasn't any better either.\n- Change the physics on the cabin curtains.  (airplane level)  I should have been able to breeze right through them like they weren't even there.  Instead, I felt like I was trying to surface in a pool with a heavy wet carpet blocking my path.\n- I didn't care for the game mechanics/graphics.  I've played much older games that had a better feel than this.\n\nSadly this game really didn't do a thing for me.  I'd much rather play any of the old Quake series vs this.","May 22","false","1.0"," 28 of 59 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","28","59","0","1"
