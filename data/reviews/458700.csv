If you like that kind of games than this is maybe for you but I don't recommend it.\n\nPros:\nmany levels\ndifficult\nco-operative\nCons:\nmonotone\nbackground music is somewhat boring\nno effects at all\nugly graphics (this kind of graphics is used in pre 90s). I personally don't care much for graphics if gameplay surpass it but here is not that case\nVerdict: another unity crap. Hide it or delete.\n\nCheers!","April 8","false","0.2"," 78 of 109 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","78","109","3","5"

Here we can find the same idea but in a more playable form, you have like 7 different modes + impossible mod (which i still have to unlock so cant say anything about that yet), each of them has its own dodge mechanics, it's a nice game to improve mouse controls and mutlitasking.\n\n+Different mods\n+Each mode has like 30 difficulty levels\n+You can play together with your friend using keyboard\n+Pretty time consuming if you decide to unlock impossible mode, cus you have to grind up some coins and unlock all the previous modes\n+Improves time of reaction and multitasking skills + peripheral vision\n+Low price is obvious plus\n-I accidentally bought some pretty expensive *bonuses* when i went to the shop, i think it should have at least some accept button, not just instabuy when you click on it, and you cant revert the sell","April 7","true","8.2"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","32","46","8","7"
