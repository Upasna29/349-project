This is not a casual experience you sit in front of and make stuff happen, this is a game were everything takes it's sweet time to do...something-anything! It does things on its own, and every so often you need to come back and make sure nothing dies. Although its not the best game, it certainly is entertaining.","December 28, 2013","true","3.0"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","0"

Creating and breeding your own fish types is pretty awesome and rewarding.  There is so much to talk about in this game I don’t know where to start. First off I want to make this clear, it’s a Tycoon game, meaning you have to grow yourself into a huge monopoly by using strategies and methods of your choosing to make as much money as possible. It’s almost like a complex pet simulator which may not be attractive to a lot of people. One cool feature of the game is that it even plays itself while it is not being played at all (and when the game is turned off O_o), you gotta check in on your fish every so often to see how they’re doing.  You can also breed over 400+ different types of fish in this game which is crazy. The game starts out kinda rough and slow, but then it picks up as you start Tycooning in dis ♥♥♥♥♥. If you loved gigapets then you’ll love this game because it is like a gigapet times 6,000!!\n\nReplay Value: There is a lot of replay value here\n\nDifficulty: The game starts out pretty hard at first seeing how you have little money to spend\n","December 26, 2012","true","32.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The seemingly endless assorment of few and far between fish has yet to be fully discovered by great minds such as Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein. Not only this, the age defying, eye popping graphics dont for one second make you think this is a normal game. In conclusion, if you are a fan of vast, impossible arrays of unsolvable enigmas, this game is for you.","April 26, 2014","true","7.5"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","10","18","7","2"

What's pertinent is that this game is a relatively simple, "indie" simulator set in a fish store.  What's more, it's literally "real time"; your fish only spawn / grow in actual days / weeks, meaning if you breed off a set of new and interesting hybrids... it'll be days before you can do anything with them.  Some folks appreciate this "realism", I guess, but it strikes me as an odd choice when everything else (inter-species breeding, "magic fish", etc.)  is completely fictionalized.  In the end, it makes for a game that doesn't have a lot of "bite" to it, and requires relatively large amounts of "real time" in order to see any kind of progress.  Frankly, I can find better ways to watch the hours tick by.","September 16, 2014","false","21.5"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","6","18","0","0"
