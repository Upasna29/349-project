The art style is quite simple but looks gorgeous.\n\nNow on to the game itself.\n\nThere are two team (Red and Green) and there are currently 8 different classes and they all look very different (Making them easy to differentiate) and there are many variety of maps.\n\nYou both get a side of the map and start with spawners. You then have to take over class spawners (Each map has different kinds of spawners). Then eventually you have to take over the other players spawners. Once you take over their spawners, it's GG.\n\nAnother very good thing about the game is that the matches are short and quite intense (Which is very good in my opinion).\n\nI haven't played much because not many people had the game (<20) and i've only found 2 people in online matches.\nBut this was before the early access.\nNOw it's in early access, i will be playing this more often and after the addition of steam workshop, it'll be a very good game!\n\nCosting less than Â£2 (08/01/2014), i don't see how you can go wrong with this game\n\nRecommended :D\n","January 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","33","42","0","0"

Everything seems to work, and work well.\n\nThis is a very simple to learn RTS, with good level design (thus far), a pretty good base mechanic, and a brilliant art style (literally and figuratively, the lighting is a bit intense).\n\nThe basic premise is that you control a constantly-spawning highly mutable lifeform, and by taking and holding various points around the map you gain access to different sets of abilities for your units. Basic units spawn at a constant rate, and the biggest challenge lies in determining what to turn them into and where to attack. Resource management boils essentially down to "how long do I wait before expanding", which is a simple enough thing to measure.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nAs I've said, the art design is excellent. Seriously, everything is pretty clear in its function at a glance and the game looks gorgeous.\n\nIt's got a really intuitive interface. Even novice RTS players should be able to pick this up and figure out just about everything extremely easily.\n\nSpeedy matches aren't something I'm used to in any RTS. It's nice to be able to knock out a quick game or two instead of an hours-long slog sometimes.\n\nIt's quickly engaging, and the additional features that are supposed to make that even better.\n\nThe downsides:\n\nIf you're looking for something with a lot of depth, look elsewhere. There aren't lots of resources to juggle, there's no campaign, it is exactly what it appears to be.\n\nIt's really heavy into micromanaging units for a sizeable portion of each game. Towards the end it can get a bit more macro, but misplacing half a dozen guys (not tough to do) can have pretty dire consequences early on.\n\nMomentum is massively important. This isn't a negative thing necessarily, but it becomes pretty clear pretty quickly who has the advantage in a battle. It's possible to come back if you're behind, but there's an obvious tipping point.\n\nYou can't control units while you're zoomed out. That's a bit of an odd design decision and I'm sure there's a reason for it, but it's a little bit frustrating.\n\nAll in all this is extremely well done, and for the price you seriously can't beat it for entertainment value.","February 16, 2015","true","7.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

Unlike Eufloria, certain bases are dedicated to spawning units while others are not. Instead, other bases allow you to convert units from "basic" to something else with each unit class having its own strengths, weaknesses, and stats. It's a very tactical game and the AI is incredibly challenging, even on the "easy" difficulty setting. A map editor will be introduced down the line which I'll be interested to try out. I would have liked the ability to be able to set the number of AI opponents...at present, it seems like maps only support a total of two players. It would be fun to see what a three or four player game would look like, I think. $3 is a good value for what the game currently offers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhjE4_8KFjQ","January 8, 2015","true","1.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

Strategies are key to this game as without them the opposition will have the advantage. Combining fast moving weak minions with slow but strong crabs is more effective than just crabs as they will just get annihalated. After a while of gameplay the game will speed up making you act more efficiently.\n\n---Conclusion---\nThis game is definately for RTS fans and even casual gamers. I give the game a 9/10 for being fun, unique and a true gem of a game!\n\n---YouTube Video---\nA few games with my friend which shows that tactics really do matter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_4m652KCnA","January 8, 2015","true","3.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

Never.\nBut Boid is an exception. This game doesn't feel like an Early Access game.\n\nI first had the chance to play Boid at Gamescom 2014 in Cologne and totally loved it. After completing tinybuild's card collection game I received a beta invitation for Boid and since then I'm playing the game and enjoying it.\nIt's a very entertaining RTS which is a lot of fun at current state. Even though the game is a little bit short on content the current price is more than fair. The fact that this game is still in Early Access should tell you that more content is on it's way and the price will increase in the future! At the moment the game is incredibly low priced for what it already provides on content so even if you're only interested in a game you can play every once in a while take a shot and try it out.","January 8, 2015","true","4.1"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","2"

Often you need to accomplish A and B before C can be completed. Boid takes an entirely new spin on an old favorite by simplifying it into something that is easily digestable, even if you only have a few minutes to sit down and play. The accessibility of Boid is certainly one of its strongest tenants. Basic units come from Spawn Pools, then they are put into a larger pool to turn them into the class of your choosing as identified by the symbols. The classes are quite varied, though most maps don't feature all the classes at once. Scouts are fast but lack defense, Crabs have massive attack but low speed. There are healers, poison-support units, and even kamikaze bombers! Figuring out how you prefer to coordinate them is great fun, and there is really no wrong answer which leads to a world of replayability. Once you have a sizeable force, you can set them up as a barricade to repel enemy intruders. The troops will need to be reinforced after each skirmish, which kept me delightfully rushing about the pool upgrading units and trying to keep my army of microorganisms bolstered enough to repel any danger. Some classes do counter each other, which means you'll probably want a mixed regiment of units to protect each of your spawn pools. If all you have is Crabs and Basics and an enemy Bomb shows up, they'll all be blown to smithereens... One shot with a ranged Gun unit could've saved them if only I had the foresight. This class-based RTS is simple, fast-paced, brutal, and I love it. Let's take an even deeper look at Boid.\n\nOne of the first things I feel I should mention is the online multiplayer. Currently there is only a 1v1 mode, but any game that is released with the capability for some raw PvP gives me a warm fuzzy feeling. Bots send tiny regiments of units to scout your defenses, however most player fights end up as a giant war of attrition. While bot battles are usually short and succinct, PvP battles can rage on for upwards of thirty minutes. The center of the battlefield becomes a killing field, wave after wave of units, some too young to even have a class, sent to die for your glory. It reminds me a lot of trench warfare, both players sacrificing everything they have in order to gain just a few more feet of leverage. Then, just when you think you've pushed them into hiding, a regiment of scouts executes a flanking attack that decimates your forward force. The action is extremely tense, which impresses me to no end mostly because of the simplicity of the graphics. Everything is portrayed in minimal detail, but at the same time, nothing feels left out. At no point did I feel confused about if a unit was functioning, from the Bomb's rippling explosion to the Medic's healing wave, everything feels wonderfully pieced together. Currently the map selection is minimal, but Steam Workshop support will soon be added, allowing you to create your very own microscopic battleground.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesn't have any background music during the actual battle. The music that is offered during the selection menu is quite fitting though, and when ordered to move the different classes will utter unique cries of confirmation. You start to feel connected to your microscopic minions. Proud of their victories, though when they are defeated it is only due to your tactics. Strategies must be shifted based on the layout of the map, and the spawn/class pools. The game never felt over my head, and even features a brief tutorial. I'm extremely impressed at how easy it is to isolate a class, or break off a regiment from your main force. There are red pulses on the edge of your screen which let you know if you're being attacked, and in which direction. If one you capture a pool, or get one of yours taken the entire screen will flash. There are very important minor details that make the game feel much more alive, especially when facing a top level player. A squad of Scouts can be sent to distract at one spawning pools, while the bulk of your fighting forces takes another. I desperately want to see four-player maps with every unit available. Currently the price sits at $3, which is unbelievable for what is offered. The price will increase when workshop support is added, and again when single-player campaigns are finally offered. My suggestion would be to jump on this bandwagon as soon as possible. Boid offers a swarm of fun and can only get better. I'm positive that with Workshop support, this microscopic game could blow up bigger than it ever dreamed.\n\nThere is little to say negatively about Boid. It does feel a bit bare bones, but for a recently released Early-Access title it is extremely playable. The player-base is currently quite tiny so you might be waiting for a while to hop into any PvP battles, but hopefully that will be remedied in-part with this review. I feel that the class UI could be cleaned up slightly with the addition of hotkeys, since the cursor really does need to be everywhere at once in this sort of action-RTS. Right now the game can become anything, and while hope springs eternal, reality is usually a lot less kind. I hope to see different modes implemented aside from direct obliteration of your opponent. Perhaps a hard-point or capture-the-flag gamemode? Then there are the aforementioned bigger maps... Boid looks to me like to will be able to deliver. Much care obviously went into its creation. As proven by the variety of options to select from, including something called "Colorblind Mode", basically changing all the green/red in the game to blue/yellow... An interesting concept, but one I didn't end up applying, even as a colorblind person. Still the gameplay is blazing fast fun, and one would be crazy to complain about MORE options. Thanks to tinyBuild and Mokus for a fantastic game that will keep me coming back for a long time to come.\n\nSummary: Aquatic RTS with a lovely minimalist design, and plenty of potential.\nFinal Score: 7/10 for aesthetic, replayability, and tiered goals/pricing.\n\nCheck out the full text/photos: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-boid-early-access/\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf4dK80XA1Q","January 18, 2015","true","10.7"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","0"

Like the ability to group units together with hot keys, Showing the unit stats on hovering over them on the side panel, a smaller side panel. A wider screen view would also definitely help.

It's fast-paced and games can be quite tense.\n\nThe AI has 4 difficulty levels and is reasonably challenging. Class system, while being simple, provides enough variety for a lot of different strategies, and strategies that will work on some maps won't work on others - sometimes simply because there won't be "bases" that can turn units into a type that your strategy depends on. So game constantly encourages player to think of new ways of utilizing available units. And there is easy and flexible map editor.\n\nNow a few words about multiplayer. Boid is clearly built with it in mind, it's really fun. As of now, there is 1v1 mode (and developers talk about implementing 2v2, 4 players FFA and perhaps something else - but I'm not sure if this is among official plans or just a possibility). Bad news about multiplayer is that it can take quite some time to find an opponent online. Good news is that you can play against AI while the game is looking for an opponent for you.\n\nDeveloper actually listens to the community and not a small number of  frequently requested features and improvments has been implemented because of this.\n\nI'd recommend Boid to people who aren't very good at RTSes but want some fast strategic/tactical fun - as I'm one of that bunch and game plays well :) Also Boid looks like a good entry point to real-time strategizing.","April 26, 2015","true","11.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With this game, even to beat the AI on easy was a struggle. Unlike games in the past like this that focused on trying to overpower the AI, in this game you have to trick the enemy. Hide the majority of your force from its sight, and when it tries to attack you, repel the attack and take over the location it deserted to attack you. This is a game of risks, you do not know how many enemy lay waiting for you on their stronghold. And always remember to convert your forces to types that can do more damage from the basic spawners. Try to even out the types of your forces, all guns and you will die at close range, but having a few guns when charging an enemy stronghold can help snipe a few before you reach there. Its all tactics, and now, you can see if you can outsmart your friends in MP!","January 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/micbemac/recommended/314010/","micbemac","micbemac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/micbemac/","146 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have just spent several hours with Boid,  a simplistic 2D RTS that has you take control of several amoeba like organisms in underwater cavernous environments and pits you against an equal foe located on the other side of the map. Brought to us by indie developer tinyBuild Games, also known for the satrical "No Time To Explain".\n\nThe idea is simple, take over all control points on the map before your opponent can. Control points are broken into two basic categories,  spawn points that slowly spawn new troops up to a maximum of five at a time, and evolution points which allow you to morph your creatures into various upgraded forms, like a strong crab like creature, a long range laser canon, and speedy scouts among other variations.  You are tasked with controlling your flow of new units while strategically choosing which path to take and which upgrades to use and balance everything accordingly. All actions are controlled by a simple click of the mouse, and a side panel gives you a brief summary of units available, and selected, and you can use waypoints to help automate some of your troops to specific defense points or upgrades to capture.\n\nBoth offline and online modes are already included in the most recent build. The offline version features a fairly good A.I. which can challenge new comers to the game and is a good way of getting acquainted with most of the unit types, and general gameplay. Multiplayer of course is where a game like this shines, as adapting to a human player's differing strategies and changes of pace are where the real challenge and fun is. With the recent addition of leagues, and ranked play, you can easily lose hours to Boid.\n\nGraphically Boid's 2D graphics are simple, yet colourful and make it easy to identify unit types by their shape, as well as identify enemies. Winning and losing spawn points is shown graphically by quick flashes of light on the screen to give you a quick clue that you may need to investigate elsewhere. The submerged aquatic setting is full of life, and the lighting effects give great depth on what is otherwise a flat world.\n\nAvailable now on the Steam Early Access program at a measly $3.29 CAD, Boid is a steal for anyone looking for an easy to pick up, but competitive RTS. One that is being well supported by the developer with regular updates and improvements.\n\nwww.micbemac.com","July 26, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art desing is gorgeous, the mechanics mirror those of classic RTS games and streamline the actions required to perform by the player to focus in the most thrilling aspects of the genre:\n\nÂ· Fast decision making.\nÂ· Macro and Micro managing.\nÂ· Army composition.\nÂ· Unit positioning.\nÂ· Scouting and Harassment.\nÂ· Combat.\n\nGames are very fast-paced, and the deal may be sealed within a couple of minutes, but when both players manage to counter each other's strategies games can last for quite a long time.\n\nThis is currently in Early Access stage but it is totally worth the price.

When I first bought this game, I only could pick specific maps to play with AI. It felt like I was fighting against enemy spawner rather than Artificial Intelligence. Now it's changed. You can choose any map including the ones you made, then AI will adapt to that map like other strategy game's AI do.\n\nYet there's some problems including crashing issue, but still looks so fine for me as a game in developement. I'll be waiting for the next update.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you start the game, you're given one testicle which continuously produces sperm cells. You move them into other egg cells to dominate them. Once dominated, it also makes sperms for you. More testicles means more sperms.\n\nOnce you reach enough amount of sperms, you finally march onto enemy egg cells to make them pregnant. Grab this game and make your baby!\n\n+Pros\n+Simple, noticeable graphic design.\n+Various mutation choice and many mutation spots around the map, which requires both strategy and tactics.\n+Short play time per a session.\n\n-Cons\n-There's no real egg cells to inject my REAL sperms.\n-Game shuts off occasionally, hope developers fix it soon.\n\nIt's currently on early access but still very enjoyable. Can't wait for further update including map editor. 8/10\n\nEarly Access Review written on Jan 20, 2015\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------","January 20, 2015","true","12.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","1"

Every game feels like a zerg rush :D\n\nlittle about it:\n- it's only 1vs1 player\n- a strategy game where in order to win you have to be faster than your opponent in conquering strategic points on the map and also be able to hold them.\n- you do not controll the way your units spawn, the more spawning points you controll, the more units you produce, thus is essential to controll at least the same amount of spawning points as your opponent to be able to stay in the game.\n- each "basic unit" (is actually a good unit, but average on all stats) can be transformed to different units if you controll certain points on the map. Each unit has its own advantages and drawbacks, some are faster but weaker, some are slower but stronger, some are weaker but have range, some heal, etc.\n- at first it feels a little strange(slower mouse movement - but you can adjust it in options menu), game allows you to zoom out(you are able to see the entire map) but this zooming is used just for observing, you'll have to zoom back in to be able to controll your units. After playing some games, I got used to it and it seems natural now.\n\nPros:\n- simple, very easy to learn but harder to master\n- can be played "casual" as games can be really fast(minutes) so you don't need hours to play a game.\n- low price\n\nCons:\n- Almost no players to play against for now(still early access) so you'll be mostly stuck playing against bots(the hard difficulty is pretty challenging).. or you can always play against friends if you have them(I'm lonely)\n- you can play only ~5 maps vs bots, while online there are more options ~20\n- only 1v1. Maybe in the future it would bring a nice twist to be able to play it with more players.","March 24, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It does require that you take time and plan out your moves for the future. If they added a co-op mode it would possibly give people a tad more enjoyment from the game. Also, if there was no fog of war (possibly for only a specific game mode), it would add more strategy. Without a fog of war, you would be able to determine which types of units you will need for future battles and it would lead to counter strategies and possibly more fun for the player.

Done? That's Boid.\n\nWhat I mean is that the game designers have opted for a graphically simplistic RTS. And while it still looks good in it's way (kind of like neon sperm.... who doesn't like that?), it creates it's own set of problems:\n\n\nThe minions move in swarms, which makes it difficult to distinguish between different classes of minions. Not that unit diversity is really noticeable anyway, but still....\n\nThe way point "dots" can be difficult to click on and move for some reason.\n\nThere is no way (that was made apparently by the tutorial at least) to hotkey select groups of minions... you can only select them by class, which makes directing your forces an exercise in frantic click-and-drag motions to separate and direct them accordingly.\n\nAdd to these issues the fact that the AI is INSANELY fast and proficient in making an enormous force in about 10 seconds, while you're still desperately trying to drag the first way point to the predetermined spawn point.... the game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly.\n","December 3, 2015","false","4.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While you can zoom out, you CAN'T control your units during zoom out, so you have to constantly change to zoom out and zoom in which is uterly useless and broken function.\n*The Hard AI is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at most I beat it on all maps under 2-5 minutes so you are unable to even practice with it but then again developing smart AI is hard for the unskilled programmers.\n\nMajor problems:\n*When you play VS players on some maps there are freeze spells that can be cast at the moment your unit step on them (gain control). Those spells are AoE and because your units move as swarm they can easily get frozen resulting in your army been wiped, just because you was not the first to rush this spell. Because of the nature of this spell "INSTANT", because of balance issues on all games in the world there is COOLDOWN or CHANNELING TIME. This is because this is game changing ability so the other player can respond to this high threat. Because of the nature of this game maybe you sacrifice units in order to cast this spell and the effect is based on how many units you sacrificed since you risk nothing casting it and you gain only benefits.\n\nRecommendations:\n*I can see you created waypoints for the spawners which is good for automation purposes, but make the spawner size smaller and the units to be unable to go on top of it that that much so players can more clearly know what they are doing.\n*While having spells is cool function adding channeling/recharge time is recommended. Other option is to make the effect based on how many units you sacrificed on the platform.\n\nConclusion:\n*Because of the above problem I find this game to be unfit for play and I cannot recommend it until the above problem is fixed.\n*If they don't put some interesting campaign in this game and increase the size of the arenas I can't recommend this game for above 5â¬ as at the momment it have less content than a tetris and the size is the same as well.","February 8, 2015","false","11.3"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","5","16","2","0"

Since there are three different difficulty settings for bots, you can freely experiment with lots of strategies before jumping online. I've just started playing and from what I can see, Boid has potential. I'm not good enough to jump online yet, but I will soon to at least test the waters. I believe TinyBuild is creating a rather unique game. I'm eager to see how it updates over the next few months.","January 26, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are minion spawners, you capture them to generate more minions and you can upgrade standart minions using the different unit upgrade points.\n\nThis game is fun if you liked Galcon and that type of micro strategy games you will like this one. The only let down for me so far was: There is no 3,4,5... multiplayer support and I am not sure if it is coming or not. All you can do is a 1v1 match as far as multiplayer is concerned. AI(Single player) is not so bad, hard difficulty provides some challenge but if you are familiar with the genre; it is really trivial to beat them.\n\nGraphics are nice and Sounds are better. Game UI and menus are a bit dull, but hey! It can be improved. Units are balanced and game itself allows players to micro manage units. You can't put hotkeys to units( like AOE(M), Starcraft etc... CTRL + number ) or I could not manage it anyway, that was another let down for me.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game. It is really worth the price. Single player is a bit boring after you figure out units and stuff but multiplayer is hella fun.  We need more players for multi so, buy this game!!","January 18, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The different types of transformation made the game more competitive, taking key transformation point made matches between players more fun. There are also counters to different types of transformation making the game balance in many ways. There are different game play style with starcraft where you go rushing or play solid defense. The game developer also promise to make a system for player making their own map, letting player make crazy maps to play with friends. But there is one thing they are lack of, which is number player.
