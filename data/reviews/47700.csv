Is fair to say that this is not a sequel to Command & Conquer, It is much more like a action strategy spin-off.\n\nThat is not the reason why this game is bad, but here are some reasons why you should not buy it:\n\n- Permanent online connection require to play. In the middle of the campaign EA servers went down and now i simply can't play until they decide to go back up. Now i am here, angry, writing a review.\n\n- Requires you to login and input your password every time you start the game.\n\n- Unskippable cutscenes\n\n- Lack of mission variety, is most of the time build troops and walk around the map destroying everything in empty skirmishers style maps. Is really hard to believe that this game was released in the same year that Starcraft 2 came out.\n\n- The new mechanics are really average, there is not much do to. They cut out resource collection, all you do is choose the appropriate MCV to the situation and walk with your troops.\n\n- Units are ultra resilient. It may take minutes of firing to kill an enemy armada. Combat is not fun.\n\nEdit: You also lost the mission progress when the game lose connection.","June 3, 2015","false","9.4"," 407 of 422 people (96%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","96","407","422","20","3"

See Conclusion\nNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:\nCommand & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars Review\nCommand & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath Review\n\nINTRODUCTION:Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is a real-time strategy game developed and published by Electronic Arts. This title serves as the official sequel to the critically acclaimed C&C 3: Tiberium Wars  and acts as the final chapter in the decade and a half long Command & Conquer Tiberian franchise.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The story picks up 15 years after the end of Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath. The Scrin has been defeated, Kane has successfully recovered the Tacitus and the Brotherhood of NOD is merely a shadow of its former self. Despite the Scrin's failed invasion, all is not well as Tiberium now spreads in an ever more rapid rate and human extinction is almost inevitable. The game starts with Kane offering the remaining world leaders a solution to this problem.\n\nPROS:+ Return of live action cinematics but...(See CON #1)\n+ Good sound effects and voice acting\n+ Interesting veterancy system with visual upgrade changes for each level of veterancy\n+ Good special effects and graphics (but average art style)\n+ Interesting new units\n\nCONS:- Poor costume quality for the live action cutscenes\n- No base building\n- No resource gathering\n- DRM Stacking (Always Online + Log-in requirement every time you start the game)\n- Unlock and account level up system that ruins the game's unit availability: (meaning you can't jump to multiplayer immediately because half of your units are locked.)\n- Population Cap\n- The game is lore deficient, with a rushed and confusing story\n- Poorly written and poorly executed attempt to establish “emotional depth” by giving the Commander a wife that most players won't care about.\n- Lack of mission variety and the fun stealth missions were completely removed\n- No side bar like the old games; the entire UI looks bad as a whole\n- Too much deviation from the C&C source material meaning it neither look nor feel like a C&C game\n- Ridiculously low damage and high HP for every unit that results in...(See next CON)\n- VERY slow paced action\n- Pathfinding problems\n- Severe balance issues\n- Very short campaign time\n- Small and poorly designed campaign maps\n- The game as a whole feels rushed and cheap\n\nNEUTRAL:+/- The 'Crawler / MCV' unit building system is an interesting idea but it shouldn't have been implemented on an already existing franchise such as C&C because it already has an established (and working) formula.\n\nCONCLUSION:A VERY BAD sequel which stands as an insult to the fans of a 15 year old franchise. In EA's attempt to “innovate,” they failed to see what made the Command and Conquer games fun for a lot of people.\n\nWORTH IT?NO, the game is not worth it. I would not recommend this game to anyone even on a sale, specially if you're a fan of the old games. You're better off buying the previous titles like Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars and its expansion.\n\nFINAL NOTES:I would have been kinder in my criticism of this game if it did not have the Command and Conquer name on it. Tiberian Twilight would have sold better and would have been received better by the community if it was merely a spin-off rather than the finale of the franchise.\n\nThis video expresses clearly what I feel about this game.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

As a concept it's... unique and might have some potential, but they certainly didn't pull it off. If you're looking for a steroidal version of Tiberian Sun and Tiberian Wars, this isn't it. If you're looking for closure to the series, then the end of the storyline is worse than the books following Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. The story is stupid, the acting is worse, and more immature and childish than Red Alert. Do you really want to know how this series ends? Fine, here it is: Kane makes peace with GDI for free, and in both the GDI and NOD campaigns you are protecting Kane on his quest to cross the portal to join the aliens. The end.

Seriously, C&C4 completely abandons every core element of what made the Command and Conquer identity in the first place.  #1) Battles take place more in arena venues than true story dictated maps.  #2) Your unit count is so small that you can forget building an army #3) You cannot build base fortresses and your production capabilities are easily lost and recovered meaning you've got nothing important to defend and no ultimate goal in smashing your opponent's key structure. #4) The ingame economy is so simplified and anemic that it removes any remaining strategic decisions so that it becomes impossible to out-produce your opponent. #5) Progress is slow and boring since you must tediously earn experience points in order to unlock better units. #6) The visual language of the unit designs is no longer clear making it very hard to understand why one unit is superior to another, and not only that but all the units are extremely wimpy with little ability to decisevly break through enemy forces.\n\nC&C4 started out as an experimental idea for a cheaply made free-to-play RTS game and was then forcibly upgraded into a C&C game.  The live action story moments are the only thing worth mentioning about this game to anyone with a passing care about the Command Conquer franchise and for that just go to Youtube where you can see it all for free.\n\nWhat a terrible, unforgiveable waste of time and resources this game is.","July 15, 2013","false",""," 86 of 99 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","86","99","0","0"

EA created a chimera (apparently trying to take likeness of the other RTS titles) forgetting that this game has been an icon and should not be so awfully transformed. Thus dies C&C from house Westwood.\n\nAdding injury to insult the new hybrid of a game is not even enjoyable to play. Tactics and strategy were limited to just positioning your mobile base and produce produce produce units. No money means just keeping the number of units at maximum and trying to utilize their not so useful abilities to win a mini skirmish after another in hope of reaching the mobile (sic!) enemy base to destroy it. The process gets boring after an hour of gameplay. On easy, the AI is practically dormant. On normal, computer produces units all the time that it becomes overwhelming.\n\nI won't rate multiplayer as I dont care about it. I wanted a good and fitting story to end a legendary plot. What did we get? A slap in the face. They might as well just put the credits at the beginning and be done with it. A MAJOR disappointment. I hope someone picks up the torch where C&C 3 left it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/recommended/47700/","welcomeaboardmate","BlackEagle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/","501 products in account","I tried really hard to like this game, as it's the final C&C game that it looks like we're getting in a long time - could even be the last the way EA is heading with their BS. This game shows a fantastic idea, a fantastic concept, something that could have worked out great - IF IT DIDN'T HAVE THE LABEL AS A FULL ON SEQUEL TO THE TIBERIUM UNIVERSE C&C GAMES. As a spinoff, this game would have been mediocre, but as the official sequel and ending to the C&C storyline, this game is abysmal in every way possible.\n\nNot a single thing feels C&C about this game - theres a tiny population cap, there's no base building, there's no resource collection, maps are small, the campaign is abysmal with a terrible storyline and cutscenes that don't just look bad - they are legitimately stuff someone likely recorded with their iphone camera and slapped into the game! Just watch any sections that involve the "public" speaking rather than paid actors. The only saving grace in the storyline is Joe Kucan, who as always takes the role of Kane and makes an extremely badass villain until a terrible ending that's the same regardless of which faction you go with - AN ENDING THAT'S THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHICH FACTION YOU GO WITH. Let that sink in.\n\nThe progression system is terrible - yes, there's a progression system. This game revolves around collecting tiberium crystals INDIVIDUALLY and using them to upgrade your MCV to higher tiers to unlock better units and such. However, when you start, you are level 1 and have access to absolutely NOTHING. Only after you level up several times will you unlock the 2nd tier of technology which at first is completely worthless without a single thing used for it. Everything has to be unlocked through progression and this BLATANTLY makes anyone who's a higher level than you stronger than you with no workarounds based on how good of a player you are or anything, PERIOD. For example, you have to pick a class - offensive, defensive, or support. If you go defensive, at the beginning of the progression scale you only have access to 3 infantry units. No vehicles of any sort, period. While these infantry units CAN be used to counter other infantry, vehicles, or aircraft, they're all infantry and can be MUCH MORE EASILY COUNTERED by a diverse enemy army.\n\nThis is a game that again, has a fantastic concept that was soiled by something that clearly had the goal of being made with the least amount of funding possible, the least motivation possible, and the smallest amount of time necessary to produce it - probably so EA wouldn't have to pay people to work on this game any longer than they would have to before it was BARELY functional as a game and could be pushed out the door, which is exactly what they did.\n\nAnd what sucks is, if everyone is maximum level on progression, the multiplayer can actually potentially be fun. It feels like the game was designed for that, but it was just unfinished, so to pad the length of the game and make people play it longer, they slapped progression in to make you grind to be level 20 (the cap).\n\nDo not buy this game. If you want a good C&C game from recent times, go with Red Alert 3. Just don't expect any multiplayer options since this is the ONLY C&C GAME to not run on Gamespy and the gamespy servers are going to tank here in a month.","April 24, 2014","false","42.6"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","55","58","0","0"

However that is the only positive I have about the game and not a very strong one at that, now for the negatives.\n\nLets start with the most glaringly obvious one which i think everyone feels the same and that's the campaign... This had to be written by some emotionless, imbecilic monkey. It literally starts off going THIS NAMELESS CHARACTER IS YOUR WIFE CARE ABOUT HER!!!! (uhhh okay???) Okay seriously why would I care about this character, I've literally never seen them before but the game just expects you to care about her and really really obnoxiously tries shove it down your throat it's insane because aboviously they're going to use her as a plot device. I think a bloody 5 year old can figure that out.\nThe campaign is insanely short as well I completed the whole thing in about 2.5 hours, that's it... the whole thing.. and like an hour of it is a tutorial. It ends so suddenly as well I was like wait is that it. I just did like 4 missions after the tutorial crap and then poof, done, over. I can only imagine that they were planning on bringing out a tonne of garbage DLC for this just to unlock more campaign missions.\n\nNow for the Gameplay...\nIt's terrible just flat out terrible, it's watered down from other games and lacks any sort of depth or strategy.\nThis is literally it it, You start off with your main "structure" called a Crawler, now you move your crawler to whatever objective you have which is either one of 3 things: Capture thing, kill thing or Defend thing. (defending thing being the most annoying since you have no control over said thing it will generally just run into things and get itself killed, it's like "Hay you know what would be a fun idea, lets walk face first into that big horde of enemies over there. I'm sure things will be completely fine!"). Now as I was saying here's what the gameplay is: Move Crawler to objective, Deploy Crawler, Throw ♥♥♥♥ at problem until it goes away, move to next objective. That's it, that's all I did, I didn't have to care about what units I built since all i had to do is build the spider tanks with the big ♥♥♥ tesla coil and throw them at the enemy, I didn't even have to worry about them dying since if you build like 3 or 4 engineers everything you have is pretty much immortal anyway. i didn't even have to worry about my base since there's no base building to worry about and the base came with me anyway so screw defenses. Oh and for tech it's literally hay see that red crystal over there? yeah pic that up like 1 or 2 of them and you can INSTANTLY unlock every single bit of tech you want.\n\nSo that's it that's C&C 4 in all it's terribleness. The only way I could possibly recommend this game is to play it just to see how bad it is.","June 17, 2015","false","3.1"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","27","29","5","0"

This particular game is the poorest of the entire series, in my opinion and manages to take several steps backwards from the previous CnC Tiberium Wars. Multiplayer is only truly available after several hours of grinding in the single player campaign so that you can unlock units or some such nonsense.\nThe graphics are worse than the previous game! The game menu forces you to be logged onto EA's public chat rooms or whatever crap they think is best for a paying customer to be logged onto when playing a single player game and this entire experiment of a game is repulsive. The game is poor and best avoided. CnC 3 is a much much more enjoyable experience in both the single player and mulitplayer.","November 27, 2013","false","4.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

Do not buy it! Even if they offer if for a free weekend, the price is too high for its worth. What made this game so crappy? The gameplay, the story, and the idea of taking away the concept of base building and resource gathering. Every fan knows the story of GDI vs NOD. GDI's purpose is to contain the Tiberium and stop NOD from using it as a tool. NOD wants the tiberium to claim it as the next step in human evolution while informing the world that GDI are a bunch of fascists that care for the rich and abandon the sick and poor. BUT C&C4 throws that all away when Kane uses the Tacitus, the item that the 2 factions fought so hard to obtain and unlock the secrets of it, to ally with GDI and destroy the Tiberium that infested the earth. I bought it because i love C&C from the start of playing red alert. After Westwood was gone, it all went down the drain. C&C3 was good, but aliens?! blah! I would have loved to see CABAL come back, but EA made up for it with Kane's Wrath.

You used to be the king of RTS. Your cheesy live action cut-scenes were the stuff of legend and we eagerly anticipate your every release.\nNow what have you done to yourself? No resources, no armies, no bases? What is this? A shadow of what used to be?\nYOU ARE NOT COMPANY OF HEROES!\nWhy can't you stay the way you used to be? We all loved you and cherished every memory of you? Why do you have to cheapen what we have?\nWhy? WHY? WHY?!\n\nIt is difficult for me to articulate my feelings about Command & Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight. All I really know is, I don't like it.\n\nIn some misguided attempt by what I can only assume is an ill-informed marketing department somewhere deep in the bowels of the EA mega structure this installment of the Command & Conquer franchise changes everything about the previous games. They even went so far as to remove the live action cut-scenes that, despite being where B-movie stars go to die, had become a benchmark in the industry.\n\nYou no longer build bases or harvest Tiberium, instead you get allocated a number of points that can be spent on units, when a unit die you get your points back and can try a new combination. It takes what used to be a very balanced RTS experience and turns it into an entirely micromanagement experience, and not a terribly good one at that.\n\nThis is not unlike what you might see in the later Dawn of War games but where Dawn of War balanced it with RPG elements making each unit seem important here you are just sending mindless, faceless entities towards a bunch of other mindless, faceless entities in the hope of beating the map objective before you mind rots from the monotone boredom.\n\nCommand & Conquer might be viewed by many as the classic simple RTS, but it was the one that monopolized the best on that approach and it was the franchise that more than any other made the real time strategy genre a force to be reckoned with.\n\nNow it is nothing more a boring mediocre clone of a game, trying to do with all the other cool new RTS's are doing but not doing it nearly as well and losing what made the game special in the first place in the attempt.\n\nIt is a sad end for what was once such a proud franchise. The older Command & Conquer games will forever hold a special place in my heart but this makes me hope the series will die before another abomination is released.","December 24, 2012","false","32.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

C&C 4: Tiberian Twilight..........\nI've have been a C&C fan since I was 4, aka from 1998. The first game was perhaps the first game I have ever got and was the series that got me into both gaming and real time strategy games. So as you can see, when I heard abotu C&C 4, I was prepared to enbark on a good bye party for my beloved franchise. However, I had to scrap it when a leaked beta information on the gameplay changes the game was gonna make. Therefore I avoided the game like the plague. Once the game was finally released, did I feel guilty of having to abandon the party?\nApparently not cause not only did the reviews show little discouragement but 98% of all the C&C fans like me cryout in anger for the series. Obviously this game recommendation from me was Hell no (and I'll repeat it again at the end for those who are too lazy to read this and skips to the end.\nSo why is the game bad? Well the first problem is the gameplay. The gameplay in terms of C&C gameplay felt like it was design by satan. Rather than traditional gameplay where you would collect resources and build both a base and an army to conquer your enemies, the game went Moba like based game with a unusual population limit (which drew me away from the game) and a requirement of playing from other people. Another thing that the game is known to have been hated on is the story. Now I haven't played the campaign but from what I heard, it's a cluster f*(k.\nSo is there one thing I like about the game? well......... I do actually enjoy the music which is actually pretty good.\nIn conclusion, if it wasn't for C&C being in the game, it could have been ok, but the C&C is a perminate damage to the game for I have to say I do not recommend the game\n\nFor people who want to skip to the conclusion on whether to own the game or not, the answer is HELL NO.","September 14, 2014","false","0.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

All the base building aspects are gone, instead you are given a "crawler" which you can set up and produce certain units and structures/abilities depending on if you chose offense, defense or support. I only suggest buying this if you hated previous C&C games since this is the complete opposite of past games. I plan on finishing the campaign, on easy to get it done with faster, and to never play it again.\n\nEDIT: You may enjoy the game if you liked World in Conflict's multiplayer aspect. The whole game plays like it, where you are forced to pick a strategy and stick with it. However, it is more limited because in World in Conflict you could still make most units, however in this game you are forced to only make what your strategy allows.

The lack of base building or resource gathering means that the game is just a mad rush to build as may units as possible, throw them at the enemy, and repeat. Only one of the classes can build defenses. the leveling up system means that you are grossly underpowered in multiplayer matches until you grind up to the top. This complelety destroys the balance as you could only have access to tanks while your opponent is using Mastadons. Also, the story and the acting is awful.

While crucial for story-enthused players, C&C4 breaks up the traditional base building and attempts to create a rank-based multiplayer game. The constant mobility leaves you feeling that every mission is a commando-based offshoot and fails to satisfied classic real-time strategy fans. The ranked multiplayer makes most matches feel unbalanced, but  there are opportunitues for co-op gameplay. All in all, C&C4 leaves much to be desired in every aspect, but the game still holds the conclusion to the series.","August 4, 2012","false","11.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I feel like EA should be paying us to play this.\nThe "always-online" that EA has a big hard-on for lately is a nightmare.\nThe only reason I bought this was to concluce the CnC tiberium storyline and even that was terrible. Did you know there's no more tiberium in this game? Literally, it's pretty much all gone. No base building, no harvesting resources. You can train units without any cost but only up to a very, very limited unit cap. I'm talking REAL limited.

A mockery.\n\nThis game isn't as bad as they say it is ... it's worse!!! :( Like me, you might think "It's C&C. how bad can it be?" Answer: world-class bad. A complete corruption of the art form by people who don't understand the first thing about what made C&C cool and different from other RTSes, and have ruined the franchise. Highlights: no more concept of "economy" or "base-building"; plodding, ineffectual units; linear "progression" of uninspired unlocks, meanwhile each faction can build fewer units -- not to mention structures -- than ever before; and of course a laughable "story".  C&C has "wives" in it now, did u know?\n\nOverall, it just exudes that particular EA-Games flavor of disgust. $5 I wish I had back, and the bottom line: wherever you may rate this game on the scale from "just plain" bad to "seriously I can't believe how bad it is" bad, your time is most assuredly better spent elsewhere.\n\nDisclaimer: I never met a C&C I didn't like. ( .................... up until RA3 which, questionable as it may be, is still infinitely more playable and "C&C" than /this/ POS.)","July 3, 2013","false","11.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game itself never got the chance it might have deserved, because it could never be judged on its own merits but always as "The Conclusion to the Tiberium Saga".\nThey failed the fans of the previous games, because they delivered something that did not understand the value of the gameplay of all the previous titles and threw out time-honored traditions just for the sake of cleaning house.\nThey even managed to fail the brand itself. If EA has to send out an email that ensures "fans" that they have brought back resource harvesting, removed unit caps and similar basic fundamantals, then it is very clear that the brand itself have lost tremendous value and C&C4 almost solely bears that whole responsibility.\nOverall this game fails, not because of what it is, but for what it sets out to be.","December 2, 2013","false","0.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Command and Conquer 4 strays so far from the original Command and Conquer formula that it is virtually unrecognizable as a Command and Conquer game. Gone is the base building and resource gathering, replaced with a "mobile crawler" and a rather stifling hard "population cap" as well as a need to gather experience to unlock other units.

It is TERRIBLE!!!!  The fun in C&C games, because they seem not to have understood it,  is to be able to build strong defenses and large bases, outposts and a solid economy ?!? With the machanics of this version, it is absolutly IMPOSSIBLE to accomplish, at all!!!  This thing with the crystals to gain access to slight advantages absolutly sucks.  You need to play many hours before gaining access to 50% of the units available using only boring to play and weak mech_infantry units.  From my point of view, they would rather keep the unit layouts and apply the game mechanics of the provious version...  At least it would be playable.  What a rubbish!!!

The only reason i give this game a positive rating is because i had a tons of fun and positive memories playing it with my friends in coop/compstomp and just skirmish with AI. If you play this game without thinking about past C&C games, it's actually fine, runs great, plays great, looks great. Let's do a breakdown :\n\nReasons to buy it ( only if it's on huge sale and you are desperate ) :\n\n- Tons of fun in COOP with friends or vs AI alone.\n- Very pretty environmental/map design.\n- Sometimes it's very challenging.\n- Visuals.\n- 5v5 players possible.\n\nReasons to avoid it and tell me that i am stupid for giving it a positive rating :\n\n- Abysmal plot written by a madman in a few hours. Probably taken from DeviantArt fanfiction section.\n- Questionable units design.\n- Horrible FMV actors performance.\n- There is almost no way to beat campaign alone, it's designed to be beaten in COOP.\n- Unit cap.\n- Has almost nothing to do with C&C, hence no base building or tiberium harvesting.\n- The ending cutscene ( which is the finale of whole C&C series presumably ) is so horrible that you might want to kys after it.\n- Most of the super/special weapons feel weak.\n- You need to unlock units in order to use them.\n\n\nIf reasons to avoid it don't scare you + it's on a huge sale and you have a friend to play it with - then you might want to get it just for collection and full playthrough with people you know. If you're looking for extra content for it - don't. Game doesn't have mod support, but it does have few custom maps.\n\nBut if you want some more good old C&C - don't get it, it's not C&C, it won't be fun for you, infact it might leave you with few dead brain cells, just like me.","February 6","true","25.7"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","12","27","4","0"

The game has some RPG elements to it which you can cap within 10 hours of non stop playing.  The dev's did away with base building and resource gathering instead you get a crawler similar to a command center which is mobile.  It creates all your units.  You get 3 crawlers to choose from either side.  Support, Offense and Defense each class has it's own unique unit's and abilities.  At first I enjoyed this game.  But removing resources and base's takes away a huge elemnet of why enjoy RTS games to begin with.  No economy to manage and no real "home" to protect 2 factors which add depth to RTS's.  Being able to manage those and your army add's alot to the gameplay and I miss it when playing this game.  If you don't appreciate those things in RTS's and prefer to get right into the action then this game is for you.  But not so much for me.

No, this game makes you think and strategize way more than any other strategy game, and its' micro-manage-enducing gameplay will grab anyone on the spot, who is a fan of games such as chess (like me) where you have to think 2-3 moves ahead.\n\nThe only problem - the title.

At no point are you ever forced into multiplayer, like one of the previous reviews said. I've been playing the campaigns and did a few skirmish maps with the AI to level my profile. Which does lead into one partial negative. That being the near necessity of playing one of the campaigns before you start skirmish modes. Apperently the unlocks are tied to yoru profile rank which is persistant in the campaign and skirmish.\n\nGame play's not really that aweful as some have described. It's more of a elite squad based kind of strategy take on C&C. That may be off putting to some, but you do have a "base building" option with the defense crawler. Just don't expect massive bases like in C&C3. I did find myself useing the offensive crawlers a little bit more than i would have liked.\n\nSo the story lines a little anti climactic. Sadly given that it's the end of the series, it would have been near impossible to have actually finished it properly for the majority of the fan base. So i can't fault it for that, though i do find fault in how the cutscenes follow through. It's like there are parts missing. That being said, if you run both campaigns, you'll get alot of the plot holes filled in by the opossite campaign.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, but when i get a chance, i'll add that review.","November 29, 2013","true","14.2"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rozzy/recommended/47700/","rozzy","Rozzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rozzy/","69 products in account","I actually quite enjoyed playing this despite the bad publicity it has. Yes, EA do what they typically do and use a name to sell a game that's completely different from what is expected of it. It probably should have been an offshoot instead of a sequel. If you can ignore that then it's not that bad of a game and has no serious technical problems.\n\nThe game is basically just dumbed down and casualised RTS that's good for playing for 30 minutes. All the more complex aspects such as base and resource management are thrown away leaving you with the job of looking after 1 master unit, the Crawler. You collect Tiberium crystals to receive upgrade points and when the Crawler is destroyed it respawns at a drop off point. The Defense type can construct buildings but only buildings such as the Obelisk and Nuke/Ion Cannon which require the Crawler to be alive to operate. Support buildings can also be captured but cannot be destroyed.\n\nI completed the campaign and played some skirmishes. The skirmish mode is a little shallow and some extra customization would have made it much better such as increasing the unit limit for games with more players. I'm going to give it a thumbs up for that at least. If you want or expect a traditional C&C experience then don't get it and stick to C&C 3 or the older games.","June 12, 2015","true","70.2"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

Electronic Arts’ award-winning and best-selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful conclusion with Command & Conquer 4, which will introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay, while retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series’ history.\n\nIt is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod’s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this "Tiberium Control Network" without GDI’s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions – GDI and Nod – inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.\n\nAfter 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is then that the world’s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what will he want in return. These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga.\n\nWith a multitude of innovative new features to the fast and fluid C&C gameplay, Command & Conquer 4 offers players an entirely new way to play C&C. An all-in-one mobile base, persistent player progression across all game modes that is constantly updated in a real-time online profile, a 3-class system for each of the two factions, co-operative play, and a 5v5 objective-based multiplayer mode that promotes teamwork and social interaction, make Command & Conquer 4 unlike any other C&C experience.","July 19, 2014","true","371.8"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","10","28","0","0"

While its not a bad game in its own right it defies a lot of typical conventions that C&C has had since its inception in 1995.\n\nHowever if we forget that this is a C&C game and judge it on its own merits.  I'll say this, first its a fast paced game and unlike  previous C&C games it requires you to think about using your units right as each unit now has a strength/weakness mechanic more so in this title.\n\nGraphics wise its visual fideltiy is pretty impressive for an RTS game and even though the ammount of units you can have is limited the battles do in fact feel big, which is a plus.\n\nAs this is a C&C game you can expect well acted real time cutscenes and these are the most impressive I'vse seen so far.\n\nNow for problems.\n\nOne of the major issues is that players can level up outside multiplayer and then take that rank/level into multiplayer, meaning there's no sense of progression and someonne can just anhilate you in multiplayer because you've not unlocked all the units/upgrades.\n\nBottom line this can be a fun title if you can forget it has anything to do with Command and Conquer, but it also appeals to true fans.  Generic RTS fans may want to avoid this title.  Which is the only reason I can recommend this title.","June 23, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

C&C4 is a legitimate step forward in RTS mechanics, distilling the fun of what you used to call "base building" in the game's offense/defense/support crawlers.\n\nI picked Defense and played through the campaign. Guess what, it's anything but "Defense." If you could call crawling up in the enemy lines, plopping down defense towers and bunkers next to their ♥♥♥♥, and letting your therefore heavily shielded infantry tear everyone up, "defense."\n\nThe game shows that there is pretty much no need for RTS games to go through the traditional stages of build-up and then push. In this game, you just push. Or get pushed. All day. Can't take it, well, there's Starcraft for you people who like having to memorize tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t before actually playing the game.\n\nSee, there's a reason why people enjoy games like DOTA-like games. It's because they took the fun parts out of the RTS and put them in a game by itself. Give C&C4 some credit for doing the same thing but for base building, army composition, and micro. In time you guys are going to look at games like C&C4 as the first (though mis-advertised) baby steps toward actual computerized strategy games where it's easy to pick up and play but the strategy is really deep like chess and Go.","February 22, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

It would seem by default a section of the HUD is missing, map for instance is cut off at about 2/3, only showing the middle and right third. Also lack of a menu button, unless mapped to something suitably awkward, or possibly on the cut off section of the display made exiting to alter settings very awkward.\n\nA ctrl+alt+delete, 5 end task and 1 terminate process later, we come to the third attempt, resulting in entire system locking up and the plug being pulled.\n\nNet result, I want a refund, but terms and conditions state that's not going to happen, so here's to a waste of money.","November 29, 2013","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

As it's shown through gameplay, it does NOT resemble the traditional build-up-your-base-and-army aspects seen in most of the previous games (Renegades is an FPS game). There's a limit on how much units you can use at one time. It's also not a destroy-the-enemy-base game anymore as it's more like a hold down points of the map type of game.\n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment I found would be the online portion. First, an internet connection is required at all times even if you're not playing online. Second, because there's a level up system which determines how much you can use (and both factions have separate level progresses), it limits a player's choices within the first hours or days of playing. Lastly, playing online can match people unfairly (players may have considerably large level gaps), leading to games where a new player doesn't have the units a higher level player does, especially powerful ones.\n\nIf you're a player who has played CnC games throughout the years, it's likely you'll be disappointed with the change in gameplay mechanics. I really don't think this game is worth playing, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm saying "don't buy it". Buy it if you want, I'm just saying it's not worth it.","May 17, 2013","false","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is to be said that this game and its dynamics, even the approach to it all, differ fundementally from the previous installment. The game is rather based on having mobile bases, not only encouraging of establishing only temporary bases, but even forcing you to hastly settle down only to for the most urgent actions and to move on in a giant caravan of units and your mobile command/construction building in order to survive. In the sense that [spoilers!] the planet is a Tiberian wasteland invaded by an Alien species in this installment, it gives off this nomadic post-apocalyptic feeling, which might be quite matching but hurt the gameplay experience in my opinion. Everything feels less permanent, rather like an action-packed campaign mission where your goal is not to build up a base and start offensives from there, but to utilize the little you have to outsmart your (in this case, also) mobile enemy.\nI personally love building up a base and having the responsibility of using terrains to defend its chokepoints and entrances. I was surprised and rather disappointed after playing the third installment just before this one. The graphics are less realistic and although this might have been the intention of the developers to return to the 'semi-comic'-feel, it felt sloppy and like being let down after CnC 3: Tiberium Wars.","September 6, 2014","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before I start the criticism of the game, I feel that it would be fair to mention the one redeeming feature because there is only one and that is Joe Kucan reprising his role as Kane, about the only thing satisfying for a long time fan of the series such as myself.  Now on to the downsides.\n\n1. The complete lack of base building and resource gathering.  How you can even label this game as an RTS without these core elements is beyond me, instead of the staples of the RTS genre, units cost a certain amount of "Command Points" and that's it.  No tiberium, nothing to be gathered or collected or used tactically, just a limit placed on you at the start of the game and boom click a button, create units up to the limit and that's it, that's the extent of resources in the game.  And as for base building, much the same applies, you have a power limit so you place down a certain number of defensive turrets up to the limit and that's really all there is to it - on both fronts a complete lack of anything in-depth, evidence of a second rate game aimed at a minor market being shoe-horned into something much bigger than it actually is intended to be.\n\n2. The units/maps/graphics.  The units provided at the start of the game are weak and ineffectual so in order to obtain more units you level up and then unlock them which sounds like a fairly simple concept, that is until you realise that exp. for leveling up is difficult to come by.  The lack of exp. becomes apparent after still not being awarded any after completion of the third mission in the story meaning that in order to progress your tech, hours of play time is required to unlock even just mostly mid-range units.  The weakness of initial units isn't alleviated by the fact that you can make large numbers as the Command Point limit applies so you are restricted to small squads of units, not the massive armies you expect from an RTS game.  To go with the theme of a small number of units, the maps which battles are conducted on are best summed up as tiny, cramped arenas with very little room for manouvere meaning it's goodbye to any tactical thinking and hello to comabt which feels scripted and unintelligent.  As if the unit/map situation was not already bad enough, this steaming mass of disappointment is served up in a graphical style more akin to a comic book setting, gone is the sleek, futuristic, powerful look of C&C3, it is instead replaced by  out of place, chunky, Megablocks style units, which completly destroys any sort of serious mood the game intends to create.  The graphical style of C&C4's units is so far removed from C&C3's that they're not even in the same universe, nevermind the same page.\n\n3. The story.  It's fairly obvious that the story is terrible from pretty much the word go as one of the first scenes has you, as commander, greeted by your wife.  Yep, that's right, your wife because that's just what an RTS story needs, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t love interest forced into the game.  From then on the story goes rapidly downhill, not aided by the dire acting of all those involved (with the exception of Joe Kucan) and then ends with the equivalent of "And they all rode off into the sunset and lived happily ever after."  Seriously? After having fought now at this time 4 Tiberium Wars, having battled across the globe and faced all manner of foes whilst still wondering about the mystery of Nod and Kane and what the ultimate goal could be, it ends with "Kane and all of Nod travel through the alien tower and leave GDI behind on a tiberium-free Earth having left them peacefully".  I have to wonder what it is with EA and their amazing ability to consistently screw up epic storylines and disappoint faithful fans of a beloved genre because that ending is just utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and reeks of a rushed writing crew being forced to pull something out of their asses.\n\nSo to conclude, C&C4 fails to deliver on all fronts: from dreadful mechanics and weak units, to poor acting and a storyline that could arugably have been concieved by a 5 year old, C&C4 smacks of poor quality, despiration and coporate greed.  A truly disappointing end to a great series, something that should not have come to pass.  I cannot urge you strongly enough, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\nOh and one last thing... EA please if you would kindly go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves bloody with a rusty sword that would be greatly appreiciated, you ♥♥♥♥♥.","August 29, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are only 7 GDI missions,  7 NOD missions, and 3 common missions.  I finished it all in 14 hours.  Not much room in there for story.  The story they did have, and the cutscenes, seem very low budget and thrown together.  No Hollywood actors this time around.  The final cutscene in each campaign is literally the actors standing in front of a white sheet with a drawn picture.  If they had doubled the number of missions, I would be recommending this game.  It seems like they're trying to bring a lot of focus onto multiplayer, but I'm only interested in the single player aspect.\n\nOne thing that took a little while to get used to is that they changed the gameplay style.  Previous C&C games have had the formula of building/defending/expanding a base, managing your economy and power, and trying to push out as many units as you can.  In this game, you have a fixed number of points that can be redeemed for units, another set of points for structures, and third set for skill upgrades and expanding your tech tree.  There are no power plants, harvesters, etc.  And if a unit is killed or a structure is lost, you get your points refunded, and can build it again.  A key strategy is to continually move your MCV forward, towards the goal.  This makes most of the maps very linear.  Once you can get past the dramatic difference in play style, the game actually gets enjoyable.  Though some of the time, it just feels like you're filling up your build queue so you can spam the enemy.\n\nWith the new all-in-one MCV style, they added something that I thought was not well executed.  Instead of just one kind of MCV, they now have three:  offensive, defensive, and support.  Offensive is mostly for making units.  Defensive is for setting up structures like cannons and bunkers.  Support was totally useless to me, as it's for making repairs and setting up airstrikes.  The reason why this wasn't well executed is that you could only have one MCV at a time.  So you can't be defending a structure and attacking the enemy's MCV at the same time.","July 5, 2014","false","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am happy that I bought this game for a real cheap ~4$ during this year's Summer sale. I would be furious if I wasted 20$ on this game. I would hope EA would develop a C&C5, but the "fans" insist that they don't even try and let the series die with dignity due to the horrid C&C4.

There are only 7 GDI missions,  7 NOD missions, and 3 common missions.  I finished it all in 14 hours.  Not much room in there for story.  The story they did have, and the cutscenes, seem very low budget and thrown together.  No Hollywood actors this time around.  The final cutscene in each campaign is literally the actors standing in front of a white sheet with a drawn picture.  If they had doubled the number of missions, I would be recommending this game.  It seems like they're trying to bring a lot of focus onto multiplayer, but I'm only interested in the single player aspect.\n\nOne thing that took a little while to get used to is that they changed the gameplay style.  Previous C&C games have had the formula of building/defending/expanding a base, managing your economy and power, and trying to push out as many units as you can.  In this game, you have a fixed number of points that can be redeemed for units, another set of points for structures, and third set for skill upgrades and expanding your tech tree.  There are no power plants, harvesters, etc.  And if a unit is killed or a structure is lost, you get your points refunded, and can build it again.  A key strategy is to continually move your MCV forward, towards the goal.  This makes most of the maps very linear.  Once you can get past the dramatic difference in play style, the game actually gets enjoyable.  Though some of the time, it just feels like you're filling up your build queue so you can spam the enemy.\n\nWith the new all-in-one MCV style, they added something that I thought was not well executed.  Instead of just one kind of MCV, they now have three:  offensive, defensive, and support.  Offensive is mostly for making units.  Defensive is for setting up structures like cannons and bunkers.  Support was totally useless to me, as it's for making repairs and setting up airstrikes.  The reason why this wasn't well executed is that you could only have one MCV at a time.  So you can't be defending a structure and attacking the enemy's MCV at the same time.","July 5, 2014","false","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First attempt resulted in computer rebooting during NET.framework installation. Second time involved a 20min wait while NET.framework installed, then half an hour chasing round for account details, the login screen's link led to an endless loop of entering an email and a code, never once saying 'By the way, you already have an account under that email, you're wasting your time.'\n\nOnce all these hoops have been jumped through to the games satisfaction, navigating a somewhat awkward setup menu to start a simple 1v1 skirmish with the ai, to get accustomed to the game. It would seem by default a section of the HUD is missing, map for instance is cut off at about 2/3, only showing the middle and right third. Also lack of a menu button, unless mapped to something suitably awkward, or possibly on the cut off section of the display made exiting to alter settings very awkward.\n\nA ctrl+alt+delete, 5 end task and 1 terminate process later, we come to the third attempt, resulting in entire system locking up and the plug being pulled.\n\nNet result, I want a refund, but terms and conditions state that's not going to happen, so here's to a waste of money.","November 29, 2013","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It would seem by default a section of the HUD is missing, map for instance is cut off at about 2/3, only showing the middle and right third. Also lack of a menu button, unless mapped to something suitably awkward, or possibly on the cut off section of the display made exiting to alter settings very awkward.\n\nA ctrl+alt+delete, 5 end task and 1 terminate process later, we come to the third attempt, resulting in entire system locking up and the plug being pulled.\n\nNet result, I want a refund, but terms and conditions state that's not going to happen, so here's to a waste of money.","November 29, 2013","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game is nothing alike to C&C3 and is gravely disappointing. The entire layout of the game itself is different and suffers without the classic base-defense. I was hoping that the story would lift off after C&C3: Kane's Wrath, but it seemed to stray from the storyline itself. C&C3 is my top favorite C&C. I am happy that I bought this game for a real cheap ~4$ during this year's Summer sale. I would be furious if I wasted 20$ on this game. I would hope EA would develop a C&C5, but the "fans" insist that they don't even try and let the series die with dignity due to the horrid C&C4.

It won't happen so I'd simply suggest you to play the older Command & Conquer games that are unfortunately only on Origin (except for Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wrath, Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath, Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 and Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 - Uprising.\nNot counting this one because this game is NOT a Command & Conquer game.\nCommand & Conquer 3: Red Alert was not as great as the previous ones but they are still fun unlike this, you're not too sure what to do with it after having finishing it at least once.","December 27, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is nothing alike to C&C3 and is gravely disappointing. The entire layout of the game itself is different and suffers without the classic base-defense. I was hoping that the story would lift off after C&C3: Kane's Wrath, but it seemed to stray from the storyline itself. C&C3 is my top favorite C&C. I am happy that I bought this game for a real cheap ~4$ during this year's Summer sale. I would be furious if I wasted 20$ on this game. I would hope EA would develop a C&C5, but the "fans" insist that they don't even try and let the series die with dignity due to the horrid C&C4.

(at level 20((the highest level)), you get 60 to use) Say, a nod venom, which is a TINY tier 1 hovering missile plane, takes 3 points. A nod Leviathan(HUGE) takes 20 points(you can have three of those and nothing else). See the problem now? another pain is that it needs internet 24/7, so if i go to ski, i cant play. Lastly, it gets very boring after a while. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

Generally there's only one tactic  towards a campaign.\nA bit more difficult even for senior-players of  CNCs.In that, no one deserves this.

Every new game should have things that make you feel like it's new, and they've gotten feedback, worked with ideas, and have dished out the best they could come up with. This game, saddly, feels like an RTS rendition of a game from the early 2000's. I really wish those who worked on the game had the money and/or cared enough to make this last installment a great success, and a game that would leave a good lasting memory from a series that was the foundation of the childhoods of severl individuals. ♥♥♥♥ EA. I'm so enraged that i care little to look over my comment for any errors.","May 17","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no stratigy in either.  Basically make troops, toss them to their doom and repeat.
