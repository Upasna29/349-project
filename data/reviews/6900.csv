Hitman 1...\n\nThis is an Interesting game from a Series that I have only just started getting into, I have always been interested in how far my favourite games have come from their source material; the first Hitman game I played was Hitman Blood Money and I loved it, and I was suprised on how many of the elements present in that game were not in this one.\n\nThe Beauty of Blood Money was the fact that the game could be played in pretty much any way you wanted; you could play stealthily, you could tactically pacify everyone one by one, or you could just shoot everyone. C47 however can't seem to decide on how it want's to be played, you can't really play stealthily because guards will shoot you for sneezing wrong, you can't pacify everyone because there is no non-lethal wasy of getting rid of guards, and you can't just shoot everyone because you die too quickly.\n\nThere is always one or two ways to beat a level as opposed to the large playground environments used in Blood Money, without a walkthrough you will be stuck on this game often leading to cases of unfair difficulty.\n\nAm I saying that C47 is a bad game though? No. It is simply a game that has aged poorly in several ways; the control for example is bizzare: the walk forward and run forward functions are seperate buttons. Graphically the game looks really good for 2000's standards and there are some familiar elements in this game present in future installments such as the fibre wire and Sniper rifle suitcase. You are not punished for killing enemy mooks but you are for innocent civilians, a level of frustration is reached in certain levels however when you are forced into a shootout because there is no other way around the level.\n\nIt isn't really fair to judge C47 on superior sequels, but rather look at the game itself, it isn't a bad game, but certainly not a great one, I would only reccomend this to people who have played future installments of the Franchise who want to play this out of Morbid Curiosity\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Average","November 27, 2013","true","14.1"," 74 of 86 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","74","86","0","2"

Just like any game from 2000 there will be many flaws in A.I. and level designing. Most of the levels were small and only had one or two ways of completion but that is fine because with a saving system like this one it really would have been a nightmare to beat this game. If you are caught, killed and hit space to continue from a checkpoint the guards will still be on alert EVEN if you are loaded back in an area you are sure you were safe in; they WILL find you. That is one of my very few gripes with this game as it still delivers satisfying gameplay with a variety of fun hits.\nThe story, in my opinion is the game's strength but it only picks up in the end quarter of the game and for me, it did not disappoint. Learning how 47 was created and by who was pretty awesome and I enjoyed watching it unfold. Most gamers overlook this rewarding game but I highly recommend they try it out if they are a big Hitman fan!\n\nPersonal Score: 7/10","June 25, 2015","true","12.6"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","2"

However, you may find it frustrating for:\n- Lack of checkpoints (you got one chance in a mission)\n- Controls need remapping and getting adjusted to it.\n- Camera is a bit weird.\n- Dialoug sometimes get weird.\n\nWhy would you play this game?

Aside from the gameplay, the controls arent bad, its playable, but this game has the best soundtracks which are worth listening to. The graphics is amazing of its time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwonthurtyou/recommended/6900/","iwonthurtyou","Lincoln Balloon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwonthurtyou/","287 products in account","The Hitman series of games was one I had always meant to get around to.  I owned three of the games for quite a while, but after picking up the last two (Contracts and Absolution) I finally decided to start playing through them.  Going into the first one, I fully expected it to be underwhelming.  It is old after all (released in 2000).  But even that didn't adequately prepare me for some of the infuriating old school design choices this game uses.\n\nFirst off, the game has occasional moments of brilliance.  The Hong Kong missions and the Budapest mission are shining examples of the potential of the Hitman premise.  But all the missions surrounding it are slogs to get through.  And it all comes down to one simple problem.\n\nOften, Hitman: Codename 47 doesn't seem to understand what the word "stealth" even means.\n\nTake, for example, the third jungle mission.  You're tasked with taking out a drug lord.  But he's holed up inside a mansion inside of a fenced compound crawling with guards.  There is literally no way to take him out silently.  The room he's in has only one entrance, and the moment you open the door he grabs a big machine gun and starts shooting up the place.  And if you leave any nearby guards alive, they will start shooting you immediately.  Sure, you have a couple respawns, but they don't do anything because the moment you get close to the guards that killed you they recognize you and sound the alarm once again.\n\nAnd it was in this mission that I finally realized how inconsistent the AI is.  Sometimes, they're incredibly stupid.  You can kill a guy on the other side of an open doorway from another guy, and that guy won't even notice.  However, sometimes you silently choke a guy who's in a completely different room (behind a closed door no less) from another guy, and the moment you walk through the door that guy somehow knows what you did and immediately starts shooting.  And there's no checkpoints so if everything hits the fan guess what?  You're starting that twenty minute long mission  all over again.\n\nThis wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem if it wasn't for the randomness of it all.  The guard who psychically knows that I killed his friend?  A large portion of the time, it doesn't happen.  And there's no logic to it.  Sometimes he knows.  Sometimes he doesn't.  And this is endemic throughout the entire game.\n\nThen there's the mission design, and that's where the game will occasionally get incredibly lazy.  For example, one mission involves getting through a bunch of gates to get to a boat where your target is hiding out.  Unfortunately, no matter what disguise you are wearing (even if it's the same exact one as the guards protecting the gates), they won't let you through.  They yell at you when you get close, and if you try to pass, they start shooting.  It makes even less sense when you consider that EVERY OTHER GUARD CAN WALK THROUGH JUST FINE.\n\nI feel like a lot of the people still praising this game are feeling nostalgia because they played the game when it was new.  Considering that I haven't, maybe I'm just being overly critical because I'm more used to modern game design.  Whatever the case may be, I do  not  recommend this game, especially considering that I've heard Contracts remakes the best missions from this one (namely Hong Kong and Budapest).  I honestly would have skipped it if it wasn't for my masochistic completionist ways.\n\nI do plan on reviewing the rest of the franchise as well.  I'm interested to see how it evolves over time.","March 29","false","17.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The story is your a hitman named agent 47 and you must kill targets. You can either go silent and kill your objective or you could just walk in the front door and shoot the place up. It did have some neat mechanics like posioning someones food, Disguise as an enemy, and drag bodies\nGame does get fustruating with the difficult of the people. Even on easy and medium when you die they give you an extra life or two.\n\nOne thing i personally did not like about the game and i remember it when i played it back in late 2000 if i have 20 bullets left in this uzi but if i pick up another uzi i cannot take that ammo from the gun, so than i have to carry 2 uzi's in my inventory just incase if i run out. This game allows you to carry roughly 70 items in your inventory not counting snipers, aks, mini gun, and shotgun. This only goes for sub machine guns and pistols. So if you collect the guns while killing you could get confused on which gun is empty and which is not.\n\nCons\n1.

If you are looking to get into the Hitman series and want to start at the beginning, you may or may not want to skip this one anyway.\n\nTo start off, the graphics look great for the time, even though the draw distance is fairly low. Also, on more modern systems, you need to mess with the graphics options a bit so static textures don't behave like animated .gif files. Before even touching control configuration or resolution settings, make sure to set the renderer to OpenGL, no matter what. Otherwise, on a presentation level, Hitman does it's job.\n\nAs for controls, they definitely take a bit of getting used to, and you'll definitely also have to mess with the controls for at least 20 minutes just to see what suits you. And some of the design choices for them, even for the time, don't make a whole lot of sense. Such as a dedicated sprint foreword key. Luckily, after at least five or so configuration changes, I managed.\n\nRegarding sound, the music does a pretty good job most of the time at setting the mood. Whether things are tense and you are sneaking up on your main target to slice their throat without making a peep, or running through a Columbian jungle running-and-gunning, Jasper Kyd did a solid job composing it.\n\nOn a story level, the first Hitman is a bit basic, but still captivating enough to see through to the end. One thing that really spiced my interest is the references to movies such as Scarface or The Godfather.\n\nAnd finally gameplay, well, it's a lot of trial-and-error. On many missions you will find frustration as the game expects you to sit though hours and hours of you dying from the same problem when the solution was literally in the last place you would look. I really can't blame anyone for looking up a guide or walkthrough for the game, as it really doesn't give you a clue sometimes. And in regards to the missions, there are not a lot of them, so this trial-and-error frustration doesn't last too long. Some can range heavily in length and aggravation, and most aren't very replayable or memorable. There is a difference between a proper lack of hand-holding (i.e. something akin to Metroid) and tedious bull$hit.\n\nWhat also range between missions are the bugs. Yes, this 14 year old game that they are still selling on Steam still has bugs. None of them are necessarily game-breaking, but can ruin a would-be successful play through a mission. Some range from minor visual glitches, to enemies that spawn out of nowhere that somehow see through your disguise and murder you, to the game spontaneously crashing.\n\nIn the end, for IO Interactive's first game, and it being the year 2000 when it was released, I give it a bit of leeway. And as a whole it isn't a bad game. I have to agree with the Metacritic score of 73/100 it was given.\n\nIf you really want to start Hitman from the ground up and are willing to deal with a bit of annoying cr@p here and there, maybe wait for a sale unless you are really that eager.","August 4, 2014","true","21.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Well, here's what I'll say, which is 100%, and entirely honest!\n\nThe Verdict: 9.5/10\n\nThe Reason: I have no idea\n\nThe Logic: It's been my favorite game since I was 5  years old\n\nThe GamePlay: I don't know, read someone else's review\n\n...............Yea, why are you still here? Don't you know I have better things to do than type reviews? Buy the game if you're not a little _____ like nearly every other chump here, then I suggest you buy the game. It's hard, it's fun, it's rewarding, it's out-dated, it lacks saves in levels, it lacks great AI, it lacks a lowered difficulty, but it may just tell a slightly compelling story that may just make it worth while, and maybe lead you to continue playing the series, because you aren't an imbecile,  and you actually appreciate real games for they are!\nWell, this is the end of my review, and the MAX you'll get out of it, but check out my other reviews that are for real if you'd like...and P.S., the Hitman Series is my absolute favorite game series of all time, so there you have it!","June 20, 2014","true","348.9"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

The First Hitman game (Hitman: Codename 47) took the gaming world by storm when it came out in 2000 and remains a cult classic to this day.\n\nCampaign: One of the finest Stealth / Strategy RPG's of its generation, it puts you in the role of Agent 47, a shadowy assassin who is equally capable of slipping in and out of target locations un-noticed as he is of pulling out a pair of chrome-plated 'Ballers' and taking absolutely everyone out. With a broad range of missions from the 'Lee Hong Assassination' (Rooftop Sniper takedown) to the 'Massacre at the Cheung Chow Fish House' (No one comes out alive), the game provides a wealth of memorable situations you will talk about years down the road.\n\nFlaws: The game is not without its flaws - for a game nearly 14 years old, gameplay mechanics can be somewhat clunky. Probably the biggest gripe however is the in-game Save option, which does not exist. If you are spotted in the middle of a mission or die, you will need to start the mission over. While not a big issue in the earlier (shorter) missions, this can become extremely frustrating on the later missions where you need to navigate a huge mansion with tons of guards and after 20 minutes of perfection, one mis-step means you're killed and need to restart.\n\nDo not let the gripes stop you from playing this classic which spawned 5 sequels and a movie to boot. This is the OG, the Original Hitman - where stealth, strategy and patience are virtues and the reward is the perfect hit.   Rated - (8/10)\n\n\nWant More Recommendations?\nClick the 'Follow' button on our Curator Page (Link Attached) to get the latest reviews updated directly onto your Activity Feed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freeze_25/recommended/6900/","Freeze_25","Ice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freeze_25/","427 products in account","At the time of this writing Hitman: Codename 47 is closing in on being 15 years old.\n\nHitman: Codename 47 has a great concept. It is the first hitman game I have played and has the series' iconic game mechanic of changing clothes which I found to be very fun. Sadly, that was one of the only things fun about this game.\nThe game maintains a level of enjoyment throughout except during longer missions where everything goes horrible every possible time for the player.\n\nThis game is a stealth game but often times I came to realize that the game doesnt seem to understand what a stealth game should be. Often times Agent 47 is forced into shootouts or situations that cannot be stealthed through. This becomes frustating very fast as the game also has no checkpoints and Agent 47 is relatively fragile compared to most action heroes. This lack of checkpoints makes the game challenging but less fun. Mechanics sometimes further amplify this problem as controls are imprecise and patroling guards sometimes randomly know you are the mysterious man who killed someone 2 blocks away in that back alley that no one saw or heard anything from.  The game does feature a respawn mechanic which allows the player to come back to life at a preset area (usually where you completed your last objective) ; HOWEVER, it does not make you incognito and every guard that was shooting at you before will still be shooting at you now.\n\nThe AI is terrible (Its understandable given the game is 15 years old)\nSometimes guards will be overly suspicious for no apparent reason. It is not unusual for a guard to hear a silent takedown and come running around the corner to see you over the body.. but because it was a silent takedown he obviously doesn't know it is you that performed the act. You can easily outsmart the AI but sometimes the game doesn't play by its own rules and someone downstairs three rooms away heard you when the guy right infront of you didn't.\n\nThe rules / game mechanics are vague\nEven now after beating the game and understanding the game a whole lot more than I did while playing it, I do not understand the rules of some AI or mission objectives. Often times the game throws you into a level with an absurdly vague objective and lets you wander to figure it out. Usually what you are supposed to do has very little to do with the information you were given or objectives are exponentialy more complicated than the brief mission objectives say. Mission objectives do not tell you if you have completed them or not leading to sometimes trying to leave a mission and not knowing why you cannot. Often times I have wandered into an area that gets me killed not knowing it was restricted access or worse guards only sometimes care which leads to situations where you play the exact same way twice with different results.\n\nThe difficulty\nOverall the game is challenging, but its a stealth game and getting caught is bad and gets you killed. Even ignoring the other flaws in the game the difficulty is still absurd. Missions can sometimes be really short and easy and then immediately you are thrown into a half hour minimum warzone with no idea what to do. Some missions I beat on my first try with no assistance from any walkthroughs and other missions even with walkthroughs it took me 5+ hours to beat a single mission. The first mission was almost impossible despite being incredibly straight forward. The first major assassination that takes place at a seaside restaurant is potentially the hardest. A later mission you are forced to take on a boss battle with Scarface Tony Montana who has an M60 while you have whatever little toy guns you can find lying around AND this is also in the middle of a larger mission where if you die you have to start all over due to no checkpoints.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nOverall the game isn't the worst experience of my life. Some missions in it may qualify for that title but the game overall is enjoyable. If you had checkpoints and could skip levels that were overly hard and long the game might actually be somewhat recommendable. I think the games age does play a part in why it was so hard but a little extra effort to explain details of what needed to be done would have gone a long way in making this game a much more enjoyable experience.\n\n","September 18, 2015","false","23.2"," 43 of 74 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","43","74","5","4"

The main flaws of C47 are the completely oblivious AI, the lack of an extensive rating system, and the sometimes linear level design.\n\nThe enemy AI functions more like walking sentry guns than actual guards. No matter how many times you run up behind someone the AI never turns around and the moment you acquire a disguise you're free to run around restricted areas without any suspicion.\n\nEven if the stealth isn't rewarding, the fact that 47 isn't a bullet sponge will encourage a more strategical approach. The game shines because each level plays out like a puzzle. The reward of figuring out how to assassinate your target without any prior knowledge is unlike any other game.\n\nSome of C47's best levels include Traditions of the Trade and The Lee Hong Assassination because of the expansive, non-linear level design and multiple approaches to completing the objectives. The sheer replayability of these levels are what defines Hitman as a series.\n\nWhile Codename 47 is noticeably flawed, it provided the framework for future games of the series to refine. The AI is forgiving, but at the same time the levels will require multiple playthroughs in order to find the solution. The age of the game may put some people off, but if you're really interested in the Hitman series, Codename 47 isn't a bad game to start with. At least, it's definitely better than Absolution.","March 27","true","11.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

If it's on sale, however, I highly recommend to anybody who's into the Hitman series, or anybody who wants to get into the series. Does that mean this game is awful? Absolutely not, it's a wonderful game - but it's not without its faults. Here's some pros and cons:\n\n+Although stealth is the best option, you really don't get penalized for taking the loud and dumb route.\n+Provides an exceptional challenge.\n+Plenty of missions and gameplay time (I've watched most of the game before, I haven't played it as much though).\n+Provides good story, especially considering most games from this era in time lacked basic story elements.\n+Rather than beginning out with weapons or needing to collect them, you gain weapons upon mission completion, regardless of play style.\n+Before starting your mission, you select what weapons, items, and ammo you bring into the level - but for a price, and it's only for the current mission. For the next mission, you must select/reselect your inventory again. It makes you think more strategically on what items to use, rather than just take everything you can carry.\n\n-AI is pretty terrible by today's standards, especially compared to Blood Money.\n-Can be too hard at times. Codename 47 is harder than the rest of the games.\n-No checkpoints: so if you fail or make a mistake, you restart the whole mission. Fortunately, the missions are generally fairly short.\n-Camera is awkward at times.\n-Controls are terrible. I promise, you will want to map the controls before you start the game. Here's my config, to give you an idea:\n\nWalk forward: W\nRun: Shift (hold JUST shift to run. If you're also walking forward, it will not work, strangely enough.)\nWalk left (strafe): A\nWalk right (strafe): D\nWalk backwards: S\nLean left: X\nLean right: V\nPreform action: E\nToggle sneak: C\nToggle camera mode: Alt\nDrop item: G (X works good as well)\nEquip binoculars: B\nEmpty hands (holster weapon): F\nFire: L mouse\nReload: R\nChange firing mode: Delete\nShow map: M\nMission status: Tab","March 7","true","1.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you have been gaming since before 1990 and have patience, buy this game. I have followed the Hitman franchise but played the 2nd game first. I appreciate the older graphics and more difficult gameplay to a degree. If you purchase this game, bare in mind that the mechanics, AI, and gameplay will be completely different from the way games are created and played now. It is a difficult game to play but after a couple of  missions, it will be easier and you will understand how everything works.\n\nI enjoyed the large weapon selection, the fact you can sneak up on enemies, kill them and then drag the body and take the clothing. That is how basic the game works. You cannot hide bodies unless you just basically keep them out of site. If you are a Hitman fan, buy this game because it explains the beginning of the story and how Agent 47 came to be. If you decide not to play this game, Hitman: Contracts (3rd game) is a remake of Hitman: Codename 47.\n\nStill, the game is a classic nonetheless, and is definitely worth the buy if you have patience. We all have those older games we grew up playing and would recommend them to others. Although this was not a game I grew up playing, I still give it 4 out of 5 stars.

You are then quickly taken through a series of training exercises and then given your first assignment. You never ask why, nor question who it is that sends you on these missions. You simply are a hitman, devoid of any ethical dilemmas or personal identity. As you progress through the story you will eventually begin to discover clues as to your origin but for now, there are people alive that shouldn't be.\n\nEach mission sets you into a open area with guards, civilians, cops and others roaming the place. Various events within the missions are timed, as your targets goes about their business and it's up to you to pick the time, place and method by which you dispatch them. Different missions provide different obstacles and while all the missions have a path of least resistance you will often find yourself experimenting with different plans.\n\nWhich weapons and items you bring with you is chosen at the start of the mission at a fee although you can also pick up and use what you find throughout the mission as well as take the clothes of any unfortunate henchmen or passerby you happen to kill or incapacitate and although it requires some effort to get past the suspension of disbelief it requires when a 7ft. blad psycho with a bar-code tattoo on the back of his head passes for an oriental chef with only a change of shirts the mechanic works wonderfully in the game and the many disguises and the various places they allow you to go opens up many more avenues leading towards your target.\n\nIn general the open-ended nature of the missions is what separates Hitman 47 from the pack. An early mission has you recreating the classic Sollozzo assassination from the Godfather movie. You can play along with the movie, stashing a gun in toilet, go to the meeting, excuse yourself and then come out shooting. You can also walk through the front door with your gun cocked taking out the targets henchmen first, or you can wait for the target to go to bathroom himself and shoot him through the window, or one of a myriad of other possibilities that the game gives you.\n\nThe game looks stunning for it's time, with high quality graphics and textures. The maps are big but never devoid of life. Sound quality is acceptable but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nIt is not all roses however, the game hasn't aged well and what was great graphics back in the day is now all but unplayable to a modern audience. The lack of a proper save game function was not acceptable, even back then.\n\nAll in all Hitman Codename 47 is a great experience, the open maps and the many paths to chose from makes this one of the few true assassination games. A definite buy for any fans of stealth and subterfuge.","May 31, 2013","true","31.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This game is riddled with problems that honestly I'm surprised I kept playing it all the way until the end. In theory, this game gives you objectives and then lets you figure out how to handle them. In practice however, the levels only really allow for one specific strategy in order to complete them. It ends up becoming a game that, rather than being about finding creative ways to brutally kill people, is really just about figuring out what you exactly must do to finish the level and then executing it.\n\nSo there's basically no variation. Also the AI is beyond terrible. I've shot guards and, so long as nobody saw me shoot them, I could stand right next to the body as the guards run up to investigate without thinking that I was the one who did it. I suppose I should be grateful about this though, because you need to kill plenty of people to finish each level. And if you get caught, expect to end up in a massive gunfight that you can have serious trouble surviving. A single witness or one unsilenced gunshot can ruin everything. Sadly, while there are a few levels that truly allow you to be a sneaky hitman, there are more levels where you are just gunning people down. And the last level doesn't even try: it's a straight shootout without any chance for subtle tactics.\n\nIf you want to be a sneaky assassin, this is not the game for you. This game's only real value at this point is that it messed up enough that the game developers had to learn from the mistakes made here. And that led to them making the fantastic Hitman: Blood Money.\n\nBut there's no real reason to play this one.

There was a remake called "Contracts", but this is better.\n\nItches a scratch no other game can. Especially after a long day at work.\n\nThe interface is shunned by some people, but I find it better than in the rest of the series. You can aim precisely with your "eyes" standing still - this is what hitmen and bodyguards do under those sunglasses I presume. basically you can "unhook" your reticle from the character and move his aimpoint around. This is important because, like in real life, you aim with your mind first and then take out a weapon to perform a shot. ot me, this brings another level of immersion, especially knowing that your character is a cunning assassin who is meant to be as inconspicuous as possible until the last moment.\n\nThere is also a more realistic representation of weapons in the game, for example you can pick up two different guns and use them akimbo-style, if you so wish, and have a beretta in one hand and a hardballer in the other.\n\nIt is not easy to create a game with same game mechanics, but also suited for different playstyles. The mission diversity is just right. From creeping in the shadows of a hotel, to starting a Rambo-style war in the jungle. Some see this as a drawback, but I prefer variety in games, especially inventive stealth ones like this title, where you can pick from a myriad of approaches to eliminate your target.","April 29, 2013","true","86.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaxmith/recommended/6900/","jaxmith","JaxMith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaxmith/","448 products in account","Hitman: Codename 47\nTL;DR - Skip this, buy the second game\n\nI would like to start off by saying that, as of writing this review, I have played every Hitman game, with the exception of Contracts. This gives me the opportunity to compare the games with each other and how well they (still) hold up.\n\nUnfortunately, “Hitman: Codename 47” does not hold up very much. Time was not very kind to the game and it surely hasn’t aged all too well, making it rather difficult to recommend a playthrough.\n\nThere are a number of issues that plaque Codename 47. Being made 2000, it sure looks and plays like a contemporary game of that era. The graphics are okay at best, but like many early 3D games, everything is kind of blocky, which might be the result of IO-Interactive being a very small developer with limited resources back in the day. The gameplay is just plain clunky and overly complicated for no apparent reason. Seriously, different buttons for normal walking speed and running, sidestepping (strafing) and turning around? It took a while and a lot of key rebinding to get used to these controls personally. Anyone who played other or modern FPS/TPS will likely have the same issue.\n\nRegarding the music, it’s good. Jesper Kyd, whom you may know as the composer for other games such as Assassin’s Creed, Borderlands and Kane & Lynch, is doing a fantastic job with very ambient, moody pieces, setting a perfect tone to a gritty game full of wetwork. The sound engineering in general is okay, nothing to complain about.\n\nHowever, the voice acting is atrocious. Thank god they casted people with their respective dialect to fit the correlating character, but none of them are any good. Especially Agent 47 himself sounds just really silly and it’s hard to take him serious. Then again, a lot of games had this problem and still have, so it’s hard to fault the game just on the VA alone. David Bateson, voice actor for 47, reprised his role in subsequent sequels, doing a lot better in those thankfully.\n\nNow, the biggest problem with “Codename 47” is simple: it just isn’t very good. What first appears to be a game about being sneaky and confronting targets with care and silence quickly just turns into a game that feels like a run-and-gun shooter, a pretty bad one. With the exception of two or three missions, the most part of the game is spent on gunning down the henchmen of your targets, before executing the targets themselves. Normally I don’t have a problem with blasting my way through waves of bad guys, however the problem here is A) we’re supposed to be a silent killer, so what gives? And B) the enemies have an unforgiving pin-point accuracy, leaving you dead before you can even insult the game for the cheap enemy fire.\n\nThings that are supposed to aid you in your quest are meaningless. Taking on disguises of dispatched enemies often times doesn’t work in your favor, simply raising an alarm for the AI, which, in this game means “Everyone knows who you are, even in disguise. Why? Because the game hates you”. The AI WILL see you, disguise or not, from across the map. They will follow you, find you and they will kill you, because apparently everyone absolved with a diploma from the Liam Neeson School Of Premeditated Murder. And did I mention some missions have a failstate? So when the alarm is raised, you’re pretty much out of luck and will have to restart the mission if you’re not quick enough to get to your target. Simply put, the AI is broken beyond belief and leaves a bitter taste on an otherwise promising game.\n\nAlthough I’ve been very critical about “Codename 47”, I want to address that I’ve had my fair share of fun with it. I loathed it more than enjoying it, but I would be lying if I didn’t enjoy some aspects, like the few missions which feel like actual Hitman games (the missions “The Lee Hong Assassination” and “Traditions of the Trade” come to mind).\n\n“Hitman: Codename 74” sets the foundations for a fantastic and still mostly unique video game franchises. The debut game is sadly overshadowed by subsequent games in every conceivable way. With the second game in the series, “Silent Assassin”, IO-Interactive out-done themselves already.\n\nIf you would like to know how the franchise started, give it try. However, if you want to play a game that feels more like a proper Hitman, skip this one and just continue with the second game, Silent Assassin. Otherwise, try “Hitman: Contracts” which is basically an expanding and proper remake of the debut.","August 26, 2015","false","15.8"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","16","29","4","0"

Be warned this is not an easy game as it requires lots of patience combined with a hefty duration of trial & error. Also, the default controls doesn't do this game justice as they are horrible, I suggest you tweak the controls to your liking before playing. In addition you can't save the game so if you get killed or spotted you might aswell restart the mission by pressing Shift+Esc as the checkpoint system sucks and it will put everyone on high alert. Some missions can be long and tedious especially a level called  plutonium runs loose  iff you know what you are doing as most missions should take no more than 10-15 mins to complete. However, if you are willing to go for the ride you are rewarded with an amazing experiance. There is a feeling of satisfaction when completing a mission, taking out a guard and hiding his body then using his disguise to traverse the level undetected. The graphics are tollerable but there is alot of jaggies when you run this game in high resolution. This is easily fixed by applying AA in your graphics control panel, I personally applied 4xmsaa in the nvidia control panel and it worked like a charm.\nThe steam version has some flaws, which are listed below with some fixes:\nWhen you first launch the game, you might get "Failed to find Steam" error. To fix this Verify integrity of game cache or Copy the steam.dll in the steam folder to the "Steam\SteamApps\common\hitman codename 47" directory. Now the game will launch.\nTo fix some in-game crashes make sure to run the Hitman.exe in Windows XP (Service Pack 2) Compatibility Mode.\nTo run the game in widescreen resolution, you need to edit the Hitman.ini file in the install directory.\nThere is a problem with the steam overlay not displaying correctly and in my case it didn't appear at all. I wasn't able to fix this problem.\nHere are my recommended .ini tweaks:Include Setup\Locale.zip\n//DrawDll Render3DFX.dll\nDrawDll RenderOpenGL.dll\n//DrawDll RenderOpenGL.dll\nSoundDll Sound.dll\nScriptDll GSC.dll\nLocaleDLL Locale.dll\nResolution 1920x1080\nColorDepth 32\nAnisotropy 2\nAntiAlias\nDisableLight\nShadowDetail 2\nTextureResolution 0\nDisableDXT\nDisablePAL\nWindow\nStartUpperPos 0,0Note: In order to make the .ini tweaks to work do not run the configuration utility, do not change the graphics settings in-game. If you verified the game cache, the hitman.ini file will be restored to default, so make sure to back up your .ini file just in case.To sum up I recommened this game to old school stealth fans or to anyone who likes challenging games.","August 2, 2014","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

This was the first assassin-theme game I ever played. I instantly got into it, and carried out a little obsession with assassin's, thieves, spies and other people of that kind to present days.  So it was fun back then, I even recall a moment when I called a friend to help me figure out the level, sweet memories.\n\nThe reason behind negative review is because we became spoiled. Times back then we didn't had that much variety of games and stuff we have now. Games like this was jewels. When I came back to this, I haven't got even half of the fun I had back then. This game have alot of problems. It all begins with a some bugs and glitches and end up in sometimes just terrible level design. Some events have no logic behind it, like say a mission in harbour, when a guy comes up from guarded doors, you can kill him and take his clothes, but guards still won't let you in for some reason. Beside all this, the game is relentless - you will die in a matter of seconds even on low difficulty. You of course have a restarts, but they have a little sense, since the guards already know that they need to kill you, and so you die, again. To a matter of fact, enemies sometime attack you out of spite, with no reason behind it, and you will have to replay level all over again coz' game only saves between levels. Also, why they would give you immense amount of money, when you can't even spent 1/4 of them, even if you buy everything on every mission.\n\nThis all leads to a complete frustration - the game you might admired so much back then doesn't seem so good anymore. To enjoy this game you need to get a time machine, otherwise it's just not worth it. Returning players may get some nostalgia out of it, but it will remain good if you won't push yourself. Newcomers might aswell read the plot and move on to the next part, which is alot more better in every way.","February 4, 2014","false","7.3"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","26","50","0","1"

My reason for this is because I can tell you EXACTLY how I found out about Hitman Codename 47 and I was with my family and I remember asking my father to buy it for me and it's just a long story and a very sentimental moment for and this game only deserves respect. For a 2000 game it's an amazing work and an inteligent story line. I definitely had hard time adjusting to the controls and the graphics... Well you know it's not going to be outstanding but if you are in your early 20s or mid 20s you will definitely understand why I am attached to this game. It is amazing how much the Hitman franchise have evolved and I would never imagine there would be a movie when I got the game 15 years ago. I feel old being able to say 15 years ago and clearly remember everything but this memory is one of the things that made it very well worth it. It introduces you to the Hitman series in an amazing light and you gotta bear with it since nowadays game are a lot easier to control and technology have evolved to the point we have Virtual Reality. Even in Sci-Fi movies this idea was ridiculous 10-15 years ago. You don't HAVE to play this one in order to understand the story line but it definitely makes it easier to understand the idea behind Hitman and gives you a mental trophy; do not be fooled, this one is a tough one. In the more complicated levels you get a few chances to complete the level and pretty much restart a couple time after you died but don't expect convenient Save Games. You gotta really think here and beat the odd bugs here and there. I could keep on rambling for another 3000 words but point is this game is worth it, you don't judge a game just by how it looks and operates comparing to games noawadays. There are at least 10 major factors you have to take into account. This game did a great job portraying the life of a hitman and had an amazing story-line and really put you in the game and feels somewhat like a puzzle because it's not just aimless shooting and you die realistically after a couple hits or like 5-10 shots if you are hit in the kevlar vest. I enjoyed this game a lot and also enjoyed being frustrated with this game, it definitely brought back memories from when games took more than 5-15 hours to beat. I give this one 8.5/10 (could be less buggy and the saving system could be more intelligent and other very small factors made me rank it as 8.5/10) I tried ranking it without keeping in mind this became a successful Series and just ranked it as if this was the only Hitman game out there.

Put aside these differences (because that's what they are, not flaws or negative features) the game offers players to see the history and story behind Agent 47.

You can carry guns when disguised but for some reason people will shoot at you if you carry a specific weapon which makes no sense, and even less sense since you find that weapon from their own base. Like for the two parts of columbia you can take a sniper from them and walk normally, but once in third part they'll suddenly shoot at you for no reason. One annoying thing is that people will see you ready your weapons even if you're behind them, you have to crouch so that they don't see you. I have to check guides to see how the AI works before starting a mission because of how random it is.\n\nThe voice acting is also hilariously bad.\n\nI love the Hitman series and I say skip this one.","June 30, 2015","false","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Agent 47, his demeanour is cold, calculative and as sharp as a .338 Lapua Magnum round in your Cerebral Cortex, is set out to join the ICA, his base of operations that deliver him contracts to take up in assassinating his marks for money, however the marks set by his client may not be exactly say who he actually is.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay in Hitman Codename 47 places you in an open area with different places to execute killshots or strangulate your mark. Killing too many civilians will severely reduce your paygrade and the ability to purchase ammo and other equipment for the job and committing mass murder of innocents will inevitable cause you to fail the mission.\n\nGraphics\nThis game features radiosity shadowing, high polygon counts and high resolution textures and use of physics ragdolls which were impressive for their time (near 2000). Though the repetition in the use of urban buildings is overused and the sprite/flat shaded sprites and textures for foilage are not very well done. The draw distance is terrible\n\nSound\nThe games audio has high use of fidelity (16 bit, 48Khz was considerably high) in its soundtracks and is focused mainly on its theme which has a Jungle and Classical genre feel to it, sound effects are done to great effect, representing a solid bullet shot out of a Sniper Rifle into the flesh of someones face.","January 8, 2014","true","15.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I only got into this game recently due to only being a Hitman fan since the release of Absolution (Then buyiing every other Hitman game).\n\nIf you are unfamiller with the Hitman series, it's basically about the most amazing Assassin, traveling around the world killing peole.\n\nUnlike the new entry in the series, where there are so many ways to do one thing, Codename 47 dissapointingly doesn't have many ways to finish the levels. It's like there are one or two ways of getting past guard, one way to kill him, one or two ways to kill him.\n\nThe game isn't bad in any way, it's just a bit dissapointing in comparison to it's years older sequals.\nLooking at the game itself, it looks good for a game that game out in 2000. The levels are pretty unique and it's really good fun at most times, though one mistake and your screwed, I am unable to shoot out every guard like in the newer games or run around a corner and hide.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who have already played the newer games in the series and want to continue playing Hitman because as a Hitman game, it is great. You buy your weapons at the start of every mission so you have to plan  how your going to do it before beginning. So, overall I would give this game a 6.5/10, good, not terrible or great.","April 28, 2014","true","9.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If anything Im really starting to dislike it.\n\nSo first things first. Nothing really works correctly. Its a stealth actiony game right? But stealth is bugged most the time. Try to sneak up behind a guy with fiber wire or a knife to silently kill him? He will turn around and shoot you in the face. The AI is like your mom in that they have eyes in the back of their heads. Thats a creepy thought....\n\nAlso sometimes disguises will cease to work. Get into a shoot out and run off and put on a new outfit and some AI will still try and kill you on sight while others....just are okay with you. Its confusing and goes against later installments in the series. Some AI will instincively know it was you who killed some random guy so they will go out of their way to shoot you in the face. Its completely broken for me in the Lee Hong mission and thats where I stopped. So it feels more bugged in this way. Theres alot of other smaller things that just seem weird or broken like occasionally things get stuck floating that should have physics applied to. I suspect it would have been very easy to patch the AI in this so that the encounters like I mentioned don't happen in the ways they do but nope. This is just the old game.\n\nLots and lots of trial and error. You need to go through missions by the book or you outright fail the mission. You might make it to the exfiltration point with all objectives finished only to find you attracted to much attention so you still fail anyway. Enjoy replaying that mission. You have the illusion of choice but in reality there is right and wrong ways to finish the missions. Atleast thats my experience up to the Lee Hong Assasination mission since I can't finish the same thing.\n\nAlso, no save states? No saving at all inside a mission? Only a horrible respawn system that respawns you a set number of times upon death but the mission remains the same the moment you died? Its really the worst way I have ever seen for handling player death and checkpointing as its the easiest way design/programming wise but probably the most jarring and confusing gameplay wise.\n\nThe games just not very good. I would suggest playing Blood Money if you just want to play a good Hitman game (don't touch Absolution as its absolutely garbage!) or any of the later games.\n\nI can look past the graphics and sound, but when the gameplay is meh....its just meh.","July 30, 2014","false","6.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","2"

Buggy af. Can't even count anymore how often I got attacked WITHOUT ANY REASON. 2 Chances to respawn at a checkoint in the middle of the mission if you die. No matter which point it is, in 90% of the times it does NOT reset that guards are attacking you (even if you spawn at a point where you didnt even kill anybody or did anything else which would draw the enemies aggro)\nMissions are just guessing what to do. When you found out after 1000 trial & error attempts, how the mission is supposed to be completet, theres still a huge random factor due to bugs if you can finish the mission.\n\nSorry to say since I thought the first Hitman title might be cool and the reason for the big success of the series nowaday, but now I'm really supprised that Hitman ever got any success at all. It's not the only old title I've played, so I can say that the age of this game is NO excuse for the ♥♥♥♥ you get.\n","March 16","false","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Also follow the display guide on the guides section.\n\nWell, this is the game that actually got me into games. I remember my father playing it. I was like OH GOD STEALTHY, DAD WATCH OUT, DAD WHY DONT YOU CHANGE TO THOSE CLOTHES, DAD LOOK THE IDIOT LEFT A MASTER KEY ON THE DOOR. Good times.\n\nNow that I'm older I can notice the terrible voice acting LOL. The worst actor is actually 47, and that makes me laugh a lot. But well. YES I recommend this game. It's old? yes. You'll have some display problems that are quickly solvable? yes. Worth it? YES. There's even a fix for you to expand the default drawing distance.\n\nThis was a time when the game didn't actually have any guide or reference for this particular way of tackling the "stealth" genre so not all the levels are pure stealth. You'll kind of hate the jungle levels, one in amsterdam and the final one (kind of a Boss fight) since they force you to reveal yourself and shoot and kill heavily armed, non final target NPCs. It took me hours (even now that I'm an experienced player) to pass the final jungle mission. Buy a freaking Kevlar jacket :D I have to say though, It's rewarding to place a good headshot.\n\nOther than those things, there are memorable missions: Lee Hong's, Frantz Fuchs', Boris' that, despite being featured in Hitman Contracts, they are played differently here. One warning though. The game's hardcore and unforgiving. Depending on the difficulty setting, you're given a number of lives. Resurrecting doesn't make the guards forget about you LOL. In the hardest setting you are given one extra live only in the hardest missions. Be patient and play well. Plan your assasinations, choose well your targets and weapons. "Wake up! Wake up my friend!" :D\n\nConclusion: This game is a classic, it has its flaws but its enjoyable. I'd recommend buying it on a sale. It's worth it. If you have a config problem just leave me a comment. Maybe I'll be able to help.","December 11, 2015","true","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, I would not recommend playing this game unless you're a Hitman fan that's interested in how the series started. I played all the other Hitman games on PS2 and XBox 360, and I was interested to see how it all began with this game, but I finished it feeling a little disappointed.\n\nThe Hitman series, as a whole, is action-stealth, usually with a strong emphasis on stealth. I'd say this game is more a strong emphasis on action. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of stealth to be had, but there are several parts of the game where it's necessary to, say, clear out a room of thugs to continue the objective. I mean, the last mission is nothing but shooting; there's absolutely no stealth option.\n\nThe mission locations are basically sandboxes like in the subsequent games, with what seems to be plenty of ways to accomplish the mission on the surface, but oftentimes there's only one surefire way to truly complete your objective; all other "methods" will likely result in blowing your cover and dying. And trust me, you don't want to die in this game; there's no checkpoints or saves, and you have to restart the entire mission if you fail. It's very frustrating to waste 20 minutes and die because you unknowingly trespassed and was shot to death in seconds; it's very easy to die, even with armor on.\n\nThe game is buggy; there were times that I pressed escape to open the main menu and it would restart the mission instead, erasing all my progress in that level and forcing me to start from scratch. The game crashed twice in my playthrough, which is to be expected when running such an old game. I got stuck on the world geometry often; there was one time where I had to restart the level right at the end because I was stuck on a flight of stairs.\n\nIf you're looking for fun action-stealth gameplay, I would suggest playing the other, later, Hitman games. Codename 47 left a bad impression on me, and I can't see myself playing it for fun anytime soon.\n","June 26, 2015","false","8.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","5"

And frustration at the Scarface reference. The game gives you many options to complete your objective, some of which are not as obvious or easy to execute as others, so you start experimenting while carefully weighing risk versus gain, since there is no save function.\nIf you die, you restart the level.\n\nTo the end, missions get more complex and way more difficult, so difficult, that at one point I had to abuse the AI and wait with a drawn gun behind a door, waiting for the enemies to parse through it one by one.\n\nCompared to newer games (Hitman: Absolution for example), this game is worse looking, has clunkier controls, but gameplay that is a thousand times better than Absolution.\n\nThat said though, if you want the best Hitman experience, get Hitman: Blood Money. You can skip Hitman: Silent Assassin and you should most definitely skip Hitman: Absolution.","December 15, 2014","true","15.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Standing in front of someone trying to hit him and constantly missing.\nMaybe I missed it (no wonder considering how outlandish the key mapping is), but there seems to be no way to actually AIM the weapon - sure, you have a crosshair, but if I take my time aiming I might actually HIT something, instead of firing a circle around the target.\n\nApparently if you have too many "unecessary" kills (in my case: police that was immediately aware that I killed someone), you lose the silence gun.\nSure, makes sense - after all, the last thing I might do is try to avoid detection, how could that help prevent unecessary kills?\n\nHere's to hoping the rest of the series is better...\n\n(BTW: if you want to play it, for story, I heavily recommend a cheat for godmode. But it's still annoying as hell. I don't want to go through massacring everyone, but I guess the game wants me to...)\n\n\nAlmost forgot - regarding weapons. Of course you can pick up the weapons of killed enemies. It would be stupid if you couldn't, right?\nEspecially if you're using exactly the same gun as them - easy ammo, isn't it? Of course not. Any new weapon you pickup is ADDED to your inventory - so you might end up having half a dozen UZIs in your inventory - all of them empty, but one.\n(You can drop items, though.

Hitman: Codename 47 had freaking awesome visuals for a 2000 release and the music is most definitely by Jesper Kyd but at the same time the combat feels clunky, the voice acting is completely lifeless and the mission design itself is lacklustre and not very player friendly. Codename 47 also has perhaps the worst difficulty curve I've felt on a PC game and the lack of quick-saving or mid-game saves of anykind makes approaching levels properly more frustrating than it should be. What saddens me the most is that many of the levels and story elements explored in the first Hitman are replayable in the vastly superior Hitman Contracts, which is also on PC. Great. Except there is one problem: Hitman Contracts isn't available on Steam. Damn.","December 6, 2012","false","6.0"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

However, its not exactly bad, just a bit poorly executed. Also the interface is fairly bad (I'm looking at YOU map!).\n\nUnfortunately the game doesn't work on a quicksave/quickload system like a lot of FPS'/ later Hitman games, oh no. It works on limited checkpoint system that just respawns you at a certain point you got up to, without actually altering your progress made from up to that point. So lets say you bite the dust whilst having alerted every damn enemy in the map. They will STILL BE ALERTED. And a lot of the time, if you alert everyone and don't do something about it FAST, your main target will be alerted and he will haul it out of there faster than you can say game over.\n\nI only beat about 3 levels before it got to the point where the game just got too hard and annoying for me. I just honestly gave up and just watched someone else play the rest of the game via the internets, and had no regrets in doing so. A lot of the things you have to do looks obscure and hard to pull off.\n\nLater Hitman games are much more playable, so I suggest you ignore this one at first unless you have absurd amounts of patience, wit, and skill.","November 10, 2013","false","2.0"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

Don’t get me wrong, the core concept for an amazing modern stealth game is there. You can kill people and steal their clothing and identity, and stealth melee takedown is epic. The open ended mission map is quite a concept to behold for a decade old game. Too bad this falls short everywhere else. The animation and character models look like pure ♥♥♥♥. Voice acting is hilariously bad and plot design does this game no credit. You basically play through 9/12 missions not knowing anything about the origin of codename 47. To top it all off this game probably has the worst controls of any stealth based games. Everything feels clumsy, down to the freakin camera controls. If you want to really know the origin of Codename 47, go read a wiki.

However 47 does not feel like an insanely overpowered ninja killing machine in the first entry to the series, little aid to help you out during missions makes the game impossible for new players to play and each mission feels like a drag, they levels are poorly designed and most missions frustratingly enough only one or two sensible ways to kill your target which is quite honestly pathetic, you may either poison this fat man, or shoot this fat man. The checkpoint system is laughable, when you die, cool! You would expect to go back to a checkpoint, right? Wrong. When you die you respawn at the start of the level but all the guards are already on high alert and will blow your head off the second they lay eyes on you, it is easier to completely restart the level than to fight through the hordes of enemies that will inevitably get the better of you.\n\nHitman: Codename 47 had some interesting ideas that were new to the world of gaming when it first came out but the lack of help for new players or lack of methods to kill your target were extremely frustrating which means I give the game\n4/10","December 4, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting is also decent. While not as professional as the later games, they still fit, and David Bateson does a good job giving 47 the voice we all know and recognize. The graphics, if one accepts that it is an older game, are still pretty decent, and the game creates really great atmosphere in the levels, along with the fantastic music composed by Jesper Kyd.\nThe controls can be a tad difficult to get used to, although you do get used to it. Warning: The deafult controls aren't the usual WASD-controls, so I recommend changing them in the settings.\nIt's hard as crap, and while that definitely can be a good thing, it can also become quite annoying at times. There are times, where you lose the idea of what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go. It doesn't help that the maps are usually pretty large, and while you do have a map, it becomes easy to get lost if there is no clear goal on the map. The big maps can also be annoying when you die, and you restart at a much earlier point on the map, which means a lot of retracking to get back to the point required to continue the mission.\nAlso, while you can try to go Rambo in the missions, it's not a good idea, as you die very quickly, even when you use Bulletproof Vests.\nOverall, while the game does have some annoyances that were common at its original release-date, Hitman: Codename 47 can still be enjoyed today, although it is required to overlook the shortcomings.\nLast note: The mouse sensitivity goes crazy when I tried to change the resolution, so if that problem occurs, start the game again as an Adminstrator or change resolution to 800x600 in the Hitman.ini-file in the Hitman-folder.","March 29, 2015","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Something most shooters are lacking for instance. Hitman carries on the tradition of Thief, where intelligent stealth and planning of your equipment beats the loadout you are carrying.\n\nAnd here starts the pain:\nStealth is nothing you just do, it is a hard earned skill of knowing what to do and when. Sometimes this means a Minute or two of simply doing -nothing- waiting, pacing and taking your time. Sometimes Stealth means being really quick and just not missing the right moment. Most of the Time Stealth means: Use one bullet max, the rest is knifework.\n\nThese lessons are hard taught in C47 and none of it´s successors retaliates so hard on missing out on any relevant detail. On the other hand you realy have a feeling of -beating- the game and not just dangling along.\n\nThis is why I enjoyed it just like Thief, back in the days, and am learning the hard way, that a lot of my patience and skills from back then have given way to a happy triggerfinger, which is needed a lot more in other games.\n\nTo Wrap things up:\nC47 was clearly ahead of it´s time gameplay wise and it is still a challenge to beat.\nThe Risk and Reward system really works well and the frustration level for tiny misteps is enormous, as you wont be able to save a level.\nIt is just like going by Yoda: Do, or do not! There is no try!","January 22, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a genuine classic and that's not just nostalgia talking. The game is a challenging stealth action game where you play as 47 the hitman as he completes assassinations around the world. For me this game has the best story out of the hitman franchise (Bloodmoney is the best game though), it has great art design and music, great memorable levels and the gameplay is satisfyingly challenging though some might find it frustrating. If playing this for the first time the controls will probably have to be completely reconfigured to make them easier to grasp for a modern gamer. This game is highly recommended by me. If you are already a Hitman fan but never played his debut you owe it to youself to get it.","February 10, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a loudspeaker instructing you to do various tasks from putting your clothes on, scaling obstacles and using firearms to become an efficient assassin. Now after completing all the tasks you end up escaping from the sanatorium. Later on about you aka subject 47 end up as a professional hitman of the International Contract Agency (ICA), now known as Agent 47. He is briefed by his handler, Diana Burnwood, and sent around the globe to eliminate four criminal masterminds with large enterprises, companies and crews. You gradually go through the missions, learning as you go. To an interesting end for that part of this game series.\n\nGame play: Hitman Codename 47 is played in a third-person perspective with a control setup is similar to a first person shooter. Each level is an open environment which is populated with NPC's such as civilians and armed guards. Now basically you as Agent 47. Carry out your assignments, which usually is to kill some one. But they can be other things your are told to do. Some may say the paths may appear linear in the game. But that is wrong there is many different ways you can accomplish your missions. But the game essentially emphasises stealth and silent kills without raising alerts, giving the player a higher financial reward for doing so. Penalties in the form of financial deductions are given, for example if the player kills civilians.\n\nDisguise plays a large role in gameplay. Any NPC that Agent 47 (You) kills you can take their clothes which can help you in completing the mission. But you must also make sure no on finds that body or you disguise will be useless. So there is alot to the game play of this game which makes it a fun game to play in the Hitman Series.\n\nThe Graphics: Well if you compare them to the graphics we have they do not even stand a chance. But for the graphics back then when the game came out. They were certainly good. Even now I can still play it with how it looks.\n\nControls: Simple mouse and keyboard setup. You can customize your key to suit you.\n\nThe Music: What can I say the music with this is just works right in my view. It always had held a place in this gamers heart in the Hitman Series.\n\nThe Reply Value: Unless you wish to try possible different ways to do each mission. There is not much reply value.\n\nBugs/Glitches: Well back then I don't remember seeing any issues with the game. But now there is some. Due to the game not really made to work properly on higher OS's than when it came out. But don't let that stop you. There is fixes for start up issues on the Steam and GOG forums.\n\nOverall: Story had me intrigued right up to the end. The game play is just right for this type of game, even for my psycho style I play some times. Graphics as I said good for when the game came out. But certainly couldn't hold a candle to today's. But that certainly didn't stop me from playing it. Controls simple easy to configure, what more could you ask for. Music just right for the game. Reply value it is there but not alot. Bugs/Glitches as I said for new OS/Systems yes, but there is fixes out there. So taking in the everything even when the game came out. I give this a 9 out of 10.","March 13, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting is also decent. While not as professional as the later games, they still fit, and David Bateson does a good job giving 47 the voice we all know and recognize. The graphics, if one accepts that it is an older game, are still pretty decent, and the game creates really great atmosphere in the levels, along with the fantastic music composed by Jesper Kyd.\nThe controls can be a tad difficult to get used to, although you do get used to it. Warning: The deafult controls aren't the usual WASD-controls, so I recommend changing them in the settings.\nIt's hard as crap, and while that definitely can be a good thing, it can also become quite annoying at times. There are times, where you lose the idea of what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go. It doesn't help that the maps are usually pretty large, and while you do have a map, it becomes easy to get lost if there is no clear goal on the map. The big maps can also be annoying when you die, and you restart at a much earlier point on the map, which means a lot of retracking to get back to the point required to continue the mission.\nAlso, while you can try to go Rambo in the missions, it's not a good idea, as you die very quickly, even when you use Bulletproof Vests.\nOverall, while the game does have some annoyances that were common at its original release-date, Hitman: Codename 47 can still be enjoyed today, although it is required to overlook the shortcomings.\nLast note: The mouse sensitivity goes crazy when I tried to change the resolution, so if that problem occurs, start the game again as an Adminstrator or change resolution to 800x600 in the Hitman.ini-file in the Hitman-folder.","March 29, 2015","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's because I'd always read articles about it and I was always dying to give it a try, but of course, the prices were often outrageous. Anyway, after I've got home and installed, I've noticed was that the game wasn't easy at all, so I've failed several times only by trying to learn how to work around my way with the tools of the trade. After finishing almost every single mission, eventually I've got to the penultimate and I've got stuck (there were no FAQs available in my mother's tongue and my english was even worse than now). Ok, so after a whole lot of frustration I've deleted the game and later I found redemption in the series through the following volumes of the franchise (except maybe for Contracts, it was kinda disappointing in my opinion). Now after all these years, Steam released the first game for an interesting price and I was like "what the hell", so I decided to give it a go again. I don't know if my memory is bad or not, but I don't really remember anything about having a checkpoint during the missions. Besides that, for some strange reason, no matter how perfect my aim would be, I'd always end up shooting at the wrong places (such as the arms of the bad guys, who'd end up looking like a bunch of tubemen). Seriously, no matter how many bullets you'd fire there, they'd still have enough strength and control to shoot you down as if your projectiles were mere flea bites. Well, after a few rage quits, I've finally got to that same part which I was stuck in the past and naturally the same thing happened again, only that this time I had the necessary means to get through that situation and finally manage to beat the game. Ok, after all that, what's my conclusion? It was a mix of nostalgia with disappointment, but I'm still giving a thumbs up for the good times I had before (especially with the wistful cheat codes).","September 23, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're new to the Hitman series, SKIP this game and get Blood Money! This game is annoyingly hard and only has one or two solutions to each mission. The besides difficulty, the controls are also broken. The graphics are what you would expect from 10+ year old game made in the early 2000's.......it's s**t (though very good when it was released). Its sounds like I'm bagging on this game, but truthfully I expected a better game. In all honesty, this game is what generally started the stealth game craze back in the day even to the point where Assassin's Creed takes some elements from.\nFor the hardcore Hitman fans, go ahead and get this game (if you dare). This game will take you roughly around 8+ hrs to finish, and thats only IF you have no idea what you're doing. The game is actually a lot shorter, each mission only takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Most of the problems can be excused as not aging well, but nope I'm not forgiving this game because its old. Welp, I'm going back to kick this game in the a**!

Something most shooters are lacking for instance. Hitman carries on the tradition of Thief, where intelligent stealth and planning of your equipment beats the loadout you are carrying.\n\nAnd here starts the pain:\nStealth is nothing you just do, it is a hard earned skill of knowing what to do and when. Sometimes this means a Minute or two of simply doing -nothing- waiting, pacing and taking your time. Sometimes Stealth means being really quick and just not missing the right moment. Most of the Time Stealth means: Use one bullet max, the rest is knifework.\n\nThese lessons are hard taught in C47 and none of it´s successors retaliates so hard on missing out on any relevant detail. On the other hand you realy have a feeling of -beating- the game and not just dangling along.\n\nThis is why I enjoyed it just like Thief, back in the days, and am learning the hard way, that a lot of my patience and skills from back then have given way to a happy triggerfinger, which is needed a lot more in other games.\n\nTo Wrap things up:\nC47 was clearly ahead of it´s time gameplay wise and it is still a challenge to beat.\nThe Risk and Reward system really works well and the frustration level for tiny misteps is enormous, as you wont be able to save a level.\nIt is just like going by Yoda: Do, or do not! There is no try!","January 22, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably the worst part of the game was the inability to save your progress in a mission. There was a checkpoint system in place, but if the guards were alerted before you died the first time, they would remain so when you respawned at a checkpoint. Furthermore, the difficulty of this game doesn't really allow for you to alert the guards very much. You pretty much have to be stealthy or very strategic when killing guards because their bullets do massive damage to your health, even on normal difficulty. Some of the missions are incredibly long as well, and many of them include large amounts of running before you can even encountering your objectives. Therefore, if you screwed up, it can cost you about 5 minutes of running around before you can get back to where you were. Other than that, the game is great. The weapons are fun to use, the stealth system is pretty solid, the missions are unique and well thought out. Most missions have multiple approaches of taking out a target, but most are fairly difficult to find. Other than the name and general location of the target, the game really doesn't help you out in terms of hints and clues. If you aren't very good at problem solving like me, you may have to use a guide to give you an idea of what to do in some of the more tricky missions. Overall, though, this game is challenging and entertaining and a good introduction to the Hitman series","September 12, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately for my plans of playing through the whole series, this simply won't run well. I've followed tutorials by PC Gamer and posted on the forums here but no fix has been found. The game won't start unless it's in windowed mode, which is fine. It's not playable in windowed mode however. There is a significant amount of stuttering or bounciness. I would be willing to suffer through this, however it impacts the game play as, first of all, timing of the NPCs movements is somewhat off (some move past where they are supposed to be way too fast) but most importantly, the rag doll physics are totally screwed up. After killing someone, their body will bounce and fly around like it's trying to improve the Poltergeist remake.\n\nAs an example, on the second real mission, there is a limo driver who you can kill while he is peeing. Whether I kill him with fibor wire, knife or silenced pistol, when he dies his body goes flying around the entire map, gets 'spotted' by guards and civilians and leads to me losing the game. Haven't been able to make it past this level due to this bug. Can't recommend this game unfortunately.","June 28, 2015","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's because I'd always read articles about it and I was always dying to give it a try, but of course, the prices were often outrageous. Anyway, after I've got home and installed, I've noticed was that the game wasn't easy at all, so I've failed several times only by trying to learn how to work around my way with the tools of the trade. After finishing almost every single mission, eventually I've got to the penultimate and I've got stuck (there were no FAQs available in my mother's tongue and my english was even worse than now). Ok, so after a whole lot of frustration I've deleted the game and later I found redemption in the series through the following volumes of the franchise (except maybe for Contracts, it was kinda disappointing in my opinion). Now after all these years, Steam released the first game for an interesting price and I was like "what the hell", so I decided to give it a go again. I don't know if my memory is bad or not, but I don't really remember anything about having a checkpoint during the missions. Besides that, for some strange reason, no matter how perfect my aim would be, I'd always end up shooting at the wrong places (such as the arms of the bad guys, who'd end up looking like a bunch of tubemen). Seriously, no matter how many bullets you'd fire there, they'd still have enough strength and control to shoot you down as if your projectiles were mere flea bites. Well, after a few rage quits, I've finally got to that same part which I was stuck in the past and naturally the same thing happened again, only that this time I had the necessary means to get through that situation and finally manage to beat the game. Ok, after all that, what's my conclusion? It was a mix of nostalgia with disappointment, but I'm still giving a thumbs up for the good times I had before (especially with the wistful cheat codes).","September 23, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game centers around a genetically engineered clone who goes by no name other than "47" escapes from an asylum after going through various tests in both combat and weapon skills. A year later 47 was recruited by the ICA(International Contract Agency) a government division that specializes in assassinations, espionage, & terrorism. Agent 47 goes on global missions to assassinated various crime lords, drug dealers, weapon smugglers, thugs, terrorists, etc. Upon his travels, 47 notices that there's a connection between the targets he's executed and is willing to piece the puzzle together to find out who they all work for. The first entry in the series has it's share of clunky controls, occasional glitches, and situations that defy logic. These isssues, I can look past as the game does offer a challenge and fun factor. After the release of this game, Agent 47 would soon be ranked as a favorite anti hero for games. His cross of Vin Diesel and Golgo 13 gives him an iconic look along with situations and moments that will remind you of Terminator, Nikita, Scarface, and Leon the Professional. This was the first game to use a fully composed orchestra, the first to use the rag doll function(whenever you drag a corpse is moves like a doll), and the earliest use of the cloth function on the character's clothing. Keep in mind that the later games do get better, as at times this game can be frustrating with no mid level saving,minimum health meter, and poor functionality of disguises. But again this is only the first game, so give it some mercy. Anyways if you like playing a third person shooter where you have various options to kill a target, choices of prefered weapons to use on the missions, and various disguises to put on will make this game worth your while.","July 26, 2015","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know that this is how old games were, but as I said, today the first title in the iconic Hitman series is not as enjoyable as it might have been 16 years ago. Maybe because we may have been spoiled by last decade's games or something like that.\n\nIn the end, I would only recommend Hitman: Codename 47 only if you wish to dwell into the assassin's origins and, after finishing the next games of course, for the right to brag about playing the entire Hitman series and how much of a true fan you are.

One of the first games where you could fool enemies by wearing their clothes and where you had to be sneaky to avoid detection and a face full of bullets. The missions are quite diverse and you won't be bored while carrying them out. Of course, since this title was released quite a few years ago, it has its share of stupidity (you can stand next to a corpse while the guard ponders "whatever could've happened here" or follow an enemy for a couple of minutes, while they feel your breath on their neck and won't suspect that you're up to no good). Overall I recommend this game as an excellent introduction into the world of Hitman.","March 14","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/recommended/6900/","silentzero1","SilentZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/","21 products in account","Introduction:\nHitman: Codename 47 is an action/stealth game, originally released in 2000, and the first entry in the popular and well-known Hitman series.  You take on the role of a genetically-enhanced human clone assassin named "47", using stealth and tactical problem-solving in order to complete contract hits for your employer, the Agency.\n\nThis game uses a third-person perspective, but plays more like a first-person shooter in relation to controls and movement.  And the general idea is to use stealth and silent kills to eliminate your target without raising any alarms.   While it's possible to complete missions by other means and with more collateral damage, it will cost you financially (ie. clean-up crews, ammo and weapon cost, etc).\n\nA very fun and intriguing concept, to be sure, and clearly a success considering Hitman games are still being made to this day.  But does the original Hitman stand the test of time?\n\nTLDR Highlights:\n++ Tactical Problem-Solving\n+ Perspective/Camera\n\n- Trial and Error\n-- Controls\n-- Ridiculous AI\n-- No Save Feature in Missions\n\n= Cool concept and interesting gameplay, but the game has way too many issues that make it almost unplayable at times.  If you are hardcore, like me, about playing games in order then get it cheap on sale, but otherwise I can't possibly recommend it.\n\nReview:\nPROS -- Personally, I find the entire game concept, specifically the use of problem-solving skills in order to complete assassination missions, extremely cool.  There are some downsides in the execution, which I will get to in a minute, but overall I really enjoyed this aspect of the game.  It was surprising to see so much complexity and variety in each mission, and when I was finally able to execute my plans flawlessly it was extremely satisfying and rewarding.\n\nEven the perspective style was creative and interesting: third-person view, but with controls and movement that felt like a first-person shooter/stealth game.  Mostly I could only see the back of my character's head, neck and shoulders.  I almost wish the game never showed his face except when looking in bathroom mirrors, giving him an even more mysterious quality, but their method works well too.  Not sure how exactly, but this perspective really made me feel like a stone-cold assassin.  Maybe it was such stiff, emotionless movement and the default walk speed (I only ran when I had to), but whatever it was, it certainly immersed me in the role.\n\nCONS -- Unfortunately, there's quite a few bad traits in the game that I just couldn't get over.  First of which, the controls.  They felt awkward, clunky and slow, even after I customized the key bindings to my personal preference.  Combined with the fact that I constantly had issues with getting certain things to work correctly, like strangling someone with fibre wire, I almost quit the game before the end of the second mission.  It was that bad.  Thankfully, I got used to it somewhat, but not entirely.\n\nThe next thing I noticed was the ridiculous AI.  NPCs were incredibly stupid, but at the same time uncannily omniscient.  A guard blocking entrance to an area would stop you and say you can't enter (as he should), but stand there and watch as you walk behind him and then wait patiently for you to slice his throat.  THEN other NPCs would walk up and see you next to the body and not suspect you in the slightest.  On the other hand, you can walk into a room unnoticed and have all NPCs with their backs to you, but you even THINK about drawing your gun and the entire building knows it and immediately comes down on you.  Extremely frustrating and immersion-breaking.\n\nFinally, game turns into a big "trial and error"-fest.  With what information you're given walking into the mission, there's almost no way you could complete the contract in one attempt, unless with the aid of some sort of guide and you have incredible luck.  In a way, 47 becomes uncannily omniscient himself, because by the end, as the player, you know exactly how events will unfold and where the enemies are, etc, and are already ten steps ahead. (Suddenly, the new Agent 47 movie makes a lot more sense lol.)  Add the issues with controls and NPC AI -- not to mention the game crashing on me a lot whenever I try to open the map -- and the fact there is no save feature within the missions, the game becomes a frustrating and repetitive nightmare.\n\nOVERALL --  Before this, I had never played any of the Hitman games and had only seen the movies,  but the newest installment in the series looks amazing, so I decided it was time I finally played the previous ones.  Hitman: Codename 47 is very interesting, I'll give it that, but there's so much wrong with the game that it's almost unplayable, making it a painful experience that I would save other players from if I can.... which is why I can't possibly recommend this game.  If, like me, you have a thing about skipping games in a series, then at least catch it on sale (got mine for $1.75 or so).","March 21","false","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You go around on a mission for half an hour, try something and fail, restart, try something new, restart. Finally after 10 times you figure out what to do and do exactly what the game wants you to do in order for you to win. The freedom is non existence!

I picked it up again as part of a bundle, and thinking that maybe I remembered it to be worse than it was gave it a go. But no, nope, it's it's actually the opposite. Hitman didn't deserve a positive rating back when it was released, and it certainly doesn't deserve it now.\n\nThe UI of the game is absolutely atrocious, and your biggest enemy in the game are the controls. In a design decision that inexplicaply persisted all the way up to Blood Money, all functions are hidden under a handful of keys, and if several tied to the same one are performable at a given moment, you have to CYCLE THROUGH A DROP DOWN MENU to get to the correct one. As difference between success and death -- which incidentally means you have to start the mission from the start, as there is no possibility of saving -- often comes down to seconds, you will often see your master assassin dead because he couldn't figure out how to work the elevator or holster his weapon in time.\n\nThe missions, meanwhile, are furstrating grind. Unlike in the later games, you will not be given enough information beforehand to plan a course of action, nor the opportunity to observe your surroundings to decide one. The ONLY way to complete the missions is to do them over and over again until you find just the right sequence of actions and are able to execute it to the dot. The issue is compounded by the ridiculously unpredictable physics of the game: Invisible walls, knee-high barriers you can't vault, handguns that send corpses flying over buildings. And after all this, there is ultimately little reward for completing the missions, as the story of the game is little more than an excuse thereof. The writing is bad, the voice-acting worse, and the graphics haven't exactly aged gracefully, either. Avoid at all cost.","February 16","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But let's focus on some things I don't particularly like about this game. The controls are AWFUL, at least until you set them up... Then they get, better but still quite difficult to get used to. The animations are, different. They completely over exaggerate their arms and legs and torsos... It's fun to watch so 10 points there. There aren't really any other bad things I can say about this game, except really anything bad about the others that this shares... Either way, I still recommend this game.

For the longer answer you need to look a little closer:\n\nThe graphics are a complete disaster, the object positioning seems rushed and the character models are all pretty awful (as compared with the graphic fidelity of today) But if you can look past the graphics, look past the shortcuts and the low poly counts it's still a fun and somewhat challenging game. And honestly, even for 2000 the character models weren't too terrible, even today in the future year of 2016 I can tell that "oh, that's his face, right on." Oh. and WORKING MIRROR TECHNOLOGY, PEOPLE!\n\nThat is not to say that this game is not choc full of problems, there are bugs and glitches eeeverywhere. One of these appears in mission 4 I think? the assassination of the red dragon guy. one of the guards you must deal with tells you to "leave immediately", except depending on where you stand he will just do an infinite loop like a complete jerk! I.. resorted to just shooting him, being silent and deadly wasn't worth it. The controls are a monument to failure, both presets were designed very VERY poorly, and I highly suggest that anyone thinking of playing change them before they do anything. The game itself is actually kind of short for what it is, you get going and then suddenly "huh, that's it?" And by that I mean you can play through it in about 5 hours, depending on difficulty and experience. If you have no experience with stealth games it will of course take you a bit longer. maybe.. 20ish hours at the very most? Some of the voice acting coooould be seen as just a little bit racist, like in Hong Kong and in the jungle shortly after. The Story is.. well I'll be honest I didn't pay much attention to the story, I wanted to hide bodies and sneak about being a dirty spy/assassin.\n\nSo, final conclusion! If you are nostalgic over the Hitman series give it a go. If you really can't look past the graphical value of this game in order to enjoy it then don't bother. It takes a lot of patience to get through this game, but if you can stick it out if you can conquer it's wild nature then you know what? you just might feel like you did something.","January 29","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
