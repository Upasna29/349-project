Lovecraft, so if you have not read his work, you may want to before purchasing. It will give you a greater understanding of the themes and key players in the game.\nFirst lets cover the many positives. This game is genuinely creepy, from beginning to end. The pixelated art is beautiful, if you appreciate pixelated art. I would have done so many screenshots, but sadly with DOSBox I was unable to. The town of Innsmouth is charming, yet you can definitely sense the sinister presence that surrounds and invades the town. The people themselves are also not quite right. It's fun trying to discern who is there to help, or bring about your demise.  The soundtrack is very creepy, letting you know that you are about to enter a world of nightmare. The sound effects are also great. There are times when you are walking through a forest, and you can hear the animals, which can create either a very pleasant or sinister effect, depending on when you go. There is an instance when you have to visit a cemetary, and there is no soundtrack. The sounds of what you would expect to hear in a cemetary at night is all you need to set the mood. The voice acting, for the most part is pretty good, with just a hint of cheese. You can either read the dialogue, listen to the spoken dialogue, or use both. If you use both, expect lag. The written text stays much longer than what the actors say. You can right click if you want to skip the awkward pauses. This really is the only technical hiccup, and I find it forgivable, since there are other modes available.\nNow the puzzles. They range from everywhere to pretty easy, to having to use your head, to receiving no help at all, and just figuring it out by trial and error. Don't worry, there is not a lot of the latter. Save often, since there a million ways to die. The game takes place over a span of three days. The first day lays the groundwork for the mystery and the horror that you will encounter. The second day is the most stressful, yet it is very rewarding once completed. The third is...well that would be telling.\nNow I must cover the things that separates this from every point-and-click I've played to date. First, instead of using your mouse and clicking where you want Mr. Parker to go, the mouse is in the shape of an arrow, and you move him by choosing which direction you want him to go. Once you get the hang of it (it shouldn't take long), it's easy to maneuver. Next, and this is the awesome thing, is that if you are within eyesight of something you can pick up, a dotted line appears, directing your gaze to an object. NO PIXEL HUNTING! It's great because you find things you didn't know you needed, and when you get to the part of the game when you need said item, you have it! However, you still have to open cabinets and search places, but once you see it, you'll know immediately if you can pick it up. Why don't other point-and-click games do that?\nI could talk quite a bit more about this game. The look, the sounds, the soundtrack, the game mechanics, are just great for the time it was made. You also have a journal to keep notes that can help you on your way. The cut scenes and animations are creepy, disturbing, and well done. Lovecraft would be pleased.\n","February 10","true","13.0"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","3"

But really, it's pretty fun, even if there are a few BS puzzles. Having to look up how to develop film comes to mind. If you want to play one of the grandfthers of Cthulhu Mythos Games, this is it, besides the OG Alone in the Dark. There are a lot worse things to spend 6 bucks on, just try not to take it as seriously as it tries to present itself. It's a tad too silly to take seriouslyat times, such as literally flying. I'll let you decide WHICH time Parker flies I'm talking about.\n\nSeriously, though, Steam, the guy's name is "Parker".","December 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","16","21","6","1"

The puzzles are good, but you can easily die in the game, for several reasons, so don't forget to save regularly.  Some people believe the story and the ending were too happy for a lovecraftian story, but I enjoyed it, it has an eerie soundtrack and atmosphere.","February 8","true","7.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
