I really wanted to enjoy this game for what it's worth, but the aiming system in the game completely ruins it. I think the graphics, presentation, audio and controls are all spot on. I wish more indie devs would tackle mindless fun like this, but the aiming takes away any enjoyment.\n\nI understand that the devs wanted the shooting to be simplistic and just focus on the center of the screen with a sort of auto-aim function, but this really takes away from the game. It's an on-rails shooter where you don't aim and really only control your dogding. The dodging part is great, but why couldn't they just follow the design aspects of Aces of the Galaxy and let you aim your guns and modify the missile lock on system to be a bit more responsive. If there was a crossair you controlled to aim your guns, and the missile lock on system required you to hold it down to lock on then release to fire, this would be a much much better game that I could recommend.\n\nPros:\n\nAdequate Visuals, Audio and Presentation.\nGood movement controls.\nAttempt at a genre lacking modern titles. Aims to be simple and fun.\n\nCons:\n\nAiming system is a complete failure and takes all the fun out of combat.\nWeapons could provide more of a visual response.\nBetter indication of the amount of damage you're doing as well as receiving.\n\n","December 8, 2015","false","0.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

So if you ever wanted to know what Kamikaze feels like, join the battle!\nAnother point is the targeting system: you can't choose on your own what you shoot at. There's an automated targeting system which selects targets for you. But the algorithm for selection is incomprehensible, eventually selects something in the direction you're heading but often feels like random. So what you'll need is a lot of swarm missiles (multiple missiles shot at once that automatically select all nearest targets). So a fight with many enemies can pretty quickly become frustrating. Success on higher levels is more about luck than skills.\nLast thing: the story is very short (one short afternoon and you're through the whole stuff for a single decision tree) and its presentation is a bit "low level", just some audio conversation while you look at your current surroundings.\n\nSo, if it's on sale for a very low price, it's a distraction for a (very) short while if you don't expect too much, but at full price: not worth it.","May 28, 2015","false","4.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

Balancing is worth a mention - Normal difficulty has some challenges, but not too frustrating, while Hard makes you constantly fight for your life. It's rare to see that nowadays.\n\nThe main problem is the aiming - Star Horizon forgoes having a reticle in favor of visually lining up your ship with your target. It generally works well and doesn't get in the way. But:\nit's underexplained, which means you have to figure out this quite counterintuitive idea by yourself\nit breaks the immersion - it depends on how you look at the scene from the third person perspective, reminding you that you don't actually pilot the ship\nyou obscure the target with your ship, so if it shoots back at you, you won't see that\nThere are also some decisions to be made during flight, which makes for a nice touch of variety, and a simple customization system which goes well with the complexity level of the game.\n\nOnce you grasp the aiming, you will be having some solid fun.","November 28, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Instead of making the game with grandest AI, lighting effects that depends on your position... Instead your move, at least overall movement is pre-set and you need to move your ship within the narrow confines of the path and shoot or dodge things and destroy enemies. It is that simple, and it's a wild ride.\n\nAs "John" of the Federation, you are a starfighter pilot that was about to break the backbone of the rebellion, when a suicide attack destroyed the Federation command ship and your ship went crazy and did an emergency shutdown, leaving you in cryosleep... until you woke up far from home, and you had to defeat a few rebels to even get them to give you some directions and some repairs. You then have to decide whether to join the rebels permanently, or go back to the Feds, and in turn, you realize there is an even bigger threat out there.\n\nAs you make kills, you will get "credits", and you can use those credits to upgrade the ship with more armor, guns, torpedoes, and swarm missiles. And you will need them as enemy ships becomes heavier and tougher to kill, and many require a "boss fight" where you need to slowly peel off every turret that the ship can deploy, which can include heavy beam turrets as well as swarm missile launchers similar to yours, in addition laser turrets.\n\nTo counter this you can shoot at the missiles, and you can do "dodge" left and right which performs a spin move that may get you away from the enemy or missiles. Your ship is equipped with shield, which regenerate, and armor that doesn't. When all the armor's gone, you're dead and need to restart from checkpoint.\n\nMusic is decent, and voice acting is above average. Sound effects are okay. Visuals are very good as it should be, even on an old rig like mine.\n\nWorth it for some retro-blasting.","November 18, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But is the port any good and does it stand on it's own playing the PC version on Steam?  I've had a chance to test it for a few hours, so let's find out in this first impression of Star Horizon.\n\nMany would immediately compare Star Horizon to the old school Starfox Nintendo games mainly because there's not a lot of rail shooters these days.  Star Horizon is not a Starfox clone, it's a sci fi shooter.  There is a struggle between the Inter Galactic Corporation known as the Federation and the Rebel Alliance.  You play as John a private pilot of the federation and your companion is Ellie the AI on your ship.  Your role is to find out what's really happening in this war.\n\nThere's simple cutscenes that take place over voice communication and there is plenty of banter between John and Ellie.  The voice acting fits and helps the game flow a little better, but the story is not incredibly deep.\n\nAlthough the game was originally designed for touch screens, the PC version supports Xbox controllers.  Your ship is outfitted with your primary weapon the laser.  But you have to be lined up directly behind enemies in order to hit which is different from typical rails shooters and a little difficult to aim, but you get used to it.  Then you have homing missiles and torpedos which have unlimited ammo, but are on a cooldown.  Both your weapons and armor can be upgraded in the hanger in between missions.  There's also a dodge mechanic which comes in handy.\n\nCombat is fast and keeps you busy but there are moments when the difficulty increases significantly for certain sections.  Even on easy certain sections seem difficult to pass without upgrades due to the amount of enemies.  I wish the difficulty scaled a little better in these sections.\n\nAs far as the port from Mobile to PC, there's a lot of benefits but a few disadvantages.  The graphics are nice and it even supports anti aliasing and ultra settings.  Your ship and your the effects of your attacks look very detailed and the space atmosphere is immersive.   I still feel like the primary weapon shooting needs to have a reticle with a bit of lead time like in Starfox.  Then in the hanger upgrades section the scaling seems off.  Running 1080p, the menu options are fair sized, but the text on the ship upgrades is so small it's illegible.\n\nThere's not a lot of space rail shooters on Steam and this game is pretty fun for a short ride.  Check it out on Steam if you want a fun space shooter. Subscribe to the skilled channel for more game reviews.\n\n\nPositives:\nFast Rail Shooter\nShip Upgrades\n\n\nNegatives:\nDifficulty Balancing\nMobile Interface issues","May 28, 2015","true","8.0"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","10","22","2","0"

Harkening from the space-battle gameplay of games like Star Fox, Star Horizon puts you in the pilot seat of an interstellar aircraft.\n\nLike Star Fox, it's a bit of a rail-shooter. The ship's AI sets a course to your objective, and it's up to you to dodge and navigate your way through space debris, laser fire, and other ships in an epic space battle. This is something the game does very well, with the play setting, as the space battle erupting around you feels epic and massive, leaving you to feel like a small cog in a larger machine. Massive ships float around you, while smaller fighter ships spiral around shooting laser fire at your fragile shields.\n\nI haven't played that much yet, but I've learned that there is a huge underlying narrative driven by player-choice (similar to a Telltale style game). This very ambitious title plays extremely well, with excellent controls and a truly epic feel. The ONLY issues I've noticed thus far are audio issues (whoever equalized the game... didn't.) and the fact that I feel like my primary attack is completely useless. The rockets work just fine, but when shooting the laser guns, I never feel like I know where I'm shooting. Apart from that, this is a very cool indie game, and one I intend on spending a lot more time with.","December 8, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's short and sweet, definitely worth the 75% discount I paid.\n\nThe only negative from others seems to be the auto-aim.  I don't know if the auto-aim was worse when the game was first lauched and then the developers fixed it, but I found the auto-aim to work perfectly.  You still have to move your ship to aim and single out the larger ships for your torpedos, it's just not completely manual with crosshairs.  I guarantee if the developers added crosshairs to the game most of the whiners would stop, because the auto-aim functions just like the auto-aim that's added into a console shooter game, FPS or otherwise.","December 26, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

John!!!! JOHN!!!!\n\nSo I've tried to play this game on Normal difficulty. First thing to notice - the graphics are pretty. The UI is well done, the music makes the mood. Okay, now destroy this target. And it took me a while to understand how to hit something... It was weird reading all the reviews saying "the controls suck". How can the controls suck? Well, it's the aiming system that sucks. You see... there is no crosshair. You aim by "puting your ship so that it covers your target". Ignore where your ship is pointing. Very counter intuitive, very hard to get used to.\nSecond thing to notice - the game gives you auto-aim swarm missiles... I guess the designers saw an issue with this, so here's an easy way out.\nYou can dodge, but beware, you can't dodge what you can't see, eg. enemies coming right from behind you. Or that asteroid that appeared right when the camera turned awkwardly (you don't control the camera, it's an on-rails shooter).\n\nVoice acting is medicore, the lines are medicore... the story is pretty bad (docking after attacking a station and asking for repairs? seriously?), the mechanics are overall pretty badly designed (eg. evading obstacles is pure luck).\nThe game also wants you to grind some sections, which in addition with bad design leads to the worst thing in bad games... punishing.\n\nAnd this game will punish you.\nIf you get through it, you won't get any reward. Just more John...\nIf you're thinking "oh but StarFox !" this game is far from it...\n\nThe only pros: graphics, non-linearity of the story (still, a pretty bad story)","January 16","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean, I love railshooters. I loved Starfox on SNES and N64. But this game...\nFirst of all, you can't hit anything unless your targeting system actually targets it. But that is apparently totally random. Sometimes it targets, sometimes it doesn't target anything. If you're flying near the edge of your screen, you can't target anything that's not dead-center in the screen. If you want to target something that's near the edge, you have to fly to the center and then towards the target. And hope it works. Sucks, especially if there's missiles coming at you. And if you don't destroy these missiles, they WILL hit you.\nSure, you have the swarm which also hits enemies (and missiles) you didn't target. But usually there's too many missiles for that coming at you.\nThere are no actual boss fights, which is a pity. Except for the mothership, which you could call a boss. And holy crap, is it hard. The first two phases I can get through, but the last one? It fires missiles which you have to shoot down, and uses laser beams which you have to avoid. All the while hitting its "eyes" when they're open.\nNow here's the thing. First of all, the targeting system rarely ever locks on the eyes. It only locks on the missiles. You can't point at the eyes as well, as you constantly have to avoid the lasers (my hand and left thumb really hurt now).\nAs if that's not bad enough already, the eyes are only open for like 5 seconds. And your lasers actually require 5 seconds to even reach the eyes. So if you don't have a lock immediately and fire, you won't do any damage. You also can't use your auto-targeting missiles, as they take like 7 seconds to reach the eyes. Meaning they'll never hit them.\nAlso, the tunnels you have to fly inbetween battling the mothership are so narrow that it's almost impossible to do so without taking damage. Meaning you most likely won't take on the third phase of the mothership with full health.\nI have no idea how to beat this, I tried for over 1 hour straight, but I don't think I didn't even do any damage.\nThe rest of the game is relatively easy. So this sudden spike at the end is just unnecessary.\nThis is so frustrating, which is why I sadly can't recommend it, even though it's a good game otherwise.","May 6","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
