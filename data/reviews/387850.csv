It seems to be about the same size as one would expect from a flash game, and has about the same animation(Very poor explosions). A price of 10 euro is then very, very steep for what you get.\n\nCoupled with the simple gameplay comes a few issues. The resolution is tiny(The steam preview pictures? That's almost full size, almost.), full screen mode will stretch everything if you're on a widescreen monitor, and your area of operations is tiny to the point where you can not even see the aircraft before they're starting their landing on some of the maps.\n\nTo say it's an amusing way to spend a few hours is correct if you're a fan of the game and have absolutely nothing better to do. But to call it a full game and worthy of 10 euro? Not even close. If steam had a rating lower than 'no', this would be the one to get it since it's definitely not worth the price. But if you can pick it up really cheaply it is probably an idea to give it a shot.\nMaybe at a 95% sale or something similar, but if it's for anything more than one euro you should avoid it like the plague","July 26, 2015","false","4.7"," 62 of 81 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","62","81","6","0"

Taxi where? Take off from where? Count me in!\n\nIs this a fun game?\nYes it is, though sometimes you have to be really focussed on harder difficulties. So the game is about directing planes around and on the airport you are assigned to, sounds simple and sometimes it is. But must say I already had a lot of fun with it, managing all the planes.. setting speeds, landing, taxiing, taking off and setting speeds again. You'll get the hang of it as soon as you start playing and in the end you can land thousands of planes and not crash a single one.\n\nBugs:\nHad a few minor ones with achievements, nothing game-breaking though. I had no crashes and the game works fine.\n\nRecommend it?\nYes. Note that a newer one should hopefully be available late 2015 it says on Greenlight --> Airport Madness: Time Machine","September 7, 2015","true","15.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Pretty good.\n\nThis is a fun, fairly frenetic puzzle game about running various very busy and inherently unsafe airports full of exciting close-calls. You play an air-traffic controller and try to keep planes which are in the process of taking off or landing from crashing into one another. This game is very far from being realistic but is fast-paced, stressful but sort of cute and fun at the same time. I'm not very good at this game but it was still fun trying it out. There are a lot of runways to choose from along with several gameplay modes. There are also other airports which you can unlock as you complete the various challenges the game throws at you. A good, though very challenging, little game.","February 6","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When loading into an airport you have a nice easy flow of planes to take care of, but after so long all hell breaks lose and you have a traffic rush coming in of planes from all different directions and speeds. You have to time take offs perfectly with landings so planes don't collide on the run way. Depending on the layout of the runways take off collisions may be a factor as well. If you are looking for a game that you can lose track of time in as well as go for decent skill based achievements this is it. Definitely worth playing.","July 30, 2015","true","5.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","12","21","2","0"

Love it!\n\nAPM4 has less taxying and more focus on getting everything to synch, sneaking a takeoff between 2 landing airplanes to keep the passengers happy (or pushing up the daisies untill you learn that trick). APM4 focuses on challenges more than just diversifying the airports, but there are some interesting ones like like Area 51 and a Carrier battle group.\n\nTo add some flavour to it all, a chopper can drop by to fill up on juice, and there can be a snowstorm, which turns the ground white which does not help with the white aircraft you are trying to guide. APM4 fortunately also have hotkeys for quickly assigning speeds to aircrafts instead of you having to click em, and you can simply drag airplanes to whatever runway you want it to land on.\n\nOh and emergencies and weather can be turned off and you can manually adjust how much trafic you want using a slider. Speaking of sliders - this game would be perfect if it had sliders to adjust the volume of sound/music/voice.\n","August 7, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are numerous graphical issues, including text not fitting into the buttons which is more of a minor irritance, and AI related issues that prevent it being fun.\n\nThe main thing that needs fixing is the 'Holding Pattern' AI.  When planes are put into a holding pattern the pilots are in control of their position in the 'stack' and are at varying altitudes.  On this game they suddenly divert from their current course and all do a separate holding pattern at exactly the same altitude in converging circles.  This is made even more difficult to manage as you can't make them climb or descend to compensate.  It's bad enough working out what the planes on the runway are doing at a glance.","January 2","false","5.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
