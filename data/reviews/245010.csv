In fact, i still do, but this steam version is just a joke. First of all, the intro cinematic don't even play. The resolution is 800x600 and, the worst part, the soundtrack is bugged and plays the same song on all the levels. I still have the original cd, and the game is pretty enjoyable, but they should not sell a game full of flaws such as this. If they ever fix all those issues, yeah, i would recommend it, but until then, no.","December 24, 2014","false","10.3"," 100 of 108 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","100","108","0","3"

The controls are o.k. you can change it in the menue settings.\nThe graphics of this version isn´t that good i remember a resolution of 1024x for that game by its original.\nI know there is a way to get a better resolution but its somewere in the options menue.\nI never seen another game like that after it- its still good and not just in a nostalgic way.\nThe saving system is o.k. its harder because it saves the moment of health too so\nyou have to be more strategic when and how often you save- some savepoints\nneed gold.\nI finished this game only once back in 2000 and try to redo it again.\n","June 12, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But with the game background being largely inspired from a gamebook written by Ian Livingstone (one of the first ones I read), this game had a lot of interest to me.\n\nSo what you get in this version... nothing much new from the old one because it does not seem anyone bother to bring the game to current standard like some of the bitmap brother games available in "HD" (like speedball). Even worse, the bad controls are still here, the bad camera angle still here and the low polygon... yes still here.  However the game is now highly playable with no lag... but some brief returns to the desktop during change of screen.\n\nAnd the absence of lag making the game highly playable is definitively a go for it in my mind.\n\n","February 10","true","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The verdict? Ain't got enough in common except in name with the former and what the hell was I thinking with the latter? This game came out the same year as Tomb Raider or thereabouts -- and this game is not as good as that game. I *STRONGLY* suggest you instead have a much better experience with this game by going to youtube and watching a "Let's Play" -- you will NOT have to struggle with the horrible interface and you will get amusing commentary about the frustrating elements instead of the frustrating elements themselves.","February 28, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

This title might not be all of these, but it was the game that started it all for me. I saw this game in a box with eidos surrounding it. A white border box with the name eidos. Anyway, gaming has died. I post this review here because games aren't about games anymore. Uh, how can I explain.. Games used to be fun, original, classic. They had old game engines, hard mechanics and you didn't know where to go. See, everything went downhill. We have graphics that are still poor somehow. We have to upgrade our pcs each year or so if a super game comes out. Uhm games aren't fun anymore. There's games like sims 2, deathtrap dungeon, final fantasy (the old ones), bloodrayne 1, giants citizen kabuto. They were classic. They weren't limited to go there kill that. Yea, they kinda were. However, the way you did that was very original. You laughed one moment and then you used a jetpack to kill some monsters with special weapons. The artstyle too, it's way too boring in games these days. Colorful graphics, simple yet memorable textures and music that always stood in your memory. Why can't we have that these days? Do we really have to become kids again? I know I talk so much and I shouldn't type that much in this review but I want to end this review streak with something. Gaming used to be simple. Gaming used to be interesting and less money based. HELL GAMES LIKE HALO AND ONI WERE INCREDIBLE. You haven't heard of oni? Well it's a bloody game that bungie made and rockstar published. You were an anime girl who had tons of fighting moves and you could shoot guns. You were fighting the mafia. What the hell do we have these days? A stupid guy with a cloak who kills random guard. My oh my, and a super story going on around him. You see it's things like these that make me rage.. uh maybe i don't like change. However, I want my games back. There was a spiderman game where you took out a bomb out of a building or where you were fighting symbiotes on top of a moving train, or where you were saving mary jane from venom. What do we have these days? Nothing. Sorry for the incoherence but I'm trying to find out what happened and why games these days are so bad. I don't think I can find the exact reason, but I think the people were smarter. They were also nicer, kinda. But that's my opinion. Crimson skies is another game I remember from my childhood. Together with freelancer, or urban chaos. God bless those who made great videogames. Because, they will always be remembered. Revy's speech out. :)\n\n\nuh when i mention halo i mean halo combat evolved\nthe stupid guy with a cloak killing a guard is any assassin's creed character\n\nspecial mention for alone in the dark 4 the new nightmare which is also phenomenal.","November 30, 2015","true","0.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","9","18","2","0"

While both versions have crap controls and camera, at least on the PS1 it was still pretty fun and there is something captivating about the game, having to force yourself through a dungeon filled with traps and monsters in order to survive and escape.  But the PC version is just horrible.  I just got a new monitor and because the resolution for DD is 800x600 max, this means I can't even play it now cos it 'fails to render' when I start.  But even before, when I could play it on my old monitor, the game is terrible.  The levels are mixed up and all wrong, and they've stupidly tried to give the blood and gore an update so the more you get injured its reflected on the character.  I can't stress enough how bad it looks, its just outright terrible.  The outdated graphics of the PS1 version look better.  Save your money.  Do not buy this game.  Get a PS1 and play that version of Deathtrap Dungeon instead, you'll have a much better time.","August 29, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
