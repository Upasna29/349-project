You'll probably want a controller for it.\n\nThis was by far and away Yuji Naka's best game. It's an early illustration of how games can be art. Naka proved through level design and gameplay you could create a cohesive story with virtually no narrative. Armed only with metaphors and imagery; the story is imparted in a way that no other art form could allow.\n\nIn my 15 years owning NiGHTS on Saturn; I never realized any of this. It was only when I repurchased this game recently that I started seeing how brilliant the story is. I won't ruin the imagery and the different ways it relates to the overall theme. I will say however that it's a timeless coming of age story. Each and every piece of scenery is a metaphor for growing up. One can quite literally relive different phases of their childhood through this imagery.\n\nWhen I say every piece of scenery, art, gameplay, and level design. I mean it quite literally. It was all designed metaphorically to relate to the process of maturing into an adult. You could write a book about how the art can be interpreted alone.\n\nNot only this, but it's so simple anyone can complete the game. Yet so complex you'll never be able to truly master the tracks. If you're a Sonic fan and want a sense of speed. This game gives it to you like no other. By taking away the platforming elements. The developers could focus the gameplay on acrobatic moves and highscoring through high speeds with few obstacles to slow you down.\n\nThe dynamic/evolving music engine was also quite novel and innovative. By nurturing the nightopians, breading them with the nightmarens, or destroying the nightopians the moods of the creatures would change. Depending on their mood the music would change slightly. This system allows the music to stay fresh and familiar, but never truly repetitive. Being able to interact with the nightopians in such a unique fashion really gave some players a bond with the world of NiGHTS.\n\nEdit: Formatting and grammar.","November 6, 2014","true","20.4"," 63 of 66 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","63","66","0","0"

All I can say is I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!\nThe gameplay may look boring, inane, or weird but if you give it a try, I promise you will love it. If you are a SEGA or Sonic fan, you have no excuse not to purchase it. It should be illegal not to buy it if you adore sonic.\n\nNiGHTS will always be my favorite game. I've never had so much fun playing a video game.\nThe soundtrack is just gorgeous. The album version is better! It comes with two alternative songs for each level.\n\nThe gameplay is difficult to explain, to be honest. Your objective is to collect 20 orbs as fast as you can. With the reminding time, your goal is to gain as much points as possible by flying through hoops without losing your chain.\n\nMy only comaplains are the boss battles, 6 long levels (around ten minutes long) and locked at 30FPS. In addition, I did not like the boss battles. They may be advance during their time, but I found them ambiguous to beat.\n\nHowever, eventually, you will want to try again and again to beat your scores. NiGHTS has that feeling like playing a Sonic game.\n\nIt comes with bonus features like the SEGA Saturn version and a remastered christmas theme of Spring Valley.\n\nOverall, if you see this game on sale, its a must purchase game. You will love it!\n\nMy steam friends comments on game:\n\n"I really like it actually. I usually dig Sega games, and this one came through. It's very unique! Loved it!"\n\nI STILL LOVE THIS GAME TODAY. :D","December 1, 2013","true","63.4"," 50 of 55 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","50","55","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdgamer97/recommended/219950/","cdgamer97","cdgamer97","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdgamer97/","21 products in account","One of the greatest games of all time. I'm surprised NiGHTS hasn't been very popular recently, or ever, because it definitely deserves a little more recognition for the beauty and creativity of the game. Controls are easy to learn, and I'll often find myself playing for hours at a time trying to beat my old scores or just releasing steam with a boss run. The characters are colorful, easy to love, and full of personality! This is a feel-good game!\n\nI'll be honest, the first time I saw NiGHTS as a young gamer raised on Nintendo consoles, it was in the NiGHTS into Dreams pinball table alongside Sonic in Sonic Pinball Party for the GameBoy Advance. Needless to say, having just recently been introduced to Sonic, and having a mindset that most girls didn't play videogames, NiGHTS appeared to me as SEGA's lady-Sonic character... the feminine colors of pink and purple hadn't always appealed to me.\n\nMany years later, revisting some of my older games, I picked up Sonic Pinball again, and I thought to myself: "I remember the NiGHTS table having something the Sonic one didn't: Bosses! You're older and much more skilled now, so why don't we give this a go?" After a few practice rounds, I'd cleared my way through all 6 tables, their Nightmaren bosses, and eventually unlocking the secret NiGHTS "Twin Seeds" table, which led to my first encounter with (and triumph over) Wizeman the Wicked.\n\nI was hooked. I wanted to learn about the REAL NiGHTS. After finding very few videos on Youtube over the original NiGHTS into Dreams, I did my own research, and found the game was available on Steam for just $10. At this point in time, I didn't have a Steam account, nor was I interested in TF2 or Garry's Mod, Counter-Strike, any of these legendary titles I'd seen friends playing in the past.\n\nThat's right:\n\nThe whole reason I made a Steam account was for NiGHTS.\n\nSo the next time you see me on your team in TF2, or the next time you see me post a Garry's Mod animation, you can thank the whimsical dream-jester, and the geniuses who've brought it to life.","August 19, 2015","true","35.2"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","7"

The good news though its very smooth and fluid and stays true to the original Sega Saturn game. The only complain that I have is that in Sega Saturn Mode- the game is not a true emulation - its a remake using texture mapping without filtering - nothing more. I guess Saturn Emulation is hard to achieve. While there are many emulators out there they require a high system requirement and even at that you don't get accurate results.

In addition to the original game itself, included also is the rare and coveted demo disc Christmas NiGHTS, opening up unlockables and a varient of Spring Valley primarily centered around Christmas (though the theme sometimes changes depending on the holiday/date, such as April Fools, Halloween, summer, Valentines, etc). This alone makes this port worth it to the die-hard fan, but on top of this, you've given the option to switch between the original Sega Saturn graphics, or the graphics of the formally Japan-only PS2 remake.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with this title, you can choose between to play as either Claris or Elliot, two children whom by day struggle to overcome their fears, and by night aid NiGHTS in overthrowing the king of all Nightmare, Wizeman. As you fly through linear circular stages, you'll collect orbs and other goodies, destroying captures that hold Ideya - raw dream energy - that had been stolen from the two children. Its story is left intentionally vague to encourage the player's own imagination to interpret the events. There are also many goodies and easter eggs to be found hidden around, including the curious Nightopian AI (these being creatures that breed, grow, die and can even hybridize with enemies within the level). At the time of its original release this game offered groundbreaking techniques in graphics and gameplay style, giving it its own place in history and recognized by many as an unofficial secondary mascot to Sonic Team.\n\nAnd now for the downside. Unfortunately, the game is incredibly short and can be 100%'d in only a few hours, though the extras help to provide some replay value. Also, while the controls, for the most part, are pretty tight there are areas where NiGHTS becomes difficult to control - particularly areas like the bobsled, mermaid and rail portions from their respective levels.\n\nStill, despite those problems, for the price and what it comes with, I would consider it well worth it and highly recommend it to anyone interested in a timeless masterpiece and a piece of gaming history. If you're still unsure, I would say to consider waiting for a sale. Either way, NiGHTS into Dreams is well worth having in your collection.","April 7, 2014","true","3.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

NiGHTS HD recreates the Sega Saturn classic with the addition of a theater mode and art gallery, plus the Christmas NiGHTS extra story.\n\nGameplayThe game ultimately boils down to speed runs. There are 7 stages in total and the aim is to rack up the highest score by chaining links, combos and performing acrobatic stunts, all the while collecting dream energy to unlock special dream energy and returning it to the checkpoint. The game can be a little tricky to figure out at first but once you learn the patterns, you will have fun flying through the levels at high speed. My only concern is the controls doesn't quite have the same finese that the original has, but I am using an Xbox360 Controller. I would like to try this game with Steam's own controller.\n\nThere is also the option to explore the worlds a little and admire their design, however if you take too long the game pushes you to complete the level. This isn't a bad thing as afterall you are in a dreamworld.\n\nDesignA game that was developed in 1996 still stands as having some of the most imaginateive landscapes and character designs. Each level is a representation of the characters emotions and the challenges they must overcome in real life, The levels are bright and colourful and you often spot something you never noticed the last time you played the level. After the wonderful dream levels are the darker boss nightmare stages which contrast the adventure levels. The boss levels just feel like a nightmare and give you the sence of dread.\n\nThe HD textures and character models are really good, and there is an option to play in Saturn mode, with the low poly models. Unfortunately the Saturn mode also reduces the screen to it's original 6:4 format.\n\nVerdictWhile the game is excellent, and it has all the charm of it's original. I still find myself wanting to play the original. However, I still highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a quick game to pick up and play a few rounds after coming home from school or work.

However, like most of Sega's early 3D games (Virtua Fighter excluded), it was somewhat lacking in polish to begin with and as such hasn't stood the test of time well. I have a lot more respect for the team that did Journey of Dreams after revisiting this than I did before because, while that game failed spectacularly, the original NiGHTS didn't exactly give them a lot to work with. A lot of the reason why Journey of Dreams was bad is that NiGHTS itself, by modern standards, isn't very good.\n\nI'm giving this a recommend, but that only applies if you're already familiar with the game and would like to play it again without dealing with old hardware. On that level, this succeeds abundantly, and I hope Sega will continue to do re-releases of their older games. But if you're not already a fan of NiGHTS, this is a skip. It's a product of a bygone era of gaming, and a company that was struggling to find its identity in a changing industry, and it shows. NiGHTS was clever and beautiful for its time, but now it mostly seems counterintuitive and dated.","May 31, 2014","true","2.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

A Sonic Team and SEGA classic through and through. More than just a port but rather a respectfully remade tribute to the Saturn's answer to Mario 64. You can switch between the original Sega Saturn graphics or play with new models and textures that enhance the visual quality of the game without changing the artistic direction. This game is fast, bursting with vibrant color and catchy music that you'll never forget. My only complaint is that the game only runs the at the console's original speed of 30 frames per second.

But then I actually got to playing it. According to various sects of the internet, this game hasn't stood the test of time, and the only fans are nostalgic 90s kids who played the game when they were young kids. So in 2016, as a late teen playing the game for the first time ever, I can safely say this is one of the best games I've ever played. The game's atmosphere is perfect, the gameplay is simple but fun, the levels are very replayable, the soundtrack is great, and the simple but charming narrative tells a story without a single word. And even though the game is kinda short and the character models are a bit... dated, this is still a great game I'd recommend to anybody who wants a more unique experience or a refreshing break from modern gaming cliches.","April 25","true","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I haven't had any technical problems with it so far and the controller is smoother to play with than a Saturn controller. NiGHTs is difficult to compare with other games, it is like a platformer but with lots of flashy acrobatic flying around the screen instead of jumping. The system will take a lot of getting used to but after that it's actually quite a simple game to play. It is good for short play sessions, most of the challenge will come from trying to beat your own scores as the process of completing the game is quite easy. The story and world are fun, you are in a dream world being invaded by nightmares, it ranges from chill-out to surreal to faintly creepy. There is no death, only running out of time, but the timing can be very tight and enemies will knock 5 seconds off your 120 second time limit.

The levels are filled with beautiful and creative imagery, and each level has it's own distinct features to compliment the core game mechanics. The bosses have very memerable designs and have unique ways of being defeated. For those of you who enjoy story there's not much to be seen here, but I feel the minimalistic approach to the story helps to immerse players into this world of dreams and forge their own stories from the few cutscenes they are presented.\n\nI, myself, have a lot of fond memories of this game and feel it still holds up well even compared to more modern games. You even have the option to play with new, updated graphics in a modern screen ratio or go totally old school. It is a bit of a shame that not all the fun "presents" from Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams are featured in this version, but you will find certain things change depending on what day it is. ;)\n\nI'm glad that after so many years NiGHTS is reborn into the modern world to give a whole new generation of gamers a chance to experience this amazing game.

The goal is simple and requires capturing stolen Ideya by collecting at least 20 blue orbs and destroing the capsules. The sooner you destroy the capsule, the more time you have to collect more points before the time runs out. Once you've collected all four Ideya, NiGHTs is warped into a boss battle. There are four stages for the two characters, Claris & Elliot. The fourth stage for each character, Twin Seeds is the same and in order to unlock it you need at least all C's on previous stages. The game is short, but sweet. However, it can be a real challenge to get all A's on the stages, which is required to unlock the Christmas NiGHTs. SEGA has given the game a nice HD improvement, thus boosting more colorful and vivid visuals than the Saturn version. You can play the game in two modes, HD & Saturn. The keyboard controls for this game can take some adjusting and I would reccomend getting a Xbox 360 controller since this game was really meant to be played with a controller. This is indeed a good port of a very good game, probably Sonic Team's only masterpiece.

You have to collect at least 20 of the small blue orbs to destroy the large blue orb, then go to the gazebo looking thing to advance to the next part of the level.

It's easy to see why it became a cult classic.\n\nThe remastered graphics in "Brand New Dreams" look great, but even the original Sega Saturn graphics hold up surprisingly well.\n\nThe only complaint I have with this game is that it's very short and easy, but leaderboards and achievements give it replay value.","December 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The instant I entered this dream, I was hooked, I became an instant fan of this flying purple jester. I have discovered this game a little later in my life, so I'm pretty much jealous of the guys who actually GREW up with this game. Must've been a magical experience for you all...\n\nAnyway, my thoughts for this game. Played the Sega Saturn version of this game (on an emulator, at least), and it's controls are simple enough. At least two buttons to drill dash and two more buttons to do some tricks. With that, you're all set for a flying adventure that will make you dizzy and your fingers aching the first time!\n\nNow what can I say about this port? It's everything I envision in its HD remake: smoother models, better resolution, HQ textures, and an actual main menu! The controls are also optimized well for PC gaming, and that's well appreciated.\n\nThe music? Still as good as ever! NiGHTS music really has this certain thing to it that distinguishes it perfectly from Sonic's musical scores (which is just as good, btw). I still listen to it from time to time and it really is a great music for daydreaming :P\n\nThe story? Unlike its sequel, the story really is a bit hard to catch since we're only given a few cutscenes explaining how Elliot and Claris ended up in the night dimension, and I get that each stage and bosses means something storywise, but it's always not easy to understand.\n\nThe bossfights? Creative! Each level has its boss, and each one has a different tactic required to beat them. My personal favorite is Reala's, because it's straightforward; no timing, no patterns, just aerial acrobatic action! After a while though, it's gonna get repetitive, so savor the awesome feeling you get in the bossfights while you still can!\n\n\nOverall I give this game a 9/10 - you must try this at least once in your life! It's a good game, and one that will help you remember what being a child is like, should you forget.","December 19, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simply right click on the game in your Steam library and go to Game Configuration. All changes are made there instead of in-game. In my defense, the game does nothing to explain that this is how you change these settings, but at least the options are there. So please disregard the majority of my gripes in the following review. This version of the game is perfectly fine and I highly recommend it.)\n\n\nOh dear, if I hadn't gotten this at an amazingly low price from Humble Bundle, I would be a great deal more irritated right now.\n\nI'll start by saying that Nights into Dreams is a great game. No denying that. The main character, music, and graphics are all delightful, and there's a great deal of replayability by learning the courses and memorizing the most effective paths. Aside from the camera being a little too zoomed in which makes it hard to see your surroundings, I could see myself putting some legit time into this game. Unfortunately though, not this version...\n\nFirst, the biggest red flag. No controller support. This boggles my mind in so many ways. You'd be hard pressed to find a game on Steam that doesn't work with a standard Xbox controller. Maybe some that don't work with third party controllers, but generally Xbox is good to go with no problem. Not this game. Nights feels like it was DESIGNED to be played with an analog stick. Not this cumbersom WSAD format. Also it uses the J and U buttons to spin, which I found less than comfortable. So I at least expected to be able to rebind the keys, but you can't even do that. You can't use a controller, and you can't rebind the keys. This version of Nights will be played the way it wants you to play it.\n\nA second big gripe for me, no fullscreen mode. Man, never before has a lack of such basic options felt so restrictive and distracting.\n\nOne thing I can commend the game on is that it offers a How to Play guide in the options menu. I was prepared to complain about a bit of a learning curve for new players since nothing is explained when you start the game. But this How to Play guide takes care of that issue thankfully.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend this version of Nights into Dreams. Should the developers patch in these basic functionality options, then I can recommend it no problem. Until then, get it on PSN or Xbox Live.","November 29, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

This port could easily be patched up to fix the problems it has and in that case I would fully recommend it--NiGHTs is such a fun game that it doesn't matter if this port is kinda a hackjob, it's still just really fun, and I'll either play it on Steam or I'll play the real version on SSF.\nThe graphics look great, I'll give it that.\n\nIt's really hard to not recommend a game in the end, if that game is NiGHTs. I just wish there was a truly complete port of the original with all these added features to boot, and maybe some extra 2player LAN/online modes. I'd easily pay double the asking price for that.","January 4, 2014","false","7.0"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

The camera is so zoomed in (much MUCH more than, say, an old Sonic game) that the wonderful feling of 360 degree flight and linking rings is constantly interrupted by scanning up and down to find the next group of them; there are huge gaps in the level with no leading collectibles to guide you, and it really interrupts the flow of the game, which... seems to be the whole point, the flow. There's no other way to experience that flow except by rote memorization of level routes.\n\nAnd the mechanics are so esoteric and unexplained (even within the "tutorial", which is just a flipbook instruction manual which doesnt talk about even half of the in-game objects) that your ability to interact with and understand the mechanics is very limited except on, I imagine, far repeated playthroughs after looking through guides. The game's very, very short unless you care about getting high rankings, but I don't know how you'd figure out how on your own considering it's not clear how valuable time, links, bonus rounds, and etc. are to point totals (I got totally mixed results when trying to prioritize one/all).\n\nThe HD version doesn't adapt the pre-rendered visuals well; they feel either uncanny or unclear. There are no gameplay improvements I can find in the HD version (like an adjustable camera).\n\nIf you like the idea and surrounding aesthetics of this game, hunt down the Wii game; neither are masterpieces, but it's basically this but better executed.","December 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Not because it wasn't fun, but because it hasn't aged well and Sega made no effort to upgrade it. Not much is different from what you can find in games now with analog control and free roaming. It feels alot like modern games since it was at the beginning of modern games, but it's just not as good. The world isn't really open and the models and textures suck. In this golden age of gaming, where casual games you can play in short burts are becoming the new AAA all they would have had to do is upgrade the graphics--some ugly models and textures. Don't let old hardware limitations ruin a lasting experience and lasting long-tail revenues.\n\nSecrets of RÃ¦tikon actually reminded me of Nights, because of it's beauty and controls, it hit me like playing Nights for the first time did, but it was new. Nostalgia alone just doesn't get it sometimes. Sega may have got my money, but for people like me who always wanted this game back, just skip it and wait for the new indies to release games that actually have more content, better grahics, and some just as good of designs and gamplay as what used to be $40-50+ games.","July 4, 2014","false","0.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The actual objectives are: get 20 blue orbs, hit weird snow globe thing, get back to start, repeat 4x. After that you get a boss which is essentially a puzzle of "how do I defeat this?" They seem to be rather short.\n\nHow you play is even strager. You actually only move on 1 plane at a time (up, down, left, right). There are set paths sometimes which you can branch on to be on a different plane, but it's not just open. You can fly, so it's not really a platformer. But it still feels a lot like Sonic but with many less enemies and no challenge to the actual stage.\n\nIt is very colorful with decent variety to the very small amount of distinct stages which is nice.\n\nBut in the end, I didn't find this fun. I never exactly felt challenged. There is essentially no story (you can read it as part of the "How to Play" menu if you'd like, but I almost immediately forgot it since it doesn't actually feel like it is anywhere in the game). Without story, the gameplay has to carry it. And the gameplay isn't fun to me.\n\nIf you do just want an arcade-y point grabbing experience with pretty good music and interesting visuals, you could do much worse.

I tried the upgraded version first and was blown away: why would anybody make a flying game that you view from the side?  After giving it a fair shot, I decided that it was awful.  I came back here to give it a review, and saw how many people truly loved this game.  Just to see what I was missing, I booted back up and tried the Sega Saturn version... LIGHT YEARS BETTER.  It replaced some 3d graphics with 2d versions, changed the control scheme a bit, and made a fiew other tweaks that really made me see why so many folks enjoy this.\nIt's still not my cup of tea.  I cant really reccomend this, but if you get it: for the love of god play the original Saturn version.","October 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I couldn't endure the experience long enough to get very far because I did not find it enjoyable at all. You fly around, collecting things, doing some variety of tricks, and generally don't have any idea of what's happening unless you've somehow managed to play it a lot. Everything requires a lot of guessing, especially the boss battles, because there's little to no feedback if you're doing something right.\n\nEach course becomes increasingly difficult, and it's not just due to the layout or design, it's because it's hard to control your character. Turning is a problem because you have a wide turning radius, so be prepared to collide with things and generally miss your targets. I had a huge problem with the loose controls.\n\nDon't buy this unless you have a case of the nostalgia.","March 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

The colors are vibrant, and the soundtrack is cheerful, unique, and quirky with some tracks being surprisingly ambient. The story is told without words using only music, cinematics, and imagery.\n\nIn game, you control the titular androgynous character who flies around on a twisting and turning track, sort of like one of those remote controlled racecar tracks. The controls themselves are simple and effective. NiGHTS has it's flaws, the biggest offender being the camera which will sometimes have trouble keeping up with NiGHTS or will "cleverly" hide point collectibles in such a way as to make you fly at an awkward angle to be able to see them.\n\nOverall, NiGHTS is a very charming unique game that is worth a try .This HD remake also includes bonus content in the form of  Christmas NiGHTS, which is a fun little remix of one of the first stages.","July 14, 2013","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is just so far from anything else out there that there's no base to compare it to. The reviews and gameplay videos I'd watched beforehand had done little to give me a mental image of what it actually is, so it was still largely a mystery to me when I finally got to try it.\n\nMy best attempt at an explanation is as follows: it's an arcade-style pseudo-platformer which revolves around semi-free flight through a 3D environment on a shifting 2D plane. You collect floating orbs with the goal of gathering 20 of them as quickly as possible, which allows you to break open a bigger glass orb once you find it and enter a bonus mode in which you try to collect as much stuff as you can and return to the start (the 2D path forms a convoluted loop) before the timer runs out. Each time you do this, the 2D path which you travel along will shift to incorporate different parts of the 3D world. After completing 4 such paths, you leave the main world to fight a boss; the faster you defeat the boss, the more your score will be multiplied, and the better your letter grade for the world will be (with one of the game's 100%-completion goals being landing the A rank on every level - which is no easy task!).\n\nRecommended if you're looking for a break from the norm that won't be a huge time-consumer. That said, it might be good to wait for a sale, as for all the incredible uniqueness it offers, it is sadly quite short with only six normal levels and a seventh shorter level.","August 6, 2013","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It never says a word, nor does it ever have anything in game to explain the story in full outside of what you see and play. It never holds your hand, nor does it ever make it's ever incresing challanges easier. It has no 'super-guide' nor diffaculty setting ether in case you get stuck. It also only ever presents the play 7 stages in total making it a very 'short' single play experance.\n\nYet because of all of that, it is chances are one of the best games ever made in all time. It's got a MASS of hidden depth and secrets for the player to poke at and find, it offers a fast pace gaming style even Sonic would blush at, all while presenting a world so colorful and vivid that it would be sucessior couldn't even mimic. It's story is presented in such a way that, while no one ever says anything, you still understand what's going on, what these two kids are struggling with, and how NiGHT's is trying to help them with such before even they need the assistance of the kids in the end.\n\nIt's wimsyical, magical, and perhaps given just a bit more prase then it's fully worth. Yet I think if you really talk towards anyone who played this game in any fashion, more less played it yourself, you might too understand just what got birthed doing a time when gaming was in it's true 'golden age'.","December 19, 2012","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is, effectively, my childhood in a capsule. Developed by Sonic Team, back when that was still considered a good thing, the parallels to a sonic game are definitely there, with chip collecting, high speed gameplay, and short but sweet boss battles feeling very similar to a traditional sonic from the Genesis era. The primary difference beyond theme is that there is an emphasis on aerial maneuvers and acrobatics as you float through the dreamscapes. It's not enough to simply go fast, you're meant to go fast with flourish. I originally played NiGHTS and the special holiday demo Christmas NiGHTS originally back on the Saturn, and the re-release does a lot to keep the charm and innocent magic of the original.\n\nThere are two graphical modes, the HD-Remaster and the classic Saturn graphics which, thankfully, share the same gameplay progression. The new HD mode looks quite nice and definitely makes a more modern, easier to stomach version of the game for people who might not carry the same level of nostalgia for the franchise, but I found myself playing through with the Saturn graphics most of the time, at least for the first run though. While I have not quite unlocked them yet, Christmas NiGHTS is also available in this release, which I believe was also given the same HD/Classic mode treatment. The one thing I found absent was the Nightopian collection (a small gallery of Nightopians you've come across in the game) but I'm hoping that will potentially be unlocked along with the Christmas NiGHTS portion. The rest of the gallery however appears intact and contains the all important Music selector.\n\nAll in all for newcomers NiGHTS provides a a weird little game that's fun, colorful and can just be picked up and enjoyed without worrying about investing hours of playtime or unlocks or anything like that. For those with a previous history with the game, its a unique portal back in time, which brings with it the same sense innocence and wonder the game has always drawn on.\n\nUpdate: While I can confirm the Nightopian Collection did make it in, Christmas NiGHTS only unlocks as a remastered version without the Saturn option. They're still great levels though and easily the most memorable part of NiGHTS.","December 21, 2013","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Looping and zooming around, whether to collect items, go through rings, or for fun/no reason at all, just feels right in a way most games don't seem to understand. Unfortunately the boss battles are still often frustrating, with a complete lack of highlighting or even hinting at what you should be doing in some of them and camera angles straight out of the mid-90s.

Fans may get an extra dose of enjoyment from playing Splash Gardens, decked out in a Christmas theme, listening to Jingle Bells as they play. Other additions include a gallery of unlockable art work and photos.","December 28, 2013","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both the characters, bosses and scenery are beautifully crafted and the accompanying soundtrack of Sega's usual calibre create an outstanding overall experience. However, controlling with a keyboard can be awkward (Xbox controller is recommended) and this remake lacks some original features such as the date-oriented bonuses and almost all of Christmas Nights, subtracting partially from the enjoyability.

The original game came with an analogue controller that allowed you to move the character like butter. Now instead we are given digital (on/off) keyboard controls. What's even worse is that when I use joypad to keyboard software to use a controller, the input available is still only digital and only up/down/left/right.

I would say it depends on your preference...if your one for constantly changing missions and wide veriaty or even more traditional platforming elements...I dont know if I can say this game would be for you...but if your open to having experiences and to playing a game for immersion and the more creative elements that gameplay has to offer then I would say give this game a shot, it'll broaden your horizons and may even change the way you think about video games...","October 3, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Let me address some of the complaints;\n\nFirst off, yes the game creators didn't quite make the objectives entirely clear (There were no "in-game tutorials" in 1996!) so I would reccomend hitting up any of the player guides available online,  it's not rocket science, and it will open up a really worthwhile experience.\n\nSecondly, the game DOES in fact support native plug-n-play controller support.  Again, this may not be obvious to the unintitated, but if you left-click the game title in your Steam library, it will bring up a Menu.  Select "Game Configuration" and presto, you can activate your in-game controller.   I personally find the Xbox 360/One controller work admirably for this game.\n\nWith some of the fundamental complaints out of the way, let me heap a little more praise on this game;  It's memorable, unique, and charming in a way that gamers usually only find in a Miyamoto developed title.  A true classic, and it makes me wish Sega would invest a little more effort in updating it's back-catalog of similar gems.","October 18, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bet that if I would have own Sega Saturn and this game back then when I was a kid, I would have probably cried tears of joy like I did when I heard Sonic Generations' classic version of "Green Hill Zone" . (No joke)\n\nAlthough, I can find some faults which bother me a bit. First of all, the story is rather meh imo. But then again, I think that the stories of the games weren't the main thing back then (unlike nowadays; game has a bad story, it most likely will get bashed to ground). The game is fairly short too. Not that many games were long back then either. The re-mastered version is rather hard to navigate too in my opinion, hence why I stayed in the Saturn mode most of the time.\n\nI'd say it's worth of it's 8â¬ price tag.","February 21, 2013","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is simple in concept; you play as Nights, an androgynous jester that inhabits the land of dreams, and assist 2 children in collecting "ideya", which represents a core personality trait such as courage, kindness etc...\n\nIn gameplay terms, this means starting in a 3D level as one of the children, with Nights locked in a magical cage behind you. At this point you may explore a little, but there is a strict time limit represented by an alarm clock that will attempt to wake you up and end the dream. Once you walk to Nights you will fuse with him and can then begin collecting ideya.\n\nThis is played out via the 2.5D mechanic that was popular back then; though the levels are 3D Nights' flight through the levels is set, with the player moving left to right collecting 20 ideya and depositing it in a cage to release the aspect. Rinse and repeat a further three times along different routes through the level, and then fight a boss.\n\nIt is an uncomplicated design and there are only 7 levels total, but the main focus is on score attack so there are plenty of opportunities to replay the courses and improve. What elevates the game to classic status is in the overall design; the levels are dreamlike and varied, and each course throws up interesting twists, such as rollercoasters, or Nights transforming into a toboggan on the snow levels.\n\nThe music is absolutely phenomenal; transforming from soft and ethereal to driving and dramatic as levels progress, with a cute theme song to top it off. This complexity earned the soundtrack a comparison to Disney by several reviewers at the time.\n\nThe game also introduced the A-Life system, which was eventually expanded into the Chao of Sonic Adventure. Creatures called Nightopians populate the levels, and your interaction with them can change their attitude towards you and eventually change the level and music in subtle ways.\n\nThe story is minimal but effective; a simple introduction for each child detailing the reason for their nightmares and an ending cinematic for each also, plus an extra scene when both child's levels have been completed. All the scenes play out without voice, so the story is entirely visual. Despite this, it manages to have a very touching end that truly fits the "Disney film" aesthetic that was reference by reviewers.\n\nI heartily recommend this title; I imagine that it will not be as enthralling as it was to me as a child, but the core mechanics still stand up to scrutiny. This release includes updated textures from the PS2 rerelease of the game (only in Japan) so it is not strictly HD quality, but the bonus "Christmas Nights" game that was given out in '97-'98 as a demo of sorts is included, and is jolly good fun at Christmastime, especially if you have children.","June 28, 2013","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And this game is one of those pieces from that gem."\n\nIn the game you pick from either the boy or girl character, but what you're playing is a dream essence called NIGHTS who flies around obstacles in your dream-world while collecting random items, to then move onto the boss battle at the end of each level. Just don't take too long or else time will run out and you could wake up from your dream, then its game over.\n\nFor a game that came from the same team behind the original Sonic The Hedgehog, NIGHTS Into Dreams is a delightful experience and a really good stress-reliever to play. Visually it's very bright and colourful with lots of unusual textures to make the gameplay feel like you're flying around in a whole new world!\n\nMy only issue with the game is because there hasn't been too many sequels, this game does feel a little aged...\nWhenever I play this game, no matter what system, it feels like I'm playing a game from 1997. But that doesnât ultimately make the game bad! I still think itâs worth checking out if you have never played this game before.\n\nDefinitely a Sega Classic and one to try if you're a huge Sega Fanboy! ;)","July 27, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can indeed change to controller mode and fullscreen (just not within the game).\n\nI am a huge fan of Nights into Dreams and being such, the Steam port is a huge let down.\n\n-No Controller Support!\nThis by far is the greatest transgression. The original game came with an analogue controller that allowed you to move the character like butter. Now instead we are given digital (on/off) keyboard controls. What's even worse is that when I use joypad to keyboard software to use a controller, the input available is still only digital and only up/down/left/right. No diagonal movement, making the character stutter, move erratically and not at all gracefully. Unless this is changed (and I know it won't) the Steam version of Nights into Dreams is completely worthless\n\n-No Fullscreen\nI cannot believe this is not an option\n\n-Graphic "Upgrade"\nEven the "Original Saturn" levels don't look like what they did in the original. It takes away from the nostalgia. Which for most people who would purchase this game is the whole point and the "Remastered" levels are hardly touched up. It's difficult to really tell the difference.\n\nFor those of you who have never played this game, this is not a good representation.\n\nFor those of you who have fond memories of this game. Find it literally ANYWHERE else.\n\nSega, this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥-poor excuse for a PC port of your classic Nights into Dreams.
