The friends go to investigate the town, and soon get wrapped up in some severe hauntings from the strange ghost that start coming out when night falls.\n\nThe game has a low-budget, and it shows. Graphically everything looks outdated, with low-res textures, odd character animations, and the like. There's also no real-time shadows. The game also has a few bugs. I didn't encounter anything game-breaking, but a few 'look through the wall with the camera', 'get stuck on an object for a moment', 'that character is levitating,' type of bugs, However, something I found interesting was that they didn't copy and paste many models. There were a lot of posters around town, and each one was legitimately different. Same with pictures, and just small details all about.Outside of a few chairs or piles of garbage, most of the models were unique to each other, and I was surprised the developers didn't take many shortcuts.\n\nMentioning this, something I noticed about the game is that there were a lot of secrets and original assets used for things that most players would probably not even end up finding or seeing. There's more I have to say on the topic, but I'll get back to this in a bit.\n\nThe game has legitimately great atmosphere. There are some fantastic scares, the feeling of unnerve that is caused by the game. It has an atmosphere to it that most horror games these days are missing from the days of old, sort of a combination of dread and excitement for what's going to come next. The atmosphere and scares are more akin to something like Fatal Frame or Kuon than Amnesia or Outlast, I should mention. Recommended at night and in darkness, with headphones.\n\nThis is backed by fantastic audio design. The music is great, the sounds are great. Voicing is okay, a bit cheesy but enjoyably so. However, with the music, how it is and how it's used in the game, is really effective, and also I can mention unique. The music is very different than any other horror game I have played, but very effective. And how the music transitions with events going on is very well-done. The audio is also unnerving, and sometimes hearing a weird sound, even without knowing its source or even without it leading to anything, raised the tension. It sometimes gets hard to tell if a sound you just heard is part of the music, or something in the environment, but I say this as a good thing.\n\nAnd the game does not lie on its laurels. By this I mean a lot happens, and the game never throws the same thing at you twice. I was honestly surprised by the number of ghosts there are in this game, there were a lot more than I was anticipating. Some great enemy variety, and you fight each ghost really only once or twice, there was not a single ghost I think the game threw at you a third time. And the 'events' that happen, like scares or atmospheric additions, were all incredibly varied too. This definitely helped to raise the intrigue as you never knew what might be coming next, and some of what happens really goes into the unexpected.\n\nCombat is similar to Fatal Frame, but a bit more simplistic. There isn't a charge rate like Fatal Frame, or a point system, but the closer enemies are, the more you damage them when you take a shot. And if you attack them right before they attack you, you deliver additional damage.\n\nEven the puzzles are well done and intelligent. Figuring out what to do is fun, and they do a good job at laying out clues to what you need to do to help piece it all together. They have clever hints and details, while not being extremely obvious either. However, it should be mentioned that those with less patience and less of a desire to figure out cryptic clues may not like how they're handled. But if you loved puzzles from horror games in the 90s (which have been notably absent in recent years), then you'll likely be quite happy to see some return to form here.\n\nOne of the game's biggest draws is some absolutely memorable moments. Several of the ghost encounters are absolutely fantastically handled and designed, the pacing of the game is wonderful for the most part (though may some end up stuck in the school for a while), and there's good variety with all of it. Some of the moments, such as the sit-down with Ira or the whole Mansion location, are absolutely stellar, and strike me as quality horror moments, something that has been missing from so many horror games, the sort of intrigue, weirdness, and execution that leads these moment to be gripping and chilling.\n\nWhat they have here is fantastic, it legitimately is one of the best classic-styled survival-horror games to release in the last few years, and I think genre enthusiast who like certain elements of horror games that have been absent since the days of old will really appreciate the game. It's well-paced, well-executed, and well realized. It's low-budget, but those who enjoy the genre likely won't be bothered by this, some absolutely fantastic horror games over the years have been decidedly low-budget. The developers only had $26k to make the game, but they have managed to with that make a very confident horror game, and honestly some of the most fun I've had in a horror game in a while.\n\nThe weird thing is the secrets I mentioned earlier. There are complete sections of the game you could miss if you don't do some exploration. There are ghosts you won't fight unless you go off the beaten path. A tip to the wise is when it turns night-time and before you enter the school, don't enter the school like the game suggests and instead head back towards the town you just came from. There are different types of ghosts if you head backwards at this point that you'll never encounter in the main game. And little hidden areas and easter eggs to uncover all about. So on that front, there is some really cool optional content to explore in the game.\n\nThere's also a few cool unlockables. Once you complete the game, you unlock additional outfits, all of which are actually pretty well designed, and can be used on a second and later playthrough.\n\nThere's also a few side areas you can explore right now that don't really lead to anything, which I can only guess are there right now for the possible future Free Roam Mode (a lot of buildings and side-areas off the beaten-path are currently inaccessible or kind of barren right now, and I assume will be open in the free-roam mode the developers are working on).\n\nI want DreadOut to succeed. I really liked what was here, I'd even go as far to say this is the best attempt at making a 'classic' style horror game to release in the last few years, really having an understanding of those gripping elements that made those games enjoyable (a deeper level of meaning and not just superficially being classic styled with fixed camera angles and tank controls). The whole game will probably take someone 4 - 9 hours, depending on how much they explore and find hidden areas and how long they take on puzzles.\n\nDreadOut is completely worth experiencing. It's tense, sometimes terrifying, has the right amount of weirdness to it, some absolutely stellar moments, and is actually a lot of fun. Its low budget shows, especially in the graphics department, but through clever design, good execution, and variety at hand, manages to be a fun and memorable experience.","May 8, 2014","true","21.7"," 332 of 371 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","332","371","0","13"

(I include myself in that category)\n\nAfter completing Act 2, I think this is a rather charming game with some really solid ideas, if finicky execution. The ghost design is excellent, and there are some truly impressive individual sections. One that stands out in particular is an actual dialogue sequence with one of the ghosts.\n\nThe game is weighed down in some spots by awkward pacing, poor conveyance and goofy NPC interactions. If you can muscle through those, you'll find a pretty solid indie horror game with a creative style that sets it apart from the standard first-person "roam through dark hallways" genericity of many of its peers.\n\nIt's quirky, it's fun, and surprisingly frightening. The final boss fight is a trippy, delightful end that wraps up the game very well.\n\nDreadOut has its flaws, but overall this is one of the few modern horror games I would call "unique." It's worth checking out solely for some of the cool sections in the second half of Act 2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaseface/recommended/269790/","chaseface","ChaseFace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaseface/","421 products in account","Most of what I said below still applies, but after seeing how short the game was, how awkward the game's overall control scheme is, and how confusing and nonexistent the plot/character development is, I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone that doesn't have a diverse taste in survival horror games or who aren't enormous Fatal Frame buffs.. My voice over friends being on this project made my first impression a bit biased, and as a longtime gamer I feel like this game was coded somewhat poorly and doesn't hold up well. Just kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n---------------------\n\nSolid game. The first enemy I saw (about 15 minutes in) literally had me breathless and scared for my life, and most horror games these days don't do it for me.\n\nThe interesting thing is, I'm a voice-actor, and all my voice-acting friends provide voices for the main cast of characters. They're all experienced professionals and they give the game a believable atmosphere, with crystal-clear audio quality not commonly found in indie games.\n\nThe only cons I can say so far are the really low-resolution textures (mostly in daylight outside, which is a brief experience) and the very jerky/clunky character animations make you realize just how indie/low-budget the game is. Some characters seem to moonwalk a little bit while the cutscene animations are really jerky and twitchy. It lends itself REALLY well to the scary parts when enemies are twitching and convulsing, but when two girls are playing patty-cake in the beginning it looks super bizarre for some reason.\n\nIf you ever get stuck like I did (the game throws you in with literally ZERO tutorials) there's a 'How to Play' section at the title screen. It shows you the first enemy you deal with, and it can't be defeated, and it suggests that you need an item to defeat it. I think that's kinda cool, since tutorials ruin the atmosphere and it feels better to search for the answer.","May 6, 2014","true","9.6"," 403 of 498 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","403","498","0","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bikinisntchmnstr/recommended/269790/","bikinisntchmnstr","SeñorPoopusSenpai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bikinisntchmnstr/","45 products in account","Anyone who has played and enjoyed "old-school" survival horror, such as the Fatal Frame/Project Zero games or the first four installments of the Silent Hill series, will probably find something to like about this game. DreadOut borrows A LOT of elements from these two series, from the overall atmosphere of the enivronments to the use of a flashlight and an otherwise mundane, non-threatening object as a means of combat.\n\nGraphically, it's good. It's not stupendous, but it's certainly not horrible either. They're about on  par with what you would see in some the better PS2 games, and I mean that in a good way. The ghost designs are well done, especially the larger ones. They all look menacing and the fact that you have to photograph them to drive them off just makes them that much more unnerving. Unfortunately, some of them you may miss if you just press on through the game without doing some exploration outside of the school. The sound design is very well executed, from the ghost sounds to the overall ambience of the evironments. Since the game shrouds you in darkness and limits your field of vision when you do have your light on, sound is you're only indication of what is lurking around you before the visual cues appear. The music also enhances the atmosphere. There was one specific point in the game where the music was so eeire and off-putting that I was hesitant to press on any further. The voice acting is well done, at least the English is. I haven't played with Indonesian audio yet but I'd imagine the lip syncing may be better. The silent protagonist was also a good choice. It's better than listening to someone talk to themselves for the entire length of the game. The overall design of the game shows that a lot of thought was put into making it interesting without it being too cliched. The design of the school seems mazelike and unless you're paying attention to the signs above the classroom doors, it's easy to feel somewhat lost and like you're walking in circles. The puzzles are inventive, requiring you to use the camera to inspect the environment to find the solution rather than just finding a key lying around. The puzzles remind me of the kind you would come across in the early days of Silent Hill.\n\nOf course, there are a few gripes. Some of the textures look a little flat in spots. It's particularly noticable in the areas of the game that take place in the daytime. And if you don't take the time to really explore the environments, the game can seem rather short. There's a little replay value, if only to get the achievements, but not much. I was also somewhat irked by the fact that in the demo you could see the environment on the phone screen as you wandered around, even when you weren't in camera view. This isn't in the full game and it's a bit of a bummer. The phone screen is blank until you enter camera view. I know it's minor and it doesn't really affect gameplay, but I thought it was a nice touch and would have been worked into the mechanics somehow. For example: as you're looking around the environment you may notice something pass across the phone's screen that you don't see in normal view, prompting you to go into camera view for closer inspection.  Like I said, nothing major. More a personal opinion.\n\nAll in all, it's a well executed game and fans of classic console-style survival horror will enjoy this. I just hope the next act will be released in a timely manner.","November 16, 2014","true","5.5"," 109 of 113 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","109","113","0","0"

DreadOut is not just a collection of jumpscares and definitely not a "get-out-from-the-creepy-labyrinth-while-a-monster-is-chasing-you" kind of thing. It has a story to tell, puzzles to solve, a bunch of different monsters with backstories, it offers some variety and even something that reminds a battle system, so it's more like "big" horror games of the past decade. Too bad that the experience itself felt frustrating for me. The "battle system" where you need to take photos of monsters is messy (although you get used to it after a while), there are glitches here and there, monster designs are not scary (moreover, I couldn't help but laugh in some "scary" scenes), puzzles sometimes feel too cryptic, Act 2 has a totally different pacing than Act 1 and... I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I wasn't  scared at all, had only one or two moments when I felt somehow creepy. Despite of all this, the game has interesting ideas in both gameplay and story - and I totally loved the talk scene from the Act 2, DreadOut at its best. I wish there were more moments like that. I guess the reason for most of the problems is lack of experience of the devs, they're small indie team after all.\nOverall, honestly, I don't know if I can recommend this game or not, I have really mixed feelings about it. If some interesting ideas, great OST (totally going to buy it) and badass ending are enough for you to bear frustrating gameplay elements, you can buy it, it's most likely that you won't regret your decision. But I'll give it "Yes" because it tries to do something different in the genre.\nHope my post was useful; it’s my first time writing a proper game review in English.","March 5, 2015","true","7.2"," 104 of 110 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","104","110","6","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/269790/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","The game itself feels like a stripped down Fatal Frame with a whole bunch of Indonesian ghost lore.\nIf you wanna skip the lengthy part of my review and go straight to the pros and cons, you can find them below.\nBut first things first: the story.\n\nYou play as the Indonesian high school student Linda and you're just coming back from a trip with your school class. Your teacher drives down a road until she notices a blocked off bridge leading to an abandoned village. You don't know how you came here but you all decide to investigate. After investigating the village you find yourself in the school located there. Something terrible happens and you're trapped. Alone. Your main objective: get the hell out of this place!\nLinda herself has special abilities which make her sense and see supernatural beings that are nearby as well as items of interest.\n\nTo stay with the story, it isn't too bad actually. The game is comprised of three acts, act 0, act 1 and act 2. Act 0 acts as a foreshadowing to act 1 and act 2 is the continuation of act 1, released almost over a year after the initial game release.  The story centers around a big chunk of supernatural beings from Indonesian folklore and has many twists to it. Also there are two endings to be achieved. Personally, I got one of the endings and it wasn't bad at all. Also, after act 1 the game gets much less cliché, effectively making everything more enjoyable.\n\nBut... what about the gameplay? Well, here are the basics:\nYou can run, walk, interact with a lot of doors and items and use your IrisPhone (harhar) to take photos. The camera is the key mechanic of the game. Taking photos is used to defeat ghosts and solve puzzles, the camera vision is also used to uncover hidden passages, invisible ghosts and progress through the game.\nThen there's the dying mechanic. And by that I mean: you can not "die". You may fail, but you will never get a "game over" screen. Once a ghost defeats you, you will end up at Limbo. From there you may head to a bright light and you'll be given a chance to go at it again.\nAlso you may collect some items along the way. Even though there is an inventory, there is no combining of items to solve puzzles in any way. Which is kind of a shame, the game had some potential there.\n\nSince this is a horror game, the horror oughtta be there, right?\nWell, it is. As soon as it is nighttime, ghosts start to show up. When encountering some of them for the first time, they can be pretty scary. Through act 0 you will only encounter two of the many ghosts in the game - one of which is a heavy one. You can only sense it and see it through your camera, so when you need to get someplace fast but know there is a ghost breathing down your neck, you're kinda on edge. Act 1 features much more ghosts and if you're not prepared or know how to fight them or successfully get away from them you will get scared a lot. But after a while in act 1, you will know how to deal with those entities and then defeating them kinda loses its scaryness. So the horror doesn't last long. Until act 2, that is.\nFor act 2 brings out a much wider variety of ghost mechanics that will put you on edge if you're playing it for the first time because you will get into situations where you just don't know what to do about them.\nBut the horror doesn't only lie in the ghosts themselves. Act 2 does a lot with its surroundings. I won't spoiler anything though, but let me tell you this much: mirrors are the worst. Aside from that the game does underline its horror a lot with sounds and music, sudden turns of events and a couple of very well-placed jumpscares.\nIt is quite rare that I appreciate jumpscares but the jumpscares in this game are just perfect. You'll never expect them, they will always catch you off guard and they aren't just cheap screamers with overly loud sound. They're good.\n\nSo overall, the horror in this game will wear off quite quickly during act 1, but that only leads you into a false sense of security because act 2 is just so much different.\n\nBut speaking of music, the soundtrack of this game features some really nice themes that are doing their job well. Some of them aren't for the horror of the game. These tracks just sound good.\nBack to the ghosts: A nice thing about this game is that every supernatural being you will encounter actually is a thing from Indonesian lore people in the real world believe in. That's a nice little detail. I adore that.\n\nOf course, not everything is good about the game. But this isn't about plot holes, boring combat or anything.\nThe main issue I am going to adress here are the horrendous loading times and the performance which sometimes goes BAD. Also the texture resolution is still hilariously awful and doesn't justify the loading times one tiny bit. Seriously, I thought I forgot some options in the options menu but nope, the textures are just blurry and I can't do anything about it.\nOn occassion this game's performance sucks ♥♥♥. I mean, you're running around, moving your camera and BAM! you look in the opposite direction because the game was frozen for half a second and turned you around. Really annoying at night when you can't see sh*t. And the loading times are just awful. I don't even understand why they are so god damn awful. It's nothing on my end, that's for sure.\nOn the technical side of things, I didn't get any crashes whatsoever. Just some bugs sometimes.\nOn occasion the world won't load fully so you'll se the surroundings pop in one by one. And then there's starting from act 1 or act 2 which sometimes causes game breaking glitches. A restart usually fixes this however.\n\nWell, what else about the game?\nIt has got some little details to it that I want to point out here before switching to the pros and cons.\nIf you beat the game once you will be able to go to the back of the car in act 1 and choose between a selection of different outfits for Linda once you start a new game. Some traditional outfits as well as some casual outfits.\nThis game has some pretty nice effects, especially when interacting with some of the ghosts (one in particular that shows up in act 2) up close.\nAnd the game has boob physics. Yay...?\nAlso, there's a ton of eastereggs to find. Some are related to the developers, some are related to other horror games and some are just silly little things to brighten up your day.\nOh and the English translation is sometimes... hilarious. Yeah. Hilarious. Let's leave it at that.\n\nSo, off to the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+ A semi-open world for you to explore, find hidden items, secrets and eastereggs\n+ A variety of different settings, you didn't honestly think all the spookyscariness will be in that school, did you?\n+ The supernatural beings are all reminiscent of Indonesian folklore\n+ Solid horror that will keep you on edge upon getting to act 2 because it changes up things dramatically\n+ Very good sounds and music\n+ Story's not all bad and got a lot of unexpected turns, some stuff can be foreseen though\n+ Good English voiceover, good animation quality, nice character design\n+ Impressive jumpscares\n+ Big ghost variety\n+ Runs well most of the time, no crashes\n+ Boob physics\n+ Female protagonist (that's always a plus)\n\nCons:\n- You cannot die\n- The texture quality on the environment tends to be sub standard\n- Sometimes your framerate drops to 0 for half a second, effectively annoying the hell out of you\n- The horror in act 1 wears off quickly\n- Once you know how to deal with most enemies, killing them gets quite trivial (act 2 fixes a lot of this though)\n- Some achievements fail to work a lot of times\n- There's only two acts, wish there were more\n-+ Dat English translation tho\n\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes.\nThe horror's pretty decent and at the current price I'd call it commendable.\nAlso it's nice to play an Indonesian horror game for a change.","February 16, 2015","true","12.9"," 69 of 74 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","69","74","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/recommended/269790/","silentcaay","SilentCaay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/","247 products in account","This is a fantastic example of the horror genre being done properly in a video game. I didn't know much about it going in, only that you played as a girl with a camera who fought ghosts, so I set the bar low thinking it might just be a bad Fatal Frame knockoff but it's very original despite the parallels. First let's talk about some horror tropes and how the game handles them because a lot of games screw this up...\n\nJump scares are here but they're not the ONLY thing that's here. There's is a lot of tension, build up, anticipation, not knowing what you're going to find around the next corner, etc. In other words, there is a strong focus on the psychological aspects of horror and the game doesn't just rely on jump scares. There is also plenty of times where the tension builds up to... nothing. Yes, even nothing is important in horror. If the audience learns that tense moments always lead to a horrific payoff then the tension melts away due to familiarity. It just becomes systematic. Here they mix it up often enough that you never know exactly what to expect and that keeps you on edge.\n\nDarkness is another trope often done wrong but this game handles it in a fairly unique manner. You do have a flashlight and it is better to use the flashlight than not use it but the flashlight itself isn't the best way to light your surroundings. When you bring up your smartphone camera, the world gains an even lighting that makes it easier to see things. Being in camera mode is slow, however, so there's a good balance between moving quickly in low light and switching to your camera to see better. The game also avoids two horror game DON'Ts: flashlight cone of light and batteries. The flashlight has a fairly wide arc of light (although the engine sometimes renders things in darkness that should be lit, this is an engine issue and not a design issue) instead of a narrow cone which is great and it doesn't require batteries/fuel which is fantastic. That's just the beginning, though, because later you get an SLR camera which has a completely different lighting mechanic. Instead of a flashlight you have the camera's flash. The flash lights up the world VERY well but only briefly and when you bring up the camera you're left in the dark until you take a picture instead of having the even lighting of the smartphone. This is a whole new dynamic and you have both the camera and the smartphone so you can switch between them as you like which gives the player choices and different ways to explore the world.\n\nNow, onto combat/puzzle mechanics. These almost entirely revolve around the camera. Many ghosts you can just take pictures of when the camera shows static but sometimes you need to work out a pattern or a discover a weak point in order to be able to kill a ghost before it kills you. Puzzles are also mostly about taking pictures of the right things or noticing differences in the world between the world as you see it normally and how you see it behind the camera's viewfinder. While it seems very simplistic, the game keeps everything fresh throughout. Each ghost and puzzle is going to have it's own little twist. There were a few fights and puzzles in the game that I was really impressed with and I don't want to spoil.\n\nAs for the story, the game does a great job of giving you the backstory through little newspaper clippings and whatnot while giving you the present day story though cutscenes. There are some aspects that probably could have been fleshed out a little better but overall you'll know what's going on by the end. At first it seems like a normal little haunted town but there is a bigger central plot that comes into play near the end so I can't say any more about it.\n\nAs for criticisms, I have plenty. This is an indie game on a budget so it does have some flaws but overall the great experience overshadows all the flaws. The one flaw I have the biggest complaint about is Limbo. When you die you end up in Limbo and you have to run into the light to get back into the game. Normally this running section gets longer and longer the more times you die and it gets REALLY annoying. There are items you can collect to shorten Limbo, however. IMO, the shorter length should be the standard. The first time I played I missed an item so I wasted many, many minutes running in Limbo during boss fights where I died frequently and I feel that was just a big waste of my time. (Edit: Turns out there is an option in the game for "Fixed Limbo Length". Wish I'd known about that earlier. Turn it on to save yourself some grief!)\n\nThere are also some little quibbles like the low res textures (some are like N64 quality, I know this is indie but sheesh), some audio levels being unbalanced (sometimes a BGM would kick in quite loudly for what I had my volume set to), a few glitches here and there (nothing game-breaking) and some of the ghosts can have particular quirks that make it hard to fight them (one ghost I needed to aim the camera slightly high or I couldn't get static to take a picture and I was completely frustrated before figuring that out) but none of them are enough to detract from this great gaming experience. I highly recommend it even at the full $15 price tag. Pick it up if you enjoy horror games.","December 19, 2015","true","10.4"," 55 of 65 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","55","65","0","0"

SEDIH + I WANT MORE. Gue bener bener menantikan ACT 2 Linda beserta kawan kawannya!\n\nGameplay\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4f4dwV1q1c\n\n\n\nKesan Pertama\nWOW! Ekspektasi gue sangat tinggi dengan game ini, secara Digital Happiness udah meluangkan banyak waktu, tenaga, dan energi untuk game DreadOut dan.... EKSPEKTASI GUE 80% dikabulkan. Mungkin 10 menit pertama dalam game agak sedikit membosankan, tapi bersabarlah... 10 menit berikutnya, bakalan terus horror. lalu 10 menit berikutnya lagi horrornya makin SAKIT. Gue gak bisa bilang apa aja yang bakalan lo lihat, tapi tim Digital Happiness bener bener terbukti mengeluarkan buanyak sekali usaha untuk menampilkan hantu hantu ala Indonesia.\n\nGrafik\nButuh high texture! Entah ini PC gue yang lemot atau settingnya default ke medium, tapi tekstur item yang ada didalam game resolusinya masih kurang memuaskan. Kalau lo suka banget dengan detail detail disetiap benda, mungkin agak sedikt kecewa. Walau pun begitu, atmosfir dan suasana horrornya bener bener kerasa banget. Abaikan benda benda kecil seperti alat tulis dsb, coba liat sekitar lo! Ruang kelas yang begitu gelap, kumuh, dan lembab. bangunan yang udah berlumut, hancur, dan kusam. restoran yang diserbu tikus, poster acak acakan, dan jendelanya pecah. Walau pun itemnya kurang detail, tapi atmosfirnya bisa membuat lo sulit bernafas.\n\nGameplay\nNO TUTORIAL. Yup, begitu lo masuk, lo musti belajar sendiri. Walau pun ada semacam guide kecil, tapi rasanya kurang aja gitu kalau kita sebagai gamer gak dikasih tutorial sebelum bermain. Selain itu, semuanya buat gue cukup sempurna. Gerakan karakter Linda tidak kaku, kameranya cukup sensitif, dan mode FPS nya cukup menarik. Gue udah banyak bermain game, terutama game horror.. segala macam kontrol yang ada didalam game ini cukup flawless. Sampai sejauh ini cuman ini yang bisa gue tulis, AKAN DIPERBAHARUI LAGI.\n\nEDIT:\nGue dapat info katanya ACT 2 bakalan ada nanti, masih TBA. Berita lainnya adalah nanti bakalan ada mode Free Roam gitu, semacam Slender kah? Gue masih belum dapat info yang lebih lanjut. Tapi dari sumber yang gue baca, Free Roam ini merupakan DLC.\n\nStoryline\nsuatu genk anak SMA yang berencana untuk pergi ke suatu tempat menemukan dirinya tersesat disebuah pintu masuk kota mati. Linda, Ira, Bu Guru Siska, dan 3 orang temannya memutuskan untuk masuk ke kota tanpa nama tersebut untuk mencari petunjuk jalan. Terror dimulai ketika salah satu muridnya menghilang didalam gedung sekolah yang tua. Linda pun menjelajahi sekolah tersebut sambil mencari cerita dibalik kota yang mati ini.\n\nGue berani kasih skor 8 dari 10.\nKenapa? untuk sementara, gue enjoy banget dengan game ini. horror levelnya cukup tinggi. gue sempat berteriak kaya anak kecil yang ga dibeliin es krim sama mamah nya pas ada hantu. ini bener bener game horror yang semua orang pasti suka. lo pengen menikmati kegelapan? lo pengen dikagetin? lo pengen didongein kisah hantu Indonesia? LO BAKALAN DAPAT ITU SEMUA. Tapi satu hal yang sedikit dikecewakan adalah low texture dan no tutorial. Tapi gak apa kok, untuk harga $15 bener bener pantas banget untuk dibeli.","May 8, 2014","true","5.9"," 119 of 180 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","119","180","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/269790/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","DreadOut is a third-person Puzzle/Survival Horror game by Digital Happiness. In it you take on the role of Indonesian teenager Linda, who was on a school trip when not-so-suddenly her group becomes trapped in an old, creepy, abandoned town.\n\nSounds familiar? Surely it’s the starting point of many a game, but the kind of horror DreadOut brings out is one of my favorites. You see, here you’re not hiding from invincible monsters, you’re not running away, and you’re not (really) fighting the ghosts (technically speaking). If you’ve ever played Fatal Frame, you’ll be quite familiar with the play style and ambiance of DreadOut, for Linda is armed only with a camera, and that is all she has to fight off the apparitions and, yes, solve puzzles.\n\nDreadOut is comprised of three different acts (0, 1 and 2), each a bit different than the previous one - act 0 serving as a sort of glimpse as to what to expect, Act 1 setting the pacing, and Act 2 completely changing the pacing you’d gotten used to; all acts follow the same storyline; and while in essence the story might not be out of this world in originality (despite the twists and turns taken and the stories within stories), and while the ghost design might not be anything too different (even if they’re unique to Indonesian lore), the game gets plenty of cookie points for being in a different setting and full of ghost (and thus, cultural) lore.\n\nControls in the game are fairly simple: You run (stamina dictates you need a break every so often), you walk, you interact with doors and objects, pick items up, and use your phone’s camera to snap photos, solve puzzles, and defeat ghosts. And also to illuminate really dark areas, too. Linda has a ‘sense’ which helps her find all these things, when a blue vignette appears you’re near a puzzle, item or secret, while if it’s red, it means there’s an enemy near.\n\nAlthough the graphics and textures are a tad dated and will not give an AAA game a run for its money, they’re still fairly decent, and the characters are attractive enough to look at that you won’t be put off by their faces every time they turn around. Despite this, the general ambiance is quite good, and succeeds in making you forget that it’s a game and giving you that creepy feeling every survival-horror abandoned town and building should have. The voice overs are pretty good too, something I was pleasantly surprised with. The music is really good - it’s not always creepy, but it’s still good, and in the parts where it is creepy, it succeeds at it. The game also makes use of silence and sound bites to make you on edge, like playing soft, creepy laughter or crying when you least expect it, managing to create something that truly has you on the edge of your seat.\n\nThis is the kind of horror I like, the type that’s more psychological and situational than just jump scares and loud noises, and while DreadOut does have a few jump scares, they’re not quite as obnoxious as the ones utilized in most horror games.\n\nIf you’ve never played Fatal frame before, this is how the “fighting” aspect works: All “fighting” is done through the camera. You point it at the evil spirit and snap a few shots, which damages it, and it eventually disappears (unless it’s invincible… then it’ll just leave you alone for a little while). DreadOut has added to this where you don’t just have to snap, but some of the tougher spirits actually have specific weak spots for you to find. I do love this style of gameplay, but I found the ghosts to be a little less scary than the ambiance of the place, and a bit more annoying. It seemed like it took too many shots just to get rid of one simple ghost, so once the initial scare wore off, defeating them was more of a chore. The slightly cramped spaces also made for tricky fights sometimes, becoming particularly annoying during boss fights, making it hard to find their weak spots. At least in Fatal frame when they rushed at you, you had a last-chance shot that made more damage than the others, and a bit more time to run around and find a comfortable spot to snap from. Not so much in DreadOut, where there’s no last-chance shot and less space to run around before the ghost charges at you again. This might work for a more hardcore gamer, for me it didn’t work quite so well.\nI feel like the potential in these type of camera-only games isn’t on the fights themselves, and thus they should be easy enough the get past without infuriating you, which doesn’t mean they can’t require some kind of tactics. This, more than anything, is what made it less enjoyable for me than I had anticipated.\n\nI will say, however, that every fight was different from the last, so the originality put on it was really nice to see. When you die in DreadOut you don’t fail. It’s not game over and start over… when you die you enter “limbo”; a dark area with a light ahead of you. You run towards the light, and start back at the spot you were at. Usually with the ghost right besides you, and barely enough time to get your bearings between the animation and lifting the camera before it charges. This is both a cool concept and kind of annoying, as every time you die the length you have to run to reach the light is longer. You can make the length you have to run fixed in settings, though, which I took advantage of.\n\nThe puzzles are rather difficult. Sometimes it takes a lot of random snapping of photos and pondering to figure out what to do… which is actually rather good, except when there’s ghosts around making you nervous. Sometimes they were a little too puzzling though, where I would find the blue vignette and walk around and snap shots at everything in the hopes something would yield a result, and couldn’t find what it wanted me to do at all.\n\nIf there was one big thing I didn’t like about this game, I would have to say it was the lack of a save-when-you-want feature. The game auto-saves at several parts and does so as well when you exit, which is wonderful and useful for the average gamer, but -and while I appreciate such things- I would also have liked to save at a point I decide without having to leave my game to do so. I also found the save on exit not working all the time, as twice I had to re-do a (short, but still annoying) section when I went back to my game.\n\nThere were a few minor bugs through my playthrough; the game would sometimes lag a bit (at random times, not because it was particularly loading anything) and the camera would sometimes “snap” back at a weird angle (I feel it might have been because of the lag, but it seemed like it did it at random times too), but none of them were game-breaking bugs.\nAnd speaking of loading, the loading times could certainly be improved on, as they get a bit too long.\n\nThe game has a few items to collect through your play and several documents (besides every ghost encounter filling your ghost lore book with interesting tidbits and stories), as well as some easter eggs; you can also unlock some outfits to wear during replays. There’s also two endings to this hidden gem, which was quite nice.\n\nAll things considered, you can tell that despite the dated graphics, the developers have put a lot of thought and care into the game, and you really have to appreciate that. I think this is a solid horror game that does the horror part very good, but falls just a little bit short at the gameplay aspect - at least for my personal taste.\n\nOverall I’d highly recommend it, particularly if you’re a fan of Fatal Frame or similar styled games, or if you like horror games but are tired of jump scares.","July 13, 2015","true","2.9"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","0"

Being lost and needing to explore is actually very favorable in my opinion - I HATE when a game becomes a simple matter of tracing objective markers. But for a long time, I was going several play sessions not figuring out what I needed to try next in the game, as after a certain point the entire school is available to you, with no hints as to where to go next.\n\nA couple of recommendations for the developers that might be pretty simple ways of improving parts of the experience:\n- When a ghost is first encountered, update the Ghostpedia right away. Also, provide a simple button prompt (ie, Tab, or the Y button) to go directly to that ghost's page. If someone's clueless as to the method of defeating it or strategies, that might give them some encouragment. (And after it's beaten, that's useless) To give players some breathing room, have the ghost start out with some "taunt" animation that takes several seconds in which the player can realize the cutscene's over, etc.\n\n- When the player has reached some new area in which there's something they need before leaving, don't let them leave until they have it; for instance, lock them in the left wing of the school until they take the puzzle picture from the crumbled balcony (at this point, I started re-exploring the whole school not sure where to go). This could be accomplished several ways. A) A demonic wall appears behind them and vanishes after they have the item (not great, as players won't think to check the wall again) or B) Have a simple one-way gate like a longer drop, and a normal locked door to escape, from which they need to obtain a key from the same spot. (For instance, maybe after taking the picture, the cat could be holding a key)\n\n- An alternative for my previous problem might be more focus on the Journal. I did follow the game's loading screen tips of looking at it when I didn't know what to do, but there were definitely points in which the top item (There is a locked cupboard, it could be useful) didn't take me anywhere useful, as I had only one guess where the key was, and no guess how to retrieve it. Maybe the top item could be highlighted, to show that that's what you should currently do as other objectives may not be available. For more detail, it could progress like this:\n:: With that ghost out of the way, the left wing's second story can now be explored.\n:: There are strange markings visible in the lobby from the second story.\n:: There's something strange about this picture...\n\nFor a first game by a country that does not often do game development, it's a great effort. If you see this on sale under $5 and you enjoy horror games, I'd say go for it. But, currently it's not a lot to offer and can be kind of frustrating with its lack of player-information.\n\n(I will try to remember to update this when the second act comes out)","June 13, 2014","false","3.6"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","37","52","0","0"

Unfortunately, the few decent ideas this game has are ruined by completely miserable gameplay and design.  Expect bugs, enemies that will stunlock you to death, a system that punishes the player for dying by making them wait arbitrary, incrementally-increasing amounts of time to respawn, obtuse, illogical puzzles, poor voice acting and translation work, dated graphics, stiff, absurd character animation, directionless pixel hunting, paths that continue infinitely instead of dead-ending...\n\nAbout that death system?  When your character dies, you get to engage in the delightful minigame of running in a straight line towards a respawn point.  The first time you die, the jog takes about 15 seconds.  With each death the run becomes longer and longer.  As soon as you die, the game autosaves and checkpoints you, so there's no way of avoiding this sequence.  By the time I quit out to write this review, I counted the tedious errand taking upwards of a minute.  The developers brag about this mechanic in the in-game manual.\n\nI don't like this game.

But ! You have something to counter that, a magical phone that will make the ghost disappears when you took their photos. Yep, just like in Fatal Frame.\n\nAct 1 Review:\nThe thing is, i really want to give this game a good review but at this current state, i can't. First thing first, i don't want to talk about the graphics because its not that good, its mediocre at its best. The texture didn't have the amount of detail that 2014 games used to have (yes, even in indie games quality), that is coming from a person that didn't really care about graphics. Now the gameplay, its very boring, you barely encounter any ghost at all and there's only 3 of them that you can actually fight. The other ghosts ? Its only part of some cheap jumpscare or puzzle that you most solve. For a game that advertise their main feature is the magical phone camera. Its a huge letdown in game design that you only use it a few times, even though Its actually really fun to defeat the ghost using the camera.\n\nThe puzzle is not really easy and no, its not because its challenging or anything, its because the game didn't tell me or guide me what so ever, how can i know i suppose to get up there to that dead end just to get the clue that let me advanced the story ? The game suppose to give a small bit a clue to help the players.\n\nAct 2 Review:\nI guess i could finally kinda recommend this game, in this act they certainly improved a lot of aspect in the game which make the game better.\n\nFirst of all, the puzzle is a lot better than the act 1, the "puzzle" sense that the main character get when they stumbled upon a puzzle is easier to be noticed. Its still hard, and you still have to think to solve it, but it doesn't require luck to even stumble upon some of the puzzle like in the previous act.\n\nThe ghost encounter has been improved a lot. There's more aggresive ghost that will try to kill you and you have to use your camera to kill them, and each ghost has there own weakness which makes every encounter with them is a puzzle itself. There is less passive ghost in the game, but every ghost that you encounter has a purpose instead of just kinda standing around doing nothing or just be there to jumpscare you, some of them is part of the puzzle that will help you advance the story, and some them has some hidden story that you can collect.\n\nThe plot that this game is going for is very interesting and kinda unique. A lot of people might hate the story, but i really like it. I can't tell you anything about the story apart from that you will have to think in the end. Like, What just happen ? What the hell is the story ? Who is her ?? and that kind of stuff.\nBut, the ending really feels like a sequel bait, which is not nice in a game. I just hope that the developer did well enough to actually make a sequel to this game.\n\nReally fun but really short and apart from few jumpscare that are kinda scary. Its not that scary, not like the horror that Silent Hill or Outlast could give you. But i think that some people might finds it scary. I still didn't think its worth a full price if you want a memorable and scary experience. But i still recommend it, just keep your horror expectation lower and you will enjoy it.","April 4, 2015","true","4.0"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","28","37","5","0"

I am not sure whether the Act 2 will have the same length or will be longer. In case of having the same length, it's a very bad point. The game only have a couple of hours so with Act 2 would be 4 or 5 as much. I hope the developers takes this into consideration at time to release the Act 2 since the Act 1 is too short. Also looking forward for the free roaming mode. It may be interesting but still, the game needs a longer story asides of this extra mode.\nRight now, the game is kinda "expensive" due the short duration but if you are a lover of horror and survival games then is worth it.","May 8, 2014","true","8.2"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","0"

I would even say that it's not really a passing grade.\n\nLet me start with what is good. The sound was amazing. Music and musical changes as well as ambient noises make for a great deal of atmosphere and scare-factor in these games; clearly the developers and designers of this game realized that. The models used for the creatures and ghosts also struck me as unsettling and scary.\n\nThe price is also affordable which is a bonus.\n\nBut I guess that's it.\n\nGraphics were sub-par. I can foregive this however and would encourage you to look past graphics when making a purchase in the horror genre. I think too much emphasis on graphics can actually ruin a well designed game.\n\nBut this game didn't strike me as well designed. My first frustration was centered around the inarticulate communication of what is seemingly the first real puzzle. A help screen can be accesssed in the games menu and when all else fails, the main character also keeps a journal that can be referenced at any time. Presumably, to help with solving puzzles. As you might have guessed this was not the case with the first puzzle. You are left to wander the halls aimlessly looking for anything to help you. The only clue from the journal? I need something sharp. The rest of the puzzles mechanics are just "dropped" on you with the anticipation that you'll piece together what the developers were driving at. I can appreciate this approach to puzzle/horror games (Riven and Myst were both fun and did similar things) but I became frustrated with the pig/key puzzle and its abstruse and very obscure "picture of what could look like bad graphics on the ceiling" solution.\n\nAfter spending so much time pacing the hallways to figure out this puzzle, the fright of the game had become entirely deflated. With my frustration now outweighing the atmosphere, I carried on with the puzzle in to a room where I need something sharp. The first item I see of notable worth in the room? A pair of scissors. I don't just get the scissors though. I need to go over to a crib (for what reasons I'll never understand since I'm not looking for a crib) and trigger a boss fight. Okay. Bosses are usually another side of a game that can be fun and interesting.\n\nNope. The pairing of cloogy controls and a constrained space (you fight in an enclosed room) are the only reasons this fight can be considered "challenging". The space was a good idea. The controls were not.\n\nYou spend a great deal of game-time in third person following the main character with a pretty typical control scheme. Moving the mouse moves the camera while you use the keyboard to interact (E) and move (WSAD). The flashlight on your phone is turned off/on with (F) while the right mouse button puts you in "first person" mode where you look through the camera of the phone to snap a picture with the left mouse button. Doing so to a ghost deals damage to them. You cannot move quickly while taking these pictures. Why? Because screw you. That's why.\n\nThose controls are reasonable. But it leaves you impared when attempting to swap between third and first person modes and quickly line-up a snap-shot of anything.\n\nAnd guess what this fight demands of you? You guessed it. So here you are, in a tight space, moving from third to first person, which in turn slows you down or speeds you up, attempting to take pictures of a ghost that is phasing in and out of existence around you. All that was truly needed was a bit more indication of where this ghost was going to appear next or maybe slightly more space, but there is no way to "quickly" look behind you and check all angles. You  have to run in short circles in the middle of the room whipping the camera around just enough to line up a snap-shot and hope you don't get so much as nicked by the boss, because then you'll be locked out of recovery and defeated.\n\nWhat's so bad about being defeated? Well, when defeated (killed) you are sent to a spirit world. Your task here? Wait for your character to pick her sorry butt up off the ground then run a soul-crushing distance (about 20 or so seconds) back to the light and re-enter the frustrating game that sent you here to begin with. Every time you are defeated. Wait for her to get up ~sigh~ Run for a mind-numbing 20 seconds to the light ~sigh~ Try again.\n\nLook. I know many are not  going to take well to my review. Haters gonna hate. But more of my time was spent running to the light, wandering hallways aimlessly, and doubting my purchase than was spent enjoying the game. I never finished the first boss. Like many other games that frustrate me, I will likely return and complete the game; a kind of "due diligence" on my part. I did so with the original Red Faction game as well (also a terrible game).  But I ultimately don't recommend this title. It lacks both polish and necessary (not even good... just necessary) design elements.","December 7, 2014","false","7.7"," 65 of 105 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","65","105","3","6"

Now this game comes around taking a bit of everything and creates a very nice horror game. The graphics are not that great, the texture quality on Linda and the other characters are fine, but the ground, cars and even the walls seems like something from the Playstation 2 era, but graphics are not all.\n\nThe game itself is very enjoyable, the horror is made just right and the game is made with creepy in mind instead of cheap jump scares everywhere. You still think the school is creepy even when you know there is nothing in that room or you already walked around there without anything happening and sometimes you can hear stuff going on even when you can't see it or near it.\n\nYou can even play act one more than once, cause I even discovered that it's not worth rushing though, you can search the city at night and find stuff here and there.\nWith act one with less than two hours long, I still think this is worth the money.

Graphics wise it is on par with many PS2 games of the mid 2000s era, with very simple texturing method, animation is also a bit weird at times.\n\nOn the positive side: Character design and AI is very well done. I haven't found any critical bugs that would ruin the gameplay. Ghost design is spot on when it goes for the creepiness factor. But what I would give 5/5 stars is the general atmosphere of the game. This game does not rely on cheap jumpscares but more of an unpleasant sense of presence, in that you know there are ghosts and supernatural beings out there to get you and you must get through them to proceed with the story (that is what Dread is supposed to mean I think). Sound effect and music is amazing. It feels like every single step that you make is bringing you closer to another ghost. Gameplay wise some of the ghosts are actually quite challenging to defeat.\n\nOther: If you are not familiar with Indonesian culture you will see many things that are culturally relevant to Indonesians which are subtle but noticeable (sort of an inside joke for me).\n\nCannot wait for Act 2! and maybe more acts to come!","May 9, 2014","true","6.0"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","2"

I'd then like to move on to saying ♥♥♥♥ YOU, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING MOTHER-♥♥♥♥ERS, for creating such a ludicrously CHILDISH way of "punishing" the player for the seemingly unforgivable crime of...wait for it...DYING IN A VIDEO GAME.  What is this punishment, you ask?\n\nWell, the first couple of times it's actually kind of groovy.  Your character awakens in a "Limbo" of sorts, lying on the floor of an otherwise featureless landscape surrounded by lit candles.  She finds her feet, and soon enough you figure you may as well run towards a coalescing light nearby.  Sure enough, you slowly emerge back into the land of the living, and may continue where you left off.  Sounds pretty nifty, huh?  TRY DOING IT MORE THAN TEN TIMES IN A SINGLE SITTING.  But wait, there's more!  The light...get this, you're gonna love this...the light MOVES FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY EVERY TIME YOU DIE, until it's eventually, like, a minute or more's running distance away.  In other words, not only are you rewarded with a two-minute wait before you can get back to trying to work out just how to get past that tricky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a boss bit, but you can't even walk away for those minutes like you would with a slow load screen, unless you have a pet monkey you can train to SIT THERE FOR TWO ♥♥♥♥ING MINUTES HOLDING THE "SHIFT" AND "W" KEYS DOWN!!!\n\nI can tell that the people who made this game are by and largely very talented, but apparently they either don't give a damn about public opinion or they don't know how to do STEAM UPDATES.  Because given how many negative reviews I've seen complaining about this particularly "striking" and "unique" feature which they've foisted upon us, I for the life of me cannot understand why the designers haven't decided to do a patch to fix this INSANELY BAD IDEA.  Seriously, it's stupid, and insulting, and to add further insult you start getting on-screen comments like "You might want to consider switching to casual gaming" whilst running towards the light for the umpteenth time.  Oh yeah, TROLLING people who shelled out good money for your game...genius.\n\nLet us seriously, SERIOUSLY hope that this nonsense is gone - or at least severely lessened - by the time that Act Two of an otherwise excellent game rears its head, 'cause honestly Digital Happiness, it's the only conceivable reason I can see why this game has such an appalling Metascore.  Apart from this highly significant flaw, and perhaps one or two puzzles/boss-battles which rely just a little TOO much on obscure solutions, this is top-rate horror gaming.  Oh, and a map wouldn't hurt either.  But honestly, the main criticism I have is the "dying" system (which you can't even circumnavigate by re-loading, thanks to you getting an auto-save the second said death occurs).\n\nThe people who make games this good deserve respect, but you know what?  So do the people who PLAY them.  Wake up, designers.  We're not all uber-gamers who devote our lives to spending 16 hours a day in front of the computer.  By all means make the games challenging, but please refrain from tactics which just make people wanna relinquish their support for your product (and FUTURE products) altogether.  I'm sure the "Limbo" idea was cute on paper, or in design meetings, but don't make the game-buying public your ♥♥♥♥ing guinea pigs.  Cheers.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10 (subject to improve if the developers grow a conscience and "do the right thing").\n\nLONG OVERDUE UPDATE:  Okay, so I finally deigned to play the second and final Act of this game, after finally abandoning my wait for the devs to return the "new" 32-bit version to its former 64-bit glory (don't even ask...Google it if you gotta).  First up, in regards to my little rant above...yes, the devs did more-or-less address the infamous "never-ending Limbo" issue, not by removing it entirely, but by adding an option where you could set it at the initial, much shorter running distance.  This is obviously a lot less annoying, but still pushes one's patience by the fortieth time that it occurs.  So what do I now think of the game as a two-part whole?  Well, I gotta say, despite many reservations I still hold about it, I'm quite happy to raise my Verdict to a 9 (but no higher).  It still has a TONNE of problems, but nonetheless easily qualifies as one of the best third-person survival horror games to come down the turnpike in a LONG while.  Let's see if the newly-released Keepers of the Dark side-game improves upon the tremendous potential shown herein.\n\nRevised Verdict: 9/10.","August 2, 2014","true","11.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I mean, c’mon…fighting ghosts with nothing but a camera?  It may sound silly to the uninitiated, but those who have played “Fatal Frame” know better.  “DreadOut” is a more modern-day version of “Fatal Frame” where the player takes on the role of Linda, a high school student trapped in an old abandoned town.  Equipped only with a smart phone, she’ll (you’ll) be tasked with solving puzzles all the while fending off some really terrifying “creatures”.\n\n\n\nBuying the game will grant you access to the first act, with DLC on the second act and a free roam mode to follow.  My biggest gripe is that Act One is only about one and a half to two hours long, once you know what you’re doing.  There’s only a handful of ghosts to boot.  Just as I was getting into the first act, it was over…I didn’t have this problem with “Outlast”, which took between five to ten hours to complete. I was able to confirm with the developer that the second act will be free, though the free roam DLC will have a price tag.  I was also able to confirm with the developer that the second act will contain more content than the first, so that helped to alleviate some of my concerns somewhat with regard to the price.\n\n\n\nBesides the “buy Act One now and hope Act Two is more meaty” feeling, I did run into a bug or two.  The game can also glitch out on occasion, forcing you to hard-quit and replay areas already beaten.  One of my save files got corrupted and I had to erase it altogether.  Still, “Dread Out” is an incredible and horrifying experience.  There is a demo available should you wish to try before you buy.  If you can’t get through the first minute of a “Slender” game without screaming like a little girl, then you may want to before dropping the dough.\n\n\n\nFull Review:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/dreadout/\n\n\n\nVideos:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dgn3gu3isuo\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uXp2YSlFDQ\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7j1ZxukOpI\n\n","May 13, 2014","true","5.9"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","2"

The path leads directly through the town and to the school where the game truly starts.\nLinda moves around in the third person, but the only way to fight or sometimes even see ghosts, is by switching to the first-person camera mode. Combat in DreadOut is pretty similar to Fatal Frame. When ghosts get close enough, the image on your camera will distort and snapping pictures at that moment damages them.  You will also use your phone’s flashlight function to search through dark corners for clues.\nThe visuals, while obviously not up to the level of a triple-A PC game, are not the best, but still okay for an indie game.\nThe sound effects are good so far.\nThe game is not really scary and the story is also not really brilliant.

Borrowing from Indonesian folklore, it manages to create one of the most paralizying scary games in years. You play as Linda, a highschool student on a roadtrip with her classmates and teacher, Soon they find a road block and have to continue on foot, traversing a desolate town, and stopping at an abandoned school (cause horror game characters are suicidal and have a death wish).\n\nBut before i fully praise the game, I have to warn EVERYONE about the issues this game has, which are several and MASSIVE.\n\n-Gamepad controls are ♥♥♥ and can't be rebinded, so you are better of playing with mouse and keyboard, butthe mouse has terrible acceleration that you will never get used to, making it frustrating, and indirectly scarier. All the character movement and actions are clumsier than your usual survival horror. It´ll get you mad at some points, and is not good to be too mad to even be scared.\n\n-Texture quality is on the VERY low end, and pop in is almost as scary as some ghosts, since they will appear right infront of your feet.\n\n-Models and graphics in general look worse tha the average ps2 title, is not a massive complain for me, but is very striking at first, and needs some time to get used to...\n\n-Story: Characters are dumb as hell, the story isnt even there, is just a platform to make you face these horrors, the end. On the bright side, the dialogue is so corny and bad, you will be glad that you spend most of the game completely alone.\n\nSo now lets list what i consider great in this game.\n\n-Atmosphere: Lets just say, you are better off playing this game with brown pants, cause the simple act of walking is already a challenge when the enviroments looks so eerie and creepy. Also, the enviroments have this samey maze look. like older Silent HIll titles, where all rooms would look almost similar, making it difficult to draw an mental map, and raising the stress bar even higher. You´ll have a flashlight, which barely illuminates, and totally works.\n\n-Sound: Great use of sound effects and music, is hardly ever strartling, but always tense and haunting in the best posible sense, musical cues will evoke a feeling of dread that will follow you though most of the game.\n\n-Ghosts: won't even call them enemies, even if they are out to kill you, but they are so amazing, they deserve to be called for what they are...This game not only has some of the best ghosts i´ve seen in games, but has their actual lore, and they don't get the mob treatment, each ghost is unique, and doesnt repeat, meaning, you wont be facing hordes of them (in 1 fight you do), instead, encounters will be more self contained and memorable for this graceful design choice. I really loved the ghosts in this game, so much, that ater playing, i find myself researching about them, just to learn more about them.\n\n-Puzzles: Good and Bad. Bad at first cause they aren't you usual "pull x levers in a certain order" type of puzzles...They involve more what you see as a player, and make of the enviroment, is more about observation (almost like antichamber at times) than the more conventional puzzle solving (silent hill, RE, amnesia, etc).\n\nIn an ocean of horror games, all presented as luxury ships (Evil Within, Alien Isolation, Soma, Outlast, etc), Dreadout is a rackety wooden boat, the difference, this crappy boat is the truly haunted one.\n\nOther than that, i´m really looking forward to future horror works from this studio (Digital Hapiness), a small indonesian indie dev that has really left an impression in the industy with their first work (this game).\n\nAnd still, i know the average consumer is too used to triple A graphcis and handholding(and being honest, better design in general), that is why I hesitate to recommend dreadout for full price, but it its on sale, you love horror, and can endure dodgy design, this is a game you will probably appreciate.","November 4, 2015","true","10.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

Each ghost also has some lore behind them including some disturbing ones like the scissor phantom for example (Here's his story http://dreadout.wikia.com/wiki/Scissor_Phantom give it a read) & also the achievements have a few references (Also a few achievements with hashtags & pop culture) like for example the Attack On Titan achievement is a reference to the post apocalyptic anime that everyone craves about including me (Here's the IMDB page about the show http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/ in case I sparked some curiosity for people that never heard about it). The game is also set in an semi open world so there is a lot to explore but it's more difficult to adventure at night, the options menu is ok, the game can also be played with controller & if you really want a hardcore experience turn off all the hints in the options menu.\n\nThe only thing I wish the game had was a better connection with the other NPCs but there's other suggestions you can add in this forum here http://steamcommunity.com/app/269790/discussions/0/558755530214691567/ because the devs are listening & I like game devs that respect their consumers but overall the game has been cleaned up from past issues so that's a plus.

Just to keep the feel of location, besides many locked doors, you'll be actually finding notes with backstory of specific places.\n\nBackstory might help you getting more into the game, but what's the main feature of DreadOut, is the brilliant horror atmosphere. Scary sounds that you can't recognize, creepy environment with well designed ghosts, jumpscares and ubiquitous darkness is something the game does in a great way. But that applies to the horror segments, that has more or less boring walking around itself.\n\nAll gameplay mechanisms are bound to smartphone of the protagonist, Linda. With your everlasting battery, you'll use your phone as a flashlight and a camera. Puzzles use camera flashes or peeking through it, as you might see different things through the camera. The everlasting battery for flashlight is compensated with the fact that you may not want to be using it all the time, there might be a situations where you'll rather decide to spend your time in the dark that may feel somehow safer.\n\nLevel design has enough room for you to get lost; there are situations where you might not be sure what to do next. Developers tried to help you at least a little, as they added Linda's diary into the game where you can always check your current objective. There isn't any proper tutorial in the game but all controls and gameplay mechanics are explained in the "how to play" section of the menu. I don't think of horror game players as casuals, so I think it shouldn't be a problem for anybody interested.\n\nI tried to be positive with the game as far, but it's time to mention the bad things. DreadOut is not for everybody, I understand why it feels great for experienced horror game players, but I found the gameplay overall more boring that I'd originally expect. Making all the gameplay around walking and using camera seems to be a good idea, but personally it didn't feel much satisfying to me after about an hour. While the short game length can't even make it much repetitive, you still might lose a motivation to continue - the only "magnet" there is truly the atmosphere.\n\nGraphics are something that can make players ask themselves if they are really playing a game released in 2014. While the ghosts look great and characters look somehow fine, the environment around you, when not placed into darkness, looks really bad. Many objects and their textures reminded me of Counter-Strike 1.6 and basic 3D graphics modeling - For example, I haven't seen cars that would look like "slightly better boxes with textures" for a really long time.\n\nOh, and you'll be able to see through some walls with third-person camera. Another nail in the coffin is the bad optimalisation that even with the poor graphics sucks up performance pretty badly. Don't expect getting high with your FPS counter.\n\nConclusion:While DreadOut does a great things in terms of the horror atmosphere, the other factors are making the experience for worse, mostly. It's definitely not a game for everybody, and considering it doesn't offer even many hours of gameplay to those who don't want to unlock all achievements, I don't think it's worth recommending.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of DreadOut was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that might have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 23","false","5.6"," 28 of 48 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","28","48","3","0"

It is seperated in three acts: 0,1 and 2 where act 0 is equal to the demo of the game. Personally, I found playing Act 0 as first a bit irritating.\n\nWell, with act 1 the actual story is set in motion. A group of high school students and their teacher Miss Siska are (after taking a wrong turn) arriving at an empty village. You are playing as Linda Meilinda and you start exploring the village together with your friends until you arrive at an old school building, the home of several ghosts.\n\nAs for the gameplay: Linda the main protagonist has the ability to fight the ghosts by taking pictures of them with her smart phone. Normally you play in an over the shoulder perspective which changes to first person perspective while using the phone. To help you, especially playing the first time, there are several hint indicators. A red vignette if enemies are nearby, blue if a pickable item is nearby, and a phone glitch if a ghost is in damaging range of your phone. Some of the ghosts are only visible through your phone, others are invincible or have special weak points so you always need to pay attention and can't get to relaxed. The atmosphere of Act 1 is eerie and really tense and you are always on your toes. The area is pretty large and you can loose directions easily. There is interesting stuff and ghosts to find. Starting with Act 2, after the school building, I felt the game got more linear which made it partially easier but it still has a wonderful tense atmosphere. From time to time there are some small jump scares but the game relies more on its atmosphere.\n\nFor the Story: The Story of  DreadOut  is interesting but there is a good chance for you to "miss" it completely. Most of the stuff you need you, is shown during your playthrough (Cutscenes, Pictures on the wall, etc.). But it isn't explained to you at all so it can seem confusing. Especially for Act 2 I personally got lost inbetween. There is a greater picture and it is recommanded to play the game again a second time after making yourself a picture of the story. As achievement hunter you need to complete the game several times anyways.\n\nFor the completion time: If you know what you have to do you can complete the whole game (including the optional area in the beginning of the game) in around two hours so that is pretty short. But the first time playing you will probably need around 5-6 hours. As an achievement hunter there is a lot to do: Finding easter eggs, hunting down all ghosts, getting the alternative ending and more.\n\nAlthough I criticize the "narration" style of the game, especially of Act 2 and also Act 0 I can only recommand this game. After completion I read a bit in the forum and read about story interpretations. After doing this you can appreciate the game much more. Maybe you are smart enough to figure out everything yourself. Even with the first time confusing story the game lives so much through its excellent atmosphere and tension. So buy the game, support the developers, complete the game and if you find the time complete it a second time. The game is worth your time.\n\nPS: If you have questions just post them here and I'll try to come back at them as fast as possible.\nPPS: I have ignored the graphical aspects of the game since I don't care for them to much. But some users reported glitches and other problems. Also the textures are somewhat dated. If you are not a "graphic ♥♥♥♥♥" it shouldn't bother you too much.","October 29, 2015","true","15.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/recommended/269790/","endchronicle","Rekyua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/","675 products in account","DreadOut is a call back to the games of the past, it's a old formula revived and updated for the new generation.\n\nThe first thing that stands this game apart from any games I've seen lately are the attention to detail in the environments. I spent my first playthrough scanning the landscape and checking each room, great care has been taken in the design of the levels and it's refreshing to have situations where you can get to a lonely dead end that serves little purpose other than to let you explore (but only sometimes are you alone). The controls work well for the game as well and didn't do anything to hinder the gameplay but the lack of a 180 degree turn is sorely missed in some encounters that need some tight turning but it still has tighter controls than Fatal Frame, another game DreadOut takes some ques from. The game also doesn't hold your hand, there's a handy "How to Play" in the menu that I recommend you get familiar with, and get use to using the camera to check things out!\n\nThe sound is great as well, I haven't been entranced by atmospheric sound and music since the days of the first Silent Hill entries. Even if there's no immediate threat I found myself on edge just walking around due to the haunting sounds as I explored the game.\n\nI can highly recommend this game and look eagerly forward to the release of Act 2 and the subsequent Free Roam mode. Make sure you check out the demo as well, it's its own stand-alone level that you definately don't want to miss. At the time of this review I couldn't get the download to work through Steam but it should be working on release.\n\nBut the game does have some negatives, the first is the length. It's only 2 hours (with figuring out puzzles the first time, I was stumped a couple of them for a good while) if you go in blind so right now there isn't much.. So, it's a negative but when the rest of the game comes out it should pad it more, since I'm more disappointed that there's less game for me to play right now. Second, Death is handled differently in this game, I'll try not to spoil anything but you always get a second chance with more time. There were some technical issues but they've already been fixed by the developer so I won't count those.\n\nEither way, it's great! Might not be too long (for now) but it's an amazing experience!\n\nAnd remember this when you get the game... when night falls stay outside for awhile before going indoors..","May 12, 2014","true","5.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

This game isn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. If you are considering buying this game because you think it looks like Fatal Frame, then you should read my review first.\n\nThis game has less to do with encountering ghosts and more to do with solving difficult puzzles. Don't get me wrong...I love puzzles! I wouldn't have a problem with a few short puzzles in a horror game. It becomes a problem when I spend so much time trying to solve puzzles that I'm no longer being scared by the game. Instead, I end up being frustrated.\n\nAlso, the game lacks balance. The first ghost you encounter is a violent giant pig that apparently CAN'T BE KILLED! Why is this the first creature I encounter? Why not start with a very basic enemy to help you get a hang of the controls? I don't know! Makes no sense. Also, the first boss you encounter is nearly impossible. You fight a ghost with scissors in a small space that requires you to have impossible reflexes in order to even have a chance at victory.\n\nAt the end of the day, this game isn't fun or scarry, but frustrating. I'm hoping that the developers take all these things into consideration before they release Act 2.","December 26, 2014","false","3.5"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","18","30","0","0"

I fully enjoyed this game and had quite a few really good scares as it kept me on edge a lot of the time. I had to refer once or twice elsewhere as I got stuck; however the 1st Act was very enjoyable so I cannot wait for the 2nd Act to conclude the game. Good music, some interesting and unique opponents with only your camera ready on your smartphone as your only means of defence!.

(yes exactly, here no one will tell you where to go, what to push, when to turn atc... here every single thing can be important, things that happen in the beginning can be used in the end part of the game and not as in modern games where every single thing showing you what to do, here you must remember, think and try everything).\nDreadout is not an easy game, but it's easy in same time, here you need to think and explore things, sometimes you will lost, sometimes you can be confused in what to do, but most Puzzles have very easy way to complete them and exactly this is confusing, when you're not waiting that easiest way can be the right way.\nDreadout is the game about girl Linda who fall in to unknown world, another world, where every thing can be hostile, from where no one comes alive.

However it's still a flawed game.\n\nWhen you "died" too many times in the game, you are sent to "limbo" and have to make your way out to continue the game however the amount of distance that you have to walk everytime you dies, increases. This is frustating as hell as I died alot of times because I was clueless on what to do or I didn't know the ghost weakness. I have to walk about 2minutes+ in the limbo everytime i die and the game became stale to me.\n\nHow about removing this whole system and just replace it with a simple "Continue?" screen?\n\nThe boss fight with the scissors ghost is another flawed boss fight, I am not saying the boss is hard to defeat but when the boss was about to die, the boss suddenly goes into full steroid mode and when the boss hit you once, you are practically dead. Yes, you can still escape but trust me, it's hard as hell. How about making the boss stop for every 5 seconds when it's on steroid mode? So you can catch your breath and get a proper angle/view to attack the boss. Honestly this is the part where I died too many times that I have to walk 2 minutes in the limbo and fight the boss again and die again.\n\nOther than that, I am waiting for ACT 2.\nGood game for an indonesian company ! 8/10 !\n\nKeep up the great work guys !","May 17, 2014","true","10.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

This could pass as an older gamecube or original Xbox title, but for $15 this is a something that can be overlooked. Though initially it does seem like it will get in the way of immersion, once the game gets started and sets its dark tone, you'll be able to look passed it.\nThe atmosphere in this game is done really well, the music and tone are perfect for what a horror title should be. This definitely brings back feelings of classic old school horror.\n\nThe dialog and animations are a bit funny, but in the good way. Think kind of like the original resident evil way. Something I found charming really, the kind of bad that's really good and makes you enjoy the game!\n\nThis is Digital Happiness' first real title, and it shows. That being said, they did a really good job as far as being able to provide a new horror game in to the mix. There's a lot of potential for this franchise to grow, and for only $15, it's worth a try, especially if you're in to the classic horror games.\nThis is also the first Indonesian game to hit steam, and Indonesia is still growing as far as its games development market is concerned. When you take that in to account, they did pretty damn well with this game, and I hope they;re successful enough to continue making more games and being able to build on what they've learned with more funding and experience.","May 11, 2014","true","10.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","1"

Then you'll love this game. There are a few negatives, though:\n\n-Boss Ghosts (one in particular) are difficult to the point of near-unfairness.\n-There's one sequence you're randomly thrown into with no clear direction on what to do and how to escape while being chased. However, if you're caught and lose a life, you respawn with nothing chasing you anymore, just leaving you without a threat and the same lack of direction. Hint: Use your camera to find a hidden path.\n-Too short. It's being released in 'episodes' so there's far more to come, but the main game released so far and all it's secrets will only last about 2-3 hours.\n\nDespite the negatives that will no doubt be addressed later, this game is very much a fun Fatal Frame sister title and is one of the few indie horror games that I have found to be AAA-quality.

As it stands now, only half of the menus and actions have button icons to help you figure out how to navigate, and the mouse cursor keeps jumping onto the middle of the screen despite using a controller for this game.\n\nNOTE: There is an issue with the game engine. If you make any kind of custom setting in the video settings a lot of effects like normal maps, shadows, bloom, etc. will be disabled. You must only select a preset within the game. After that you can edit the config file located in "~\%user name%\Documents\Steam Cloud\%steam name%\DreadOut\cloud\20140722011532\profile.cfg".\n\nI recommend two additonal performance enhancements. This game takes a huge fps hit with the game's built-in antialiasing. Use antialiasing in your driver control panel instead. The Steam overlay also hurts the fps quite a bit too in this particular game, and will even run a modern video card (GTX 660) very hot with it enabled.\n\nWhat I did was use the game preset of Fantastic (highest preset), exit the game, set the aa to 0 in the .cfg file, disable Steam overlay on this title, forced aa in the driver control panel, and now it's a steady 60 fps and looks great.","May 23, 2014","true","5.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

An ongoing one, editing it as I play it more and more.\nThe game is an indie attempt to immitate Fatal Frame experience.\nIt promises a horror experience and I can't describe how strict I am on this genre.\nI love horror and I can't find many games that can absorb me into their reality and also make me feel horror.\nSo is it good? Let's see.\nThe controls are not so good. The sprites are also not nice, only the main character is really sophisticated.\nVoice acting is bad. Seriously. What saves the game from being a disaster, is that most of the horror time, is not in those voice acting scenes.\nThe sound has also some issues.\nIt is obvious that the game has many flaws.\nLike the flowing water on the graveyard, in the begining of the game.\nThe riddles are not well set and many players will probably have a hard time to solve the first one.\nI can't say that I was impressed during my play until after the candle riddle. It was really vanilla horror so far. Nothing was fitting well, not the gameplay, not the music, not the surrounding fx, not the sound fx, not the gameplay, neither the mechanics no nothing. I can't even figure out if there is a scenario. I just woke up somehere and that's how the game begins. Really? Oh well they might unravel some of the scenario later.\n\nAnd I was right, I reached the abandoned school. And it was there that I pooped bricks.\nNo I am dead serious. For some reason, the music, the atmosphere, the graphics, the sound fx, the enemies, the gameplay mechanics, all of a sudden all the elements merge together very well, in a way that they make me feel threatened. I was constantly feeling that I was in a hostile place. And that is a success.\n\nSince a horror game MUST make you feel at LEAST once fear, I believe this game succeeds on being a horror worth playing, at least for me. Yes it isn't perfect, it's far from it, but it delivers when it comes to fear, because I am used to horror. I am not getting scared easily.  They managed to scare me, it is good enough for me.\n\nI also can see a good effort from the developers. So yes I recommend it, because it deserves a chance. Give it a chance and see if the game works for you.","March 29","true","8.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/269790/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Digital Happiness return to Steam with their second game in their popular DreadOut series with Keepers of the Dark. This is not a sequel but rather a standalone horror game that takes place in the same universe as the original. Once again a developer has done a very thorough job in explaining their game in the Steam description so without attempting to repeat everything contained within it I’ll explain my own personal thoughts on the game.\n\nI feel it necessary to compliment Digital Happiness on an outstanding ‘how to play’ feature available from the main menu. It’s a great way to handle a tutorial so that players know the ins and outs of gameplay before they begin so that they can best savor the sensory experience that they are about to embark upon. For those who never played the original and are starting here, which it is entirely possible to do, this is a must read section.\n\nI agree with those who have made the claim that providing skills, abilities and experience points would have added much more variety to the game than what is present. It’s probably the biggest downfall of the game. The other, in my opinion, is the non-SLR camera perspective. I’m not a big fan of the behind the shoulder camera as I feel that it eliminates too much of the potential screen and as you can’t run while in camera mode you can’t get away from that perspective. That said the graphics of the game from an overall perspective are as they should be and help immerse the player into the atmospheric horror experience. However, the combat mechanics desperately need working on.\n\nThe actual horror featured within the game is top notch. The jumpscares are well designed and the enemies are a refreshing take on the genre. However, I do have a minor bone to pick with the final boss. I felt that the developers didn’t make it as challenging or as ghastly as what the build up – which began in the original game for those that played it – should have been.\n\nThe game has been Steamified with trading cards and ten achievements. This gives you something to aim for within the overall context of the game.\n\nIt’s not the best horror game that I’ve had the opportunity to play this year but it is far from the worst. In all, DreadOut: Keepers of the Dark is a middle of the road game that will genuinely appeal to lovers of Asian mythology and certainly to those who have played and enjoyed the original. There is much to appreciate here but many important facets of the game will aggravate players as well. It is worth its modest asking price.\n\nFor more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.","May 2","true","3.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/269790/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Dreadout is a third person horror game developed by Digital Happiness and published by PT Digital Semantika Indonesia, which was released on Steam in mid-2014 after successfully being greenlit.\n\nThe game play in Dreadout is almost identical to that of Fatal Frame. You play the role of Linda Meilinda, a young girl who is on a trip with her high school class mates. The game is played in third person. You will be using your characters smart phone and camera to fight the various kinds of ghosts you will encounter – you’ll also use them in a number of puzzles as well.  An interesting element I found in Dreadout is that you don’t actually “die”. When Linda does “die”, you’ll wake up in a dark place surrounded by candles and you run towards the light, typical eh.  When using aiming with your phone, the camera will change to first person and you’ll just be looking through the phone’s screen.\n\nI was really left feeling let down by the graphics in Dreadout. All of the textures are horribly low quality; the polygons can actually be seen visually on most of the models too! Don’t even get me started on the janky animation of some of the characters in the game as well. I was almost on the floor laughing at one of the characters run cycle, it was just horrendous. I was playing the game on 1080p resolution as I was recording, but I tested it out on 4k, it even then still looked poor. Extremely disappointed here as it based on the Unity engine so I would have expected a real high quality looking game.\n\nThere isn’t much to sale about the audio on this either; there is some generic “horror” music in the background that conveniently only turns on when something is about to happen. It is certainly not on the level as say Outlast or Amnesia with their top class sound effects. The voice acting is really awkwardly done as well, I can only assume it has been dubbed over in English because some of the lines really don’t feel natural, and the people who are saying the lines, are clearly not being paid enough, or just don’t want to be there.\n\nDreadout is a fairly difficult game; there is no tutorial level or any sort of in game assistance, you are just left to work it out yourself. Whilst the game play is fairly simple to get to grasps with, the game does not explain how you are supposed to use your in game equipment to aid you; for instance you can use your phone to control candles by holding the viewer over them; something which is used in a puzzle, but there are no clues pointing to that.\n\nAll of Dreadout’s levels are fairly sizeable; each of them has a decent number of Easter eggs and collectable items to find. Some of the collectables even unlock in game bosses for you to deal with for extra achievement points if that is your thing! The collectables are all hidden well across the level and will lead you down some interesting paths to find them. The level design is probably Dreadout’s most redeeming factor.\n\nI finished the game in just over two hours. There are three chapters to the game; the first one is really short and has no real story to it, but the last two contain the bulk of the plot and game play. The majority of people that have played the game don’t even normally play the first chapter since it glosses over most things anyway.  Other than achievement hunting, there is absolutely no reason to play this game more than once; the two hour play time is very short as well.\n\nI didn’t run into any bugs or glitches in the game per say, just the really bad graphics and poor sound effects. It can run at 4k resolutions and multiple graphic options aid you to get the settings just right for your rig. It seems the game did have a few annoying bugs when first released, such as option changes not being saved when quitting the game, but these have all been ironed out as of writing this review.\n\nSadly this isn’t going to come out very favourably from me; yes the game play is OK, but it is fairly slow paced and unoriginal. Graphically this game is appalling and quite frankly, there are so many much better horror games in this genre out there at the moment; I am fully expecting people not to agree with this, given that it already has a “Very Positive” rating on Steam. This is one of the few games to include a demo, so if you are on the fence about picking it up or not, you may as well try the demo first.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7iSFcLKAlKA\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It definitely reminded me of the older horror games, where it wasn't about the weapons and killing things, or about gore and cheap jump scares. Though, I'll admit there are plenty of those here. No, this reminds me of playing Silent Hill 2 or 3, and as many have mentioned where it got it's inspiration from, Fatal Frame. Yes, it's not a very long game, but it's split into two parts, the second of which hasn't been released yet. If you like Asian horror, try this. If that isn't your cup of tea, and you'd rather go in guns blazin'? Probably not your thing. I, however, had so much fun with this. I also respect that Digital Happiness seems to actually pay attention to the forums, instead of blowing off the players.","August 20, 2014","true","14.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Being developed for a year, I believe those value didn't last long in the US. Calculate average salary per month for a programmer, they don't have enough money practically.\n\nTherefore, I try give my not-so-called-objectives review, given those handicap.\n\nGraphics : 7/10\nArguably their main weak point. Although unity engine that being used by them have more capability, they simply didn't have enough manpower to polish the graphic. The character details is just like PS2 or XBOX era. Character animation also is not very "amusing", but playable.\nHowever, despite of the lack details in the character, they put much effort in surrounding details. Much of the details are handcrafted individually. They put effort to give Easter egg for their backer. Look for each poster and note, you'll find out that most of it are handcrafted. But you can feel that they use lighting and shadows to compromise with the lack of character details.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nFor me, this is their main strong point. Remember Fatal Frame? Remember how the atmosphere they built in that? For me, Dreadout is giving the same, if not better, horror atmosphere than Fatal Frame. Try to play it in the middle of the night, with surround speakers and when you're alone ;)\nMaybe this game is rather hard for person that is not a hardcore gamers. This is due to the developer didn't gave much information in-game. You need to figure out by yourself, what you need to do. It's a good point to draw you closer to heroine experience. However, there's a lot of guide out there to guide you out from your frustration :)\nIf you notice, the developer of this game give the opening cut-scene with "Lingsir Wengi" song. For locals like me, this is the song that "told" by many to draw evil spirit came. More than enough to give a goosebumps :(\nThe only minus in gameplay is it only last few hours. You want it more after finished it.\n\nMusic: 9/10\nAnother strong point of this game. The OST is good. Googling the artist list and review the OST, they worth to be downloaded :)\n\nFinal Verdict : 8.5/10\nThey put a good atmosphere to overcame the graphic limitation. And good soundtrack also. Actually, I want to give them 10/10 due to being handicapped in development budget. But, even with that handicap, they deserve a good rating from me :)","May 21, 2014","true","4.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

I just don't find it scary nor worth of my time.\n\nFor people like me, who rather face the enemies, prefer old good survival horror, I think Dreadout is great. Sure it's not finished yet, first act is a bit short, it isn't graphically not plot-wise exactly shining, but it has good atmosphere, devs have put some real thought into enemies and the soundtrack is great. And alternate costumes are always a big plus.\n\nIt isn't expensive, I would say it's worth of the money.

The story itself focused around Linda, the silent protagonist of this game. When a group of highschool students lead by their (yummy milf) teacher on their trip goes wrong turn and suddenly found an empty ghost (silent-hill-lookalike) town that didnt shown in gps.\n\nThe environment itself is eerie, typical of many town in West Java province of Indonesia (well the developer of this game came from Bandung, capital of West Java :P ). The music for this game also minimalist, some may say the graphic is quite dated and the voice talent kinda like reading on their script rather acting. But the story itself is pretty good. As predicted, she was seperated from her group, and she had to find them. Many of the ghost element taken from Indonesian urban legend. Also the opening song believed to be a spell for summoning spirits (if you sing it correctly along with some ritual)\n\nThe game developer said this was Act 1 and Act 2 will be released for free as DLC.","May 17, 2014","true","1.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There is no 'game over' in this game so you can think of as a good point but even so, do not think you can play carelessly. Tactical play will help you most throughout the game.\n\nA very short game for Act 1 so there isn't much to tell about the game itself, there is a no keyboard/mouse/stick configure, a PS2 game graphic, a bit buggy here and there, etc but all within consideration as this game is an indie game with an indie developer that you can not unfairly compare with other indie game developer with lots of staff and more experience.\n\nThis game mechanism is actually pretty much easy to figure but with an awkward and rigid game mechanism to use, you may confuse a little bit. If you already played DreadOut demo before, then you'll probably don't need to read 'How to Play' section. But if you new to this game, I recommend to read 'How to Play' section before you play.\n\nA great atmosphere, the sounds will make you more immerse to the game. A good old 80's Indonesia horror story setting and Asian-Indonesian ghost folklore. Third person perspective game which I like most and very fit with this game. A great choice and placement of music. An annoying and scary ghost battle. A cute cat.^^ DreadOut so far success to represent Asian, particularly Indonesia ghost folklore. Mainly focus on adventure, exploration, item gathering and puzzle solving, DreadOut recommend player to explore and find many secret hidden within abandoned ghost town.\n\nIn the end, DreadOut bring out a fresh air to survival horror game franchise. A game with Asian-Indonesian setting which you rarely see this day. DreadOut have a lot potential to develop and grow which we can all see together. A future Act 2 DLC will come as a free update.

Simplicity combat by spamming on the ghost just dont really give the feel of killing the ghost. They would have done researching on modern smartphones and maybe implement the camera effects like bokeh for slow motion or burst shot for multiple hits or face detection and so on.

I thought Amnesia, Outlast, Zero (Fatal Frame) were scary enough but Dreadout gave me the creeps and goosebumps.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is superb, it doesn't take the visuals too seriously and this is a good thing; the ambience and immersion is amazing, you feel like something will be at the corner, may be there is, or may be not.\n\nThis game is a blend that took elements from horror movies, games, legends and proved itself to be delivered as promised what is supposed to be.\n\nAlthough I am just an hour into the game and I don't think I am able to beat it anytime soon. Due to my progress, I could only make a partial rating due to incompleteness of the game and release.\n\nWith minor bugs and visual glitches, the atmosphere was nicely done and saved it flaws. Dreadout deserves a 9/10 at this moment, I will update this review by making more progress and until 2nd part out.   :)\n\n**Not trying to be offensive, but the billboards, posters and stuff are in Indonesian (not the interface language) and I can't read them!\n\nDid some research, and I think this is a Silent Hill reference:\nWelcome to ---------    (Used Google Translate "Selamat Datang Di") [clip2net.com]\n\nUpdate #01 (2014-05-16 1:48am)\nAfter beating the first boss, I kinda need a break from it. Poor objectives and not obvious level designs are giving me a headache. Died 7 times in the first boss fight, and if you ask me why, I would tell you that the boss fight design was just bad, if he hit you once, you get stunned, takes 2 seconds to bring up the camera, and then you get stunned again, basically if you get git, it's GG.\n\nAnd now my way out of limbo is so far away, I really have to say this games does need a little bit of polishing; a part which could taken me 15 minutes took me over an hour ro complete. Things and objectives are so badly designed in a way that you don't even know what you should do.. And the game even gave me a tip:  Winners don't do drugs.

Writing a review of this game is a bit odd at this juncture for a couple of reasons: One being that DreadOut, at least the Steam version, has only recently made available to the Mac. This new version that was used to write this review so it might have a few kinks yet to work out.\n\nThe second reason why reviewing DreadOut is a bit awkward is that the developer doesn’t really clearly announce the game as an episodic game. In fact, if a player wasn’t expecting it, the way the game currently ends with a lackluster “To be continued” might be a bit like a slap to the face. However, after a bit of digging, there are statements that the game is intended to receive “updates” in a similar fashion to episodic games sometime in the future.  Announcements of this are a bit skimpy on detail however and not really forthcoming enough to prepare player on when to expect anything, including basic patches and DLC releases. What this means that as of the release of this review, this game is fun and playable but by no means 100% complete. As it stands now, the experience only took this reviewer only four hours of play to casually stumble through without making any real effort.\n\nFor those who no nothing about this game, the story centers around a high school girl named Linda who is on some kind of trip with four other classmates and her teacher when they discover that road they took was cut of from a destroyed bridge after a bit of reckless exploring by some of the more rebellious classmates a sort walk leads them of rough terrain to the other side of the bridge and into an abandoned town, then to the abandoned school…and crazy stuff happens leaving Linda alone in the dark with nothing but her cell phone and a bunch of ghosts.\n\nIt’s creepy, yes, but mostly because of the sound design and the fact that Linda’s only real defense is her phone. If one mutes the sound, however the whole game seems a lot less intimidating and a bit sillier, more like the main character is in a haunted house rather than in any real danger. If Linda “dies”, for example, she just runs toward a light in this place called limbo and she wakes up where she fainted.  The ghosts come from Asian inspirations, but again without sound a lot of them seem almost goofy. Linda gets chased by a pig demon or has to take pictures of a creepy ghost with scissors to complete a puzzle, but both of these dangerous beings seem a bit laughable. The only real shocking event seemed to be the unending jump scare that was a whaling undefeatable ghost that would follow the player around while invisible if not viewed through Linda’s phone.\n\nMechanically the game was hot and cold as well. The game seemed to react much slower than the player at times and were a few instances when Linda seemed to be defeated by stun lock (the animations taking any control from the player) more than anything else, but again on the flipside, this was counter balanced by the game’s atmosphere, sound and lighting. It was much easier to accept the any clunkyness in the controls when the player is under the impression that he or she is supposed to be playing as a normal, scared, slightly clumsy teenager, fumbling in the dark by the light of her cell phone. Switching between third and first person camera also adds to the sense of confusion and vulnerability rather than coming across as clunky or slow reacting. Only rarely did the faults in the slow reacting controls make themselves obvious when they encounter a situation where fast reflexes seemed to demand too much from the control scheme.\n\nStill, credit goes to where credit is due. DreadOut was entertaining and the game’s intro was interesting enough to make an audience to wonder what happens next, despite the shortcomings in the games length and content. Will it be worth waiting for? Only time will tell, but it certainly looks to lean toward a positive outcome.The review gave it thumbs up because it was easy to see the potential in DreadOut and what was playable was enjoyable, but how the story, sound and other content will shape up later is still up in the air.","September 7, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One particular Indonesian title that has already gained a solid fanbase thanks to Youtubers like Pewdiepie, Raedwulf Gamer and Yogcast’s Kim; DreadOut developed by Digital Happiness, was discovered sometime early march 2013 where I instantly backed it and eagerly awaited its arrival.\n\nDreadOut draws its influence mainly from various Indonesian folklore and bears a striking resemblance to Tecmo’s borderline legendary Project Zero series (or Fatal Frame for you Americans out there); the tale follows high school girl Linda and a small group of her fellow classmates when on a field trip stumble across an abandoned village which of course they decide to explore their latest find and hilarity ensues, by hilarity I mean nightfall, and death.\n\nThe game follows a very similar formula to Project Zero in that you explore the areas while looking for key items, solving puzzles and fending off against various ghosts and supernatural creatures via your smartphone with camera (which unlike my phone has amazing battery life). Much like in Project Zero, Linda’s camera is key to most of the mechanics of the game including combat and puzzle solving, though interestingly where DreadOut veers off the beaten path is that unlike her Japanese counterparts, Linda cannot naturally see these vengeful spirits. This actually adds a rather interesting depth of gameplay and indeed ups the ante, luckily Linda does react to nearby danger accompanied by a red vignette but until you view through your phone you are effectively blind to your unfriendly apparition.\n\nHowever taking snaps of your enemies feels rather poor compared to Zero, you don’t charge your attack and you simply take snaps when your phone’s screen starts to act up however since the game tells you to look for weak points you can never be sure if you’re actually doing anything until the buggers have left you alone. This is a small gripe admittedly and does not harm the overall game, along with combat the camera is needed for puzzle solving; similar to the ghosts, certain puzzles or hints are not visible to the naked eye. While it hasn’t been incorporated too much in Act 1, how it was implemented was well done and when you finally figured a certain section out made it all the more rewarding.\n\nSadly though my biggest gripe with the game is the quality of the visuals, while Linda and her ghostly pals look very nice, the environments are very outdated for a game that had a demo back in early 2013 the visuals are somewhere or par with mid sixth gen graphics (PS2/Xbox/Gamecube). Textures are rather murky with several signs of very low res images used throughout and certain characters animate very awkwardly.\n\nNow while some complain that the game is rather short (which I somewhat agree with), the game is currently presented in two halves where only Act 1 is currently available with roughly 3 hours for a singular playthrough which will probably require a second run just to grab all collectables and achievements seeing as the game promotes a healthy approach to exploring (seeing as you can miss a fair bit of content if you go too far early on).\nBut considering 3 hours for half a game is pretty standard, so long as Act 2 (which will be given free to anyone who purchases the game) has a similar or longer length DreadOut proves to be a must play for horror fans and if you’re desperate to fulfil your thirst for more DreadOut you can always play the demo which is actually a nicely sized prologue.\n\nPros:\nGreat atmosphere,\nCreative twist of already established game mechanics,\nBalanced gameplay,\nPromotes exploring off the beaten path,\nMorbid Play is in it :P\n\nCons:\nRather average story,\nVisually outdated,\nLittle to no punishment for ‘death’,\nA lot of empty spaces.\n\nWritten by,\nWhistler\n\nEnjoy the review?\nPlease be sure to check out my other reviews at http://morbidplay.com/","May 31, 2014","true","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not to mention that the game glitched in the long hallway and I was forced to re-start the entire game to continue.\n\nI do, in fact, recommend the game and are crossing my fingers that ACT II has the length and the fixes to satify to enough to not regret bying a fifteen dollar game.","May 31, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game itself is very short if you try to rush through the game but if you explore (hint: explore the town when it reaches night time), there's plenty of hidden stuff. The game is really oldschool, you're required to explore and interact with your environment with your camera to solve puzzles.The combat system is similar to fatal frame but much more simplistic. The game has a nice variety of enemies and bosses you either have to fight or run from.\n\nAlso the characters animations are hilarious.","July 1, 2014","true","18.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

This is the closest thing to a new Fatal Frame game that we have got in the past several years since the 4th one came out on the Wii (and never even left Japan). This game may be a lower budget game made by an indie team who are completely unrelated to the developers of Fatal Frame, but these guys obviously have talent and know what they're doing.\n\nIf you need a horror fix and are deciding between this and Daylight, don't waste your time and money on that boring-♥♥♥ Daylight and get this instead. Dreadout is MUCH better than Daylight, and even ranks up there with Outlast and Amnesia in my opinion.\n\nI just hope Digital Happiness finishes the rest of the game soon.

The game is not particularly long clocking anywhere from 2 and a half hours for a completely fresh run to under an hour for someone who knows what they're doing. So the game is short, but is it any good? Well it depends, it's a farley well crafted game, and while it's not going to be breaking any top of the line gaming rig, it doesn't look to bad for an indie game. However as i said it is rather short, and filled with very few enemies. considering it all occures in the confines of a school that's all and all about 2 halways on 2 seperate floors there's not a lot of places to put them but you can actualy finish the game only encountering about 5 actual enemies, 2 of wich are invincible and ether need to be beaten off with a stick/aggresivley photographed or outran and outmanwevered. All that being said if you let yourself get imersed you can find a suitabley creepy experience with a good number of scairs that aren't just enemies jumping out at you from obvious vents ( I'm looking at you Dead space ). If you're looking for a well crafted quick bit of horror go ahead and pick it up, with act 2 coming out as a free update in the near future this might just end up being a worthy sucessor to it's spiritual predecesor Fatal frame.","May 27, 2014","true","4.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is "recipe horror." It follows a structure that will be very familiar to horror game enthusiasts. That certainly isn't a bad thing. The atmosphere is really good. I mean stellar. They nailed the feeling they were going for. The graphics will remind you of your Playstation 2, but in this genre it matters little.\n\nThe enemy character models/animations. Oh. my. god. They are fantastic. Typically with smaller productions like this one, you see corners cut, but not DreadOut. There is one exception: the enemy you end up spending the most time around is probably the least scary. His animations are a little stale. After your first encounter or two, he will lose his horror appeal.\n\nOn the scary meter I give this a solid 7/10. You won't be thinking about this after you finish it, but I jumped out of my seat a few times. I got the game on sale; I would not purchase it for $15 until part two is out. But, if you consider it the price of a movie ticket, you will not be disappointed.\n\nIf I said anything else about the game, I might ruin it for you (part one is not very long), so I'll leave it at that.

Aside from length, everything about this game is great. Even the graphics, which are nothing to scream about, aren't so bad as to detract from the game. The atmosphere for a horror in this is perfect. The music, soundeffects, setting, etc. it all lends to a perfectly unnerving experience.

While playing I wasn't afraid to open doors or look through my viewfinder because I was expecting some cheap thrill.

Although graphic wise it isn't much to compare with other games with huge staff and budget, the mechanics are consistent enough and the dialogue and puzzles are decent.\n\nSince the game mechanics mostly based on Fatal Frame (with a modern twist) it treated the player like a veteran Fatal Frame player, and the game don't hold your hand in anyway (though I recomended reading the How-to-Play at the tittle screen for beginners and veteran player either way)\n\nThe music in most cases are really well done, but a bit awkward in others. The animation of the NPCs are weird and clunky but you won't be bothered with it much since in the first act you won't be spending much time with them.\n\nGhost and Boss fights are well done in a lot of aspects. Some are straightforward big-scary-strong monster and some are one-shot at their weak spot. The game makes you question what strategy you should use at each ghost encounter. If you are defeated by a ghost, don't worry. The game won't punishes you harshly for your mistakes but instead sends you to a limbo stage for you to think what mistakes you have made.\n\nAt first sight, items you encountered may seems useless but if you gathered all of them, the buff, or power up, you get will eventually noticable. So, don't be afraid to explore!\n\nThe game does well to deliver an intense atmosphere once you entered the "Night-Stage" combining music ambience and ghost passing through hallways at moments where you are most restless hearing strange noises.\n\nAlthough the first act was short (about 2-3 hours first playthrough), the second act is being develop to patch as future DLC (which cost absolutely nothing, don't worry)\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for a fresh horror without western influances, and willing to sacrifice next-gen graphic, this is the game for you which only cost 15$. But if you couldn't handle the low-budget looks of the game, I suggest otherwise. But either way, you will be missing out on experiencing a new asian horror if you choose to not play this.","May 21, 2014","true","46.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The only other games I've played that have accomplished that were the Fatal Frame games. Even Silent Hill I find lacking in that regard, yet here is a $15 game that pulls it off spectacularly.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys being made to feel terrified of being alone in the dark. It should do the trick. Just don't go spoiling any of it by watching a walkthrough or anything. Afterall, exploration is the key to any adventure game.","May 17, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Dreadout flaquea un poco en el apartado grafico pero aun asi, los escenarios y la ambientacion son escalofriantes. Hay harto screaming, asi que esten preparados :D (El juego te pide que descanses tras haber jugado por un rato xD)\n\nGameplay:\n\nDefiendete solo con tu celular de espectros y fantasmas antes que sea demasiado tarde. Es recomendable jugar con control de xbox por comodidad y evitar en apretar un hotkey. Solo con tu camara de tu celular puedes ver a los espectros, sin embargo eres vulnerable si te aparecen por atras, asi que toma fotos rápido y ademas utiliza tu entorno como espejos.  Algunos jefes paracen duros de vencer como el peluquero o el postergeist, pero despues de ver sus movimientos sera posible derrotarlos. Un tip, traten de moverse y no quedarse parados enfocando con la camara todo el tiempo.\n\nPor otro lado,  la historia es de una leyenda de indonesia sobre ''la mujer de rojo'', asi que te mantendrá pegado para saber mas. El apartado sonoro es bueno, pero no a la altura de los silent hill o los antiguos resident evils. Pero sumando al entorno grafico, historia y espectros es un buen producto, aunque de poca duracion.\n\nLo malo, el halo que tienes que alcanzar cada vez que revives tras morir. Quizas sea para que tu corazon vuelva a su ritmo normal xD\n\nEn lineas generales, para ser un juego indie, lo pasé muy bien y me dí mis buenos sustos que no lo habia tenido desde que jugué Amnesia the dark descent. Recomendaria este juego a los amantes de los juegos de terror y que aun gustan de los juegos tipo de la vieja escuela, con ritmo mas lento, buscar por algunos items y no ser Chuck Norris repartiendo ostiazos a diestra y siniestra.","July 29, 2015","true","10.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Plays a lot like Fatal Frame except with a more Indonesian setting. Really good monster designs, good pacing, and while I think the scary factor is gonna be hit or miss with some people as it relies on ambience with the occassional jump scare. The good thing is that it does not rely completly on jump scares like some of the other survival horror games out now. I feel as though this is a game that had all the right pieces but at some moments they were not executed at their best. I would like to see an act 3 or a sequel to this game in the future.

It gives a refreshing wind to the horror genre (the lastest horror genre is about alien, monster, mutant, and zombie). Grab it fast if you like horror game that stays true to the actual ghost! A fatal frame reborn game that every fatal frame fans must play!\n\nAbout the game :\n- The graphics itself isn't exteremely awesome. The model playable is good, but for the others isn't as good as the playable character (Linda). The scenery and the building is good enough. And if you're an Indonesian, you will find the texture and model scenery is somewhat amusing and funny.\n- The audio is *DAEBAK*. I'll give it a 9.5/10 for the spooky in game feelings (well, actually the lastest horror game is about audio things that grabs the spooky feelings, LOL)\n- The atmosphere is very good. From the audio and the setting, even in daytime it gives me quite surprise. If you want to know then imagine a town like Silent Hill 1 or 2, it's an abandoned town somewhere in high altitude areas in Indonesia (I believe). In the daytime it's misty and in the night it's (of course) dark.\n- (Lastly) The ghost. Like they discribe in the description, the game is based on Indonesian folklore and tale. So (of course) the ghost are from Indonesia, but they change it a bit, like how come Pocong hold a scythe and it's dragging itself on the ground?? It should be jumping all around.\n\nThe thing I want most from this game :\n- If there is an update of this game, please make an option to choose the audio. Because when i played the demo years ago, the audio is in Indonesia. I want to play the game in Indonesian Audio and the text is in English. (well it's just my selfish reason, LOL)\n\nOverall i will give this game 9/10 for horror genre, and 8/10 for general genre.","May 16, 2014","true","10.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I'll update this probably if the game will be fixed (it won't be. Ever. Forget about it - it's overly incompetent game). Enjoy.\nBought it with my last money, one more day without food gotta be worth it. It doesn't run. THE HORROR.\nOkay, got it working on my other PC hooked up to TV. Buried myself in the couch, turned on gamepad, ran Big Picture. Started the game. Stutters like hell. THE HORROR.\nOkay, quited Big Picture, ran again. Works without stuttering. Looks like PS2 game. Doesn't even have shadows (store page screenshots have them, so gotta be the horror). At least it runs! Yeah! Hop on the couch. Pick up my controller. Turn off the light. Get ready to shiт the couch. Controller support feels like rаpe. THE HORROR. Then the game crashed and took steam with it. Shaт the couch. 10/10 Best horror game ever.\n\np.s.: Now the game supports only x32 Windows (the horror) and Mac/Linux. Plus a dosen of horrific(ly generic) constumes no one cares about. Still no proper controller support. Still the game ditches shadows if ANY setting is changed. Avoid it if you are not playing at work PC at your office.","May 17, 2014","true","8.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/isaiahere/recommended/269790/","isaiahere","isaiahere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/isaiahere/","213 products in account","DreadOut is a decent indie horror game with interesting concepts. Gameplay can be very frustrating at times since objectives are often vague, but once you find what you're looking for, you'll be smacking yourself in the head at how stupid you are for not noticing it earlier. Combat is creative and each enemy is unique, often containing different weaknesses and traits. My biggest gripe is definitely the short length of the game (a single playthrough being around 3-5 hours, possibly more depending on how much you explore). Hopefully, part 2 will make the game more lengthy. Also, there were some really creepy scares in the demo that could have been added to the full game, or at least made similar. I liked the idea of Linda's friends becoming possessed. It really conveys a fear of whether or not you can trust anybody in the game. I'm looking forward to seeing all that this game has to offer in part 2.","May 15, 2014","true","11.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

It's like a mix of Fatal Frame, Silent Hill and Resident Evil, all in one.  It wasn't perfect but was alot of fun to play and I definitely squeezed as many achievements out of it as I could.  Don't know if I'll replay to change the ending yet again by doing the one conversation differently, but I might.\n\nIn short summation, you play as Linda, an Indonesian college student whose field trip runs into an abandon town, haunted school and more.  The story (while not insanely complex) keeps you wanting to go through it.  To be honest as far horror games go, this one wasn't terrifying but just ground you down with a constantly foreboding atmosphere which I really liked.    As mentioned, graphics are somewhat in the ps2 area but the enemies look great (I thought), the vision switches are cool and the scenery isn't THAT bad.  Some character models are a bit awkward but it didn't break the game and the sound design more than made up for any graphic glitches.\n\nFor some odd reason and you can call me a blasphemer, I actually enjoyed battling through this more than the Fatal Frame games.   Yep, I'm stupid but I loved this game because there were a few key scenery switches that kept the journey intersting and a limited number of choices that differed the outcome.  You won't manage too large of inventory, so it's never too difficult to progress though a couple of the puzzles might stump you for a few seconds.  Combat is a little awkward and I died a bunch in a few fights (damn you scissor ghost) and not at all in others (the big, giant awesome looking beastie that throws Pocongs at you).  Despite the fighting not having a frenetic feel to it, you gotta be quick with your camera and keep mobile for some of the opposition.  The enemies, the lore behind them and the enjoyable battles is what made this game a blast for me.  Quite frankly, I thought the boss fights were excellent.\n\nI didn't have too many problems with the controls, but sometimes in combat they will bring you down.  Linda ain't the fastest draw in the East by any stretch of the imagination and sometimes you might get hung up on some scenery and get your butt kicked.  If there is a sequel (which I hope there is), they do need a bit of tightening but for the most part it was solid and in some strange way that awkwardness of control made the boss fights a real threat.\n\nThe story is well-done for the most part although I can't help but feel it could use some sort of fleshing out and deeper explanation.  I guess it makes sense well enough but it can be a bit muddled.  Voice acting ranges from right on the money to Resident Evil 1 cheese, but survival horror nuts are not strangers to this.  Not much else to say here...it's a flawed game but a very fun one!  I'll break this review down before writing you all another essay (oops, too late, already did!).   Oh yeah, okay, one more thing.  The idea of dying, ending up in limbo and running your way out is good on paper but HORRIBLY executed in the game and a major drag especially during the tougher parts.  Make sure you explore and grab a few of the collectibles that shorten this time.  I did and it made things not quite as bad, but it'll still get you yelling at the computer.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great atmospheric horror (not scary but it wears on ya)\n-Combat can be awkward but is alot of fun, kind of like the underrated Cursed Mountain\n-Interesting story that makes you want to press onward\n-Good mixture of exploration, battles and puzzle solving (feels well-balanced)\n-Reminds of old classic survival horror and some parts are really challenging\n-Very cool monsters and way entertaining boss battles.\n-Excellent sound design (music, atmospheric cues, etc.)\n-Some cool unlockables and achievements\n\nCons:\n-Graphics aren't bad.  Beautiful in some places, stale/dingy in others.\n-Interesting story but payoff doesn't quite satisfy\n-Voice acting is hit or miss\n-Sometimes controls will get you in trouble\n-Running to the light after death is a pain in the a**...like, to the point of detriment and not really wanting to play the game anymore...but somehow the game is fun enough and you'll be like sh*t I"m comin' back!\n\nOverall rating:  7.8/10","September 17, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But the atmosphere is amazing, and that definitely makes up for it.\nThis game should be played in a dark room, preferably with a set of headphones on.\nThe atmosphere, the strange creatures and it's creepiness is great all the way through.\n\nThe story is kinda like Silent Hill.\nYou follow a schoolgirl and a few friends and a teacher. On the road they suddenly stomp into a broken bridge. The bridge has never been there before. They start searching around to see if they can get through somehow. They find and search an old school to see if they can find any help with directions, since they seem lost (I guess). Of cause it ends with everyone getting seperated, You are playing the role as Linda in search of her friends.\n\nThe voice acting is good, the animation however is kinda clunky and the story is fairly mediocore, though with a great twist at the end. The monsters are creative and scary.\n\nGameplay was for me a little hard to get used to - I tried starting out with a controller, but after a while, felt mouse and keyboard was the better choice for this game. The game mechanics are quiet simple, you run and walk most of the time looking for clues, and once in a while you have to fight monsters. You fight the monsters by taking pictures of them with a smartphone camera and later on a SLR Camera. Taking their pictures makes the monsters go away.\n\nAt times it can be a little hard to know where to go and what to do (mostly in act 1, school area), but it's possible to figure out.\n\nFor people who can look past DreadOuts rough edges, bugs and glitches - I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who's a fan of horror games. The sheer horror of facing these weird monsters, trying to find you friends and get out is great. Again, the atmosphere is amazing and is the selling point of this game.","July 25, 2015","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Polterpneuma/recommended/269790/","Polterpneuma","Polterpneuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Polterpneuma/","906 products in account","After playing this game for a total of twelve hours from large amount of exploration through ghost-hunting, achievement-hunting, decal-hunting, and document-hunting, I realize that there is much more to be said about this game. Hence, I have decided to delete my previous review of the game and rewrite the whole thing.\n\nI first got wind of the game by chance whilst looking through pages worth of games in greenlight district (pun intended), with the some games looking absolutely dreadful... until I saw DreadOut. Upon looking through the page, my first reaction was, "Yes, please!" to which, I subsequently found out about their IndieGoGo campaign, and threw my hard-earned cash at them.\n\nIt has been a very long time since anyone used the classic horror formula of the highly praised Fatal Frame franchise. All we have been getting in the recent years are just a bunch of sad excuses for a horror game like Outlast, throwing bags of train tickets at people to Jump Scare Central. Look, I know that Outlast is highly praised by many that probably get a raging hard on whenever they hear the game's name, but the game does not create any sense of agency for me, to which, I will talk about it in the future.\n\nDreadOut by no means is a perfect game; the game is severely flawed in many different aspects because of its low budget, and one of the first actual PC games being released in Indonesia (as I was told by the developers that companies tend to lean more towards creating applications for mobile phones instead), and because of these two factors, I have cut this game more slacks than the chefs cut New York Strips in an American steak house.\n\nTo begin with, the English voice acting is believable, albeit somewhat cheesey. I genuinely felt entertained even after listening to them for the eleventh time. Despite the short and scarce dialogues, I could hear the different personality and manner of speaking in all of the character, though I just hope that I could spend a little more time to get to know them better, as spending so little time with them made them feel more like a bunch of talking paper dolls rather than your friends.\n\nThough admittedly, the characters are pretty nicely designed.\n\nSpeaking of looks, though, I have never been much for graphics. Sure, if a game looks photorealistic, it is definitely a plus, but I have never made it an absolute requirement, much unlike many of the graphic hounds that demand everything look like, if not better than, Battlefield 4, regardless of the game's budget and country of origin. The graphics overall are fine, with some noticeable resolution differences between the environment and the characters, though I suppose it is understandable, as most people are too busy staring at Linda's butt, rather than looking closely to the environment's decals.\n\nOne thing I absolutely loved about the environment are the decals. I explored the whole game, from edge to edge, just to find all the little references and names on posters, books, and pictures, scattered all over the game. This is also the one thing I keep on hearing people compliment the game about. It was not the whole "super elite ultimate graphics of doom" that mattered, but rather the little bits and pieces the game the developers have carefully placed inside. Unless it is a pile of trash on the ground, those decorations rarely repeat itself, making it that much more interesting to stare at walls for several hours. Think about it, they actually made staring at walls and floors interesting!\n\nOn one occasion, I even found my own name as the title of a book, which left a great big smile on my cheeks.\n\nThe best part the game has to offer, in my personal opinion, has to be the diversity and lores of enemies, the music, and the atmosphere (to which the music greatly contributes to). I have always thought what it would be like to have eastern superstition and mythology transcribed into a game, and DigitalHappiness answered my questions in the first ten minutes I stepped into the school. All of the western horror games consists of zombies, ghouls, and ghosts, and over time, they can become very dull, like the declining fear factors zombies have to people now. Rather than sending me running upstairs and diving into my bed sheets like what Resident Evil 2 can still do to me, zombies are now more of a plaything for violent acts. The inclusion of oriental beliefs made the once dull experience brand new again, like smelling a fresh burp after chugging down twenty mints. You also rarely deal with the same enemies again in the game. If I were to include the demonstration into the mix, the maximum instance of a ghost appearing in summation is four, two of which, showed different behaviours and wielded different weapons.\n\nNow, I have just about exhausted the good side, now we must take a look at the bad part. The definite downside for me has to be the Scissor Phantom boss fight, and how illogical and ambiguous puzzles can be.\n\nWe all know about the dreaded boss fight that made so many of us slam something accross our room (preferrably not the keyboard/controller) after bashing our head against it for a few times. If I were to describe what the boss fight was like, I would say it looks like the result of Nicolas Cage snorting a pound of coke in Wicker Man and then proceeds to smack everyone's head as he runs around shouting, "Not the bees!" The boss fight is (or at least was) a complete deathwish, and could take some five retries before you get the gist of it, and another five to luck out on the Scissor Phantom not spawning right on top of you. This also made the YOLO achievement as difficult to get as a solid brick of gold.\n\nI never really got what the meaning and purpose of the puzzle was until the result is about to be shown, namely the picture of a small key after finding the group of hanging shadows that decided they wanted a group selfie, and the hanging scissors in the secret room with the scissor phantom, who turns out to be the closet cross-dressing principal of the school. You have to come out of the closet sooner or later, Mr. Principal.\n\nFinally, there are a few points I would like to make for the new update before closing in the review.\n\nThe Indonesian voice, despite the fact that I do not understand the language a single bit, sounded pretty good to my foreign ears. However, there are three things I have noticed. First, the movie clip in the very start with the DreadOut title showing up, you can hear Shelly speaking in English in the background. Secondly, I do not know whether there is an equivalent for the line, "We clicked right away, didn't we?" in Indonesian, but the part felt very odd due to the obvious seperation between Ira's movements and her dialogue. Lastly, both Shelly and Ira speak like they have their mouth only a few millimetres away from your ear. I am unsure how the voice actresses' voice was recorded, but the way they sounded just felt off. Miss Siska, Doni, and Yayan on the other hand, sounded quite fine.\n\nLastly, this point may be addressed already, but I can see the foliage floating about in the fog as I walked towards the town.\n\nI had a great time playing DreadOut despite some of the frustration it has brought me, but unlike the frustration I Am Alive brought me, I kept on coming back for more, and made me want to explore and find everything I could. This is one of those rough gems that has the potential of brining the horror genre back on its feet to where it once was, and perhaps explore further into territory unknownst to us. If you prefer defacating your pants through jump scares and chase scenes, this will not be a game for you, but if you like to soil your pants your way through atmosphere, buy it.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you like to douse yourself in adrenaline through jump scares and gore, do not play this; if you do not care as much, buy it.","August 21, 2014","true","17.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Loading...I don't really sure what's happening in the script, but when I saw that silly loading bar, my head spinning "what kind of graphic quality this game offers? Why the loading speed is kinda slow? Will this game offers better graphic quality than 3D games such as Tomb Raider: Underworld (2008)?" and other silly questions because of that silly loading bar.\n\nOne thing I learned from this issue is that your team were preparing the entire scene at once than using dynamic approach CMIIW, I hope when you guys will do more performance benchmark when making the next act.\n\nI believe this issue is critical, because majority of user base in Indonesia doesn't have best PC available on the market, and if you trully care about your Indonesian fans, you should mark this one as critical.\n\n[h2]2. Performance[/h2]\nPerhaps this is Unity3D's fault, or god forbid, any other thing that causing this issue.\n\nIn main menu, memory footprint on task manager shows average of 800MB for DreadOut, not far from any other app if they are running on my rig, it's absolutely normal.\nBut, in the first 15 minutes of playing, I looked at the memory footprint once again, it shows average of 2048MB, this is something I can't accept. (I'm sorry for my engineer-specific judgement :p)\n\nI proceed with another benchmark, I decided to use Fraps to capture DreadOut's max, min, and average FPS.\n\nHere's the result:\nFirst try:\nFrame size: 1440x900\nTotal Frames: 5237\nTime (ms): 85907\nMin: 0\nMax: 101\nAvg: 60.961\n\nSecond try:\nFrame size: 1440x900\nTotal Frames: 5349\nTime (ms): 90625\nMin: 40\nMax: 80\nAvg: 59.023\n\nThe FPS benchmark result were pretty good though, but when memory footprint comes to judge I can't say much.\n\n--------------\n\nThat's all I can say for now.\nOverall I love this game, the story, the gameplay (even though sometimes silly responses appears, like that scissor thing), and of course, LINDA!\nI can't say much about those departments :p\n\nI'll update this after the second act released.\n\nCheers!\nAkafuri Studio[akafuri.com]\nat\nWamplo Indonesia[wamplo.com]","May 25, 2014","true","7.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/recommended/269790/","preludebot","PreludeBot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/","197 products in account","It says I only have 1 hour of gameplay, that is incorrect. I have at least 50 hours into this game and I completed it.\n\nDreadOut is a good horror game with solid action, decent story, and difficult&simple puzzles. Common questions that everyone asks is "Is this game good?" and "Is this game really scary?" Let me answer these questions for you.\n\nIs this game good? Simple answer: Yes. It has everything I expect from a horror title. The atmosphere is dark and gritty, the story has solemn undertones, there is lore that you unlock and can read from your journal, and the music fits this title perfectly. The music really made me feel like I was somewhere terrible and I needed to get out immediately. The controls are also responsive and simple. If you can allow yourself to immerse into the story, it's a very enjoyable experience. There are also three endings and different costumes for Linda. The costumes are unlocked when you complete the game once and are accesible from the rear of the van at the start of Act 1 (Not Act 0). Giving it some decent replayability.\n\nIs this game really scary? No, the game overall is not that scary. Reason being, your smart phone doesn't run out of batteries. This is a constant sense of security in itself. Secondly, you can take unlimited pictures without worrying of running out of film... Remember dying in Fatal Frame because you ran out of film? Yeah, that will never happen here. HOWEVER, if you want to expand upon this and ask if the ghosts themselves are scary then my answer is yes. The ghosts are very scary, the sounds they make, the movements they make is all very creepy and unsettling. But again, most of the ghosts are easily dispatched save for the bosses and a few tricky ghosts.\n\nAll that aside, there's a lot in this game if one takes the time to look for it. I found many hidden things in this game that I really appreciated like UFOs in the sky, hidden ghosts, and other small recognizable details. These things won't break immersion because they're extremely difficult to spot. The puzzles are questionable in places, I found some puzzles clear and easy to solve but some puzzles were unclear. Example: I spent many hours running around a school looking for a solution to one puzzle. The solution was an object I ran past several dozen times.\n\nThat is really the only time I can think of where a puzzle was unclear. The rest are simple.\n\nGhosts have some strategy to them. For example, some ghosts take more damage when aiming for their head. Also, some ghosts are invicible unless you hit a certain part of their body. Bosses are tricky and can kill Linda very quickly if the player is unprepared. Ghosts will disappear into walls... So if you're in a tight hallway and you encounter a ghost, it's best to run up and down the hallway. There is a lot of dodging in this game, it's not always as simple as standing and snapping pictures. And each ghost has their own fighting style. That alone kept me playing.\n\nThe only real negative I can give this game is they removed high resolution textures during a 32-bit patch. The developers plan to release a patch to fix this.\n\nPros:Good story, chilling and foreboding at times but that's horror for you.\nResponsive and simple controls.\nA good variety of scary ghosts with different tactics involved.\nHidden eastereggs.\nExtra unlockable costumes for Linda.\nGood sound track and sound effects.\nLots of lore to dig into if you take the time to read it.\nThree possible endings.\nBosses can be challenging and fun.\nGood voice acting.\nCons:The puzzle in the school can be unclear without a guide.\nSmart phone never runs out of batteries.\nNo high resolution textures (yet).\nSome ghosts are invincible for plot importance.\nNeutral:You may die a few times attemping to find a way to kill a ghost.\nIt can be easy to miss some things without pointing smart phone at it. (depends how thorough you are or how quick you can react)\nGhosts will disappear into walls.\nSome symbolism and meanings in lore can be difficult to follow because it's taken from Indonesian myths.\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. The cons, imo, are minor and are outweighed by the pros. Some aspects reminded me of Fatal Frame, Silent Hill, and even The Grudge (which is a horror movie I quite enjoyed.) I recommend buying it at sale price, it goes on sale often.\n\nP.S. In Act 1, instead of going into the haunted town, you can turn around and run back down the road. Run and be free!","December 11, 2015","true","3.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The final straw was during one of the first bosses you encounter.  Something about the camera angles and the controls made it really difficult to make any progress through that 'battle'.\nOtherwise the story itself is very interesting and could have been better if it was more smoothly played out and intuitive.   The little extra bits of information about ghosts that you can collect were also pretty cool.  The gameplay just absolutely killed the game for me.","November 24, 2015","false","4.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I'm not sure exactly WHY I wanted to, but I gave it multiple chances, tried to see some of its flaws as charm and just all around did what I could with it.  Ultimately though, it just couldn't keep my attention.\n\nIts positives are an interesting array of supernatural beasties drawing from Indonesian lore.  The game can be genuinely creepy at time.  It does a good job of capturing the horror feeling.\n\nThe flaws all lie in execution.  The graphics are largely a blurry, low resolution mess.  Linda's model is okay although the screen shots on the store page are carefully selected to make the game look its best.  In reality, the game looks like a product for the Playstation 2.  Your fellow classmates look laughable.  The game's pacing feels off and you spend too long just trotting around.  But the worst felt like the controls which often had me over steer or snagged me during fights.  Some battles require you to quickly move around and it just wasn't reacting well.  Compounding this was a death system where each time you die, you have to run back out from limbo, jogging along a blue strip of light.  Unfortunately, each time you die that strip grows longer and it's frustrating to not only feel like you died a cheap death but to now be expected to just jog for 90 seconds before you can play again.\n\nGiven better controls and a less punitive system for dying, I might have felt like completing this and been able to enjoy it for what it is.  But after my last jog back from the underworld, the game just felt like a waste of time.","July 10, 2015","false","6.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

For a genre of survival horror that saw some mild success in the early days of the PS2 with Fatal Frame and its subsequent sequel - DreadOut uses pretty much the same construct as the Fatal Frame series to mount its less than compelling narrative as we assume the role of a young girl named Linda who happens upon an abandoned ghost town while out on a field trip with some of her class mates. As you might have guessed it - things go decidedly wrong the moment the school children enter the abandoned school located at the heart of this once prosperous town.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470509723\nArmed with only a cellphone, the only modern update to Fatal Frames woozy game mechanics, this device ends up shouldering the brunt of most of DreadOut's dull gameplay with the exception that you can't actually use it to to call for help like any normal sane person would. We saw the cellphone device get used in two other horror releases from last year namely the excellent Outlast and the not so great Daylight but with DreadOut it's staring to feel like a terrible cliché. Not only can the device be used as a light source but it's also used to vanquish menacing spirits that wonder throughout the town by simply aiming the camera at the ghost and taking snapshots of it. Some ghosts require that you snapshot their weak spots in order to rid yourself of them. The device is also used to solve various puzzles throughout the game world as visual indicators such as a blue or grey bordered hue envelope the screen alerting the player to raise the cellphone camera yet again to note a particular visual clue.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470510362\nThe game is no looker, considering that it got by on probably a fifth of the budget such as other indies in this genre, with low resolution textures everywhere despite selecting high resolution in the setup menu. While the bad texture work is somewhat disappointing it ends up being rather reminiscent of the original series DreadOut is trying to emulate. Digital Happiness are at least creative with the ghosts and spirits - most of which come straight from Indonesian folklore and are freaky and bizarre but they are still not enough to maintain an interest in the game despite its incredibly short length since most of the time you will spend wandering around wondering what exactly to do next since DreadOut is not very good at telling you what your next objective is.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470511174\nWhere the game completely falls flat is that many of the button prompts used to pick up things lying around on the floor fail to reflect on the screen and none of the objects you are required to pick up actually stand out from the background so they pretty much look as though they are part of the scenery and can be easily missed. At one stage I was simply just running around pressing the "A" button in the hopes of picking up stuff I might have missed and in most cases this actually resulted in me collecting items I needed to progress the story along. Also the game boss battles, particualry the boss with a pair of scissors, is an exercise in pure an utter frustration. This boss appears and reappears around the room once you have managed to get a shot of it with the camera but it often moves so fast that it requires pixel perfection to to capture shots of. To add insult to injury when the boss hits your character she becomes locked in a stun-lock animation where you lose control over the her yet the boss can still do damage to you and nine times out of ten ends up killing you while you are stunned. There were times during this fight that I wanted to simply just delete the game from my hard drive and be done with. It's and exceptionally badly designed encounter. Not that the final boss fight is any better and will require patience and more than a bit of luck to defeat.\n\nDreadOut will require a certain amount of stamina to see through to the end, despite its short length, and plagued by a minuscule budget and some wonky game design is never able to elevate itself outside of being recommended to die hard fans of this type of surival horror only or those looking at it from a heavily discounted angle.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 27, 2015","false","4.5"," 80 of 157 people (51%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","51","80","157","13","13"

Act 1 was ok, and I was looking forward to act 2. What I wasnt looking forward to was how utterly superior the second Act would end up being.\n\nI thought at first there would be more than 2 acts, and that the story probebly would have dragged on. But no, instead I got an amazingly beautiful work of macabre that shows some seriously strong cinematic and gameplay ideas.\n\nThis game is ♥♥♥♥ed up, and I love that. I think that the release of Act 2 showed to me that this developer is several leagues above what their innitial release demostrated.\n\n","April 8, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dreadout reminds me allot of the original Silent Hill on the PS1 with the constant use of darkly-lit tightly spaced hall-ways and corridors but then again you could say that about most supernatural horror games.\n\nThe main protagonist is a high school student called Linda her and a bunch of high schooler's and a teacher called "Miss Siska" managed stumble across a ghost town in the middle of nowhere when they stray from there school trip. It doesn't take long before Linda is left alone and her colleague go missing or get possessed.\n\nLinda's only defense and weapon in the game is "Smartphone" and "SLR Camera" which you will use to take snap-shots of the many (ghosts, demons and spirits) they seem to be very camera shy.\n\n\n\nThe game strengths:\n\nThe ghosts and and demon's really brings out the fear and dread in someone and it really is a great fright-fest of a game. I was  jumping out my skin everytime unspected ghosts or demon was creaping up on me and screaming when I was caught of guard, anything can happen because of this you will feel on edge.\n\nThe execution again of the (ghosts and demons) was brilliantly done, I got the feeling I was in a film like the "The Ring" or "The Grudge" hell even "Poltergeist"\n\nI really enjoyed the eerie music too, it really set the tone perfectly really brought you into the horror ghost story and the atmosphere was also brilliant , I was second guessing if you saw something up ahead or not if something was a ghost or just part of the funtiture.\n\n\n\nGraphics and Controls\n\nThe graphic's are pretty mediocre at best, and the control's seem ok but could of been implemented better like the "analogue stick" and the "D-PAD" (Ditgital Happiness); said this game is recommended for use with the (steam-controller) but I would think most people would probably be using (360 controller instead) like myself, it would of been nice the 360 scheme was implemented better so it would be easier to navigate the note book and the gallery.\n\nFrustrated moments playing Dread-out\n\nThe game at times especially for act one; I came across section where "locker-key" would not show-up nor could I take photo of certain picture puzzle's in the main hall which was annoying experience for me. I would be snapping away and nothing would happen when it was meant to! Not sure if this was general bug in the game or if it was poorly implemented,\n\n\n\nI had to restart the game to fix a bug! :(\n\nI feel bad for doing this because you should never have to restart a game due to a glitch.  anyway on my second play-through I managed to get the key and take the photo that was needed but it turn's out getting the locker-key I need to do the tasks in certain order because only then it appeared when it should of been there in the first place, well not entirely sure on this but that's what it felt like.\n\n\n\nOther Game bugs and glitches\n\nAnother issue I had is with the 3 candles on the demo section it's never made clear what you need to do, I know games should be made to have fun and to be able to figure things out for yourself but this game pushed me to the point where everything is guess-work and more trial and error and allot of the time's I actually stumped on what to do!!! Especially when it came to figuring out the 3 candles. There I was thinking to myself after wondering around the same area for at-least hour. I think it's time to use YouTube to solve the problem.\n\nI find into today's gaming scene that having to youtube an area is very bad thing for a gamer to do and if this happens more than enough times, then you need to address something that is actually game breaking for the user who is playing it.\n\nI thought over-all there was lack of "Clue's or Hints" in order to help move forward in the game and what to do next but only when it came to the picture puzzles, at times it was more random guess than actually thought, went into solving the clues this was certainly noticeable on act 2 with the (Giant Indonesian hottie - section). I found myself in frustrating problems where I had no idea what to do eventually I had to YouTube that area again to find out how to progress. It turns out I needed to use the "SLR Camera" on the grass where the cat should show but the only problem is.... the cat never showed on my run I could only see the cat from a distance.\n\nFinal wrap up and score\n\nI give this game a solid 8/10 the game might have flaws but it feels unique and I am fan of obscure games and specially horror and survival games.

( It's a little bit like the Fatal Frame series. )  Being a young girl with no weapons or crazy abilities adds to the deapth of the game, it gives you a sense of helplessness and adds to the tension when your alone in dark corridors with only the phone for light.  The characters controls are slow and clunky adding to the atmosphere as you find it very hard to run away.  The Game also has some great designs with regards to the enemies, I have never played a game where you encounter giant ghost pigs before!  There are a good number of puzzles that can seem confusing at first because the journal gives you very little objective based hints.  They have created a great suspense element with the game too as there isn't an anemy in every room, yet you still find yourself holding your smartphone before entering rooms in case there is anything lingering in the dark areas.  Oh and the Dramatic music changes can put you on edge and keep you looking over your shoulder for a while before finishing your current objective.\n\nFor me this game is a 10/10 as it combines all the good elements of the old school Horror game.  If your into the Fatal Frame and Silent Hill games then this is a must have game for you.  I would advise playing in the dark, alone with a headset on to get the most out of the Helpless feeling the game gives you.\n\n\n","May 19, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a true, non-bull horror game that made me excited for more. I'm glad to say that The full game was not a waste of time. BUT do i think it's a good game in it's whole? it's mixed. I don't find the game scary, but that's subjective. What you find scary will be completely different from what i find to be. That being said, DreadOut does a great job of building an atmosphere that sticks to you, makes you ask question and unsettles. It's story is a little generic, but handled appropriately, keeping it short. If you liked Fatal Frame, you'll enjoy how this game plays, it borrows a lot from that series, with a few additions as well. Visually the game is a mixed bag. It's lighting, monster design and environments are probably it's standout features, but on the technical side the game is a little short. A lot of bugs and glitches tend to dampen the atmosphere and get in the way, but they did not ruin the game for me. Also worth a mention is how short this game is. Act 1 clocks in at about an hour, and Act 2 can be 2-3, so buyer beware if you want to get your moneys worth.\n\nPersonally i liked it, i had a good time with this, and if you dont mind a game that's buggy or short, i'd suggest taking a peek","February 16, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The environmental artstyle during the daytime lacks polish according to what I expect from today's games, but it works.  With this game, it could have two modes.  The traditional "survival horror" mode, and then a story mode where the boss fights require less camera shots.  As it stands, I find the boss fights extremely challenging due to what seems to be a lack of responsiveness from raising the camera to take a picture.  I'm quite stuck at the scissors boss due to the lack of responsiveness of this.  It feels like I must stop, wait a fractional amount of time, then raise the camera, then take the picture, and by then ... it's pointless.  If you've played Resident Evil 4, then you'll understand when I say this boss fight reminds me of the blade armed cage fight in the castle, except no gun, and no where near as frustrating.  Difficulty settings could deal with how many photos you must take of a given monster, or if the camera targetting challenge is on or off.  Even with the downfalls of it, I like the idea, so I'll give it a thumbs up.  Just don't think I'll be playing it much unless I feel like really frustrating myself.","June 12, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thought it was amazing for numerous reasons. The game itself looked good and promising. I'm a huge fan of spooky games, and I love the lore and mythology behind spirits and cameras.\n\nHonestly, I'm not the best at writing reviews, but I really enjoyed this game I feel it deserves every word I can muster.\nI'll start with an analysis and breakdown, then finish with a pros/cons list.\n\nACT 0 Starts off you off in a bamboo hut  with your trusty Android Cellphone. Pretty sure it's a Razr Maxx, but I could be wrong. Upon picking up the phone you receive a call from your Friend Ira. She sounds distressed and the call starts to glitch out when you suddenly see your first ghost! Upon leaving the hut you walk around and come across a house with your friend Ira Inside and insanity starts to ensue. She eventually tells you that she is unable to leave and only you can get out. She gives you a key to leave the house and  you end up in a tombestone slewn marsh with what appears to be a giant body in rages hanging in a cave. After solving the puzzle nearby, you are thrown into the Intro screen and into Act I as well\n\nACT I starts off in a car with your friends Doni, Shelly, YanYan, Ira and the teacher Ms Siska. You end up at a broken bridge and walk your way to the other side only to find the entire town deserted. As you continue walking, leaving your friends behind you come across a school and the rest of your friends magically catch up. Linda (the Protaganist) and Ira sit on a bench as Ira begins to talk about their friendship and reveal the story a bit. Doni, Shelly, YanYan,  and Ms Siska roam the school As you guys talk, and a great deal of time passes until it's night time. Everybody comes out but YanYan and if you haven't guessed already Linda goes to try and find him and more insanity ensues in the school. I don't want to spoil the chapter too much, but lets just say you come across a Giant Pig who's Really friendly, Some hookers, and a very interesting Hallway guard.\n\nACT II After leaving the school you wind up in the village and come across some little gremlins who steal your phone and bag. You start to chase after them until you run into Doni, who is really surprised to see you. He was so scared and lonely he really needed a hug, so he chased you for a little bit until giving up. After losing him you find a DSR camera that enables you to use it's Flash to stun certain enemies and illuminate the area much better then before with your phone. You quickly kill the gremlin and retreive your belongings only to find a lovely cult who gets very upset if you extinguish their candles. In fact, the Giant lady in the sky will have a very stern talk with you afterwards, but you simply cannot continue the game unless you put out their candles. After dealing with PMSing God Lady, you run into your friend Shelly and Siska, who is badly wounded. After getting Siska some rest, she tells you about Ira who is acting strange. You go to find her and Ira asks you to follow her and this is when the game really pops off, as there are two seperate endings depending how you handle the dialogue portion that follows. After talking to Ira, she gives you a key to go see her "sisters" in the mansion and escape, after finding out that you have to first regret ever coming to that place before escaping. More insanity ensues, you see a lady in red with pretty teeth, The Poltergeist doesn't like the dinner party they threw, and an eyeball with teeth talks in tongues.\n\nWhew, still with me after all that?

Both endings.\n-*Not the best at explaining the story and ending. You kind of have to piece it together yourself or search google.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naturesretard/recommended/269790/","Naturesretard","MikMik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naturesretard/","99 products in account","Saw this game last year, probably when it came out. Thought it was amazing for numerous reasons. The game itself looked good and promising. I'm a huge fan of spooky games, and I love the lore and mythology behind spirits and cameras.\n\nHonestly, I'm not the best at writing reviews, but I really enjoyed this game I feel it deserves every word I can muster.\nI'll start with an analysis and breakdown, then finish with a pros/cons list.\n\nACT 0 Starts off you off in a bamboo hut  with your trusty Android Cellphone. Pretty sure it's a Razr Maxx, but I could be wrong. Upon picking up the phone you receive a call from your Friend Ira. She sounds distressed and the call starts to glitch out when you suddenly see your first ghost! Upon leaving the hut you walk around and come across a house with your friend Ira Inside and insanity starts to ensue. She eventually tells you that she is unable to leave and only you can get out. She gives you a key to leave the house and  you end up in a tombestone slewn marsh with what appears to be a giant body in rages hanging in a cave. After solving the puzzle nearby, you are thrown into the Intro screen and into Act I as well\n\nACT I starts off in a car with your friends Doni, Shelly, YanYan, Ira and the teacher Ms Siska. You end up at a broken bridge and walk your way to the other side only to find the entire town deserted. As you continue walking, leaving your friends behind you come across a school and the rest of your friends magically catch up. Linda (the Protaganist) and Ira sit on a bench as Ira begins to talk about their friendship and reveal the story a bit. Doni, Shelly, YanYan,  and Ms Siska roam the school As you guys talk, and a great deal of time passes until it's night time. Everybody comes out but YanYan and if you haven't guessed already Linda goes to try and find him and more insanity ensues in the school. I don't want to spoil the chapter too much, but lets just say you come across a Giant Pig who's Really friendly, Some hookers, and a very interesting Hallway guard.\n\nACT II After leaving the school you wind up in the village and come across some little gremlins who steal your phone and bag. You start to chase after them until you run into Doni, who is really surprised to see you. He was so scared and lonely he really needed a hug, so he chased you for a little bit until giving up. After losing him you find a DSR camera that enables you to use it's Flash to stun certain enemies and illuminate the area much better then before with your phone. You quickly kill the gremlin and retreive your belongings only to find a lovely cult who gets very upset if you extinguish their candles. In fact, the Giant lady in the sky will have a very stern talk with you afterwards, but you simply cannot continue the game unless you put out their candles. After dealing with PMSing God Lady, you run into your friend Shelly and Siska, who is badly wounded. After getting Siska some rest, she tells you about Ira who is acting strange.

While the game lacks the depth of those games it has a surprising amount of variety in the puzzles and enemy encounters.  While all enemies can be defeated with the camera it is a mini-puzzle figuring out exactly how to do so.  There are some real creepy scenes, some jump scares, and some very interesting game direction and set-piece moments.  While it is not a AAA title by far it is definitely worth a play-through by fans of the genre.","July 11, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the ghosts you fight are boss ghosts with their own puzzles as to how you beat them, and so not only was it fun to solve each ghost fight, it never felt repetitve. And some ghosts were really hard, and some were just designed to kill you whether you liked it or not, and it makes you feel helpless and afraid. And I really liked how you get further and further away from the light in limbo each time you die. It felt ominous like I only had a few reborns left before I'd perish for good. The game is dark and hard to see like it should be in a horror game. And it was pretty long too. I hope this game gets to make it to PS4 too just because my PC can't push 60fps with this game.

The emphasis is on ghosts. It's set in Indonesia and uses Indonesian folklore for the story, which helps set it apart. It has great atmosphere and is certainly spooky. However, it's a little short and the graphics are weak. That said, it is a $15 game and you can grab it for $5 on sale.

And I do like it. I really do. It does a great job of producing a legitimately creepy atmosphere. The characters are good, and the visuals are great. The "monsters" are creepy, but not so otherworldly as to make you go "oh, ha-ha. Tentacle monster. Meh."\n\nThere are serious problems, though, and I don't mean from a technical standpoint. To go over it without giving away anything:\n\nYour one weapons, such as it is, is more difficult to use than it should be.\nThe hit detection for the enemies is spot on. For my one defense? Not so much. I once used it three times on one enemy (admittedly a boss) to no effect. That's not cool.\nThe reasoning for the weapon's value and for why you can do what you can do is not well established, especially early on.\nThere's an In Media Res intro section that should juts plain not be there. It's got spoilers, and it serves no purpose. Basically, you get thrown into stuff, plot points are spoiled, and then you get taken to the actual start of the game and the story. There's no point to it, and it actually detracts from the atmosphere and suspense building the rest of the game is really good at.\n\nI recommend it, but the developers should work on the issues.","May 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not having access to a console (other than the wii for Mario games and excercise) and admiring others videos of Fatal Frame, dreaming of a port one day, this was an excellent & not too expensive replacement! With the same idea behind it, namely photographing ghosts as a means to fight them, having you confront them by looking at them rather than running away to the next checkpoint, or having the scary factor decrease by shooting physical monsters with guns. This Indonesia horror game delivers the atmosphere and scares. Although all the horror clichés are here; characters running away getting lost for the story to progress as we have to find them, getting mysteriously hindered in progress until we solve something/kill someone, creepy sounds, jumpscares etc, I found myself wanting to play the thing over again for all the achievements and secrets right as I finished it.\n\nThis isn't a game for people who are bound by graphics though, because it is not a triple A title, and nor does it have to be. The scariest game I ever played was a completely free Half Life 1 mod: Cry of Fear. But for some, graphics are a must, and they can look elsewhere, or pretend they traveled back in time a few years perhaps.\nI am not put off by "poor" graphics, and so I can enjoy this to it's fullest! It has many nice sounds bits, secrets, achievements and scares to be experienced, and for survival horror fans I highly recommend it! Being Indonesian you get even more out of it I'm sure, as there are some references I don't get as a Swede. Plenty as a horror fan though!\n\nThere's some tricky bits I actually had to look up while doing my first play through. Some parts actually demand you to be inactive rather than active for example (I've never experienced this before in a game), and some sections/bossfights makes you wonder if you're missing something. You are not told for example when some creature or ghost is invulnerable at a certain stage, or even forever, but I guess if you pay more attention to sound cues and visual cues you'd figure that out.\n\nThere are apparently some gamestopping bugs and glitches (might have been solved by the latest update, I didn't risk it), I only saw a few graphical ones myself. Also, having a headset is vital to playing this. I'm not saying this as a recommendation, but actually a certain bossfight is impossible (or near) unless you have sound cues as to where the enemy will be coming from, as you are in a tight area, and risk being spammed with attacks before being able to run or shoot your camera (the enemy can be too close to you, hindering a photo working against him).\n\nDespite that one bossfight, I enjoyed this game immensly! If the developers decide to make more episodes of it, I'll be eager to play them!","May 14, 2015","true","32.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

( It's a little bit like the Fatal Frame series. )  Being a young girl with no weapons or crazy abilities adds to the deapth of the game, it gives you a sense of helplessness and adds to the tension when your alone in dark corridors with only the phone for light.  The characters controls are slow and clunky adding to the atmosphere as you find it very hard to run away.  The Game also has some great designs with regards to the enemies, I have never played a game where you encounter giant ghost pigs before!  There are a good number of puzzles that can seem confusing at first because the journal gives you very little objective based hints.  They have created a great suspense element with the game too as there isn't an anemy in every room, yet you still find yourself holding your smartphone before entering rooms in case there is anything lingering in the dark areas.  Oh and the Dramatic music changes can put you on edge and keep you looking over your shoulder for a while before finishing your current objective.\n\nFor me this game is a 10/10 as it combines all the good elements of the old school Horror game.  If your into the Fatal Frame and Silent Hill games then this is a must have game for you.  I would advise playing in the dark, alone with a headset on to get the most out of the Helpless feeling the game gives you.\n\n\n","May 19, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I do like it. I really do. It does a great job of producing a legitimately creepy atmosphere. The characters are good, and the visuals are great. The "monsters" are creepy, but not so otherworldly as to make you go "oh, ha-ha. Tentacle monster. Meh."\n\nThere are serious problems, though, and I don't mean from a technical standpoint. To go over it without giving away anything:\n\nYour one weapons, such as it is, is more difficult to use than it should be.\nThe hit detection for the enemies is spot on. For my one defense? Not so much. I once used it three times on one enemy (admittedly a boss) to no effect. That's not cool.\nThe reasoning for the weapon's value and for why you can do what you can do is not well established, especially early on.\nThere's an In Media Res intro section that should juts plain not be there. It's got spoilers, and it serves no purpose. Basically, you get thrown into stuff, plot points are spoiled, and then you get taken to the actual start of the game and the story. There's no point to it, and it actually detracts from the atmosphere and suspense building the rest of the game is really good at.\n\nI recommend it, but the developers should work on the issues.","May 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For some examples, you need to think how to beat a ghost, simply standing still and mash the photo button will take you knowhere. You really need to look close to see, how to beat the ghosts. Most time you can find out for yourself, because of red glowing and stuff. But one specific time it isn't. I want to say much, because it would be a massive spoiler. But on that specific part, you need to get hit in a specific area by a ghost to actually damage the ghost. An other part that really frustrated me, was a picture I had to do in the right angle (I took a picture of this part, but not in the right angle) to pick up a key, where I allready clicked before, but didn't had the photo for it. But the good things are clearly more weightful, like the ghost design, level design and superior atmosphere. I can recommend it to any Project Zero player or horror fan.

It doesnt really hold your hand to learn it nor tells you exatly what to do, which adds to the sense on mystery and exploration. The atmosphere and creepiness are first rate along with the playful sense of the horror. The school group is really well done and well characterized. Having come from a Western world background, in which European and Native American folklore have become fodder for cliches in modern culture,  the Indonesian ghosts are a welcome change. I could barely fathom most of them, but once they are explained, they are a very welcome change of pace.\nA word of warning, this game is scary. Another word of warning, the intro tutorial is really bad. The game would have been better served with the start of the school trip. If you make it through the intro involving the apartments and cemetary, then the actual game is first rate despite it's budget and graphical limitations. It's almost a throwback to the golden days of games like the first Silent Hill , Siren and, of course, Fatal Frame.\nBe prepared to get freaked out by things you can barely comprehend.

Never really written a review before but i felt to give a try, why not? So before we go any further, if you dislike indie games, horror games, cameras, or anything relating to those things; proceed no further! This game is filled with every single 1 of those things. Now for the pros/cons:\n\nPros:\nFatal Frame inspired gameplay\nVery, Very Atmospheric and tense filled\nScary!\n\nNeither pro or con:\nCheap jumpscares (besides the atmosphere which is done well, they throw in some cheap jumpscares to scare you, not something i enjoy in horror games but that is me, thankfully it is kept to a minimum)\nWeak game length (5 - 8 hours but could be a solid time)\n\nCons:\nStory is half-♥♥♥♥♥ (Starts off good then falls apart in act 2)\nGameplay can be repetitive (Horror games fix this with puzzle elements, this game has very little)\nGraphics are meh (for those that care about visuals)\nCharacters aren't fleshed out well\n\nIn-depth review starts here, shorten review near the bottom with my score.\n\nOVERVIEW: If you are expecting a top quality game, you will not find it here. However, this little gem is in a league of its own. Done by an indonesian company, Digital Happiness, this game takes elements from Fatal Frame, and silent hill and combines them to make Dreadout. You got the setting of Silent Hill and the gameplay of Fatal Frame, what more could you want!? Sounds so great and I have to say, the execution is solid and sound. While they were limited with what they have, they made more out of the little. When I first played this game, it was last year in like June when Act 1 was out on Steam. I bought it, played it and wanted more. I loved Fatal Frame and was happy to see another game use that same gameplay style.\n\nGAMEPLAY: In this game, you don't "charge up" your camera to do extra damage, you find weakspots on ghosts and aim for those to do more damage. Ghosts aren't pushed back when you attack them, they merely appear elsewhere and can attack in 2 ways: Physical or Mental. Unfortunately though, that is pretty much the extent of gameplay here. You use a camera to attack weakspots and not much else. Puzzles are kept to an absolute minimum meaning you won't be doing much besides running around from point A to point B and snapping a couple ghosts. Their are some bosses that are unique in their own way but felt half done honestly. The "only" difference you will feel between ghosts is the number of shots it takes to kill them. Some take a couple, some take a lot. The only unique ghost i saw in the game that differ itself from others is when you had to use the environment to find him or use mirrors.\n\nSTORY:\n\nEDIT: I will hold on to my previous review here of the story but it seems the developers took a route with an abstract story. Piece together the pieces scattered about and understand the whole picture. That seems to be what they intended for instead of just throwing everything at you. A nice touch but until more is understood properly, my view of the story will not change.\n\nAnother thing about horror games is the amount of files/documents you find to give you sense of backstory. In this game, that isn't possible. Their are FAR too few files to find in this game and most of them don't tell you exactly what happened at all before your arrival in town. I think I only found like 2 files that gave a hint to something about murder in the town but that is it. In Act 1, you get a decent amount of story that brings the characters into town and lose each other to Silent Hill. In Act 2, this is immediately forgotten and you have no clue what the heck is even going on. The story is no longer developed properly and the characters are completely forgotten (figuratively, not literally).\n\nGRAPHICS: Not something I really want to go much into because unless you love visuals, graphics are on the low end for me. However, I won't leave it out. I have a decent machine so I can easily max this game out. Graphics, currently, are on the weak side because they have to be downgraded for 32-bit machines. They are expecting to release HD textures for 64-bits so I cannot judge properly on the asthetics.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Lastly, the thing that consitutes a good horror game is the type of atmosphere it delivers to its audience. I have to say, the atmosphere is spot on here. I felt very scared during the whole ride and couldn't help but be actually scared at some parts. The Silent Hill theme was good to give that sense of a ghost town as you walk through, not knowning what was going to happen. Unfortunately, that gets dropped for a night time travel for the rest of the game but that didn't bother me too much. I was walking slowly throughout the game, taking in my surroundings and watching my step. A couple characters gave that eerie feeling along the way like "did she do it or WTF WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON WITH HER!?". Overall, the atmosphere is spot on, tension was everywhere, and the entire ride i didn't know what to expect, getting that wtf moment when everything got spooky.\n\nOverall rating: 6/10\n\nIf you are looking for a game that delivers on atmosphere and a solid Fatal Frame type gameplay, by all means dive in. Its completely worth your time and money to be able to enjoy a solid Indie-developed horror game. I would highly recommend it over a lot of other AAA type out there (but if you had to choose between alien isolation and this, go with the former). You can tell the developers tried their best to make a solid horror game so for me, I hope they continue to deliver on other horror games of this type in the future.\n\nOtherwise, i recommend moving on. The story is weakly developed, very few puzzles and not much is developed beyond the atmosphere part.","February 14, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story begins with a group of student trying to investigate an abandoned village. What I really like about Dreadout is how the atmosphere changes from daydream to nightmare.\n\nDreadout presents thick and haunting atmospheres. It feels dark, mysterious, and creepy everytime you take step into each area with great ambient soundtracks. The whole story encourages player to think and find reference from dialogues and notes. There is not much connection between Linda and side characters which make storyline feels pretty decent.\nThe solid part of Dreadout is gameplay as Linda can use her sense ability to discover item, puzzle, and incoming ghost. The way of game design and how you adapt your camera function to apply in each puzzle and ghost fight are genius and well executed. Most ghosts are both scary and fun to fight due to well-written script and how they behave to player in each encounter.\n\nThe graphics and animation are decent and some textures are too blurry for presentation. Moreover, the game has some gameplay glitch and poor optimization for some users like dropped framerate in school area. But I’m sure it can be easily fixed in future patch.\n\nDreadout surprises me in a lot of horror and gameplay aspects. It has variety and strong setup even the content is quite short. And the end holds me more questions, but for me it gives such a memorable experience which I hardly taste from other horror games in past few years.","February 19, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I got it when only the first act was out and I feel kinda bad for that cause it ruined the first half when act two came out, but, act zero, and two made up for it and I'm glad for it.\n\nThis would be close to a puzzle, 'fighting', horror game. Instead of a gun you get a camera with 'fighting' instances just like in the Fatal Frame games(taking photo's of the ghosts while their within a certain range). With puzzles along the way for progression.\n\nThe puzzles is where this game can get difficult sometimes. I can honestly say I had to look up a few of the puzzles but the others I managed to figure out myself, which, once I figured it out, I felt like an idiot. Though some of the puzzles are easy a few can be difficult.\n\nThe ghost varity is very nice, very rarly will you come across a ghost you will have to fight twice, except bosses and figuring out what to do with each ghost was fun, though it always comes down to taking a picture of them. The pacing itself was alright though there were a few occasions where it got a little fast or really slow and it left me a little confused. I'll leave it up to you to find those spots, if you can.\n\nThere are a few bugs, where you might need to run back and forth a few times before the action comes up, but, with act 2 just releasing recently(from the time this is posted) I can forgive that to a degree. Other then that there were very few bugs on my playthrough of it.\n\nGraphically it isn't much to look at and you'll find some broken textures but they take advantage of that with good music, sounds, and a jumpscare now and again. The atmosphere was really good and act zero, one (the first time I played it) and two had me on edge a lot, but, would I call it scary? Well, that defines your version of scary but I love horror and it had me creeped out well over half the time.\n\nLike any horror game the amount of replayability it has is VERY low. Horror games in general have a very low rate in that to begin with and very, very few have more then three good and scary replays in it. The first time you play I can almost gurentee you'll get scared or really creeped out, after that, depends on how much of a scardy cat you are but I would say that by the third playthrough or more, it becomes more of a picture taking and a achievment hunter game. But that first playthrough is ALWAYS the best.\n\nOverall, a good game that is worth the money in my book and I look forward to playing it again in a year or so. I wont spoil the end but if they do try and make a second DreadOut, they will get no complaints from me!","February 26, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I got it when only the first act was out and I feel kinda bad for that cause it ruined the first half when act two came out, but, act zero, and two made up for it and I'm glad for it.\n\nThis would be close to a puzzle, 'fighting', horror game. Instead of a gun you get a camera with 'fighting' instances just like in the Fatal Frame games(taking photo's of the ghosts while their within a certain range). With puzzles along the way for progression.\n\nThe puzzles is where this game can get difficult sometimes. I can honestly say I had to look up a few of the puzzles but the others I managed to figure out myself, which, once I figured it out, I felt like an idiot. Though some of the puzzles are easy a few can be difficult.\n\nThe ghost varity is very nice, very rarly will you come across a ghost you will have to fight twice, except bosses and figuring out what to do with each ghost was fun, though it always comes down to taking a picture of them. The pacing itself was alright though there were a few occasions where it got a little fast or really slow and it left me a little confused. I'll leave it up to you to find those spots, if you can.\n\nThere are a few bugs, where you might need to run back and forth a few times before the action comes up, but, with act 2 just releasing recently(from the time this is posted) I can forgive that to a degree. Other then that there were very few bugs on my playthrough of it.\n\nGraphically it isn't much to look at and you'll find some broken textures but they take advantage of that with good music, sounds, and a jumpscare now and again. The atmosphere was really good and act zero, one (the first time I played it) and two had me on edge a lot, but, would I call it scary? Well, that defines your version of scary but I love horror and it had me creeped out well over half the time.\n\nLike any horror game the amount of replayability it has is VERY low. Horror games in general have a very low rate in that to begin with and very, very few have more then three good and scary replays in it. The first time you play I can almost gurentee you'll get scared or really creeped out, after that, depends on how much of a scardy cat you are but I would say that by the third playthrough or more, it becomes more of a picture taking and a achievment hunter game. But that first playthrough is ALWAYS the best.\n\nOverall, a good game that is worth the money in my book and I look forward to playing it again in a year or so. I wont spoil the end but if they do try and make a second DreadOut, they will get no complaints from me!","February 26, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The demo is a stand alone feature and is more of a free 1st chapter than a teaser.\n\nEdit: Whilst I still believe all of the above, updates have made this game unplayable for me.

There's so much here that I'd love to like, but it's all spoilt by bad mechanics and the odd glitch here and there.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say that I really like the atmosphere here. It's really quite spooky and well done. I like how there's ghosts that are secondary in that they are just there and will do you no harm etc. I also liked the characters in this game as well. I thought they were acted very well and all gell well together I thought.\n\nLooks are hit and miss, with some stuff looking pretty good, but others looking like sub PS2 quality with very low texture detail, so it's all a bit patchy looking. But there's nthing game breaking here and you'll quickly get used to it all.\n\nBut it's the gameplay mechanics that really let this game down. I found it really hard to work out what I needed to do. I'm fine with games that don't hold your hand, but this game has some very obscure mechaincs in place, like finding a photo, then matching that photos position to find a key that opens a hidden area etc. Sounds simple enough, but I had to look a guide up a couple of times, just to see what I actually should be doing, otherwise, I'd just have been walking around in a big loop.\n\nThere's also an issue with the actual photo fighting thing. There's a ghost where you need to "shoot" it's red patch on it's back. Despite haveing a camera FULL of shots of the ghosts weak spot, it took me ages to finally get one to "take" and kill the ghost.\n\nAnother thing is the Limbo bit when you die. It can take ages to get back into the game from here (and I know you can fix this in the menu), but often, the game will respawn you directly into the ghost that killed you in the first place! A good example of this is the scissor ghost. I've lost count of the number of times I died almost instantly because I got respawned directly onto his attack. This is where I stopped playing.\n\nSuch a shame as I dearly want to love this game, but I just can't. My advise? Pick it up in a flash sale (like I did) or download the demo first.","June 19, 2015","false","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Ofcourse everygame has them - but games that are spamming it all over the place are even more ♥♥♥♥♥ier then flash games. You can't call "jumpscare games "games. They are just ♥♥♥♥ easy money way.\n\nThere are ghosts/monsters/puzzles/collectables in the game. The game has low resolution graphics and you can't change this too. I do feel the mouse movement a little wonky, if u go to fast, the camera is doing crazy stuff like going instantly to the right or left. It has "creepy" music thingy. You have a mobile and you need to use that to kill ghosts and monsters and stuff, complete puzzles and hidden passages and other things.\n\nGames like these (non jumpscares) should be more often in the store. Lets just be honest, you are not getting scared from the real jumpscare, it is just because of the sudden loud music. This game doesn't not have it! It builds up, the fear, the dark, music, and anything else so you will always see it coming or prepared for it.\n\nLet's try Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eut_D4NAFU\n\nI give this game a 8/10 and i hope games like these will be more shown in the store.\n♥♥♥♥ ALL DEVELOPERS THAT ARE MAKING JUMPSCARE GAMES.","March 26, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/269790/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","At the beginning, I felt that the game had a very Silent Hill vibe to it; mostly due to the music and atmosphere that was provided in Act 0. As I engaged in Act 1, this feeling was lost somewhere in the mix. I felt that the intended horror and atmosphere was masked by time-filler puzzles that never seemed to have much of a point to them. At least in Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Fatal Frame, etc., your objectives serve a purpose. However, this is not the case in DreadOut.\n\nYou also start the game with absolutely no indication of where to go, what to do or how to play. There's zero hand holding, which can be positive... but when you're supposed to be using a camera to take pictures of ghosts to kill them, and you keep dying within 5 minutes of the beginning of the game, it may deter some players.\n\nThe scare tactics seem to wear thin quickly, as the monsters become less horrific and more predictible the further you get into the game. You spend almost the entire first act within a very small school, with very few items to collect and puzzles to solve. You spend more time solving these small puzzles and running around than you do actually encountering ghosts. Overall, it takes about two hours if you actually explore everything.\n\nAct 2 was unfortunately worse than Act 1 in the fact that it had fewer ghost encounters and fewer puzzles. Most of the time during this latter act is spent walking around and watching minor cutscenes.\n\nQuite honestly, and a little sadly, DreadOut is one of the better horror experiences that I've come across in the last few years, and for that reason I am going to recommend it. It's better than the flood of Unity horror key finding simulators that are erupting onto Steam at this moment. Although, I wouldn't buy it at the full price. I was fortunate enough to get it on sale for about $5.00.\n\nRating: 3.5/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 17, 2015","true","8.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The games story and implementation of ghosts is very well done, the ghosts design is disturbing (as it should be) the story is catchy enough to keep on playing and the concept of photographing ghosts to kill them (plus needing different tactics to kill some of the ghosts) is pretty interesting to me! Even the graphics are "okay", although certainly not on the level of 2014.  Yet the downsides overshadow those positive aspects of the game - if you'd ask me... There are 3 things in particular that annoyed me during the time I played DreadOut: First - The game didn't really scare, but instead startle me with an overabundance of jumpscares... I didn't get a feeling of constant dread while I played, and after a while those jumpscares just annoyed me instead of scaring me... The second thing that bothered me where the boss-fights... those really had the potential to be challenging, yet fair and rewarding as well, but to me they became constant struggles to "not get stuck or stunlocked" under a boss... The last thing which really felt unnecessary and not well-implemented was the "gameover and respawning-process"... To inform you: If you die, which frequently happens, you'll respawn in a black field with a bright light in front of you to which you must walk. Upon every death the distance to said light becomes further and if you die a couple of times (like I did at some harder fights) this process becomes quite frustrating... The distance can be shortend by finding special objects and relics which are scattered throughout the game or by progressing in the story, but if you keep dying to a boss this becomes impossible and thus VERY frustrating...\n\ntl; dnr? Games background and story are good, most of the gameplay sadly isn't! Buy it on sale if you REALLY want to play it, but don't approach it with high expectations...","February 26","false","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

No game overs felt like theres no sense of accomplishment. The puzzles in the game felt like fillers to pad the gameplay out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/recommended/269790/","Chernobog3","Chernobog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/","94 products in account","I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. It has a lot of good visuals, plays like Fatal Frame, and the music score is excellently brooding. But there are a lot of issues with it, some small and others flat out hair tearingly frustrating. It takes a good concept and then screws it over with poor gameplay designs.\n\nThe difficulty is all over the place. While some things are relatively easy, but a lot winds up being luck based in regards to encounters. One such fight (spoiler) agains the infamous Scissor Ghost is essentially all about dumb luck trying to evade an enemy in a tiny room that comes out of the walls with tank controls. In the wrong spot at the wrong time? Too bad, you get stunlocked to death. Respawn back in the room and he gets a free hit on you. They've had forever to fix this.\n\nThere's not a lot of direction or explanation to anything as to what you're supposed to accomplish. You'll have to look into your Files section to get some idea, but little is organically explained within the context of gameplay outside of some otherwise nifty Silent Hill style notes that delve into background events. Characterization is more thin than I'd like. You get objects in the game, but it isn't clear if they're supposed to do anything or why you're collecting them.\n\nControls are tank based... what can I say? Your character runs and turns slowly. She's slow about using her camera against speedy enemies. If you get hit, she recovers like a drunk on downers so enemies can just keep nailing you during your recovery animations. Otherwise, controls are very simplistic.\n\nGraphically, the game is like a late PS2 title. Not a bad thing, really, but it becomes clear more work was put into some things that others. The enemies all look very good and spooky, but human character animations can be choppy. I noticed at one point the heroine's hand clips into her own wrist when bending.\n\nBut I WANT to like this title. It sets a great atmosphere even with inconsistent graphics and the way the dust plays across the camera is realistic to actual ghost hunting perspectives. The sound effects are top notch. Play this in the dark with headphones! It does feel like a genuine horror experience. But poor gameplay issues take away from the immersive quality. What should be challenging or scary winds up being nothing else than frustrating as you can get stuck in places with seemingly little to do but wander the same scenes again and again because you either can't figure out what you're supposed to do or it doesn't feel like there was anything you could rationally do... you get by on dumbluck. So it doesn't have that savor of challenge that a difficult title like Darksouls would.\n\nIs it worth $15? Debateable. It feels like some polish is needed throughout. It's not the worst title I've ever played, but it fails to live up to what it could be.\n\nAs a final note, the DLC is pretty nice for this game. The comics are interesting and deliver some pretty good wtf moments as well as explains a few things. The music itself is quite sweet too... to access it once you've bought the DLC, check your steamapps!\n\nACT 2 Comments...\n\nAct 2 was somewhat 'ehh' at first, but ramped up nicely. Things are more lively and story based in the 2nd part, with the end leaving more questions and possibilities. There are a LOT of boss fights in the 2nd part and the location is entirely different. I would in terms of challenge, the puzzles are often harder than the bosses were (there's only a few, but they make only vague amounts of sense), but generally nothing is 'scissor ghost' difficult. The 2nd is definitely darker and more surreal- expect much more direct ghost confrontations but less exploring. The linearity is a little disappointing, but the journey was more enjoyable as a whole. I'm not sure it's enough to say I recommend this title now, but it's not terrible. The experience of DreadOut is reasonably memorable with great imagery and in truth, I'd like to see more despite some qualms with the game. I'm going to say I'm neutral at this point with the recommendation. That said, if it's on sale, just go for it and play in the dark.","June 7, 2014","false","10.7"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","1"

The idea is interesting, the atmosphere is kinda right, but as for the rest :\n\n- awful textures (like, ps2-awful or something) (note : apparently, the game was first shipped with "64 bits" textures, supposedly much better, but which were removed for "performance" problems. I never saw them, and they were never reintroduced despite the initial "promise")\n- useless walking pace, meaning you'll have to be running all the time, except you can't run all the time as the character has to catch her breath from time to time\n- uninspired level design\n- average and not well presented puzzles (those that I saw, at least).\n- limbo (when you "die", you wake up in limbo, which requires you to walk towards a light to start playing again (at least 1 minute lost every time)\n- not tight enough controls (some of the fights require you to get behind your target, it's a hassle just to do that, and if you miss, chances are you'll get a stuck in a "loop" of you being knocked down repeatedly by your target, meaning you'll probably end up in limbo-oh-great-not-again ? see above)\n- camera control has a bad tendancy to "double" your input, meaning you'll raise it and then immediately lower it, especially when you try to activate it after running (which you do all the time, see above). As the camera is crucial for some events, guess what ? Back to limbo-you-gotta-be-kidding-me again (see above ... again :p)\n- absolutely no sense of fear after the first jump-scare (if you can even call it that)\n- minor, but from what I saw, your character doesn't talk, not even answering questions asked by her teammates\n\nI finally gave up after 3 hours, totally bored. This game could have been good, maybe even great, but in the end, it brings absolutely no fun, just frustration, and as such, there's no way I can recommend it.","October 12, 2015","false","3.7"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","21","41","0","0"

I don’t know if it is because of the recent update or what, but my experience with the game consisted of about 50% fun and 50% glitch.  Some ghosts don’t show up even when all of the requirements for their appearance are meet, and when they do show up they are immortal.\n\nNow, yes, there are some ghosts in this game that are designed to be immortal, but I’m not talking about those.  I’m talking about regular, average ghosts that I can absolutely defeat but who simply won’t die no matter how many times I take a photo of them or their weak point.\n\nAnother glaring issue is the camera’s range.  The way it works in-game is that when a ghost gets a certain distance away from you the camera’s screen gets all glitchy and then you can take their photo and deal damage.  But it appears that in order for the static to manifest the ghost has to cross some sort of invisible threshold that only exists when the camera is up.  So, if you pull the camera up too late or if the ghost manifests in your static-zone, the static will not appear and you cannot do damage to it.  For the most part this is not an issue, but there is one boss fight in the school that takes place in a very small room and the ghost started to bum-rush me or manifest just a few feet away.  Even though he was in the camera’s screen and I could take his picture, none of them did damage and he would hit me.  I would run from side of the room to side of the room, pulling the camera up and taking a photo, but there was no static, no damage done, and he would soon kill me.\n\nDying due to glitches is bad enough, but to then see a dying-screen message of, “maybe you should consider switching to casual gaming,” is just infuriating.  Add to this a bunch of achievements not triggering even when you meet their requirements exactly, and this game can become very frustrating very quickly.  There were other glitches that I encountered, but they hardly effected gameplay as badly so I won’t mention them.\n\nAll of that being said, the core mechanics of wandering around a haunted town, defeating ghosts with your camera, finding articles/notes that reveal more of the plot, and finding items to increase your powers are all a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes survival horror games where you can actually fight back but aren’t unstoppable.  I’d almost compare this game to the better Resident Evil titles in that you can defeat nearly all that stands against you, but just a few mistakes and you will die.\n\ntl;dr – Good game, but tons of glitches that, if encountered, can make the game almost impossible to play.  Wait till the next patch comes out and then look to see what people are saying.\n","December 30, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ltscythe/recommended/269790/","ltscythe","Lt.Scythe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ltscythe/","321 products in account","Dreadout is a game done in a "Forgotten" Style of the Survival horror genre, and before you all say, "Um Cl0ps, there are alot of games done in First Person View with minimal lighting and so forth." Let me explain, so in a society where the Survival Horror Franchise is booming without a hitch, it's full of games, literally hundreds to thousands (Not including all the ♥♥♥♥ing zombie games.......thats a topic for another day) anyways, Dreadout attempts and accomplishes the forgotten art of Mortality. Now what I mean is we all played games like Evil Within, or Alien Isolation, Slender, Five nights at Freddy's, Outlast, etc. But in those games you don't really feel a sense of mortality, everything is sort of pushed along and given to you, sure you die and attempt again but thats not what I mean, most of the new games it's all given to you, Alien Isolation you learn very early on about the hiding aspects, Outlast you learn right away what effects lighting has and conserving batteries, so theres that and then theres that "Forgotten style" I spoke of, let's go back in time to December 13th 2001, A game is released in Japan, and is still held as one of the most scariest series of games of all time, Fatal Frame. Fatal Frame puts you into your character and basically says "Here is your ♥♥♥♥ing camera, heres how to work it, some ♥♥♥♥ is happening but you already knew that, escape, on your own because Im out the ♥♥♥♥ing door already because they don't pay me enough to deal with this ♥♥♥♥." (lol) so you play through with subtle clues and hints of whats going on in books/tomes that you find or some of the ghosts you come across, but in the end it's up to you to figure ♥♥♥♥ out and take course of action. You feel mortality because your a normal human being dealing with this scary F'ed up situation where sometimes if you do die it is game over, you tend to be more cautious and ♥♥♥♥ seems more creepy and scary, and builds up until one crazy scare lets you release that sweet serenity of a scream/yelp/cry for help. Now Dreadout is like a modern day call to Fatal Frame, sort of like if Fatal Frame decided to have a F'ed up affair with resident evil, had a baby and said "do what you want but you only get to use a camera." and then silent hill came by to form a threesome and gave the baby some new toys to play with. (Seriously it;s a game worth playing until the heads of Fatal Frame in Japan get their heads out of their asses and finally release another of their masterpieces here in North America, that would raise the bar for a new generation.)\n\nAll in All let's face facts, it's not Fatal Frame........But, its not Duke Nukem Forever.\n\nThis game manages to pull off what is was inspired by very well, there are some pros and cons just like any other games which are:\n\nPros:\n+Sound Quality\n+Controls fairly Easy\n+Has a decent story, keeps you going\n+You are able to explore you areas fairly well\n+It has that mystique of not knowing whats next that every Survival horror genre game should have.\n+builds up its scares nicely\n+Let's you feel mortal\n\nCons:\n-Graphics aren't bad but don't expect brand new Far Cry 4 graphics\n-Its being released in "Acts" which isn't bad unless you are like me who just wants to keep going to see whats next.\n-Achievements sometimes don't work (but from what I hear they have been patching that so you should be good.)\n\nAll in all this game is definitely worth it.\n\nCategory        Score                Visual        8.5/10                Sound        9/10                Gameplay        9/10                Total        9/10","February 17, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I wish they expanded further on certain areas regarding the plot and characters. It felt very....no closure?

I don’t know if it is because of the recent update or what, but my experience with the game consisted of about 50% fun and 50% glitch.  Some ghosts don’t show up even when all of the requirements for their appearance are meet, and when they do show up they are immortal.\n\nNow, yes, there are some ghosts in this game that are designed to be immortal, but I’m not talking about those.  I’m talking about regular, average ghosts that I can absolutely defeat but who simply won’t die no matter how many times I take a photo of them or their weak point.\n\nAnother glaring issue is the camera’s range.  The way it works in-game is that when a ghost gets a certain distance away from you the camera’s screen gets all glitchy and then you can take their photo and deal damage.  But it appears that in order for the static to manifest the ghost has to cross some sort of invisible threshold that only exists when the camera is up.  So, if you pull the camera up too late or if the ghost manifests in your static-zone, the static will not appear and you cannot do damage to it.  For the most part this is not an issue, but there is one boss fight in the school that takes place in a very small room and the ghost started to bum-rush me or manifest just a few feet away.  Even though he was in the camera’s screen and I could take his picture, none of them did damage and he would hit me.  I would run from side of the room to side of the room, pulling the camera up and taking a photo, but there was no static, no damage done, and he would soon kill me.\n\nDying due to glitches is bad enough, but to then see a dying-screen message of, “maybe you should consider switching to casual gaming,” is just infuriating.  Add to this a bunch of achievements not triggering even when you meet their requirements exactly, and this game can become very frustrating very quickly.  There were other glitches that I encountered, but they hardly effected gameplay as badly so I won’t mention them.\n\nAll of that being said, the core mechanics of wandering around a haunted town, defeating ghosts with your camera, finding articles/notes that reveal more of the plot, and finding items to increase your powers are all a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes survival horror games where you can actually fight back but aren’t unstoppable.  I’d almost compare this game to the better Resident Evil titles in that you can defeat nearly all that stands against you, but just a few mistakes and you will die.\n\ntl;dr – Good game, but tons of glitches that, if encountered, can make the game almost impossible to play.  Wait till the next patch comes out and then look to see what people are saying.\n","December 30, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However you simply can't get away from the fact that the game needs more polish especially in the animation department which get very janky and do take away from the game. I like the basis in Indonisian ghosts even though I can't pronounce them. The second act however is a bit of a low point for me as I found glitches, slow chase scenes that I think were supposed to be tense but weren't so ended up being frustrating and a boss battle I beat by tabbing out and looking up a walkthrough to see if what I was doing was correct. (Seriously I had tabbed out the game and was in the middle of reading a walkthrough when I beat the boss, how I have no idea.) I am assuming this is Digital Happiness's first game and if it is then well done, this is certainly a good game and worth a buy, on sale mind you.","January 16","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Still have the same opinion of the game.\nAtmosphere: 10/10\nGraphics: Great for an indie game company. Dont expect AAA.\nSound: Music/effects Good.\nVoice Acting: House of the Dead/10.\nHonest and Trustworthy Devs 0/10\nAnd thats the crux of my thumbs down. The game itself isnt bad, but they included a rebind keys option. Its selectable and you can rebind the controls in the game. There is no warning in the game or on the purchase page that this option DOES NOT WORK. It just breaks the game as any rebound control ceases to function. Burried deep in a suggestions to the devs thread on the forums they acknowledge it does not work and said they want to add that fuctionality but it is not a priority. Thats fine, but why is the option there then? Why isnt it greyed out, or a message saying not to do it yet. ANYTHING. You just rebind your controls and then wonder why the game doesnt work. To me, this openface lie makes me wish the refund policy was available when I bought the game. As a left handed person this option is very important to me and my game playing experience. The absence or warning that it doesnt work yet being present this would of been a 9/10 please buy and support cuz the atmosphere and style is amazing. But instead I see dishonest and lying company I want no part of or support for.\nSadly im in the minority and will go completely un-noticed. If you care about developer integrity and a simple one line of code it would of been to grey out the option till its added everything would be fine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/269790/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Why, God? Why did you give us an indie Fatal Frame built on Indonesian lore and set in an abandoned town in the mountains and make it bad? Why did it fail to have interesting areas or a compelling story or enemies that weren't annoying as all hell? What did we do to deserve such intense disappointment?\n\nI seriously doubt He's going to answer those questions, so let's at least talk about how this happened. DreadOut is indeed an indie loveletter to the Fatal Frame series, a series that really should inspire more imitators. You play Linda, a strangely silent Inodnesian high school student on a trip with her teacher, best friend, and a few other people you will cease caring about almost immediately. They happen across an abandoned town up in the mountains, and like good little horror protagonists, wander into the school and get trapped. There's something off about Linda's BFF, and some early signs that the town was into weird rituals or whatever, but there's no big hook like Silent Hills or Fatal Frames have. You're just trying to get out of the school, so ostensibly the only great revelation in your future is where the janitor's keyring ended up.\n\nThe ghosts in your way aren't going to hold your attention either, and that's a real shame considering how rare and interesting Indonesian horror is. The first three you'll meet are a giant invincible pig, a bleached version of Sadako from The Ring, and a harmless businessman with a super wobbly head. Albino girl's the only one you can fight, and even as the first real enemy she's annoying as hell. Linda battles by taking pics with her cellphone camera, and to beat this one you have to photograph her four times until she disappears, find her again within like 3 seconds, and photograph the gaping wound in her back. She can, of course, phase through walls, so even if you know what you're doing it can take forever. Also, I played for an hour and she was the only defeatable enemy I encountered. Really, game?\n\nThere are moments of brilliance to the atmosphere, but they're lost amidst a sea of tedium. Most of the classrooms in the spooky school are empty or look pretty normal. There are two that have the chairs set in odd ways, and one of those gets a cool audio cue that gave me a little shiver. One thing really hurting the exploration is the aura you get signalling an item. When you get within like 20 feet of something you can examine, the edges of your screen turn blue, and get bluer as you get closer. There are no exceptions to this, so there's no reason not to charge down the halls and through the rooms at full speed until you get that cue. You also won't be finding healing items, weapons, ammo, or anything of interest other than plot items and files.\n\nThat's really the heart of DreadOut's problem, there's just not enough to do. Not enough ghosts, not enough items, not enough points of interest, not enough reasons to push forward. It's a depressingly thin game that has all the foundations of a great horror experience, just with nothing built upon them. Well, that's not entirely true. The game is ugly as hell. Everything is in muddy drabs, textures are stretched beyond recognition, and environmental details are rendered with 90s polygon budgets. If they were trying to fully imitate the PS2 classics, they got pretty close with the graphics, at least. It also has the ignoble distinction of being the only game where the How to Play menu option is essential, because there is no tutorial and literally nothing about how the game works is explained anywhere in the actual gameplay.\n\nI wish there was a single reason to recommend DreadOut, but there isn't. No part of it is fleshed out into anything worth your time. You might as well just play the demo, which suffers the same problems but is short and mysterious enough to minimize them, and then assume the full game got lost in development hell. In a way, I guess it did.","October 31, 2015","false","1.3"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","18","37","0","3"

Sadly, it is nowhere near that level of quality, in terms of game design, music, atmosphere, art, content and even graphics (that is saying a lot, becase FF was a PS2-era game). While it starts off fairly interesting, there seems to be no sense to anything. Why are ghosts wandering this town? Why do I have to fight a giant pig, and why does said pig have keys around its neck? The game is maybe 4-5 hours long (I haven't checked the playtime counter since finishing it), and it has maybe 3 really cool moments; none come to mind from Act 1, Act 2 has the ghost and boss that you fight with the aid of a mirror, and most of Act 0 (funnily enough, Act 0 was originally a demo for the game, released maybe a year ago). Act 2 is also much more glitchy that either two previous acts. During the first boss fight, I seemed to be stuck within the boss' collision box, and I couldn't move, and was constantly taking damage. Another glitch, at the end of this boss fight, rendered me unable to do anything other than watch the same scene about 15 times. And the final glitch involved a door with no collsion; I could just walk through it and explore the map from the outside. Generally, this game screams low production values, which is a shame because the demo was so promising. As for the graphics... They are awful, there is no other way to describe them. They seem to have decreased in quality, somehow, since the initial release of act 1. I remember seeing a dynamic shadows option, though it never worked for me, and others seemed to have the same issue. Now, the option to turn them on and off is just non-existant.","February 14, 2015","false","5.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","10","21","2","0"

Is it fair to review the game when not all the content is out? Then again, is it fair to charge for a game when what’s available amounts to barely anything?\n\nAt first I got vibes of a teen slasher film; a group of students on a road trip (with their teacher for some reason?) with a funky sound track and not a care in the world. After a wrong turn they end up at an abandoned town and decide that the sensible idea is to leave the car behind and walk blindly through town, rather than just retreating from whence they came. Eventually they come across a school, and we all know kids love nothing better, so the boys rush inside, presumably to vandalise, but this is basically the last we see or hear of them. It suddenly becomes night and it occurs to everyone that the guys have been gone a while, maybe they should look for them. Upon entering everyone else disappears, and the doors are locked. Hope you like school; it’s all you’re going to see from this point on. While the game doesn’t really say as much, you’re presumably tasked with finding the rest of the suddenly missing field trip posse, though by the end of the act, no real progress is made on that front.\n\nThe backstory of the town is explained through the traditional “find the letters” gimmick. However, note “the town”, all the backstory is about the town at large rather than the place you spend all your time in; the school. By the time you’re finished, you’re no wiser as to what was going on at the school than when you started, nor why any of these phantoms are residing there.\n\nWeirdly, once the night time portion starts, you can head back into town instead of going into the school, which reveals a UFO and a couple of other demons, just kind of… there. Sadly it feels like more effort is put into these “secrets” than fleshing out the main plot.\n\nBack in the school, you’ll be aimlessly wandering around looking for puzzles no one asked you to solve. For some reason a pig demon has the keys to the front door around his neck, and it all snowballs from there. It uses the Project Zero gimmick of taking a picture of a scene, only for the image to show to a different place where you go and pick up an item, except there’s nothing explaining why.\n\nIf a ghost touches you, then our heroine becomes “stressed”, repeated touching causes her to collapse. Oddly rather than die you appear in “Limbo”, which is to say you wake up in darkness, surrounded by a ring of candles and an eerie source of light in the distance. Sometimes a voice whispers clues, which end up being a lot more useful than the ones Linda keeps in her journal. Sadly why limbo exists and why she’s experiencing it, or whether it’s just something that happens to everyone in this world is left completely unexplained.\n\nBasically, don’t come to this game for the story.\n\nThe ghostly crew consists of a phantom pig, a yeti on crack, a businessman, a crossdressing teacher, a giant lady and a lady that likes to sing. After defeating a ghost, you get a little extract in your journal explaining what the ghost’s deal is, but it’s kind of irrelevant and doesn’t really do anything to tie them into the world or explain why they hang out at school.\n\nI was initially impressed with the reserved use of the phantoms, each is a particular character in the world rather than a random spawn, though what exactly that character is isn’t really defined. The second floor contains a ghost that disappears instead of dying, after defeating it, in one of the worst attempts at a jump scare I’ve seen in gaming, you’ll periodically get a image of it going “AAAARGH!” in front of your face briefly appear on screen. This wouldn’t be so bad were it not accompanied by a constant wailing that follows you around the second floor. This completely destroyed the atmosphere. It ended up being a deterrent to exploration since I just stopped going to the second floor until I was certain I’d exhausted every other option.\n\nYou can fight the ghosts off via your camera phone, but you can’t actually defeat them, just make them retreat until they feel like attacking again. When you take the picture *something* seems to happen to them, like the pig monster gets smaller and the yeti vanishes, but ultimately it doesn’t seem to mean anything, they’ll happily come back. Also loading screen hints say the camera can be upgraded, but that doesn’t seem to be implemented. The game says that it’s the camera flash that’s defeating the ghosts, but that begs the question; why aren’t they affected by the flashlight?\n\nThe game area essentially consists of; four corridors, a foyer, a boss room and a bunch of classrooms, most of which have nothing of interest in, just an array of misaligned desks, chairs and backpacks. Oh, and toilets, a prime place for a spook, right? Not here… In fact, there are very few rooms that contain anything of interest. It feels more like a haunted house; designed to mimic creepy films and rely on the fact you were scared of those, rather than providing any actual frights of its own.\n\nThere are a few puzzles, but they don’t have any context, nor make much sense, ultimately the main puzzle of the game is; the pig demon has the front door keys, find a way of getting them. The game just doesn’t have enough content, story, locations, characters… anything.\n\nThe idea of DreadOut isn’t entirely bad, neither is the execution, plenty of horror games have clunky controls, I can forgive that. I even enjoyed some of the time I spent with it. But it’s barely a game. It’s an assortment of horror elements, jumbled together with no reasoning behind it resulting in something that completely fails in its object to scare.\n\nMaybe Act 2 will fix that problem, but if it’s anything like the first, the only thing that’ll have me screaming is frustration at the lack of content.","June 6, 2014","false","13.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","3"

What you get is a jerky, low texture romp through a set of life- and joyless sceneries (no sandbox for sure, you are narrowly confined to eaxctly the path the devs want you to take). Yes, there's some 'scary' music and sound effects, but unfortunately, if you get stuck in a maze, it's the same sound effect on endless loop - the screaming woman repeating every 10 secs for the 10 min you aimlessly wander through what looks like classroom after classrom, all empty, all pointless, all pretty ugly looking in the flashlight perspective you are allowed; all worthless because - frankly - I had no clue how to get out of there, and why I should, and after 10 minutes, I really didn't care anymore. What's the point of this game? No clue. What are you supposed to do? I really don't know. I guess you are supposed to 'fight' by pointing you camera phone at the beast and taking its picture?? For real? I ended by just sitting myself in a corner and waiting for that random beast that roams those halls to kill off my character, mercifully, to end this incredibly annoying experience. On comes a flash screen that read "you've been playing for a while, time to take a break". Yeah. Played about a couple increasingly agonizing hours, felt like a day.

It's a shame too, great graphics for indie, and scary, but so much grinding to the point it isn't scary\n\n-The enemies you face are very scary. Unfortunately your "Objective log" tells you so little, you have no idea what your supposed to be doing.\n\n-There's a difference between being challenging & just plain unfair. The first boss you face is in a narro room (so you can't doge at all) against a fast enemy, and sometimes the game won't bring up your camera when you click, and sometimes the picture won't hurt the boss.\n\n-Die too many times, and the game taunts you, making the game agrivating as you play this empty walking simulator to come back to life, as if the game expects YOU to do better when there's little you can do about it.\n\nTo conclude, all I can say is that I searched up how to kill the first boss and so many people were saying it's unfair.

It almost always gets in the way of taking a good spirit photo or moving in the correct direction. There isn't any way to change the sensitivity.\n\nLittle to no storyline imput- Yes, Linda has a journal where she writes updates on plot-related events, but there is no feeling of planned events or order to any of the game's happenings. A little nudge in the right direction would be nice, but this isn't a complete game-ruiner for me.\n\nTension, scare-tactics and horror- Sometimes you reach cut-scenes, but all the scary stuff happens in the cutscenes and it doesn't really leave you feeling scared because you aren't in control of Linda. You just wait for the cutscene to end and the tension is gone. There are plenty of spooky moments, don't get me wrong, but in order to deliver the right "punch" of panic mixed with confusion, the player needs to control the character during a desperate situation, not just watch events unfold while eating a handful after handful of popcorn until the cutscene is over.\n\nAbsolutely no puzzle hints or imput- When the game presents you with a puzzle, you often won't even know its a puzzle at all. There are no hints, there is no moment where you read some cryptic message on a wall that you have to decypher in order to solve a puzzle and continue with the game. The game just drops some weird items or a strange picture or situation in front of you, and after retracing your steps several times because maybe you took a wrong turn somewhere or missed something, and after becoming frustrated and returning to that spot and visiting the DreadOut wiki page, you finally realize that its a puzzle and that NOW you need to start figuring out what to do, but there still isn't any imput on what the puzzle wants from you.\n\nVoice acting and graphics- The characters dont look bad, I'll admit. I'm not a graphics snob, I won't scoff if textures don't exactly line up or if someone's facial features aren't realistic. I have to say though that the voice acting in this game is horrible. Everything sounds cheesy, characters talk over eachother and sometimes audio cuts out. There are plenty of classic old games that have horrid voice acting, but with DreadOut its hard to be scared or on edge when the supporting characters sound so silly.\n\nAll in all, I can't do much complaining because I got this game on sale.\nI would not reccomend this game to anyone who wants this game because they expect it will be reminiscent of the Fatal Frame/Project Zero series, because you will be very disappointed.\n2/10","August 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've managed to get about one hour into the game, and my experience was this:\n- The game's graphics is inconsistent. Some parts - faces, petty details on leaves - are nice, but all in all this 2014 piece resembles something from the last decade.\n- The camera is horrible. The 3rd person view is inconvenient enough from the camera placing, but it glitches every time I've tried to move through a doorway, ending up in directions I did not want to look or be.\n- The monsters won't react to the attacks, they appear from nothing (I know it's also a feature, but I've died more times from monsters I couldn't even see, sense, or interact with in any way. THIS, however, is NOT part of the game.)\n- The dubbing and the voice acting is TERRIBLE. Not to mention the pacing of the dialogues, and the story itself.\n- Large/massive playspace is great. However, if I have to run for 30 minutes to get from A to B in a LINEAR game, just to spend 10 more minutes on badly-dubbed and scripted dialogues to get a loading screen, then it's just a waste of time.\nAll in all, this game did not meet my long-built expectations. It could be a great Fatal Frame remake or copy, but it... Just isn't. I asked for a refund - for the very first time.","October 31, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a shame too, great graphics for indie, and scary, but so much grinding to the point it isn't scary\n\n-The enemies you face are very scary. Unfortunately your "Objective log" tells you so little, you have no idea what your supposed to be doing.\n\n-There's a difference between being challenging & just plain unfair. The first boss you face is in a narro room (so you can't doge at all) against a fast enemy, and sometimes the game won't bring up your camera when you click, and sometimes the picture won't hurt the boss.\n\n-Die too many times, and the game taunts you, making the game agrivating as you play this empty walking simulator to come back to life, as if the game expects YOU to do better when there's little you can do about it.\n\nTo conclude, all I can say is that I searched up how to kill the first boss and so many people were saying it's unfair.

This feels like playing tabletop Call of Cthulu with a pissy DM.\n\nYou were doing everything right. Things were quiet, voice acting was fairly good, things were weird and there was an air of danger....And then it took a nosedive.\n\nThe game creates a nice, creepy atmosphere and the use of mythical creatures and spirits is nice....but so far those are the only possitive points I've found. The sound is......alright, if sometimes more grating than tense.\n\nI understand that combat, of any sort, should be a last possible option in any survival horror game. It's not scary if you can just shoot an enemy or whack them with something heavy until they resemble a fine red mist. I get that. However, you need other options if that is the case. Either running away, or at least enough of a combat mechanic not to die every time something scary pops out.\n\nNow, I'm not saying the basic enemies are difficult or anything. Not that I have much experience beyond what you meet in the school. Though even with those, hit detection feels buggy. My problem is the boss in the school. It's been quite a while since I've encountered such an amazingly unfair fight.\n\nFirst of all, it relies on quickly bringing up your camera. This would be fine, if Linda understood the concept of urgency. If you're moving even a tiny bit, she won't raise the damn phone when you hit the button. Or it might be because she has to face the direction the camera is in, which is also terrible as a mechanic in a fight that requires quick reactions. Early on this is not an issue, but the boss only gets faster and 'barely in time' soon becomes 'raise the phone when I tell you to, you bint!'\n\nThis would not be a problem, if there was room to dodge. Nope. The boss can hit you no matter how hard you hug the wall as you try to run by. And you have try to pass the boss because, guess what, if it corners you there is no way to get out of that. Considering the fight is in a very tiny room with an invisible wall in the corner thanks to the desk, this is just not fair. Especially considering you litterally have a boss who vanishes after taking a hit an can move through walls. Oh, and did I mention a single hit stunlocks you? If you get hit, prepare to eat at least 1 one more attack or even 2 if you're in a bad spot. That's not so bad, until the boss suddenly goes all Sonic the Hedgehog on you and its speed doubles. You can't run from that and odds are you'll be looking in the wrong direction when it comes out of the wall.\n\nWhich brings me to the next issue. Linda is so damned slow. I understand certain items make her faster, but bloody hell. I get it. The place is dark, scary and there are dangerous beings roaming around. I wouldn't practice free running there either, but pick up the pace a little would ya? Even her sprinting speed would cause obese kids to point and laugh.\n\nAll of this just made me feel like dying was not my fault, and I shouldn't feel that way. When I die, it should be because I ♥♥♥♥ed up or wasn't doing the right thing. It should not be because passing the boss without getting hit requires divine intervention and a particularly large rabbit's foot. I'm not asking for matrix reflexes and an arena to fight in, but I am asking for a character with more of a sense of urgency and more space than a bloody walk in closet to fight the hyperactive evil spirit.\n\nWhat finally made me quit, though, was the punishment for death. Guys, one of the most important things in gaming is being able to quickly return after dying. Making it take longer and longer each time you die is not an effective punishment. I have tried everything I could think of. I stood in the center and spun around. I died. I huddled in a corner and waited. The boss came through the wall right next to me, stunlocked me and I died. I hugged the contours of the room and ran in circles, hoping to put enough distance between Linda's slow ♥♥♥ and the enemy to raise the camera in time. Guess what, I died. And each time I woke up in limbo and had to walk further and further before I could come back to life.\n\nThat did not make me think 'Darn. Well, I deserve this. At least I know what to do now.' Instead it made me judge the mind numbingly long and boring walk and think 'You know what? No. I'm not walking all the way over there to get my ♥♥♥ kicked again.'\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really did. I still want to know what was going on, but the gameplay is not worth learning what happens in the story.","September 29, 2014","false","7.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I can't recommend this to anyone but someone who loves the horror genre that has absolutely played every other horror games.  It's too bad, because it absolutely nails the horror, and I can see it had a lot of potential and good ideas on the horror.\n\nThe Good:\n- Scare factor.  The atmosphere feels creepy and unsettling at all times, and there are also jump scares on top of this.  Even if you expect a scare, the thing that you see and experience is so unsettling, it will give you the heebe geebees.\n- Ambient music fits in nicely with the unsettling atmosphere.\n- Sound effects and sound design come from accurate places that aids you in discovering the ghosts and other weird things.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Gameplay feels clunky.  You basically shoot ghosts to death ala Fatal Frame with your camera.  The game design seems solid, but the terrible animation combined simplistic AI that beelines straight towards you at all times doesn't feel exciting at all.\n- Level design is bland.  Lots of empty rooms and empty hallways.  This causes you to run around for a long time with almost no action in between.\n- Item discovery is barely passing.  The game draws a blue halo around the item you can interact with.  It's really hard to see which items are interactable.  I randomly clicked around whenever the blue halo came up seeing if I can hit something.\n- Animation is barely passing, and characters float around.  I'm talking human characters, not the ghosts.\n- Graphical assets.  Textures are worse than games from 1998, and polygon counts are low other than some human characters.  I'm sure they could've purchased better looking stuff from Unity store.\n- B-level dialog and story.

It was not... the kind of game i expected it to be... The story over how i see it so far: apparently you play as a japanese school girl named Linda... that is riding with her school comrades to a place somewhere... i don't quite remember... but then instead they find a haunted abandoned ghost town... and they are going to investigate this town... and all they find is fog and an abandoned school very far up to the hill of the town... then they somehow get trapped in the school building... and have to find each other and get out of there... And there are ghosts and beasts that rest within the building and the town and gets their peace disturbed...\n\nThe story is very interesting and it has a good concept too... but when you start this game at first you will get confused as f*** when you walk around like an idiot to find an exit or a solution somehow... but no... you have to deal with spooky phantom logic in this f***ing game... and Linda can scare away ghosts by taking a photo on them with her cellphone... which i found too easy and uninteresting... with the "deal with your enemies"-system... Not like... run away and hide... or like try to fight them... plus the quality and graphics in this game is ugly and sloppy. it looks like the game was barely made for months or anything... But then i don't know better how to better the graphics and quality... but isn't that the game developer's job? To make the game look at least good enough for the year it is made? Well then i must say they need to get better with that skill of theirs... and i found it more annoying than scary with the jumpscares and ghosts that popped up every f***ing tenth second you walked in the school and the town... and a big-♥♥♥ boar that was walking around the school and charging at you when it saw you was not much of a big threat... and when you were outside there were pappers flying around in the air... and i was like... -"So... interesting..." and the cutscenes were so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sloppy and quick that you could barely tell what the hell happened and you had to make up your own story to follow the main story... for the game... it reminded me of a ps2 game with cutscenes that could never catch the player's emotions...\n\n4/10 because the music is not bad and works for horror games...\n\n","December 27, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Seriously. What a tease. It's got a good story, amazing atmosphere, great sound design and truly disturbing creatures. It's the closest we've been to an old-school PS2 survival horror game like Fatal Frame in a really long time. There's tons of hidden secrets and stuff to find, making exploration worth your time.\n\nBUT THEN.\nNo learning curve. Each time you die (and you're gonna die A LOT) you have to run towards the light in order to come back to life, and each time you're gonna have to run a bigger distance. The enemies are absurdly hard, AND I MEAN *HARD*.\nNot because this is some Dark Souls sh*t, but because the controls are so frigging clunky you're gonna CRY TEARS OF BLOOD trying to damage them at all.\nOther times they won't even do what they're programmed to do, making most walkthroughs unreliable. Just because it worked for whoever wrote the walkthrough, it doesn't mean it's gonna be that way for you.\n\nI still don't get some of the stuff I've found while playing this. The costumes are supposed to be unlockable content you get once you beat the whole thing, yet I had them all avaliable right from the beginning of my first game.\n\nAND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THAT BOSS. DEAR GOD.\n\nSurvival horror is my favorite genre of videogames. I've played dozens of them, don't wanna brag, I'm just saying that I kinda know how to deal with these type of games. Well, this one has broken me. The level of frustration I've endured in just 5 hours of gameplay (and half of that playtime is due to the fact that I had to restart the game several times, because the respawn light was too godd*mn far as I had died too many times) is unmatched by any other title.\n\nI really, REALLY wanted to like this game. I still think the atmosphere alone is worth the price. But I just cannot deal with such unpolished, unforgiving, unintuitive mechanics. They really ruin what could have been one of my favorite horror games in recent memory.\n\nThere's so much wasted potential here I'm actually mad at the developers.\nWhat a shame...\n\n\n","June 8, 2014","false","5.4"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

This game has originality in SPADES! I am a 23 year old woman, some of the stuff in this game made ME jump, the solutions are not always out there, or easy to solve, and if you're like me with survival horror titles, than this game is a bit hard to progress through, I keep getting lost, or running around in a circular pattern. To NO avail, have I been able to beat this game! It's like Fatal Frame, and Silent Hill without a walkthrough for me, I mean it is obscure, and the puzzles were out there for me, or maybe it is just because I kept getting lost. Lol Great game, though, like I said, like classic games, either navigation, or obscure puzzles did it for me, and impeded all progression. This one, I have not played in awhile, but if I remember correctly, I kept walking in big circles, or getting stuck. I would STILL recommend this to ANYONE! This game is amazing, I will probably play it again here soon, it takes a long time to start up, story and gameplay I mean, it has a slow start. But once you hit the school, feces hits the fan! This game has some notes from my favorite series, "Silent Hill". But this gem is more like, "Fatal Frame" which honestly, is my second favorite horror franchise. I may just buy me an, "I survived All God's Village, and all I got was this stupid shirt!" shirt. I have a P.T. shirt on now. Anyway, I digress. Buy this game if you love horrors, and getting lost!

Hair, grass, you name it, clips into anything. The walking animation for other characters are so robotic and unantural, for a game that was only made last year it looks as if it was made in the middle of the PS2 era at best. And by god the facial animations.\nGameplayThe gameplay is "okay" in not the best way. The whole gimick of the game is to fight back against the ghost using the camera by.... taking pictures? At least fatal frame explained this a little a lot but DreadOut has no explanation on how this can fight back against ghost. Controls are clunky and unresponsive and I had tried so hard to fix a bug where everytime I took a picture, it would almost crash and my fps would go to 10, but to no avail. The ghost are probaly the best part of the game even though there were not enough. I thought they were very creative and tie in to indonesian folklore. Some are a bit stupid though.\n\nStory (No Spoilers)I found the story so so so cliche. The characters were just things to die and were so bland. They were like your cliche horror movie characters, The "spoiled girl thats high maintenance", the "I'm a tough guy jock", and so on. The dialouge was laughable a points but it was expected. The only character I liked was Linda which is our main protaganist, she seemed pretty tough and determined to get out of this hell on earth. The actual story was also no existent, you're in a school with ghost in it, now get out... okay?\n\nConclusionAll in all this game was "bleh" and way to short for $15 I requested a refund and happily got my money back. Please if you played this game and did not like it then request a refund because its worth it. I had to quit and watch a walkthrough of the game because it crashed to often (I have windows) just so I can view the crappy story and the rest of the game.\nRating                                                                                4.5/10","June 6, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

WIth that being said I do love the atomospher of the game, very grully and creepy and everyone likes exploring an abandon school right?\nBut the real problem is that Dreddout doesn't know what it wants to be an action or survival horror, until act 2 I would not recomend this game.","June 3, 2014","false","5.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","2"

But when the game actually got into the meat of what it had to offer, any scares and creepy atmosphere it had, I eventually got acclimated to simply because I was STUCK in it for the longest time scratching my head over where I needed to go and what I needed to do. The game didn't make my objectives very clear beyond "get the keys off the demon you first meet somehow" and then expects you to magically know what you need to do!\n\nWhen I finally did figure out what to do, the game started to pick up again, if briefly, then threw me into an even more vauge puzzle than the last one, and then finally put me in a boss fight that was thankfully easier to figure out how to finish than the puzzles. The majority of this game wasn't me getting to enjoy a terrifying experience the way a proper horror should be. It was just me scratching my head at vauge puzzles! This, I feel was money wasted on my part, and I can't recommend this game to anyone else! If you really want to waste your money on it just to see for yourself what it's like. Be my guest.

Oh, and there was a boss pactically impossible to defeat. I still managed to completed the first act, but I got upset because I had to reload my game again and again after lossing against that boss. So I was not in the mood anymore.\nSince the demo was very appealing, I decided to give Act 2 a tried, hoping that things would get better. Limbo has been fixed, and I have to thanks the developpers for that. Also, the puzzles are much easier to solve. BUT the story is boring, and it seems like it's leading nowhere. You fight some evil creatures along the way, but it's like they're randomly thrown at you, with no real plot. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm really considering to stop right now. I'm not in a difficult situation, I'm just bored.\nDreadOut is a very cheap version of Fatal Frame, and it's sad because it could have been better. The problem is the lack of plot. If you want to fool around, killing evil spirits, it's perfect for you. But if you're searching for a game like Fatal Frame, you might be disappointed.\n","February 15, 2015","false","17.3"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

You won't know that you need to shoot her back.\n8) Have to shoot countless times to know something is wrong with the photo?\n\nOverall:\n\nA good game, but is let-down by not providing a clear and progressive stages to acquiring information and power-ups. If you jumped in and figured out the rudimentary points, you will not be able to proceed any further as you won't know that you have to shoot like in point 8 a certain camera angle from a destroyed ledge to continue the game.\n\nThe developers need to spend more time to finetune gameplay and story progression. It is great that you have a village to explore, but locking gamers to the school afterwards and not guiding them, it gets downright boring fast. I didn't know there was powerups in the game, only after I died 9 times and it was from a statement during limbo stage.\n\nThe use of vignettes to indicate ghosts and information are a great point, but not obvious enough. Gamers are focused to what's onscreen and not observe what's around the screen, like me. Consider providing vibration mode for those who use gamepad controllers like the PC Xbox 360 controllers.\n\nHopefully the developers will redo the entire gameplay and progression once Act 2 is out. Until then, I don't recommend this game to casual gamers.","December 13, 2014","false","1.6"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

And I was truly expecting this indie horror to bring me chills and jumpscares. However, sadly, it just not bring me to that presipice of desired horror thrill. Because frankly, it isn't all what the hype made it out to be. I admit the Fatal Frame, use of camera, is great ode to the one of IF not the best ghost horror game out there. But even with this fun feature, the game just pans out sort of dry and leaving me wondering why I'm not scared. If the clunky moving controls was not a big let down, or the short play time, or the fact that even with my objective notebook I had no idea where to find ONE key i needed to unlock ONE door, wasn't enough to disappoint, it's that DreadOut though with a typical horror plot, did NOT give me that horror feeling. It left me wanting to get my money back. This review is not tended towards the graphic, music or even the lazy character lay out, its towards the direction in which the scares were laid out and gameplay. Go into this game by all means with an open mind, but do not let the hype of a NEW horror game let you not see how DreadOut, is B-horror film at best.

I may have made my judgement too early, as I'm not nearly close to finishing the game. However, playing this game, constantly lost and bored with hardly any jumpscares at all, made me angry. I would love to carry on playing this game, but the lack of direction/storyline deters me.\nI'd much rather play Outlast.\n4/10.","May 16, 2014","false","2.3"," 24 of 62 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","24","62","0","0"

My first playthrough clocking in at the 2 hour mark (for Act 1, Act 2 has not yet been released) was underwhelming.  Much like Fatal Frame, the horror lies mostly in atmosphere.  Initially, the atmosphere works well enough.  Musical cues, ambient noises, with the occasional heavy breathing from the protagonist help drill home that the game wants you to know it is 2spooky4u.\n\nGhost encounters are anti-climatic.  The boar-ghost poses no real threat (hide in a class room, snap photos until he leaves, resume exploring), the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ghost's jumpscare/attack is effective once, and the final encounter is literally a run to the exit repeated three times in a row.  Since you respawn in the same location you "died", you literally have zero reason to fear the ghosts outside of the one or two jumpscares thrown at you.\n\nOh, and there are really only two puzzles in the game.  Three if you separate getting the photo from getting the key (though the photo flat out tells you where to find it, so I don't see that as a puzzle myself).\n\nThe severe lack of ghost encounters, puzzles, and general content is incredibly dissapointing.  There are free horror games which provide many times more content (and are of higher quality) - Phobia 1.5 being a prime example.\n\nAct 2 may redeem Dreadout (once it is released), however Act 1 leaves much to be desired and is not worth it's asking price of $15.  I would, assuming Act 2 does release and does improve, suggest you pay no more than $5 for this game.  Your money can be better spent elsewhere.  Heck, Fatal Frame 1, 2, and 3 are on PSN along with Siren.  You can get Fatal Frame 1 and 2 for 2/3 the price of this.\n\n*Update*\n\nAfter a quick look to the Steam forums, it seems that you're able to return to the town.  After doing so I can report the following:\n\n-You can fight one more ghost.  It's hilariously easy.  Maybe there are more; I didn't encounter any.\n-You can use your camera to see flat / 2D ghosts random float about.  They don't make noises.  They don't attack you.  They are just cardboard cutout ghosts who circle you.\n-You'll meet up with a giant ghost (whom you technically meet later in the main game), who flicks you with it's fingers as if you're a booger.\n\nAll in all that added 10 minutes to my playtime.","May 15, 2014","false","2.4"," 23 of 65 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","23","65","0","1"

The core game does not flow well, player direction is largely vague, and often you're left confused as to how to progress. Even right from the start of the game when your character gets out of the car it can be confusing where you're supposed to go. Most likely while playing this game you'll need to stop every so often and go look it up, which is annoying to have to constantly do. Puzzles, knowing where to go, putting 2 and 2 together, were always a big part of survival-horror games of yore, but in Dreadout's case it's rather vague and things are not clear enough.\n\nGhosts are cool, but some can be initially frustrating until you work out their quirks. Again, game design is somewhat bad here because you're usually left to die repeatedly until you figure out what the game is demanding from you to beat the ghost.\n\nThe game all-in-all is a good effort, the atmosphere is very good, the concept is good, the protaganist has a nice ♥♥♥ :P, but it's unfortunately a bad gaming experience because its flaws are more frustrating and immersion-breaking.","May 16, 2014","false","2.3"," 13 of 44 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","13","44","0","0"

However, the same cannot be said for DreadOut. It's a game that for the first couple of minutes has promise, but then it all disappears.\n\nI like the creature designs. It's a decent variation compared to Fatal Frame, and especially true for the giant ghost that blocks the abandoned town at night. I couldn't work out where he was at all when the orange glow started, but then I spotted his hand. I had to look straight upwards to see its huge orange eyes staring back down at me from the dark. But creature designs can't help when, instead of being scared of the game, you find yourself constantly cursing it.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are so obscure that you can spend hours running around the same small building and never find it. I had to turn to guides more often than I'd like, which pulls you right out of the game. There's no fear when you're just annoyed.\n\nThere was one involving a key to a locked door and a boar with a key around its neck. Finally managed to find the key (after collecting 2 unconnected items and taking a photo in another room), went to the door and nope, it's still locked. Turns out that the key I was after wasn't the key I needed. No, the key I needed was hidden behind a secret door that the key I did have unlocked. How is anyone supposed to figure that out?\n\nAnother is being chased down a long hallway by some massive ghost crawling after you. I'm sprinting for ages and nothing's happening. The ghost is just getting closer and I'm just tiring out. I try the doors along the walls, they're all locked. So I give up and turn to face the ghost. Nope, sent to Limbo. Turns out that there's a secret door along the walls that you can only see with a camera. Great, another thing that won't happen in that situation but is needed to continue.\n\nOh and the fight against the red woman in the second act? You have to die. That's it. Literally, you just wait to die. I spent ages trying to fight her, trying to time my shots and getting no where. Looking for some secret escape route or symbol to photograph. Nope. Just die and accept it.\n\nSometimes the fighting is just irritating. The boar would manage to knock me into a wall and the wall didn't let go. I couldn't move while the boar just devastated me. Then he manages to knock me down but not far enough way. The minute I get up, he knocks me down again. Repeat until dead. The scissor guy did the same multiple times. They just constantly attack, giving you no chance of escape.\n\nThe unskippable cutscenes are frustrating. Sometimes it's just the long duration of some animations, but I sit there thinking 'am I watching a game being played for me, or am I playing it?'. The first half of Act 2 is mostly this sort of thing.\n\nThere's also Limbo. Every single time you die, you get sent to some black void with candles around you. It takes you ages for the character to get up by herself and then you have to run to the floating light with wings. A long waste of time just to put you back where you died. There really is no need for it, especially being blinded.\n\nHad it not been so frustrating, I'd have liked this game. As it stands, I'm only doing this for achievements. It's not scary, it's not entertaining. It's just annoying.","November 1, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sounds were preatty nice at making me feel like a ghost was constantly stalking me... at first until you realise you just gotta keep track when the sound changes (since its a constant loop when nothings happening) and also couse theres nothing near by if the screen doesnt goes red and the character walk isnt on alert, which took all the horror from the game and all that was left were jump scares from not taking a pic as fast as you thought you could couse the gameplay is verry clunky, aswell as fps randomly droping (probably from all the objects being loaded when going from one room to the other or maybe its just windows 10).\n\nFor those who like playing in windowed mode to multitast, the game wont let you for some reason.\n\nI like to explor everything in games and even tho i found some interesting things like there was an object called an eris on a rock... but sadly all it says is that its a object with mistical powers flowing through it. kinda makes me not want to explore anything.\n\nThe theme song is really fun and I would still recomend to atleast watch it on youtube.","March 17","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here's how I feel it panned out.\n\nCons:\nJanky Controls-  It's third person, but your character is off to the side, not center of the screen.  Takes a while to get used to.\nCombat is awful-  Stopped playing after about an hour of the scissor boss cutting me up.  The static you need on the camera to hit a ghost doesn't always appear when it should, so when the boss is super fast and running across the room it won't consider dead on shots with the camera a 'hit'.  Then he combos you dead in about 2 seconds.  It was super frustrating.\n\nPros:\nNeat Atmosphere:  It wasn't super original, but it was fairly affective.\nGhost Design:  Based on Indonisian ghosts, it was fun to learn about their legends whenever I 'caught' them.\nGreat butt on protagonist:  Seriously one of the best rendered booties in a long time.

How well do these balance out?  Let's put it this way.  Normally, I list the bad things first so we can end off the review on a positive note.  I'm going the other way around this time because otherwise, you may never see the pros.\n\nPros: The story.  Actually something different from the usual "ghosts just want to kill you".\nGreat variety of ghosts, in large part because they are taken from Asian legends and not the usual North American and European ones.\nPossessed Ira's dialog and actions really stand out. I mean, to the point where I wondered if they subcontracted out that part of the game.\nNice variety of ways to deal with the ghosts.\nCons: INCREDIBLY awkward dialog and animations.  I half thought Linda and Ira were already dead or possessed from the way they interacted at the beginning of Act I.\nLook, I get that Linda's a silent protagonist, but for the love of all that's holy, please work the dialog so that it's not all awkward silences.\nReally bad translations at times\nTranslations for written language (especially signs) would have been nice. I get that we're not in an English speaking country, but Linda is probably supposed to be able to read Indonesian.  Or is that enabled along with subtitles?\nGhosts that don't act the way their entries say they will.  All those man-hating ghosts?  Not really sure why they're so hostile to Linda.\nIt was definitely unclear to me what I was supposed to do with the camera at first. Act 0 gives you the basic idea that some ghosts only appear there, but there was no indication that the flash would actually hurt them.  The hint text merely tells you they might be startled.\nHow slowly Linda move when the camera is up.\nHow slowly Linda moves the camera up and down. (Lag)\nHow slowly Linda does anything when ghosts are nearby (Laaaaaaag)\nPuzzles with random solutions.  Why that one mirror?  Why not?\nThe devs really need to rethink their autosave/respawn policy.  In Act 0, I kept respawning to the exact spot I died in, only the enemies were still there. And since Linda took forever to move her camera up (see above), I couldn't break out of the loop.  I figured I could just reload the save point, but guess what?  It autosaved with the enemies on top of me.  Nothing I could do but replay the entire Act.\nThe stage where there are 4 objects you need to hit the ghost 4 times.  I died after breaking the first object, but when I respawned, the object was already broken, yet the ghost still needed all 4 hits.\nAt one point, I could no longer hurt the Sundel Bolong.  The camera just had no effect whatsoever. Exiting and reloading did nothing. I had to go the rest of the game unable to do anything but run away from her.  Which made boss battles that much more annoying.\nThere are, in fact, times when your survival is entirely a matter of luck. During the locust attack, for example, you are unable to raise your camera, yet are attacked by a ghost that cannot be seen without the camera. Nice.\nThe alternate ending looks like it was thrown together at the last minute.\nInconsistent rules. Invisible barriers are bad enough, but to hit them during a chase sequence?  Grrr.  Why on earth does the SLR flash behave completely differently depending on whether you take a photo or not?\nI dunno, maybe if this franchise is given to more experienced devs, we could have something really good on our hands.  Otherwise, I'm just going to watch somebody else play it on YouTube.  Some games just need more polish.  This one has so little polish, it's practically still a rock.","January 12","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, that sounds a little crazy, but the game has a strong impact on the player in many ways, and even if at first it might give you this cheesy J-Horror vibe, I urge you to play on and give it a chance because most likely you'll really enjoy (or hate, but in a good way!) this experience.\n\nWhat makes this game even better is the Indonesian setting and how much it draws on that lore. Frankly, the ideas of spirits and demons in their mythology are pretty messed up and creepy, and even reading about them is scary, but seeing them in the game itself is just downright scary. Also, the game does use the phone and its abilities quite well, and overall this one reminded me of some of those classic third-person horror games on the PlayStation in the late-1990s, but married with modern graphics and a really great story. It's a bit buggy in places, though, but I found that none of the bugs were more than quirks to get past.\n\nPersonally, I feel the asking price is more than fair on this one, and if you are a fan of a very solid horror experience and are looking for something that gives both a strong atmosphere AND some good jumpscares, you really need to give DreadOut a chance!\n\nFrom a 0 to 10, where 5 is an "average" score, this game rates in as:\n\n=======================\nVERY GOOD...... 8 / 10\n=======================","May 31","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Linda, her classmates and teacher arrive at a mysterious village. Linda and the others find themselves trapped in the village with no other option but to continue onwards. The story takes place in the aforementioned village, an old school, and a mansion.\n\nThe most frustrating aspect of DreadOut is how unclear the objectives are. The objectives are most vague and rarely offer any helpful direction or advice to advance in the game. Most of the game time logged in the game will be trying to figure out the puzzles and how to advance to the next section.\n\nWhilst it is not the most graphically impressive game, DreadOut makes up for that with an interesting story and setting. If DreadOut had a bigger budget, this game could have been even more brilliant.\n\nRegardless of the faults, DreadOut is a game that all fans of horror ought to try.","June 5","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
