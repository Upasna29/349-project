This game lacks new players which every ♥♥♥♥♥♥me needs. At the time i'm writing this review, only 20 houses are available, and almost all of them are the experienced players so it's almost impossible for a new player to get used to it.

I love the concept of this game.  It's really a great idea behind it.\n\nThe problem for me is that the game itself has trouble matching up to that actual concept.  I don't think this is the developer's fault at all.  He clearly has tried to balance the game as much as is possible.  It's just that it quickly devolves into a sort of class system.  If you've got a ton of money, you can protect your house amazingly well and do some incredibly intricate work.  If you don't have a ton of money, you're pretty much screwed, because you can't protect anything well at all.  And the problem here is that being able to get more money depends on robbing some other houses of people who do have money... meaning that you're up against near-impossible traps and schemes.\n\nAnd another issue for me is the family mechanic.  Having a family prevents you from doing some things for protection because you need to have a clear path for them to escape.  But as soon as someone kills your family, you're actually in many ways BETTER OFF, because it means you can make even crazier traps.  The amount of additional income they add just doesn't make up enough for the amount of people who will die trying to rob your house if you're able to make some of the more deadly setups.\n\nAgain, I don't think that any of this is the fault of the developer.  There have been a bunch of updates since the first alpha that have attempted to improve this situation.  Unfortunately, it almost seems like it is a limitation in the concept itself - one that takes all the fun out of it for anyone who is starting out.  I really wanted to like this game, but I just haven't been able to despite checking in after many different versions/updates.","January 29, 2014","false","0.1"," 477 of 627 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","477","627","0","23"

You are not given enough resources to protect your own meager safe, nor go out and rob someone else's.\n\nI have a feeling only those who have been playing a long time have been able to experience the intricate trap building that should be accessible to every player in this game; and is in fact the primary allure of purchasing The Castle Doctrine in the first place.  For new players, however, the game is simply a race to rip off someone else whose stash is as equally completely defenseless as yours.\n\nFor new players, this is not a thinking man's game.  You don't spend your time solving puzzles and building.  Instead, you leave your "castle" empty so you can attempt to rip off other new players, as they too cannot afford defenses.  While you are out you're hoping you aren't ripped off from someone more powerful or equally desperate, so you can put together some funds.  Improving your situation isn't possible in practice.  You are barely even given enough money in the beginning to properly wall off an area, let alone build a simple logic trap, or electrified door.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Perpluid/recommended/249570/","Perpluid","Devlin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Perpluid/","476 products in account","In the games current state, I would not recommend it. There is absolutely no help for you once you jump in the game, no tooltips or tutorials whatsoever. There is a user guide which was very helpful to me, but I don't think that people should have to rely on guides to figure out the basics of a game. It's all pretty much trial and error for noobies, and can be very overwhelming with all the different types of blocks and such, especially when you have no idea what any of them do. While trial and error is good and all, when it's the only way you have to learn the game's mechanics, it becomes quite tedious. I also think some of the games mechanics need to be reworked - such as dying in your own home. In order to finish booby-trapping your house, you have to reach your vault yourself, which I think makes perfect sense. However, if you die while testing out your defenses, you start over from scratch. Sure it makes sense, but I think the player should just simply be cut a break here. How are we supposed to know if a certain trap works if we can't test it ourselves? There's also a five minute rule. In which if you are inactive for five minutes, the game kills you off; this happens even if you are testing your own home. As far as I understand the developer is frequently updating the game so I'd advise waiting for a few patches to roll out before trying this game.\n\nEdit: After playing a bit more of the game I'm starting to realize how broken it is. Rather than using clever traps that require the robber to think in order to break into the vault, I'm finding most people just use simple game-breaking tactics that make it pure luck if anyone succesfully robs you. An example of this that I've seen quite often is making columns with walls with a door at the end of each one, behind one door is their vault, behind every other is a pitbull ready to bite your face off. That is just one of many examples I've seen, which makes robbing other people's houses nearly impossible. This game is a great idea and I hope the developer can find a way to fix these issues, but until then this game is not worth your money.\n\nSecond edit: The game can certainly be fun, after doing some research on traps, tools, etc. via the wiki and understanding the game a bit more it became pretty addicting. I still would not recommend this game because robbing others houses is just simply too hard. There's many cheap tactics you can use and in most cases I find myself either stepping inside someone's house, turning around and leaving, or walking around a bit and end up dead with everything I worked for lost. The addicting/fun part of this game for me is building my house, then watching people attempt to run through it, while killing my family in the process. Robbing others is just way too risky, and about 99% of the time will end up getting you killed. As a lot of others have mentioned, there is also a huge level of unfairness depending on how much money you have. I think that as long as the people on the top of the list don't get themselves killed from robbing others, then they'll just stay at the top from people trying to rob them (you get a bounty reward when robbers die inside your house). These giant maze-like houses become literally impossible to break into after a certain point, when just one false step can end up being fatal; and with dozens of doors to choose from, it's pure luck if anyone were to ever succeed. Definitely could use some balancing - for starters I'd suggest raising the measly $2,000 starting cash; even an extra $500 would be enough to make a difference. Whether it be more money to defend your home, or buy tools to break into someone elses, or have more in your vault to attract robbers attention to get their bounty, or more money for them if they successfully rob you - the more money that goes around, the better. As long as it doesn't go to the rich scumbags, haha.\n\nFeature requests: Due to how often you die in this game, it would be nice to have layout saves, which would be especially useful for the start of the game. There's not a whole lot you can do with the beginning $2,000, so once you find a starting layout that you like it'd be nice to not have to build it over and over again each time you die. It would be useful for the end-game as well, and maybe the developer didn't add it in because he didn't want people to use the same layout each time, but I know that a majority of people will find one they like and stick with it rather than going through the trouble of coming up with a new one, if the developer wants them to or not; so a layout feature would just make it less of a hassle.\n\nSecondly, because of how hard it is already to rob peoples houses, I don't think that you should lose every item in your backpack if you make it out alive. Dropping the items to make room for their cash in the vault makes sense.\n\nThird, improve the search at the menu. As of now you can only search by name, and the list is sorted by richest to poorest. Add some more filters, such as "people who robbed you" or "sort by poorest", even the option to search by money rather than name would be nice. Obviously the people with the most money will have the hardest houses to break into, so if you're starting out you could try breaking into some low/mid-tier houses instead.\n\nLastly, a hand tool when building your house. When making a mistake while building you have to flip through the different items/blocks/animals and re-place them where you want them. It would be much easier and speed up the process if I had a hand tool that allowed me to just pick stuff up and drop it somewhere else, which could then be doubled as a tool that let me select multiple items by dragging a box, and moving them all at once.","January 29, 2014","false","11.9"," 97 of 118 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","97","118","0","1"

As a note: I played the Alpha before this version was released so my playtime is actually above what is listed here.\n\nGiven the locked price after release there will be two problems, the player base will stagnate (making the game even worse) and only the 'hardcore' fans will stay playing (again, making the game even more difficult for newbies and therefore worse). I will be very surprised if he does make it, but this game is not Minecraft so it really shouldn't follow that pricing model. It has very little appeal and it has very little replay value, and I would hardly consider it an "MMO".\n\nThis is not "hur-dur the graphics sux". This is just saying the gameplay is too vague with regards to what you have to do. As other reviewers said, it's better if your family is out of the equation, and it's only really easy to keep your house well protected and your family up there if you have enough cash.\n\nUnless he goes back to the drawing board and rebalances the entire game and makes actual "neighborhoods" and improves on how the game plays, looks, controls, and feels this game will just remain unplayable. A game should be fun, and this game just isn't.\n\nFor now, I'd recommend playing some other "MMO" if you're into actually doing something. This is just 'fix up your house and wait for someone to either rob you blind or kill your family or you die trying to do the same'. Kind of boring. There's really nothing extra in this 'game' to do.\n\nI actually regret buying this 'game' and I feel kind of bad giving it a negative review because it is a good concept just horribly executed.","January 29, 2014","false","0.2"," 224 of 318 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","224","318","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibcob/recommended/249570/","kibcob","•","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibcob/","242 products in account","The Castle Doctrine had a very nice thought, yet was terribly executed.\n\nFor one, the game is hyper-realistic. when trying to get to your vault by testing your traps, you can actually die by your traps. And I mean literally die, so you have to start all over again. even the smallest change to your house will make you test it again. Another thing is that you can give your wife a shotgun as a defense, and she will kill you.\n\nNext, there is interface. While playing, I felt very, very enclosed. no real menus, you only get to see one kind of screen, and most of the time it's just black darkness. It alwas uses re-ocurring colors like grey, orange, dark cyan and black. it seems very bland and boring to just look at.\n\nGraphics aside, we are onto gameplay. My gosh, is it hard to even take a step. you start off in house with your wife and kids and $2000. You can either use the money to build your house, or you can use it to get robbing equipment. Oh, and by the way, the main premice of the game is to rob people or steal robbers' bounty. You can go to the list of countless people and rob their houses, but you know you can't. Somehow, someway, everyone on that list has figured out the perfect way to protect thier house and get tons of ca$h. So how do you win? You can't. You'll try , but after about 5 minutes you realise that no mattter what you try to do, it's impossible to get more than your base $2000.\n\nTo sum it up, The Castle Doctrine is not worth half it's price. It's badly made, which will make you expect much more. But no, I pretty much told everything in this review. I thing the price for $16 dollars asking for waaaayy to much, so it should be down to $5. Anyways, the promotional sale was literally the only discount ever on this game.It's literally in the announcement. So if you have $16 to burn, do NOT use it here. Please use it somewhere else.

It's really hard for me to call it a game, to be honest.  I could write about how broken the progression is, or how buggy it is, how awfully coded and designed it is, and how people are hacking it to pieces essentially destroying the entire purpose of it being an MMO, but I feel those subjects have already been covered enough by plenty of other people.\n\nWhat I would rather discuss is the price and its relation to what the product is actually worth.\n\nEverything here feels like an experiment, from the "game" itself, to the pricing, to even the developer's lifestyle, and really in the end the customer as well as the health of the community are the ones paying the price.  The developer's "anti-sales" stance means the community will only die over time and never flourish.  For a "game" that trys to promote itself as an MMO, it means a unsustainable fanbase.  Anyone joining at this time will surely find only the super hardcore players and an even smaller window of opporotunity to learn the mechanics and to get better, from an already overly harsh learning curve.\n\nWant to suggest anything at all and provide feedback?  Well, apparently unless you've put in hundreds of hours of gametime, the community and the developer want nothing to do with you, and will freely attack you and assume even the tiniest suggestion means you want to turn the entire game inside out.  Ask to streamline the learning curve in anyway and you'll be accused by players that you are a terrible gamer and can't handle the (bad) design, or that you're just wanting permadeath removed (Like I was accused of).  It doesn't matter that a large majority of games I play and love most are brutally challenging games with permadeath as their prime feature (games like Spelunky, Binding of Isaac, FTL, etc), in their eyes I wanted permadeath removed.  I even saw the developer personally tell his players that were hoping for more from it that "the game's not for you", which just seemed rude and completely self-sabotaging.\n\nOne could argue that this "game" is okay in the end, just like how you could squint your eyes hard enough to make a whale into a supermodel, its a neat experiment concept in theory but really what brings this down is the price.  There are players who do enjoy the game so it is possible that you will also.  But it's just a question of whether or not you're willing to put down the $16 to find out whether or not this experiment fits you, which is a big pricetag for a "probably not".  The game is nowhere NEAR worth $16, there are $1-2 iPhone/Android games that are almost twice or more what this game offers.  I love experiemental games, I love when developers push the boundries of what defines a game, but usually the price is adjusted and recognized for what it's actually worth.\n\nI read the developer first tell new players to "put more time into it before judging it" which is fair, but then I saw him say to another who did put the time into it and still didn't like the game that because he had all those hours that he should consider it being worth the price.  I also read a statement from him saying that there are players who put hundreds of hours into his game, and therefore that justifies the pricetag.  But I could play with my own rectal filth for a thousand hours, and that wouldn't make it worth anything more then what it actually is.","March 18, 2014","false","7.0"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","32","37","0","1"

The author often touted how he doesn't believe in Steam sales and I thought that was respectable so I preordered to get a small discount.  Big mistake.  It's rare I regret game purchases, but this is some major buyer's remorse here.  This game is about as bare-bones as it can get.

It's very easy to create a set of traps that are 100% guess work and one step in the wrong direction and it's impossible to escape.\n\nAt the end of the day, this just isn't a fun or good game.

Probably won't play it ever again now unless there's another contest like it. I say "fun" because certain parts of the game are fun, but I don't think there's incentive to make me actually WANT to play the game without real money dangling there as an incentive.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's an incredibly addictive game, just for all the wrong reasons. For example, my labyrinth of a house took a number of hours to make during the last day of the contest, which I HAD to do all in one sitting as leaving it alone half finished would have certainly lost me all of my resources while I was away. This wasn't the first house I'd fully decked out either, so if it weren't for the real money incentive, I wouldn't have even have got this far.\n\nThen come Steam launch night, a new burst of enjoyment came from watching new players dying in my house and from some easy robberies on their new houses. However, that same night, albeit after I'd gone to bed and left my house alone for a few hours, one of the worst (but most well funded) robbers I've ever seen tore through every single cerebral trap in my home, along with most of the walls, doors, dogs and children just because he had 100 of every tool on hand.\n\nAfter dying trying to salvage and repair the intricate maze that took so long to make with my funds now at zero... what's the motivation to start again? I mean, what's the point in making a masterpiece of a puzzle when someone is just going to set it on fire as soon as you go to sleep?

Amazingly unrealistic there. A powered door cost $240, while the crowbar to circumvent that powered door costs $2400. Pricing is terrible in this game. Drugged/unconscious pit bulls will kill you if you step over them again.\n\nThe most common types of houses are:\n\nPlayers creating intricate mazes that only they know the path for. Causing you to run through and commit to paths from the very beginning, only to find out after you've committed to several paths, that you actually took the wrong one. So you die, lose your house, and any tools you had go bye-bye.\n\nHouses with multiple-multiple-multiple-multiple choice paths for you to choose. Also forcing you to commit with each turn, once again only to find out that you've gone down the wrong path. You die again, lose your house, and lose your tools.\n\nCombination locks. !@#$ing EVERYWHERE!!! We're going to force you to commit(again) by passing this powered door, pressing this button and the powered door closes behind you. Then have you guess a 6-12 digit combination, ALL of which are sticky pressure plates which are surrounded by concrete and steel walls... everywhere. You're not getting out. You might as well suicide.\n\nEntering a house(which has very little money as far as the list is concerned). The house seems cheap, being mostly wood and all. Force you to commit down a certain path only to find out a few steps later that there's steel and concrete everywhere. Well !@#$. This could be fixed by using smaller houses and the camera staying centered on your character.\n\nWhen you see the same garbage everywhere, and everyone pretty much does the same thing just because it's 'that' effective... it kind of sucks the fun out of the game for everyone except for those watching the 'security tapes' and laughing their asses off at anyone attempting to rob them and dying.\n\nLack of the ability to save a layout in the game for a $1000-1500 layout that works until you get a little more money. The  inability to sell your current house objects once you've proved your house was 'fair'. The camera does not stay centered on your character and some people take advantage of this.\n\nI'm sure everyone who buys a game expects a certain amount of fun to frustration ratio. This game has been %10 fun to %90 frustration.\n\nThe player-base is going to suffer hardcore with or without sales.\n\nWhy?\n\nThere are going to be players with a ton of money, and no one trying to rob them because you have no new players and you don't make the game fun enough to keep playing. Or simply because everyone is afraid to lose all of their high value stuff by dying. This will cause a stalemate in the game between any of the high value players.\nIf someone whom has a ton of money tries to rob someone and dies or someone actually manages to rob them, they're going to stop playing because they don't care to take the incredible amount of time and effort to build up their castle like they did previously.\n\n\nBut hey, what do I know. I'm just another guy with an opinion. I want my money back, and I want this game off of my Steam library just as much as Dogfighter.","February 1, 2014","false","19.5"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","1"

Sadly, this isn't so much a difficult game as a discouraging game. Don't get me wrong, I like the premise a lot, and I enjoy the idea of playing this game with friends, trying to guess whose house belongs to who, with all of that kind of fun social dynamic attached when you finally penetrate a house's defenses. Sadly, playing the game as presented on the public server is an exercise in pointlessness.\n\nTo begin with, the game has extremely far beyond frustrating game flow that actively discourages experimentation to a degree I can't really explain very well using words. Despite really wanting to like the game, I was done after the second day of ownership. Experimentation of any type, with your own house's design or with exploring those of others, is 'rewarded' by completely losing the house's entire design if you make any mistakes whatsoever anywhere, either in its wiring or in negotiating the house's solution. Despite well-matching the game's design philosophy, the fundamental reality of this situation is that you will spend over 95% of your game time rebuilding nearly identical houses with the almost no money you're forced to start with.\n\nThe ease of death is really overstated, it's very easy to avoid dying provided no one with an entire inventory full of guns and saws really wants your money. That said, after rebuilding the same house for the fourth time, I lost pretty much all desire to look at anyone else's houses. And, of course, if you make a mistake wiring your own house and end up in your own trap, well. It's time to start over. Unlike a 'roguelike', instead of being able to pick the game up immediately when you die and try again doing something fun like exploring an unknown cavern and collecting loot or what have you, you're forced to rebuild your entire house once again from literally nothing. If this review is starting to seem repetitive, that's because that's what the game is like.\n\nIn conclusion, one gets the feeling that the game was primarily designed for people who are unemployed, don't have kids, and probably can't be bothered to cook for themselves, or generally do any of the other things that people value their time for.

The first is that the risk reward ratio of robbing a house generally just isn't worth it. If you really commit to trying to make it through a house, you are far more likely to die than you are to make it through, the survival rates on most the listed houses back this up. The fact that you will fail to rob the house is not the problem however, the problem is how harshly you are punished for failing. You lose everything, your house, your money, Everything, and have to start the game over from scratch. Because of this, nobody ever wants to try to rob anyone else once they have a decent amount of money and a house established. 99% of the people who try to rob you have just started a new character and have not yet invested any time in building their own defenses (you can tell they are brand new because they are only worth $200 bounty if they die to one of your traps). The strategy tends to be to spawn a new character, spend the starting $2000 on robbery gear, and try to rob a house that has around $10k and build your house with the money. After that you don't rob houses anymore and you just sit back and watch people try to rob you.\n\nIf the game were to make failure less punishing I think things could be a lot more interesting. I do think having permadeath in the game is probably a good idea because it leads to people building new traps and whatnot, but I don't think permadeath should be the punishment for your first failure.\n\nI think that with each death players should have to pay an increasing sum of money, starting low but working up to large amounts, and if they can't pay then they suffer permanent death of their current character. Perhaps the amount increment would drop over time as well so you never reached a point where the cost was so high a character would never try to rob a house again.\n\nI'm not sure my suggestion is the perfect solution, but I really do feel that the game would be considerably more fun if players other than brand new characters were trying to commit robberies as well.","February 2, 2014","false","18.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AkuWelkin/recommended/249570/","AkuWelkin","Welkin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AkuWelkin/","575 products in account","This game has an amazing concept that is close to working, with a few problems. Imagine this, a game where you design base defenses and attack other player's defenses, and if you die (either on your own or the other players... yes you need to navigate your own defenses) you start completely over.\n\nIt's a really fun game, but the problem is how you get money, by having people attack your base or attacking other people. To be any degree of safe you need to buy items to go attack people, which costs money (that you don't have in the beginning). If your base gets raided you lose half your money and all your items (which consists of most of the money if you are killing people with your defenses). People will also attack you when you are logged off. The amount of items people will bring as well as their commitment to attacking is based on how much money you have, so you need a powerful enough defense to defend against the level of player willing to attack you. This takes constant monitoring because if you don't return to your house every so often, the money value will increase past the level of defenses and people will destroy your house and you will be worse than square one.\n\nSo I would only recommend this game if you want to constantly monitor and be wary of your house, as this escalation will continue even when you try to 'log out'. It was fun for a while, but after I realize there was no way to 'turn off' the game to take a break from it, you can't play this game unless you're willing to commit.\n\n\nHere is an example of what the game plays like----------\nThis is how I got a really super powerful house, and how I lost it:\n\nI got lucky and broke into several low level houses with a couple low level items, and got enough money to make a fairly powerful house. I sat this house at the ~3k value range (by spending all excess money on improvements) allowing people to continually die and upgrading every 30 minutes. You need to continually upgrade to keep the value lower and prevent people from breaking in with more items.\n\nOnce the house was powerful enough I sat it at the ~30k value range - people were now breaking in with a LOT of items, but my house could stand up to them! Well, after several hours of letting people break in and upgrading I logged out - thinking this would make my house inaccessible - and went to sleep. Later that day I logged in and found my house has reached  over 300k value (woah), but someone broke in and stole everything, leaving me with half my cash money which was around 3k gold (most the value was in items), and also having to fix all the destruction to my house (which stays when someone is successful). After fixing the problems I had 300 gold left, which does not attract anyone to break in and die.\n\nSince I had no money to invest in items and noone was dying I tried raiding low level houses without items, but most of the ones I ran into were ones similar to mine, obviously a lot of money was sunk into them but they had very little cash reserves likely due to someone raiding them.\n\nI ended up dying by accidentally walking to my own pit in my own house after trying to make my house easier to break into to tempt lower level players... time to start over.\n\n-----\n\nEvery time I start to get the ball rolling I hit a random snag here or there: someone finds a way to break traps I didn't think about, I accidentally fall for a trap I think I'm being safe about, I accidentally die in my own house due to having to run my entire defenses every time I make a change, etc.\n\nEach snag does make me a better player, but also makes me have to start over again... and without good luck (or maybe a friend who can go die in your house) getting that ball rolling is difficult.","February 1, 2014","false","267.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It describes what the game was like when the community was vivid and bustling (it was a very fun game back then). Nowadays almost no one plays this game and the few houses that remain are very much unbreakable.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to enjoy this game you need to accept it's rules:\n\n*There's not going to be any hand-holding, you're supposed to learn how to play the game by trial-and-failure. Some of the best experiences from this game come from experimenting by your own initiative and gradually learning better methods to build and destroy trap systems. Tutorials would only ruin all the fun of learning by dying or getting robbed.\n\n*This is not a puzzle game. Don't come in with any illusions that you are going to be able to simply figure out the solutions to other players houses by using your smarts. Efficient homes are designed in such a way that their solution cannot be seen and if you try to take a guess the odds will be staggeringly against you. In order to defeat a home what you really need is to make the best use of your available tools in order to disable the houseowner's traps.\n\n*There is a big gap between the experienced players and the newcomers, but it's a fair one. There is no 'leveling up' or gaining 'experience' for killing enemies here, the only thing that separates the veterans from the noobs is the very things that The Castle Doctrine is all about; tactics and deception. The players who are up in the top are there solely because they know how to manage their risks and have figured out techniques to build houses that are very hard to penetrate. You won't stand a chance against the home of a top player before you have learned how to scout and hold a sizable wealth of your own.\n\n*This game requires patience. You start with only $2000 and that will not be enough money to build a house that will make you reasonably safe from other players. In order to build a decent house you need use your starting 2k to buy tools and rob richer players, in this process of trying your luck against the rich you will die (a lot), but you need to keep trying because eventually you will succeed. Then, after your success, it's time to stop dying and start seeing other players die in the deathtrap that you have built for them.\n\n*This is a frustrating game and you need to be careful. Due to the permadeath mechanic you can lose everything that you have worked on due to one single wrong step. This rather harsh rule actually makes the game far more interesting and tense, it means that every time you defeat another player you get the knowledge that he has been completely ruined and additionally it means that you become afraid of your own house because every time you make a modification to it you are supposed to go into your own deathtrap and reach your safe in order to prove that what you have created is solvable, during these 'self-tests' you can die. You will feel in your own skin how this machine that you have created to kill other players can be extremely dangerous even to yourself.\n\n*Your family is supposed to be a burden. Just like in real life, eh? In this game you play the role of the father of a stereotypical white american nuclear family in the 90's, you have the duty and responsibility of protecting them. Other players will try to kill your wife and kids because they are a weakness and killing them can make your home more vulnerable.\n\n*The goal is just to stay alive. There are really no overarching goals in this game other than trying to survive and rising above other players in the charts. However, all homes eventually fall. Even if you make a house so good that it kills practically every burglar that enters it you still cannot avoid attracting the attention of the more skilled and well equipped thieves and once those guys set their sights on your home they will take you out... Unless you can take them out first, but for how long can you keep others from emerging?\n\nIf you can accept those things and if you refuse to rage quit you're going to realize that The Castle Doctrine might quite be the best multiplayer out there. Also: Visit the official forums, we have a nice community and it's fun to share your gameplay experiences there.","March 3, 2014","true","60.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","2"

You need to think like a robber and try to trick people into walking into the traps on scouting runs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slaphappyamericanos/recommended/249570/","slaphappyamericanos","JackT8ers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slaphappyamericanos/","36 products in account","The Castle Doctrine is a highly original video game filled with challenges for even the best chess players. The gameplay is split between two tasks: building defenses to protect your vault and your family, and raiding your neighbors' houses for money and tools. The layers of planning that a good home defense require are extensive, and numerous strategies exist for both creating and overcoming creative traps.\nThe economy of the game is intelligently designed- players begin with enough money to build basic traps and buy tools for raiding. The tools, in essence, are used for destroying traps- and the more expensive the tool, the better the traps it can break. Balancing your funds between upgrading your own security and breaking into others' houses is a challenge.\nThe tricky part comes when you have to test your defenses. Any defense you build must let someone (hypothetically) reach your vault without any tools. (It should be noted that it does not have to be possible to reach the family unarmed, so as long as there are no traps in their path, one could line the hallway to one's family with pit bulls.) Unfortunately, it is possible for someone's house to become impregnable when it is raided- mobile creatures (such as pit bulls) could end up in positions that guarantee that no one else gets through to the vault. In addition, a vault that has been raided becomes empty, and reaching it no longer grants the raider an escape. This is part of the risk inherent in robbery though: it's always possible that someone else has screwed things up for you to get their own share of the loot.\nThere is one major flaw in the game, however. When testing your own security to prove it can be breached, accidentally triggering a deadly trap kills you, forcing you to start over. You can test these traps with various devices that indicate electric current without harming you, but it can be a pain when you have to start fresh because of a small mistake in building your own house. This part of the game seems unnecessary, as it only punishes players who make dumb mistakes designing their defenses, and the punishment is death.\nAll things considered, The Castle Doctrine is a great game if you want a fun, challenging robbery sim that lets you play both sides.","February 7, 2014","true","13.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Or maybe it was a few updates prior to that.\n\nI've been a long-term Jason Rohrer fan and enjoyed Castle Doctrine up until a certain point.  Like a lot of games - comparably Rust - you need to devote a lot of time to CD, but also be aware that all that time can be robbed from you by a more experienced/wealthier player.\n\nYou build a house with the starting cash of $2000 using the various tools that are given to you all in the hopes of protecting your family (expendable) and your cash (expendable, but you really want to keep it safe).  It's almost like game design within a game.  You need to find a way to exploit any potential thief that enters your home on a meager budget, and then hope that when they die/give-up, you can upgrade your house with the items that they (hopefully) left behind.\n\nI used to compare the building experience as a somewhat psychological experience.  While building your home, you needed to think like the robber and anticipate their every move.  Will they open this door or the other?  Will they break through this wooden wall or the metal one beside it?  Anticipating the players action can be beneficial to your own progresss in CD.\n\nThe downfall of this game was the players on the wealthy spectrum.  They've built systems utilizing floor-pads that need to be pressed at the right time, in the right order or maybe not at all, and the wrong move means you die or the door (out of many doors) leading forward will be perma-locked.  There can be so much going on behind the walls of some of these houses that it's hard to just guess.  You can brute-force it, but the only people capable of that are the people you're robbing.  That's why this game is officially broken.\n\nA VERY strong "do NOT buy".","February 5","false","79.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

That is, you build a decently devious house with some dead ends and electricity for cheap death traps, with the safe behind some random door. After a day, perhaps 3-4 people will have died in your house, giving you a bounty of about 100$ or more each, which you can then spend to further extend the size of your trap er I mean house.\n\nIf you want to have fun, you have another approach to take, which actually benefits the new players. You can choose to spend your money on *gear* and go try to break/pillage houses. The reason this game is relatively dull is because, apart from its most elegant graphics and tutorial (not), it actually punishes you pretty severely when you die; you have to start completely over.\n\nThe point is, that there is no clear victory or progress. When you do rob someone, then immediately you have to secure your safe into a more safe position, upgrading your fortifications and making the way to your money more confusing and deadly. If you are idle for 5 minutes, you automatically leave the house, making it vulnerable to attack. Sometimes, you can find an easy 2,000$ by finding someone who has not built anything but instead left their house for any reason.\n\nI could recommend it, simply based on how it is kind of logical, kind of puzzle-y, and so forth, but the absolute truth is that it just isn't your typical entertainment, and it somehow makes you wish that the general idea was carried into a more complete game, with upgradable room to build your house, a second or third story, the option to have a turn-based or real-time kind of interaction that lets you decide between buttons or reflexes, and a bunch of other really quite interesting things that simply are not done.\n\nOn the point of inspiring creativity, it does actually create a space for puzzle-craft. Where it fails is simply that it could be more visually appealing, it could offer a greater variety of tools for defense and offensive style of play, it could allow for coordination and teamwork rather than a strange list that magically "knows" exactly how much money is there, and therefore takes all the mystery out of things.

First of all, it's extremely unbalanced and the starting money the game gives you is absolutely not enough. The game itself begins on a cool concept, but a tremendous amount of mistakes makes it barely playable. And even for the few people who will manage to play it correctly, it won't even be fun for a long time... Last but not least, the game is 15€ ! I know it's still not really high if you compare it to some high-priced games today, but those high-priced games at least can give some fun for more time ! With that money, you could buy much, much better games.\n\nWhile the developers surely had tons of very interesting ideas, once those ideas went into the actual game, it all became a huge mess and surely isn't at all what the developers did intend to do. When I feel like a game disappointed me so much that I wish I never bought it, that's a pretty bad sign, because that's very rare. And I felt that with The Castle Doctrine. I just feel like I wasted money, that's how frustrated it makes me after hours of playing !\n\nAlso, usually, a lot of games have a single player mode. While this game directly states it's going to be multiplayer only, when a game doesn't have a single player mode, then the multiplayer one really has to be ace. Seeing how this one is flawed and frustrating (and not for good reasons), it doesn't justify spending "so much" (for a minimalistic game, I mean) money into it.\n\nWhen I say it's not frustrating for the good reasons, let me explain. In a game like Dark Souls for instance, when you die, it's frustrating. While you lose your souls (the money and experience of the game, which is very important), you do not lose your whole character, meaning that there is an overall progression that can be hindered by those deaths if you are not careful enough, but at least, in addition of being frustrating, it's rewarding. In the Castle Doctrine, I never felt rewarded at any point, even after robbing a high-valued house successfully. Because I could barely make myself a decent defense (and seeing how many griefers there are in the game, it barely counts unless you are REALLY rich)\n\nHow to sum-up if you didn't felt like reading all of this ? Frustrating and not rewarding, boring, expensive for such a minimalistic game, and the game doesn't match up to the concept. Definitely, I couldn't recommend it to anyone. Watching videos of it and looking at the concept is just filling your head with illusions, seriously.","February 1, 2014","false","4.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It’s technically an MMO, although don’t expect to see another player whilst playing.\n\nYou’re tasked with robbing other players homes while setting up defenses at your own home to prevent these other players from stealing. The concept sounds nice, but it simply doesn’t work. You’re given a very small amount of cash to start off with, certainly not enough to purchase tools to rob others and protect your own property. Instead, beginners are forced to steal from other beginners in the same situation, with little to no defenses in place at their own homes.\n\nIn order to steal from other homes, you’ll need some tools to get through the various defenses they have in place. You have little money as a beginner, so don’t expect to be robbing the worthwhile homes. Now, maybe if there was more cash available, you’d actually be able to stand a chance against other players and actually be able to progress in the game. The game is fun, yes, but it’s simply too unfair for me to continue playing it.\n\nIt’s very difficult to get into the game, but if you’re lucky, you might actually be able to score some money off of other new players and be able to set up some reasonable defenses.","February 15, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I bought this game expecting to build a fortress to defend my wife, and my money. Little did I realize that 95% of your time is spent building your fortress. Don't get me wrong, this is the most fun part of the game, building your house. But in the time that I've played, about an hour or so, I find myself not building new designs, but repeating the same design. Why? Because if you die to your own design, you have to start all over. Now, permadeath is great and all, but it's really frustrating to "test" your own home and be killed by some flaw you overlooked, and have to restart. From scratch. The game is tedious, frustrating and incredibley boring. I've spent no time even invading another house, because I was testing mine.\nThe worst thing about this game so far though, is that when you complete a test of your house, it immediately makes it available for people to rob. This means that if you were testing with lights and chihuahas, then you're basically screwed. So you lose a couple hundred bucks, right? No big deal. Wrong. Then you don't have enough money to put grates in your house. And since you will just repeatedly get robbed, have no other choice but to commit suicide.\n\nAgain, I stress, the concept is very interesting and would be a fantastic idea for a video game...

Unfortunately this enjoyable part of the gameplay is surrounded by some really frustrating and boggling mechanics.\n\nThe permadeath means that once I've finished setting up my initial house I can't risk going out to rob others' houses as I'll probably quickly die thus wasting the time spent on my own house. So I build my house and leave it to be robbed by others and see how well I did. Unfortunately people will quickly turn up with a backpack full of tools and smash a path straight through my house. Once my house is inevetibly robbed I'll have no money left and will be unable to perform even basic repairs to my house, let alone improve my design. So I must go out and rob other houses or commit suicide (effectively equivalent options).\n\nI really think this game would be much better if it removed the permadeath and a lot of the money mechanics, and instead focused more on the puzzle aspect perhaps including leaderboards and tallies for houses/thieves.","February 7, 2014","false","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thraka/recommended/249570/","thraka","Thraka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thraka/","304 products in account","I have played this game for 21 hours so far... I give it a 5/10. Please read on to find out why!\n\nIn the beginning...\nAt first, the game starts out very cool. You're new to everything. There are a lot of tiles to play with. The best way to learn how to make something, is to venture into someone else's house and die. "Clever..." you think to yourself, "I'll use that trap!"\n\nAfter awhile, you learn how things work, so you set off to create your own house. With $2000 starting cash, you don't have a lot to work with. You don't want to spend too much making your house, because the left over money will be what people see, and they won't bother to take the time to try and beat your security for a measly $250-$500.\n\nReally, you only have $600-$800 to spend to make sure you attract burglars. Not much in fact. A guard dog costs you around $300. Electrical stuff is cheaper though.\n\nTo attack, or not to attack...\nIf you decide to venture out and attack others, you can buy tools to help you. The tools let you bypass specific types of security measures. Run into a dog? Use one of your sleep-laden-dog treats. Be careful though, you only have as many as you purchased. And other things like that. Every trap component has a counter of some sort.\n\nIf you attack someone's house, and decide that their design is just something you won't beat, and you will die trying, you can leave through the front door. However, if you do so, you forfeit all items you purchased to help you break in successfully. If you happen to make it all the way to their safe, you get money, but that is money minus what you spent on tools to make it there. Generally, one way or another, attacking another player, who understands how the game works (which everyone does sooner or later) will end up costing you money because it is hard to break into a decent house without tools.\n\nIf you happen to become successful a few times, and have built yourself a little stash of money, or you're fortunate enough to have some people attack you and die trying, you will then have enough money to start building some really cool traps. The side-effect of building your own nice house though, you stop attacking others. You won't be looking to die turning some corner 10 seconds into a robbery and then have to start over completely.\n\nWhen you're poor at the start, spend $1000 for tools, and attack a house with $3000. You will come away with more than you started, though it may take you 20 tries to do so. A  bit tedious. When you're rich, or you've built your house, never attack anyone again.\n\nConclusion\nThis game really has a lot of cool concepts.\n\nPros\n1. Permadeath is really neat because it gives you a good risk-reward factor.\n2. The traps and tiles you can place add a lot of variety and allow you to create some really cool things.\n3. All houses are user-created\n4. You get to solve puzzles, one section at a time (through fog-of-war, you only see what your character can see)\n5. The more successful you are, the more you can build.\n\nCons\n1. Expect to lose, lose, lose, and lose. There really is no way to win. You will die eventually, no way around it, unless you get so much money that you can build an entire fortress within your walls. But then at that point, there is no reason to even play the game any more. You don't want to risk venturing out and losing everything. Your money keeps growing because people want to get a piece of it.\n2. You cannot build, what you want, how you want, until you have enough money to do so.\n3. The risk of getting money at the start is very high.\n4. All houses are user-created. This is generally a good thing. Player made content is fun. However, because of the high risk-reward of the core design of the game, you will see the same cheap and easily duplicated puzzles that without spending lots of money on tools to destroy the house itself, you can never beat.\n5. There are some bad UI design flaws that hurt you. Want to review how someone attacked your house? You can do so, but while you are reviewing, others may attack you. If you have a lot of money in your house, it may be impossible for you to get in it to fix what others have broken, or even change the design. You cannot even look at your house while it is being broken into. I constantly have the problem of attack after attack without being able to get in my house and fix things.\n6. No way to save/load your design. You can use an online builder to create and save a design, but you will be reconstructing it in the game piece-by-piece, no zooming in or out to get the big picture.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBut this game executes these great concepts poorly. It may be that that all of these concepts are actually executed well by this game, but all of these concepts put together just do not work well.\n\nThe game gives you a great feeling at the start, it's a lot of fun to explore it all. But once you see how it all works, it's like discovering who the Wizard of Oz really is. You'll be handicapped at the start to try and make money so that you can design a cool intricate puzzle that in all reality, only you could ever solve on the first try.\n\nSo what is the point? Where is all the fun? It's not here. Once more people get tired of the game, and I honestly think they will, the game will fade. It's been stated by the creator it will never, ever, again be on sale. At a cheaper price than it is, say 75% off, lots of players could be introduced to it that would get a kick out of it for awhile, and give the die-hard-masochist fan base some fresh meat to play with, but without it.....dead game","February 1, 2014","false","21.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levelzero11/recommended/249570/","Levelzero11","Etio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levelzero11/","154 products in account","**IMPORTANT** The game's servers are pretty much empty nowadays, it's sad but it had a fun run. They might still be enjoyable at peak times, but from what I've seen the servers have about 15 people in...\n\nI absolutely love The Castle Doctrine. First off, to the people who've said this game isn't fun in previous reviews, let me ask you this; Is losing in games fun? Is getting stomped on fighting games fun? Is getting sweeped in RPG's fun? Is getting thrashed in FPS's fun? No, losing isn't fun. The Castle Doctrine however, is. You can go into this game with two mindsets - a robber, or a builder. It's possible to walk the line inbetween, but I wouldn't recommend it. I play as mainly a builder, but after a successful house is cracked I drown my sorrows in getting utterly pulverised as a Robber, I'm not a good situational thinker. Successfully robbing a house though, is a great feeling, this game offers a feeling similar to chess, some of the more complex CCG's and other great strategy games - the feeling that you outsmarted someone, well and truly.\n\nBeing able to look into a house and successfully traverse it, shows you were smarter than the creator, successfully building a house, shows you outsmarted the robber (There are exceptions, read to the end), watching the foolish victims of your traps cluelessly wander your house while you know exactly what mistakes they have made is exhilarating.\n\nEvery time a good house of mine is cracked, well, it's a bad feeling. And earlier this day I got fed up and just closed the window, only to reopen it minutes later, this game is addictive as hell, in a way that not only makes you want to keep on playing, but makes you want to strive to get better, something few games ever achieve.\n\nHowever, as much as I'm in love with this game, I'm not blind to it's glaring problems. I personally think the people who claim this game has evolved into having a 'Class' system are being completely ridiculous. The idea that the only way you'll ever kill someone is with a 100k house is obviously wrong. If that's the case, how did the top people make their houses? If you're reading this you've probably already seen a lot of reviews from people saying that the starting 2k isn't enough to do anything interesting. I built a house with 2k in about 30 minutes before I went to bed last night, woke up the next morning to find that it had killed 10 people, and had a total of about 5k before it was successfully robbed, these are still small numbers, but believe me, it was a crap house.\n\nThe main problem with The Castle Doctrine in my opinion, is that the balance for Robbers is way out of line, which, as much as making the building element of the game more fun, I can only imagine discourages new players trying to rob houses. A lot of houses are basically impossible to work out from the robber view, though believe me, it's hard to make a house that doesn't, and I am as guilty of hidden, multiple choice and just plain luck-based traps as everyone else. But these problems can also be cleared very quickly if you go into a house with even just a few pieces of basic equipment, 2 saws will often not allow you to just walk into a safe, but will allow you to perhaps see the wiring of an electric trap - when the robbing element really becomes fun. Another large problem, which has really lessened since the games release onto steam, is the existence of combination locks. Though honestly, you probably won't need to deal with these unless you idiotically try to guess the combinatoin.\n\nThe Castle Doctrine is a great game, and for it's early development stage, is a very good execution of a concept no-one wouldn't want to play. I would very much recommend this to anyone interested, despite it's flaws.","February 4, 2014","true","29.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

There are way worse game out there with horrible gore scenes, personally I didn't mind the violence or the fact than your only way to make money is to kill or steal so in a way there is no good guys everyone is evil in this game... So what?\n\nIf you actually enjoy merciless rogue like game this game is for you!\n\nBut really unless the game get better with a lot of new improvement and have some mercy like you cannot die testing your own traps and so on I will never play it again even if i was actually very active on the forum and in game...\n\nThis is sad since this game does have a lot of potential.\n\nSo I do not recommend this game because...\n\n1: The gameplay is lacking not enough stuff to actually do.\n2: The game have no mercy.

There is no need to describe it because the description on the Steam page is spot on.\n\nThe developer has made a truly difficult game which in no way holds your hand. You have to rebuild your design each time you die, so right off the bat it encourages you to be extremely careful when you enter other houses.\n\nMy only problem with the game is it allows building of very complex mechanisms through its wiring system, which might not be a bad thing, but I just can't get over the fact that it is actually impossible to walk through most houses using your wits to defeat the traps alone. You need to use tools to brute force the certain traps which are just (lucky guess to get through) traps.\n\nI suggest this game because it is something very different than anything I have played before, and a think most will agree. It is a ruthless game which is in no way simple, and you will die, and you will lose stuff you worked hard for, but the challenge will keep you going, and you will get smarter and better as you play.","February 7, 2014","true","9.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Who strangely dont seem to matter as much as your money when your robbed. I've watched many a UTube vid where father arrives home and the missus and kids have been brutely executed in all the glorious 8bit detail and he casualy walks past their corpses lamanting about the money he has just lost and thinking of how he can upgrade his security. Life goes on I guess.\n\nThe game is deceptively simple to learn but hard to master. I had a good understanding of what needed to be done within half an hour but then I found myself working on my house for the next 3 hours trying to get the right balance of false sense of security for anyone wishing to come into my welcoming home and death around every corner for said person once hes taken 10 steps. Then theres the carrot, sure you could spend your $2000.00 starting cash on everything barring the kitchen sink (please note there are actualy no kitchen sinks in the game at this time) but whos going to try and rob you if their risking death for 3 bucks. That $2000.00 start up money isn't looking as generous as it did 10 seconds ago is it.\n\nHappy with my death house from hell with a nice little carrot of $638.00 I headed out to partake in the second part of the game robbing everyone else blind. So after taking 11 steps into my first house ready to rob the rich and give to the poor, namely me, I found my self well and truly screwed. All I can say Mr Francis Dukis' wont have to feed that pitbull for a week due to the abundance of my carcess it threw around the place.\n\nI had just discoverd the joys of my first permadeath! House gone , Wife and Kids gone (probably went off and married pitbull Dukis') my money gone and 3 HOURS of REAL LIFE GONE!!!. So back i went to my new life and started all over vowing to never die again ... yea right.\n\nOverall this game is very promising the concept is fantastic and dark. I would like to think they will expand the crimes you can commit with the end result a dystopian society like in the movie "The Purge". If you do not know what this movie is google is your friend.\n\nNo doubt there are a lot of traps and equipment to be added to the game but from what i've read the developers are extremily commited to the game wanting the finished product to give the best possible gaming experience to us, the guys who pay the bills.\n\nIf I had one grip it would be that there needs to be something implemented sooner than later so you actually care what happens to your family instead of them just being cannon fodder.\n\nI feel the game is a solid 7 out of 10 at this stage of development.\n\nSo get past the 8bit graphics (I did) and buy this game you wont regret it, it is only going to improve from here.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me I must go and have a meet and greet with my new family ....... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ permadeath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 4, 2014","true","17.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I haven't had a game make me feel so clever in a while. I spent the first few hours of the game meticulously setting up my maze of traps that involved making some cats flip some switches that activate some electric floor panels behind any potential intruder. I found myself engrossed with the idea of trying to create something to outsmart another player. It worked... and worked again... yes I thought, this is marvelous.\n\nThen someone cut down a wooden wall that led to my family, shot down my wife and brutally clubbed my children to death. Oh my. I wrote down his name with some idea of revenge planted in my head. Then I thought about it and realized this game was leading me down a dark path. I started working on my house again...\n\nThis isn't to say that I don't think the game has some issues with balance and some other areas. I find that you want to often save a fair amount of money on a new life to make yourself a nice juicy target for some burglar. This is odd I thought to myself... I want people to break into my house. Without them I'll have no income... unless I go out and rob other people. I tried to rob other people but I soon found that other people's deathtraps rely heavily on presenting you with so many paths you're bound to fail at some point or another. Without tools you'll have no way to escape from a deadly situation, but I spent most of my money on my house... and tools are expensive.\n\nEssentially I found that the game presents you with a paradox of sorts. While it wants you to realize that being a robber or killing people in your house isn't a good thing, it doesn't really give you any other option. There is no honest living in this game, you either steal lives in self-defense or you go out and rob other people's houses.\n\nStill though, through all of this I still would recommend this game. The thrill of trying to outwit other players is too satisfying of an experience. I'm not sure I've ever really played anything quite like it. It's tense and everything feels weighty. It's really something how this game creates such a cynical atmosphere.","February 5, 2014","true","32.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I decided to give the game a shot since it looked at the very least decent. I picked it up while it was on sale and using some tips from the series I watched and reddit I made a simple house with a commitment trap and a electric floor lock out type trap as well as gave my wife a shot gun. I went out and got lucky with a few houses that had been broken into but not robbed... this is where I noticed one of the first major problems, if your wife is alive and you have a decent amount of money her death is enough for some people since they'll get half and any damage they have done to your house will remain (whereas if they die it gets fixed). Death of the wife seems to be higher up on some peoples lists if they can afford a gun, (guns have a range of 2 spaces whereas your wife's shot gun has a range of 1) and as such people will "dance" near the entrance or search for your family to get them to make their way to the door. I've also noticed that people will occasionally just enter someone's house to mess it up and kill a family member, probably in revenge for stealing their money. So, after I had some decent cash and upgraded my home significatly I let it sit for a while to see how many people I'd kill, and what I'd get with my house. for the most part I'd have people entering the house, taking 2~5 steps then backing out once they saw a commitment trap or a dog, or even just a door... the only time I'd see someone stay longer is if they had a full bag of tools that usually cost more than my savings, and even then most people wouldn't stay in very long and even would back out before they robbed my house. When someone finally successfully robbed my house they also killed my wife, leaving me with a broken home and absolutely no money. At this point it was virtually impossible for me to "recover" as most houses that I would go to rob had only a few dollars in them and were too risky, I ended up just starting over, which leads me to another major flaw... the prices of just about everything. All robbery tools cost hundreds of dollars, most effective house defense stratagies cost thousands in total, and the most effective are also incredibly cheap feeling as they are mostly combo locks after a commitment trap and the wrong combo permenantly locks you in the house while locking off the safe forever causing you to have to suicide. I feel if you were given some materials to build and rob with at the beginning of a "fresh start" and you kept your materials after surviving a hosue 2000 wouldn't be a bad starting point but as it stands it's barely enough to protect anything. Also normal doors can't be locked... which is just silly to me, the game lets you buy an electric locking thick metal door for a few hundred dollars, but we can't find a simple lock for a door. the purpose a lock on a normal door could hold would be to waste a "movement turn" breaking the lock(no tools, just slamming into it with your shoulder or something) and causing everything/everyone within a certain radius to notice someone's in the house. It could also act as a way to block off your family (they'd have keys) so that they don't need a very very obvious escape route, as mentioned int he video they need an escape route that's 100% obsticle free (aside from dogs).\n\nOriginally there was a "salary" that your character and your wife(if your wife died it was just your salary) would earn while you where away from the game (more the more time you where not playing) to suppliment stealing and house defense, it also made more sense that you where out of the house when you where getting robbed that way. But they took it out I assume to controll the money flow of the game and as a balancing attempt... but I think it unbalanced the game more than it helped and it made it so that there is truely no recovery from having your wife killed and your house robbed (barring getting lucky as hell while robbing someone with more than $50 and a broken home...\n\nSome commonly used traps/deturants that can be considered "cheap tactics" include:\n"leaps of faith" where they have an open trap door that you're supposed to assume a cat/dog will activate and close as you step onto it\n"Commitment traps" such as an electric grill flooring or an electric door that locks/turns on as you pass it so there is no turning back and it's pretty much get the money or die trying scenario.\n"death traps" there are many of these that are usually hidden behind commitment traps and literally force you to die, a simple one is to hide a cat around a corner behind some glass and cover the floor in grills so it looks like a simple commitment trap, but once they turn the corner they scare the cat and it hits a switch frying the person on the plates, another variant is the same thing but uses a small dog to run towards you.\n"Dog traps" basically dogs behind doors that lead to no where, again when paired with a commitment trap this can be deadly...\n\nSo many ways to trap people in this game, some are super easy to make, some are very expensive and most are not effective by them selves and require at least a few to protect your money.\n\nOverall this game has a great concept and a decent execution, but it has some major flaws and some major balancing issues.\nAs it stands I would not reccomend this game. I think it needs to be improved in many ways before I'd say give it a shot, especially for the $16 asked for it, if it was maybe $5  I'd say give it a shot and if you don't like it... hell at least it'd only be $5 spent.","May 8, 2014","false","40.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanakotka/recommended/249570/","Kanakotka","Kana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanakotka/","586 products in account","In a nutshell, a brilliant idea, but execution so awful it's obvious it's the developer's first attempt at making any manner of a game, with possibly little to no experience in the field of game development even in general.\nFor instance, it's entirely possible you spend a good 30-40 minutes wiring up a house to your liking for the very first time, and then you decide to test it out, because the game requires you to.\n\nSo, you of course test your traps, let's say the electrified floortrap to see what it does, whether it's some sort of humorous zapping animation or something else. What this actually does, is instantly kills you for good, and permanently deletes any of your previous effort on the house.\n\nThe game has no way of informing you about any of this, and the only way to find out is experimentation. There is no manual, there isn't even a wiki.\n\nThere are other glaring issues, such as the obvious design of going with a multiple choice lottery where only one of a 5 dozen switches opens the vault, and all the other are lethal. You obviously know which one to press, the chances of an invading player knowing this are neglibly small. Protecting the family is a pointless matter by design, as there are no reasonable ways to protect them whatsoever. Why? They require an entirely trapless (and doorless) way out of your house. There are 3 familymembers. There are no turrets or any sort of traps like that, and the dogs are a joke to dispose of.\n\nSuch a shame; the idea is worth developing for, but the execution is lacking on all grounds. Please do not waste your money or time with this.\n\nAlso, i'll just leave 2 figures out here:\nSale price: 14,99€\nSize on HD : 2,2mb\nThis should tell you how much effort has gone to this game at large, as opposed to how much is being asked for the game.\n\nI'd personally rate a similar game, "The pay-to-win quest for mediocre loot" above this, and it's obvious how i feel for that one.","January 31, 2014","false","0.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

If you're expecting a fast paced game this isn't for you. The game has an incredible amount of depth. If you're willing to put in the time and experiment with different layouts and devise new traps this game will pay you back ten-fold.\n\nIs it worth $16? Well, I'll admit $16 is a bit steep. This game would certainly be worth $10 or less for anyone. However, I'll stick by what I originally said and say if you want a fast paced game go elsewhere. If you're interested in devising clever ways to trick people and figuring out others traps then this is the game for you.\n\nIt's a shame the developer is in a "never discount" mode.

People not buying the game because of the "dead community" is completely contridictory, the community would grow if people actually bought the game and played, and this would likely bring back some of the older players as well (which im sure some are thinking, thats okay, we dont want the engineers coming back designing houses so elaborate that not even the creators of the game even understand how to get through, but really there is no time advantage on castle doctrine. 1 mistake and your at square 1).\n\nAnywho, i highly recommend this game to anyone intrested in buying, the community currently isnt very large but new member could easily fix this problem.\n\nThe learning curve is rather small, you'll build your house, you'll get eattin by your own pitbulls. The game has a built in note pad type of thing so you can write down the way through your maze, or the combination of switches to disable a door.

I had bad impressions at first, but when I had people dieing in my house those impressions changed. It's horrible when you get alot of cash that just makes you a bigger target which is fine, but I would first like to upgrade my house from all the people that died while I was away, like setup a resting point because you'll be having people with alot of tools now entering your 2,000 dollar house now with 5,000 left over money from the bodies, thier tools will cost more then that house and sometimes even your vault amount which is dumb of the player or maybe he/she just doesn't like you.\n\nWhen you rob somebody make sure to be on your lucky day because you'll need it since sometimes not even tools will shorten your odds unless you bring like 100 or so each which is alot of money. I'll mostly be robbing the poor since I can't risk my life against people that know more about traps then I do.\n\nThe wiki for this game doesn't make much sense on what things do (well for me), I just prefer videos most of the time. The price does seem crazy since this is a 22mb game, but it's addicting once you really get into it.\n\nLast thing I will like to mention is the great idea of the game how it's similar to The Epic Quest for Epic Loot on defending your castle against other players. Also (New topic) what the developer said about how sales hurt your fans, I know people would disagree but I happen to agree even if there will be issues about it since not that many people know about this game, but on how other games are like I just bought a game at full price then later it went on sale 75% off the next day or week or so, which was upseting since I'm cheap and impatient, I would like to be spending less, not having to wait and how that effects launches for some. However for console gamers don't need to worry about it since there aren't alot of huge deals on them. Lastly how the price should go up after a few months or years or so at that stoping price point after slowly raising the price showing players not to wait for a sale since it pretty much is.\n\nOverall I rate the game a 7 since there are still few problem that need to get looked over so I hope for future updates for a better experience and for other players as well. I recommend players who have time, patience, and luck to try out The Castle Doctrine!","February 1, 2014","true","34.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You design the perfect house to the best of your abilities. You step out into the world, you die two steps in because you haven't figured out the dog movement AI yet. No-one even got to see your house.\n\nSay you're John Smith XII. You design the same perfect house. You google saving layouts in this game and find nothing. So you painstakingly make the same house again so you can see how it does. Stealing at this point seems too great a risk at any stage unless you are Batman. Still, you are lured in by another player's clever design, and ofcourse die.\n\nSay you're John Smith XXXIV. You build an even better house, using your very original clever design to lure people in. It works! People die and drop their cash for you! You find indescribable, truly divine joy as you laugh maniacally at the security tapes and truly know what it is to be an evil genius. And so you add another wing to your dungeon, now it is even more dangerous... Then some rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with 3-5k (a substantial amount) of cash comes and... he dies and drops it! The feeling is indescribable. Only now your vault is actually worth something and you can't go back in because it's currently being robbed. And it turns out, it was Batman. As soon as you get a bit of money in this game, Batman is going to come and get you, and maybe you could stop him if only you could have spent some of that 3-5k cash on a better house...\n\nSay you're Phonix111186. You write a review which you're still not sure is positive or negative, but you're sure there are possible improvements implied. Then you go back for more. The truth is, Batman eventually comes for all of us, we all have to live with that eventuality. Perhaps one day, if I get really good at this, I could be Batman. But as Liam Neeson once said, "There is always a bigger Batman." There is no 100% completion.","February 2, 2014","true","49.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I felt these emotions/effects in games before: adrenaline, fear, being in the zone, pressure, and exuberance.  But Castle Doctrine transcends what it means to 'feel' in a game.  Putting aside the awesome security/reward/strategy/defense/math aspects, this game will make your heart race.  After grinding and amassing a fortune, you can spend hours designing and fortifying your house, only to lose it all after a simple mis-wiring or off-by-one timing of a trap.  And all this, you repeat in your head, you brought upon yourself.  The permadeath without fanfare is the most humbling experience in games.  One second, you are top of the world.  The next, you stare at your screen in jaw-dropped horror, realizing you are trapped in a dead end because you forgot to remove a wall or your wiring connected power to the powered-door directly.\n\nThis game needs a warning attached:  MAY CAUSE CARDIAC PROBLEMS.\n\nI give Jason Rohrer  "2014 Game of the Year" for this gem.   I will make a remake of this game in the future.  Will never forget it.\n\nAs of 10/2015, sadly there are only a handful of players.  When this game had 200+, it was amazing.

What I dislike is How the game does not have much PLAYERS. (Not saying it will be like this forever) But what I also dislike is how some off the game futures aren't really being used or aren't in the game due to less players or players hogging everything about the game. When more players are on it It cant be hogged because that = MORE Robbers = more houses = more fun. So this game is good. But this game needs to be worked on for awhile and once its done ALL THE Game futures will be up and running and it will be easier to play and bring in more players. There should be more players. But The other players complaining Are complaining about Either you loose everything or its not fair or not a fair price. What you do is you keep trying to build a better house before. Go look it up on youtube. You'll see them enjoying it. Plus at first I thought ehh Not many players. I wait one day and my house has been robbed but LUCKY my traps worked. With all the money I managed to make a better house. I went to see other houses and I copied there traps. Copying traps is easy. Its easy to copy. Basic traps wont work much so you need to really know how to play this game. Its really fun. TIP - Make sure your house is worth money or people wont try to rob it! But Really you should play the game. Even if its hard at first you start to get the hang of it. My house is tricky and hard to pass. Even if you come with alot of tools once you already gone far in you wont get out. Its fun to watch people die. It may seem there aren't alot of players but I got robbed at 1:30.AM and he died. It was funny And in a day You get a long list. BUT MAKE SURE YOUR HOUSE IS WORTH MONEY. But this game is fun. Dont listen to anyone who says a bad review. There are bad sides.

Unfortunately, the execution is mind blowingly bad. First and foremost of the problems is the fact that you have to completely rebuild your house after each death, and you cannot go to other houses without doing this. As a result the game will be building house setup, dying to another setup, rebuilding house, over and over again, each time manually. This gets old very quickly.\n\nAnother issue the game has is its learning curve. It is a very brutal game to learn. This compounds the first problem.\n\nBalance in the game is not stellar. Since each profile can only have one house set up at a time, it becomes impossible to test out new traps without demolishing your current house. In addition, the one-house setup encourages folk to just camp out once they have a nice house built, and not go into other homes. They have nothing to gain and everything to lose.\n\nNow imagine none of those problems exist. The game is still bad because it is an mmo built around player interaction and almost no one plays it, ever.","October 1, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everyone is trying to rob everyone else whilst trying to prevent it from happening to themselves. You start off with $2000 in which to boobytrap your house however you see fit using vicious dogs, pits, electrified floors, and more.  Once you're satisfied that your money - and family - are protected as well as they can be, you get to go and 'visit' other peoples', seeing if you can spot a weak link in their carefully constructed plans, cutting your way through with saws, or throwing drugged meat to dogs, but be careful. Everything is dangerous, should you step on electrified flooring, get shot, or fall down a pit, it's game over. Whilst you're out plundering to the bestof your ability, they get the chance to do the same to you. Should someone attempt to break into your house, you are able to watch their movements, to spot the weak points in your plan, improve upon it, and repeat.\n\nThe catch? While you are given tools to break into other houses, when testing your own, you aren't allowed any - and any mistake in testing could cost you your life.\n\nIt is fair to say that The Castle Doctrine is an unforgiving game, especially to new players, and (at time of writing) there are many improvements that need to be made, there is something adictive about it.\n\nSome might question why I likened the game to the three that I did:\nMinecraft - the wiring in this game is a lot like 'redstone', wiring up pressure plates to lower drawbridges, or to turn off some harmful device.\nDungeon Keeper - you are building a trap that other people have to plunder. The only difference is that this is harder, as you have to make all the traps yourself.\nChess - perhaps the most 'wrong' from the list, but I think it fits. The game is turn-based. For every move you make, the enemies in the house are allowed to do the same.\n\nThe game currently fails in a number of areas; wiring can be a bit of a nuscience, along with having to ditch all of your equipment after breaking into someones house, even if you don't steal anything.","January 31, 2014","true","33.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Nevertheless, the game still sucks me in with its atmosphere, clever mechanics, and especially the sheer thrill in watching people die by your traps.\n\nI can't recommend this enough.

I found it interesting that they were made as "art," designed with metaphor/symbolism or whatever and intended to make you think. Beyond the "art" part though, those games didn't really have compelling gameplay, I felt like I was playing them to discover the message, not because they were fun.\n\nI got this game because it sounded fun, and it is. Whether it was the developer's intention or not, this game makes me think in the same ways his "art games" did, in addition to having fun and compelling gameplay. I am having trouble expressing the way this game makes me feel and think about the themes it brings up. Its complicated and I think that's the way it should be.\n\nBut at the end of the day it really is a fun game. A successful heist feels like a real accomplishment.

But BE WARNED: IT IS PUNISHING.\nYou will probably get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the first time you build up your home, and die either by folly in setting up your own traps, or by falling into somebody else's cunning trap. There's much delight in designing a house full of nefarious traps, but oh will your nerves shake when you have to run through it all yourself, constantly wondering if you made an error in your design. Getting good at robbery takes time. You have to learn what to anticipate, know what tools are best to bring, hone your instincts, and like any robber have a little luck.\n\nBut nothing as quite as satisfying as successfully burglarizing somebody's home, especially if it's a -big- heist. We're talking $50k+ here.\n\nBought this game back in Alpha when it came out, and it has undergone some substantial changes, and improvements.\nMy ONLY gripe is that robbery tools can now be stacked. So it is possible that somebody with a substantial amount of wealth could by so many tools that they can reach a vault with absolute certainty. Then the real question is, does that vault have more money than the tools were worth??\n\nIn any case, I HIGHLY recommend this game.","January 29, 2014","true","2.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

If this is the kind of game you like, then this is the game for you! I joke. This is a good game. Maybe even a great game. But it is not for everybody, as you can see from some of the negative reviews. Some people don't "get" it. There are also some legitimate complaints that bug certain types of players more than others. However, I first got in to the alpha for this game a good year before its release. It was a good deal of fun then, and a lot of balancing and tweaking down the road, it is even better now.\n\nAnd I think it is fair to say that it is very different to most of the games on Steam, and whatever faults the game may have are actually as much an expression of the quite distinct thinking of the designer as the positive aspects. Jason has a very clear and simple vision of what he wants the playing experience to be, and is not interested in padding that out with tutorials, things to fill your house with, or indeed any features that distract at all from the basic, bare bones mechanics. The game will not pander to you. It is not open for passive "entertainment".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprout360/recommended/249570/","sprout360","Randbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprout360/","90 products in account","This game is perfect for: hardcore gamers\nGod where do I even begin. As always I’m going to write a very detailed review, try to resist spoilers as much as possible, but a decent review would be hundreds of pages in length.\nThis is always a giant sim world. By sim I mean it’s one player, but the world is so realistic, so detailed that it’s more of a simulation then a game. When you talk to NPC’s, even simple merchants, it’s not a simple press button and trade with them. You can do that, but you can also say “hows buisiness” “how do you get your supplies” “what’s new around town” etc. A lot of times they will have a misc quest you can do for them. You interact with them just like you would a real world vendor. This is how it is with every friendly NPC, and there are thousands, maybe tens of thousands of them in this game.\nThe in game world itself is probably like 50-200 square miles. And that’s just the outdoors. There’s a couple hundred dungeons, shops, buildings, etc that you can go into, that total into millions of indoor square feet. One dungeon I did last night took me almost 3 hours to complete, and I explored less then half of it. You can spend weeks in this game exploring alone. See that mountain in the distance? In the real world if you really wanted to you could get to the top of it right? Same goes for Skyrim. This isn’t Fable, or some other RPG that has set paths. You can run over rocks, jump EVERY fence (not just select fences like fable) jump off a cliff (unhealthy choice) etc etc. If you could run through it, over it, or around it in the real world, you can in this world. In general you can’t grasp cliff sides to rock climb, but you can find a way around.\nas always, it has so much to offer. Most games have one main story quest that takes a few hours, to complete, and a handful of very short side quests. This game, the main story alone takes days. There are four big factions who offer so much content, you might as well consider them 4 more “main stories”. So technically this game has 4 main story lines, all of them are gigantic. It’s intimidating to say the least, you could have 100 out of thousands, maybe tens of thousands of quests, and it’s hard to decide what one u want to do. The main quest rewards you with money, which is very useful. Anywhere from spewing fire, freezing an opponent in place, and special ones like making a quick sprint, and later the ability to summon a dragon. As well as unique weapons, gear, companions, etc. Then again there are side quests that award you with the ability to become invisible (won’t say who, keep spoilers minimal). As is the case with most games it is so overwhelming at first, that it’s not very fun, but it grows on you. The more you get into the game, the more you find it impossible to turn off the computer.\nMost games simply B-line to the end. The campaign or main story can take maybe 10 hours tops, even on the hardest of modes. This game takes days (as I said) and has plenty of interesting twists and turns. Also to the fans, there are plenty of references to other games.\nNow some info about the character. This game has a very customizable character menu. If you played Starbound, then you should have the general idea of what it’s like. On many points it has more detail on facial creation than Starbound, on other points it has considerably less. In the end I prefer the face creator in this game much more than Starbound. It’s a lot better looking, and it’s more user friendly. Rather then shaping the nose, it has like 50 presets for the nose, which you can then decide to shape how you want. I like this a lot more. As always there’s plenty of hair customization, eyes, lips, cheeks, jaw bones, eye brows, fore head, ears, skin color, skin complexion, etc. Aside from the fact that there are “more options” some new features include war paint, battle scars, and body type. For males you get 3 body types, slim, medium, and buff. Of coarse as a cool dude I went with buff. As for the females I didn’t check if it’s a anorexic chick vs Helga, or if it’s maybe “bust” customization. This system applies to NPC’s as well. It’s not always the same exact body, just slightly different skin color, and a different head/face. There’s plenty of body variety. The kids look a lot better two. They actually look like children, rather than shrunken down adults. There’s no one fat or “fluffy”, kinda hurts on the realism, but the increase in variety is a nice new detail.\nIf you have played Monaco, then note this is from the creators of Monaco. Monaco also got tons of awards, but it’s so old that if they said “from the creators of Monaco” all but true fans would be like “what’s Monaco?” So trust me this is EVERYTHING IS AWSOME, and some good stuff from Monaco. If you remember in Monaco, there are finishing moves that would be in slow motion. If you got a headshot, it would be in slow motion. In this one there are finishing moves. They don’t always happen, but when they do they are cool. The variety of them is relatively low, I think I’ve seen maybe 8 different finishing moves, but they always make you feel like a badass killing machine.","February 14, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, in-fact, its a puzzle game, and a very fine one so far.   I really want to kill enough strangers to be able to spend some of that cash that starts to build up.  I really want to drug those enemy dogs so I can steal your stuff.   Its a great little game if you like puzzles and you can get over having to rebuild your house.  I now take picures of my finished house - both so I can get through it myself and so I can rebuild it if need be.  Things like saving houses should be part of the game, so I hope that gets added.  If you like games and you have the cash then give it a try...so my house can kill you.","February 19, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Understanding how things work, that's one thing. The real challenge, however, is trying to put it all together, because a good portion of how well your traps function is based on psychology, and on that note, there's no way it hell you can know who's gonna break in, or when.\n\nHighly recommended game, 10/10.","March 25, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not for everyone, so please read the following before you decide to buy the game.\n\nFirstly I want to state that all the critics giving this game a bad review should not be allowed to even rate a game like The Castle Doctrine. I mean this with no hate but if your job is to quickly play a game and write a report about it, day in day out, then you will NOT be able to appreciate a game that involves thinking/learning such as this.\n\nShort summery: You are given a house with some money and you build traps to keep other players out. Afterwards you have the choice of either logging off and waiting for people to die(get money) or break into your vault, or invading someone elses house. Once someone breaks into your house you can actually watch footage of how they do so. The amount of people in the game is very active. Once I build my house, people normally bite within minutes.\n\nIf you have played Minecraft and enjoy the 'engineering' aspect of the game where you build and wire items together, you will enjoy this game. At first the amount of items may seem overwhelming but the learning curve is small. Once you have given the game a chance, and come to appreciate that every single house you enter is the fabrication of someone elses individual imagination, you will LOVE the game. The amount of traps and mazes that people create is AMAZING. It makes no difference how long you have played, you will always be a student in this game. You cannot ever master this game because there will likely be someone that will figure your design out -- that's the point of the game!\n\nThe game lacks a tutorial for good reason -- this game is for people that like to think/innovate. If you enjoy games that are linear, hand things out, or have safety nets, then you will not enjoy this game. The punishment of failure is very large and you will die a lot at first, however you are given all the tools to test your designs at will. If you dare to copy someone elses design, expect people to have already seen it(you better add a new spin onto it).\n\nRecommendations: Play around with all the different types of items, or watch a quick youtube video on how they work. Then go into other peoples houses to explore, and die, and die, and die, and die, and die again. You lose nothing as a newbie so check out how some other people are creating houses. Then create a simple house and watch how someone robs you. If you fail, recreate it and improve on the design -- simple as that.\n\nPersonal tactic: I fill up my backpack with saws in order to try and rob someone as a complete newbie. I break into a house that is worth more than the starting amount of money and try to saw my way through as much as possible, minding traps. If I reach a vault then I will likely double my cash, and then create a house from scratch with more money then I originally had. If I die, I respawn and repeat the above until I crack someone's house. Along the way I see cool looking traps and try to replicate them. ONCE I build a house, I never rob anyone. I logout and wait for people to die to my traps, and then build more and more.","April 5, 2014","true","88.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never really got into it; it seems like one of those games super nerds would love - as a means to prove how genius they are. I died a lot, it needs some more features. I suspect it will get better with future updates.\n\nI have not played anything else like it - it's a clever idea and it's not that pricey. Won't put you in a good mood though - unless you are really evil.","June 21, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
