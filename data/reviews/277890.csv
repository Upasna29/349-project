"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TruthHadGone/recommended/277890/","TruthHadGone","✠ Prodigal ✠","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TruthHadGone/","67 products in account","Sit your lily ♥♥♥ down because I'm about to tell you the story about one of the greatest IP's in gaming history.\n\nShantae originally came out on Game Boy Color in 2001. If you're a normal person, you didn't know this until just now. Even though it didn't sell very well, it was critically acclaimed and in fact, often ranks high in lists of the best GBC games. Aside from just being an absolute blast, it pushed the technocological barriers of the GBC to the max, creating the nicest looking game on the system, hands down.\n\nAnd then they made a second one.\n\nCapcom, deciding that Shantae wouldn't sell to the masses (but when has Capcom been right?), decided NOT to publish the sequel, known as Shantae Advance. Skip forward six years, and Wayforward finally manages to publish their own game for the 3DS, but this beauty right here didn't come out until 2010.\n\nSo what is Shantae: Risky's Revenge? The best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ platformer on this planet, that's what (at least until Pirate's Curse and Half-Genie Hero comes out). It takes place shortly after the original Shantae, pitting the eponymous half-genie belly dancer against her rival, Risky Boots, the sexy pirate. I won't ruin the story, because it seems elementary at most, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ does the game play great.\n\nThe graphics are reminiscent of a SNES game, but plays much more smoothly. It's an art style that some will undoubtedly hate, but that's the way it is. The music. Jesus Christ of Al Qaeda, I could write an entire novel on why Jake Kaufman is one of the most underrated composers of all time. The songs sound great and add to the atmosphere of the game (just sit down for a while in Tangle Forest, you won't regret it), and many of the most famous tunes from the original Shantae were remastered for this game too (such as Burning Town and the boss theme). The gameplay is your standard platformer: jump and attack. You also have the option to equip magic spells and backdash (sounds a bit like Symphony of the Night, eh?) Additionally, Shantae learns a few dances throughout her journey that allow her to turn into animals such as a monkey and elephant that are needed to progress.\n\nThe world is colorful and brimming with life, which reflects well on all the other characters (even Risky Boots herself pops out and has a vibrant personality). The game follows the concept of Metroidvania, which means you can roam freely around a 2D world, but can't access specific areas without finding certain objects first. Luckily, the game does a good job of hinting at where you should go so we don't feel like we're being dragged along. The characters are unique, and along with an excellent script, display their own personalities and mannerisms. The script isn't too indepth or intricate, but it's enough to give the characters their own sense of uniqueness (Abner Cadaver's a damn good example).\n\nThere are two complains though. Two major flaws that strike early on: the control layout, and the map.\n\nHonestly, it is a ♥♥♥♥ing miracle I survived the tutorial battle. You're not given any prompts on how to attack, which wouldn't be a problem with a controller, but a keyboard has a ♥♥♥♥♥on of keys. My only advice is to go the options beforehand and change most, if not, all the pre-existing keys. After a few minutes of tinker(bats)ing, I managed to find a layout that wouldn't make my hand cramp after a few minutes of playing.\n\nThe map is the spawn of Satan. What the ♥♥♥♥ was Wayforward thinking when they designed it. I've been playing this game for (at the current time of the review) 6 hours, and I cannot figure out which way I am supposed to be looking at it. It's difficult to explain, but once you see a picture of the map, you'll understand the reason it sucks.\n\nOverall, 10/10, would ♥♥♥♥ Shantae","September 27, 2014","true","6.3"," 150 of 167 people (90%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","90","150","167","43","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/recommended/277890/","girlkillscomputer","Girl Kills Computer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/","158 products in account","Lemme start off by saying that this is gonna be a long review and mostly about the series in the context of gaming as a woman, so for people who don't give a ♥♥♥♥, Shantae is a 9/10 metroidvania platformer (complete with time- and completion-based end pics) that's a bit on the short side but a ton of fun and has decent replay value.\n\nOkay, here's the rest of what I wanted to say.\n\nAs a woman, you get used to seeing your gender treated like sexy furniture in video games for the most part (realistic simulation of life in the real world).  You might not like it, but if you enjoy playing games as I do, you sorta learn to ignore it, I guess, or at least not be mad about it every time it happens, or you'd never stop being mad, and that's exhausting.\n\nSometimes, a game will let you choose your sex at the start of the game, and usually that's an indication that your character's sex is meaningless as far as the story is concerned, which isn't quite the same thing as celebrating or embracing women... or men, let's be fair.  Are there any complex video game epics about the difficulties of What It Is To Be A Man? nah.  But as a girl I wanna talk about girl problems, not guy problems.  Anyway, there are very, very few games that have even tried to include things about the feminine experience in there, and even fewer that get it right.  There's a thing I like to call "Joss Whedon feminism", where you take the "virgin/♥♥♥♥♥" point of view, but word-replace "virgin" with "Amazon" and call it good.  What this means is shown pretty well by the recent Tomb Raider remake.\n\nIn that game, Lara isn't especially female per se, apart from her boobs existing.  She's tough and grr and she overcomes challenges etc.  By the end of that game, yes she's a stone badass and that's cool, but it's not really an exploration of femininity so much as it is an exploration of survivor trauma and effective coping.  Which is fine.  But it's not Shantae.  I also wanna note that people ♥♥♥♥ on Tomb Raider for being exploitative when it comes to Lara, but honestly, it doesn't feel that bad to me, playing it.  Granted, the camera is definitely controlled by a dude, but not an especially horny dude, if that makes any sense.  And the game very quickly progresses from Lara being a helpless bunny getting kicked to the one doing the kicking, comin up outta pools of blood like Rambo and ♥♥♥♥.  It's pretty cool, actually.  It's a really fun game, I'm not doggin on the gameplay, I loved Tomb Raider.  Just sayin.\n\nSuper Princess Peach also comes to mind.  This is a bit closer to a game about womanhood, but it still errs in a weird, sort of naive way.  I wanna make clear that I absolutely don't think the team that made this game really had bad intentions when they made it, and hell, it even comes pretty close to the mark.  What I mean is that it acknowledges that intense emotions are part of the feminine experience, and in fact makes those emotions powerful!  They're how Peach interacts with her world and progresses through it, what's more empowering than that?  A big part of being a woman is learning to handle this very intense, very rich inner life that comes with having emotions try to drown you.  Becoming mature as a woman is in large part figuring out how to handle them.  So, to make it so a female character uses her emotions in a constructive way, that's pretty cool!  Problem is, the level design demands rapid switching of emotions, and they're portrayed as really heightened and exaggerated.  Peach comes across as going through puberty or just unstable.  With emotions like anger, it's weaponized.  Peach stomps around through enemies, literally on fire.  Now, was it like that for me when I was younger?  Yeah, absolutely.  But it's not the mark of a mature woman to swing around that wildly or to let your emotions drive you to that degree.\n\nThe other example I hear is Bayonetta.  I'll give her this: she definitely owns her sexuality, which is something people usually cite as a good thing.  Problem is, it's not a healthy sexuality.  Look at how she treats Cheshire, for instance.  I mean, you can make your arguments for BDSM and all that, and that's fine, but she definitely holds men in a kind of distant disdain, which real loving BDSM doesn't have.  It's the same mistake in the opposite direction.  The game in general is hypersexual (where the women are concerned.  where's my hot man butts and dickbulges?).  The camera is the biggest turnoff.  Definitely a hornier dude behind this one.  You've got the full-body sweeping, focusing on ♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥, the spreadeagled special moves, everything is just really uncomfortable to watch and hear.  Bayonetta is a spectacle fighter, and Bayonetta herself is part of that spectacle.  That's an important distinction.  She's not feminine, she's just sexed up.  Throwing your vag into the camera is not empowerment.  It's pandering, and I only ever hear that it's NOT that way from men, because most women know better.  At least, women that aren't trying to be Bayo irl.  It's a fairly common mistake, I'll grant you that.\n\nSo now we come to Shantae, a series starring a bellydancing sexy half-genie in poofy pants and a bustier that's probably the most empowering, healthiest depiction of a feminine hero I've ever seen.  What?\n\nWell, for starters, the bellydancing.  Now, opinions differ, but to me there's few things that are more feminine than the pure joy of physicality.  The simple pleasure of having a body, knowing it well, and expressing yourself using it, having a great time with it, comes pretty close to the heart of womanhood, in my opinion.  Shantae's dances are also the source of her transformative powers, which let her explore the world.  So, here we have the Super Princess Peach thing, but done correctly.\n\nNow, is her dancing weaponized?  I'm gonna say no.  You do acquire powerups that give her forms attacks, but they're primarily (except for the mermaid bubbles) used to get places you couldn't before, not to attack enemies.  Also, it's the *forms* that are weaponized, NOT the dances.  There are certain male characters that suggest Shantae should dance to get what she wants, or want her to dance for them, but she never does this, and you're never required to dance for anyone other than you, by the game.  This is a great thing.  In the 1st game there's a stage where you can dance for money, but it's just there.  It's not like you have to do it.  There are strip clubs irl, but you won't see me there; to each her own.\n\nThis brings me to Shantae's sexuality.  Shantae is friggin adorable, with jiggle in the right places, all lovingly animated.  But it's not excessive.  She dresses in skimpy outfits, but those outfits are basically her bellydancing uniform (irl accurate), and it's all about the same stuff I said before with the dancing itself.  It's a celebration of the female form, and I don't feel like it's super creepy or anything.  She never uses it to get ahead, even with Bolo the perv.  It's done well.  There's definitely some more fan-servicey moments in the third game, but the way they're done pokes fun at gamers who might be enjoying em too much.\n\nWhat's really fascinating to me is Risky Boots, with her high heels on a pirate ship (looks over practicality), her domination of her male crew, how she carries herself.  She's a symbol of Bayo-style sexuality, how to Do It Wrong, the traps you can fall into as a woman.  She naturally inspires the "take her down a peg" impulse.  Even her boobs are bigger than Shantae's (in 2 and 3)!  Great villain.  The fact that the game is thinking about a potential female player is HUGE.  Nobody does that!\n\nOverall, too, the variety of female characters and how they're written shows writing that cares about and knows women.  I have friends like Rottytops and Sky, and friend/enemies like Risky (and Rotty).  It's believable.\n\nSo, this series rules, and as a woman I really love that it both exists and is fun.","January 10, 2015","true","5.5"," 314 of 496 people (63%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","63","314","496","47","27"

It's basically a "Second Quest", replaying the game again with more magic capacity, but receiving double the damage. You also get a new costume, both in illustrations and in spritework.\n\nShantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut is a really fun, if somewhat short platforming adventure. It features a Metroidvania style of gameplay with gradual progression in upgrades both found and bought, as well as the ability to cast various magic attacks and transform into various creatures in order to use their special abilities when needed.

If you want to play this one and not have to deal  with the first game, all you need to do to play this game is watch/play the first five minutes of the first game it will explain everything you need to know about Shantae, Risky, and how and why everything is how it is.\n\nYou play as Shantae the Half-Genie hero who protects the town Scuttle Town where you live from the evil pirate-lady Risky Boots. Your uncle, Unlce Mimic finds a relic and is bringing it back for the towns Relic Hunter Expo. He opens the case up and reveals a lamp, no one knows what this lamp does exept your uncle, and also Risky Boots. Risky comes in and steals the lamp and sails away to look for the three Magic Seals to learn how to work the lamp. It is up to Shantae to get the lamp back and stop Risky Boots, one hair whip at a time.\n\nPros:\nGood story\nMemorable Characters (nameless npcs are even memorable)\nGood Characters (I love all characters, even nameless npcs)\nChallenging but not impossible\nExcelent Platforming + Puzzles\nFunny and unique dialouge.\nWonderful sprite animation\nAwesome soundtrack\nHigh replay value\n\nCons:\nNot best explaining on where you need to go, first playthrough will take you some hours, but once you beat the game once you will be able to fly through the game even after weeks of not playing. Sky and Bolo give you hints on what you need to do but never directly tell you what you need to do (I guess this can be a pro but this kinda hints at exploring places instead of being told what to do)\nBacktracking: ALL the backtracking isn't bad since you have to go in the area again at one point to get a key item, but I'm talking near the end of the game where you get the last power and have to go back in the temples to get the last few Magic Jam, Overall the backtracking isn't that bad\nConfusing Map first time playing. It doesn't show names of places so when a character tells you need to go to location that you never been before you will get lost since the map doesn't tell you place names.\n\nSidenotes:\n\nReplay value - This game is short so that means you can start a new game and see if you can beat it at a faster time, a really good game to speedrun.\n\nMagic Mode - This is a new mode which makes you take more damage from enemies. But you use less magic. This can be considered Hard mode, or Easy mode. If you get hit a lot and can't dodge well, consider it hard mode. If you can dodge most attacks, and know spanws of enemies and use magic well this will be easy mode.\n\nPirate's Curse - The sequel of this game, I will only review it when if it comes out on steam, right now it's only exclusive for 3DS and WiiU, I have hopes for Wayforward to add it on steam,\n\nSo that concludes my review for Shantae: Risky's Revenge, yeah there are a few cons that make it look bad but this game is really good and I highly recommend  that you get this game and start playing it.\n\nI give this game a 9/10","January 27, 2015","true","25.8"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/277890/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Shantae series, arguably the most well-known franchise from developer WayForward, had a long hiatus after its initial debut on the Game Boy Color, but has made quite a comeback more recently with Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse and the Kickstarter success Shantae: Half-Genie Hero currently in development.\n\nHowever, the series already made a return before either of those titles several years ago with Shantae: Risky’s Revenge, originally released for the DSi in 2010. Now, WayForward has brought an enhanced port to PC in the form of Shantae: Risky’s Revenge – Director’s Cut, and while there’s not enough truly new content here for fans of the original version to double dip, the game is as solid as ever, and still offers numerous reasons for platforming fans to take a look.\n\nThe story begins with the titular Shantae, a half-genie girl with magical abilities, witnessing a mysterious lamp found by her uncle being stolen by her old nemesis, the greedy pirate Risky Boots. From there, the plot is generally pretty sparse, with Shantae journeying across her home of Sequin Land in search of magical seals that will help her stop the pirate’s schemes.\n\nGameplay consists of 2D platforming across several diverse environments, as well as utilizing Shantae’s trademark abilities in battle, including her default attack of whipping her ponytail forward as well as numerous unlockable transformations. These include a monkey that can climb walls, an elephant that can destroy various rocks and obstacles, and a mermaid that can swim freely underwater.\n\nThe game’s world is laid out in a way akin to series such as Metroid, with different side-scrolling locations connected to each other to form one big map, with numerous hidden secrets and goodies that can only be fully accessed later on with abilities and items that Shantae earns throughout her adventure.\n\nWhile this approach does a good job of both encouraging and rewarding exploration and experimentation, it still also results in my biggest issue with the game, which is the problem of sometimes being stumped on where to go next, and revisiting numerous areas in vain before finding the next step in Shantae’s journey. Though that element of the game is still sometimes frustrating, WayForward made Director’s Cut a bit more tolerable, with an improved warp mechanic and a more concise map that can be referenced at any time.\n\nGraphically, though the game’s pixel art certainly looks blocky blown up to 1080p, it still has a lot of charm and attention to detail, with fluid and lively character animations and sometimes stunning environments. One downside is that the game wasn’t reworked from its original 4:3 aspect ratio to properly fit widescreens, which is unfortunate.  The soundtrack also provides a variety of catchy tunes, and the character portraits displayed during conversations have also been reworked to display in full HD.\n\nNumerous areas of the game also boast unique features, including a gauntlet of enemies to beat within a time limit or a dungeon that changes layouts depending on which way you hit switches. The game isn’t incredibly long, clocking in at about ten hours for me and possibly less for veterans who know where to go, but what’s there is fun, and the PC version only costs 9,99€, which isn’t bad when compared to many other indie games that go for double that price.\n\nOther than the improved warp and map mechanics and an unlockable mode that enhances Shantae’s magical abilities, Shantae: Risky’s Revenge – Director’s Cut doesn’t boast any big new features that would justify fans who already played the original DSi version to pay twice for what’s close to the same game. Still, it’s probably the best version available, and fans of the genre will have some good fun with it if they decide to check it out.","May 18","true","12.3"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","1"

Now for the 3rd attempt to make a sequel and I was successful thanks the loyal fans of Shantae.\n\nFirst it was digitally downloadable for the DSWare in 2009, and then ported to the 3DS and the Wii U, and now the Steam fans themselves will get a chance to play this game.\n\nthe sad part about is that I played through the game through the keyboard and not the controller, but I manage to play it through the game and it was great!\n\nI wanna give WayForward alot of props of making this game and it's highly recommendable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/recommended/277890/","poopybutts","Andem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/","618 products in account","I like Shantae, but this game is EXTREMELY flawed. Do yourself a favor and play Shantae: Pirate's Curse first before getting into this one. I did that because of the humble bundles going around this time and it gave Pirate's Curse first.\n\nI'm gonna be comparing those two games a lot since, why not.\n\nPirate's Curse did just about everything better. First off though, I like this games writing and think it can be genuinely funny at times and its just a nice light hearted adventure. The art's decent, but much better in Pirate's Curse. The music is decent, but once again much better than Pirate's Curse. The controls are fairly good, but a little better in Pirate's Curse again. I feel like Shantae's hair whip has a strange delay in this game that wasn't present in Pirate's curse, but other than that, the controls themselves are fine.\n\nThe big issue here is the level design. This is defo a Metroidvania game, and I don't think that it's quite a compliment. I don't particularly enjoy backtracking thousands of times through the same part of the level with barely any difference. Don't get me wrong, maybe one backtrack or two per level is ok. I think Pirate's Curse did it to an acceptable level. Not something I love still, but they made it fairly easy. You beat a level, and then with the power you have now, you go back to a level you were in and use that power to find the key to start the next. Very simple very easy.\n\nThis game is not so simple and easy. The level design is overly simple, yet somehow terrible and forces WAY too much backtracking. The biggest offender of all is THEY DID NOT PUT A WARP TO YOUR TOWN in this game.\n\nWHY! There are so many times you need to just go back to town, but instead you have to warp to a pumpkin patch and go through the same screen every time. Granted, they add a few enemies in there as the game progress, but it is not enough for the sheer amount of times you go through that pumpkin patch, it's awful. If you're in the town too, chances are you need to warp back somewhere, so you'll be going through the warp patch again, and you better hope you went to the right area and don't need to go through that pumpkin patch 4000000 more times.\n\nThen one other huge flaw. I don't mind the monkey transformation as it's extremely quick and easy to use and not at all clunky, but the Mermaid just seems like it was an after thought. Mermaid is basically a swimming section. It's the worst part of the game by far. You're tasked at some point to find 3 Golden Squids that are just SOMEWHERE in the water scattered around the world. You're given 0 clues other than they're in water. The water parts of the levels themselves are completely devoid of any kind of art or detail, you're mostly just swimming through complete blackness and you HAVE to hold against walls, because for some reason the Golden Squids are hidden behind walls. It was absolutely terrible and the only time I had to just look up where they were so I didn't torture myself anymore.\n\nOh right, quick note. The map is terrible in this game, and not easily accessable at all like in Pirate's Curse. This map is VERY undetailed and requires you to press pause and then scroll through items and then hit map. It doesn't show you where you are in caves or dungeons. So, once again, Pirate's Curse does it better.\n\nOther than that, I'd say this is a fairly mediocre platformer, but I do honestly really like Shantae herself as a character and am glad I played Pirate's Curse first so I wasn't turned off to it. If you want a more backtracky/Metroidvania style game, then yeah I spose get this one first.\n\nIf you want a bit of a more classic platformer style game with some Metroidvania, go with Pirate's Curse. Just get Pirate's Curse first if you're interested in Shantae, trust me.\n\nI kinda wish I could give this a thumbs sideways, but I'll stick with recommended for now since it wasn't too bad until the Mermaid section I spose.","May 5","true","5.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","7"

I played the original Shantae, though not the DSi version of this title, and while I liked it, it was a bit frustrating.  Shantae: Risky's Revenge addresses most of my complaints.  It's a fantastic little metroidvania-esque platformer.  Great animations  on all characters and monsters, warp points to help get around, much better magic/item system, very catchy music, and a much better difficulty curve than the original.\n\nI quite like Shantae: Risky's Revenge.  Others have talked about it being a lazy DSi port, but speaking as a first time player, I found this to be delightful.  There's so much color and life in the world, it was clear the developer wanted to make the world a living breathing thing, not unlike a storybook, but with better animations.  Combat is simple, whip your hair at baddies to attack, transform into different creatures to get through puzzles, use magic as is needed for help or a boost.\n\nSadly, the number of transformations have been cut down from 4 to 3 from the original Shantae, with 2 returning and only 1 being new.  And the game is much shorter than the original Shantae, though that's not necessarily bad, as much of the original was padding.  There are parts in this game that can get frustrating, such as using the powers to get over long stages full of instadeath gaps or certain enemies which never seem to go down, but they're relatively minor.\n\nIf you are looking for a long game, Shantae will only run you around 4 hours for the initial run and then another 2-3 for a replay with a new mode.  It's still very fun for the price and the animation and art style is gorgeous.  Gameplay is fun and much improved from the original.  Despite my complaints above and the game's shorter length, Shantae has an insane amount of charm and the signature Wayforward polish.\n\nHighly recommended for all platformer, metroidvania, and genie fans.  Shantae is a must play.","November 6, 2014","true","5.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/recommended/277890/","arbco","Alien Rope Burn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/","761 products in account","Risky's Revenge is... a game that charms and frustrates in equal measure. Though part of that is simply its age, a lot of it has to do with it feeling like a Super Nintendo game in both the good and bad ways.\n\nDespite being what it is - a DSi game sized up to the PC - generally Shantae looks pretty good for its age. It's well-animated with those limitations considered, though the HD graphics used for conversations and menus are both welcome and slightly jarring.\n\nOne of the big drawbacks, though, coming from the DSi, is that the movement feels slow, and it's coupled with "stop 'n go" enemies, like archers that require you to leap up into the air and repeatedly whack to clear them out of your way, or spitting foes that require you to slowly crawl towards them to engage safely. The worst offender are mermaids that appear in droves, which dive into puddles and it feels like it takes forever for them to reemerge. Maybe just a second or two, but it can make tracking back and forth a real chore. For some reason, they opted to put the warp stations to get you from area to area in out-of-the-way places, meaning that there's generally a walk to or from them to get to where you're going. And though in this kind of game you're usually given movement options that make trekking back and forth easier as time goes on, Shantae never really does other than offering new warp stations.\n\nThe controls work well for the most part, Shantae's transformations serve largely just as the lock-and-key for its exploration antics, with only one form - the monkey - providing a distinct advantage outside of unlocking play fields (it can climb walls and leap higher). Though the three additional forms are well-varied, there's not a world of reason to use them when they aren't needed. Generally, you'll be relying on hair-whipping and magic, though one kind of magic (the spiked ball) stands out above the others, often protecting Shantae and also enhancing her melee capabilities, while the others are far more situational. You'll need them all - there's at least one lock for all them - but they aren't strongly balanced. She also has another costume which basically just reduces her magic cost and increases damage, but unfortunately you can only see it by finishing the game, unlike the iOS version that gave you the option to switch back and forth very early on.\n\nShantae relies on doors that move you across lateral dimensions, and areas like the forest are easily five areas deep. Using the map becomes a necessity at times, since it's easy to get lost otherwise because of this. The forest is a particular offender, and it can be tiresome if you go through the wrong door or lose track of which area you're in at a given moment.\n\nThat being said, it does have a lot of charm to it, though a lot of the humor is hit-or-miss. Having both a female protagonist and anatagonist is rare and welcome, though the "sexy" female enemies feel gratuitious at points. If you're interested in the Shantae series, the plot of this game leads directly into the vastly improved sequel (Pirate's Curse), and it's worth a lark when it's on sale for two bucks and change, since it hardly overstays its welcome unless you focus on collecting everything in the game.  I can't recommend it unconditionally, though, and you have to go in being aware of its foibles. If you're okay with that, it's a decent little exploration platformer, though with Steam exploding with excellent games in that genre, it's hard to recommend it on that alone. It comes from a period where Wayforward was putting out nostalgia efforts that had a lot of cargo cult design, and this definitely feels like its aping games of the 90s without improving on them. It's not a bad game, but PC platforming has gotten so refined that it doesn't quite stand out.","July 5, 2015","false","6.9"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","27","40","0","3"

The reason? I had played the original Shantae on the Gameboy Color when I was younger and wasn't too big a fan of it, however I pushed on and tried out this game and I honestly have no regrets with my purchase at all. This game felt like an honest masterpiece to me and I enjoyed playing through the game multiple times. It has a great design with the sprites and art work, great music, great storyline and characters. Was just interesting to me overall and felt pretty close to a Metroid type game, which I love seeing as I've been a Metroid nerd ever since I was younger (Metroid Prime 4 and Super Metroid HD pls.) Anyways, besides that, let's get into it!\n\nThe developers did a very great job on this game, even consider it one of my favorites. They kept the simple, yet fun of old school platforming games, kept the music pretty close, kept the sprites pretty close and the game in general. They have some interesting wordplay and character development in the story that gives some of the characters their own unique personality as you go along with it. As I stated above and other have stated, keeps a very close resemblance to Metroid, Zelda, Castlevania type games. With there being collectibles and power ups to collect throughout the game, some of which you can get from the start, with the rest being able to collect as you continue on with the game and get more special abilities. Ways to increase life, items to heal health and restore magic and save rooms and certain parts of the world. There is even a different costume when you beat the game, which in a way changes your playstyle as now you take more damage, but use less magic, so where you might be able to sit around and take a few hits, now become a risk, and I love that they made that type of challenge to the game.\n\nGameplay wise is a little on the short side, about 4, maybe 5 hours worth, however, it's a story that is great, regardless of it's time. You can take it slow or speed run the game, which again, am a great fan of games that offer the option to speed run without affecting the game too much.\n\nThe controls are pretty easy to get used to, can even use a controller if you wish to play with that. They didn't feel sluggish, clumpy or anything to me, instead felt pretty smooth after I was use to everything. One quick tip that a lot of people have seemed to ask, if you want this in fullscreen, go to options, set the resolution to your monitor size, then press ALT+Enter to keep it true fullscreen.\n\nOne thing I liked in particular was how as you progress through the game, enemies from their "natural area" will start to move more closer to the lands surrounding Scuttle Town, was a pretty neat idea in my opinion, making things have a smaller challenge with their being newer enemies on the paths that you normally would just breeze right past no problem.\n\nThe bosses and their dungeons were pretty interesting, with them ranging from time trials, to puzzles to solve, all were very well executed in how they were played out with. The boss fights alone, are pretty good as well. Some of them you have to take somewhat slow so you don't rush head on and risk getting hit, where as some you can just full out attack and dodge when it's needed.\n\nThe characters are some of those characters that you "grow" a little with through your adventure, from getting closer to them, to knowing what they're about, some secrets, and a few other things you will see while playing through it.\n\n-Shantae: Can be a little arrogant at times, yet as you continue on with the game, she learns that she will need help down the road and not to push such things away\n\n-Risky Boots: sarcastic, taunting, antagonist who is always causing trouble in the story, still keeps up her taunting even if things don't go her way.\n\n-Sky: At first looks, seems to be a little hard headed alongside Shantae, but then it's noticeable that she's just trying to help out however she can.\n\n-Mimic: (for some reason, he reminded me of Lord Crump from Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.) Uncle of Shantae who is a Relic Hunter, who knows a few things which he apparently keeps a secret from you until it's basically forced from him.\n\n-Rottytops: Taunting friend of Shantae who helps you along the way while still seeming like an enemy (I mean, she took a puppy and offered it to you to eat...)\n\nThere's more you'll meet along the way as you continue on through the story.\n\nAll in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, even if I was a little off putting from the start, due to me not being a huge fan of the original Shantae I had played on the Gameboy Color, but I'm glad I went ahead and bought the game. It's a game I very much enjoy and soon a series I think I'll continue to enjoy and stick around with for a while, seeing as there are two new games coming out, one for 3DS and Wii U (hopefully PC down the road) and another one coming out on all systems and PC. I look forward to playing both new games, glad the community is so supporting with the developers making their new games, seeing as they raised a lot with their kickstarter and I truly can't wait to try out their next game, seeing where the story takes off after Risky's Revenge!\n\n10/10 Highly recommend giving it a shot!","September 3, 2014","true","60.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","9","9","3","0"

Usually I loved this. New transformations just strike me as one of the awesome things to games like this. They feel more like magic than spitting fire does.\n\nSometimes however I ran into moments natural to games like these where I wasn't sure where the game wanted me to go. Though bothersome these moments honestly didn't delay me that long. The overworld isn't that large. I found if I didn't know where to go I could just walk the whole overworld in roughly 10-20 minutes and find my new path by observation (the world of course gets larger as the game goes on, but never too large to scout in a timely manner).\n\nThe characters in this game stood out to me. None of Shantae's friends or enemies really get all that much screen time. The story and characters seem like they're kinda just tossed in as tools to get the plot rolling along. But everything and everyone in this game had a fairly memorable look and feel to it. From Shantae the bubbly sexy-cute genie girl to the flirty mermaids and swarms of nagas patrolling the overworld. Even Rottytops - a zombie girl Shantae seems to know - came off as a cute and likeable character despite clearly having no problem with the idea of eating Shantae's brain.\n\nThe animations in this were great and added a ton to the feel of the game. The transformation dances especially stood out to me as well made. But ultimately everythign in the game was beautifully animated - NPCs in town, enemy patrols, the background, Risky Boots and her funny looking ship... even Rottytops was swaying cheerfully - which probably added a lot to why she felt energetic and likable. Shantae could have used other melee-attack animations to alternate through though in my opinion; the one attack animation looked repetative.\n\nThe overworld is set up like a 3D platformer. For the most part things are left and right, but Shantae can flip to background and foreground in a few places. At first I thought this was going to end up confusing and lead to becoming lost often, but it actually turned out not to be a constant thing. The forest is the only place with enough layers to possibly confuse anyone.\n\nThe magic combat moves for the most part didn't feel very useful to me. Rapid hair-whips (Shantae's normal melee attack) were enough to get by in most cases.\n\n-Fireballs were low damage (literally 1 damage) and would only hit one enemy at a time. they were useful for burning things that needed to be hit with fire to open but unless you planned to max the fire magic it wasn't very useful. The maxed version was a low-range stream of fire; the damage was so rapid it could clear almost any non-boss monster in a single tap (some took two taps).\n\n-The various Pike spells - which are basically damaging orbs that spin around Shantae sorta like a shield - are very useful in the early and mid-game since they can keep the enemy from getting in close before it gets whammied to death. later on in the 3rd act there are enemies that can take a lot of hits and can either attack at range or rush you too fast for the pike orbs to kill them. Ultimately Pike is probably the easiest magic to play with since you can move while the spell is active. Higher level pike spells are more orbs - simple but effective.\n\n-The electric cloud spells I felt were gimmicky and only overcomplicated combat when I tried to use them. I don't think I ever found a point in the game where I was glad I had that spell on hand other than when I was required to have an electrical move to activate an explosive. They work something like a delayed bomb. You cast it, they appear, after about 2 seconds they explode or shoot lightning depending on the spell's level. More often than not by the time you cast it and the "bomb" goes off you could easily have melee attacked the enemy and killed it anyway - and often times the enemy won't be in the blast and it'll take several wasted tries before it actually lands. To it's credit it is a strongly damaging blast. I never bothered getting the highest level of this spell however. It might have been signifigantly better than the other levels in more than just damage. The first two levels of the spell were pretty useless though. I imagine the damage might be useful against bosses that don't move much but there aren't many of those; it'll be tricky trying to hit a boss with one of those.\n\nBy the end of the game one of the things that defined the game most to me was Shantae's ability to transform into animals. Her monkey form was cute and huggable. With the ability to jump higher, move faster and climb almost everything it was what I spent most of the game as. If there was a way to attack as a monkey though I'd never come acrossed it.\n\nHer elephant form was slower and a worse jumper than her human form. The elephant's main utility was to break things other forms were unable to break: walls, boulders, Golems and stone statues that shot fireballs. It was decently strong if she attacked, but since her elephant's attack was a rushing-forward attack if she didn't kill something when she used it she'd take "touch" damage. So ultimately using the elephant for anything besides a tool for smashing rocks was kind of unwise. It was a cute elephant though and I rushed around ramming low level enemies that I knew would die in one hit for the glee of it.\n\nThe mermaid transformation I have mixed feelings about. Shantae looked absolutely stunning as a mermaid, but the form felt like it was treated as a vehicle more than a form. Other transformations instantly switch off when Shantae hits any water. And Shantae isn't able to swim downwards - just left and right. So ultimately the mermaid's main ability is just being able to use down when in water. It just feels to me like it allows her to do what she already should have been capable of. Especially since the underwater areas are a bit uninteresting. Maybe the mermaid should have had some better water ability than other forms, but just treating it like a no-go zone unless you go mermaid made it feel more obligatory than fun. On land the mermaid is cute but completely at disadvantage: Can't attack, moves as slow as a walk, and every jump ends with a landing that pauses briefly every time. On land she can't even use her bubble attack - which is odd considering the enemy mermaids use it on land.\n\nEven if pretty weak at it I think all forms should be able to fight in some way and I think every form should have been able to go into water and swim around. It would have added more to the fun of the transformations. Nitpicks aside I really do love Shantae's transformations. I actually wasted a fair bit of time just transforming and screwing around - mostly as the monkey and mermaid.\n\nThe animation quality, artistic design (sexy-cute), and transformation-based nature of this game really appealed to me. The combat was very easy but never really boring. The plot was intentionally light-hearted and silly (zombies keep themselves from going mindless by drinking coffee). It's an adventure I don't think it'd be possible to hate. The only down moments I had honestly were when I felt lost and unsure what I was suppose to do to progress - which cleared up each time in minutes.\n\nI'd give this game a 8/10. I like!","November 29, 2015","true","11.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

From what I can tell it even uses some Castlevania sound effects, which I personally really appreciate. Also the way some of the enemies die, seems to have been inspired from the Castlevania series, though other games at the time did this too, it's good to see that we can still get these old-school feeling games in our day and age.\n\nThe controls are pretty much perfect, there's no knock-back when you get hit by an enemy, which is great, though it might make getting hit less punishing, which depends on your opinion if this is a pro or con. The pixel graphics are very well done, the art-stile is beautiful and the animations are very fluid. Your character can belly dance and transform into creatures like a monkey for example, which has improved running and jumping and also has the ability to climb walls.\n\nThe soundtrack is very up-beat and fits the game nicely, the composer did a great job here. There's not much else to say I guess, there's the game's humor, which has been pretty entertaining so far, but my sense of humor might differ from yours, so I obviously can't know whether you'll like it or not.\n\nI think I should mention a few things about the graphic options in the game. There's only an option for screen resolution and whether you want to stretch the screen or not. The game natively runs in a 4:3 aspect ratio, but stretching it to 16:9 doesn't really make it look noticeably worse, it doesn't really look stretched. The game starts in window mode and has no option for full screen, but this is easily fixed by pressing alt+enter at the same time. The game could use some screen filters to smooth out the pixelated look, a few people on the game's hub have been complaining about that, though I like the graphics the way they are, but more options are usually better.\n\nAll in all, this game is amazing, it's exactly what I'd expect from a top-notch metroidvania.","May 4","true","8.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It's the sequal to the original Shantae for the Game Boy Color in 2002, and was originally released on the Nintendo DSi in 2010. It's also on the Apple App Store.\n\nThe game follows Shantae, a half-genie with belly dancing powers and hair whipping. She has to stop Risky Boots from taking over her home of Scuttle Town by finding magical seals that Risky is after. It's a simple story, dialogue is few and far between, but it still has charming characters, and Shantae herself is a really nice character, being fierce and always on point. The world has lots of nice looking locations, and really captivates me with it's art style. The music blends it in well, despite being on the DS, originally.\n\nThe gameplay feels much like an old SNES game, it's pure platforming and exploring to it's core, beginning to end. And that's something that really pleases me: It's incredibly simple, there's not even that big a world to explore, but it still manages to be expansive and really rewards exploration in it's own way. There's lots of hidden goodies and upgrades for the daring explorer, and solving puzzles in dugeons always feel like a good time, testing both your platforming, and puzzle solving skills. The two mains components is what the game has, and excecutes it fabulously, it feels rewarding.\n\nShantae's main weapon is her hair (Which can be upgraded), but she can also use magical powers she can purchase from the item shop, which requires both gems and magic jam, which are more rare. These powers can be orbiting spikes around her, lightning clouds, or fireballs. There's a power for every kind of situation when hair whipping just won't do. All these powers can be upgraded as well.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Shantae, being a belly-dancer as well, can transform into different animals with her dances, whether that's a monkey, elephant, or otherwise. There's also upgrades to those transformations that let's you backtrack to previous areas, and discover more hidden items. This also let's you fight and platform in more ways than one, if you so desire.\n\nThere's a "Magic Mode" which gives Shantae a new outfit that makes her magical items more effective, but she takes double the damage from enemies. Think of it as a "Hard mode" if the game was too easy for you the first time around.\n\nThere are some issues with this game though, but keep in mind they're relatively minor.\n\n- PC wise, this is a port of a digital DSi downloaded game, so the game won't look it's best on a big monitor, may look pretty pixilated. Also, it's not widescreen supported with black bars showing up at higher resolutions, and it doesn't appear to really go into full screen. (For me, at least. It still appears windowed.)\n\n- With most metroidvania games, there is backtracking, and going from one place to another can get a little annoying when you're just trying to get from one place to another. Luckily there's these warp stones that lessen the traveling time.\n\n- It's relatively short, clocking in about 3-4 hours for one playthrough. But considering this was a portable, digital game to start off with, I understand that.\n\nOverall, Shantae is a fantastic game that you really should try out. It's a simplistic game that has excecuted it's few elements very nicely, and I think you'll be surprised.","January 2, 2015","true","33.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I felt it necessary to at least see what I was getting into, and what i found in Risky's Revenge was a neat little metroidvania that's biggest flaw is its lack of content and challenge.\n\nThis game isn't very long. It took about 6 hours on a first playthrough, not being a completionist and only going back for things if I remembered a path was blocked off. It's also incredibly easy, where the cheap price of health potions and the amount of hits you take means that you very rarely bite the dust. The bosses are also fairly linear, most having 3 alternating attacks and are weak to you spamming the attack button. Though I acquired most of the magic items for hope I would use them later, I very rarely found myself using magic outside of the necessary progression uses,. For the most part it's completely unnecessary when your main attack is so quick, useful, and doesn't take energy. The dance powers aren't useful for fighting either, which seems like a big miss to include some interesting gimmicks in boss battles. This game won't give you much of a challenge (on first playthough, at least) and many of the powers the game allows you to utilize are, to a certain extent, useless outside of platforming.\n\nWhat this game succeeds in and why i still like it is in its control, sound, and presentation. It's a beautiful game down from the character animations to the backgrounds, using the medium of pixel art to its full potential (I can ignore the semi-sloppy UI that looks tacked on from an amatuer game developer software). As expected from Jake Kaufman, this game sounds like a dream, with some tracks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3SPglviwuI having me sit for a minute just to have a moment to relax. Movement in general is very fluid and fun, which should really be you're most important goal in a good 2d platformer. In the end, the game truly comes into its own in its dungeons, puzzle solving, and platforming. The dungeons combine fun puzzles with tricky platforming that makes the game come together to a satisfying experience.\n\nFor 10 dollars, this game is worth a purchase. You can theoretically get much more than your money's worth in ng+ playthroughs which crank the difficulty. I wouldn't personally hold it up as a pillar in the metroidvania genre, but it does enough with its strengths that sets it apart from an ordinary game. This game is alright, but don't expect to be blown away.","December 4, 2015","true","6.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Vibrant looking world. Great animation, some of the best I've seen, especially for a pixel art game. Well done pixel art, not the lazy "oh I don't have the money and time to make a game look good" pixel art. Great soundtrack, done by Jake "Virt" Kaufman. Cool character designs. Good gameplay progression, everything feels paced pretty well. The dialogue is really funny and charming, the writing is very self aware and played for laughs.\n\nCons: It's kinda short, you can get through it in about 6 hours. The pixel art looks low rez on a computer monitor. The dialogue box and menus really clash with the pixel art style.\n\nOverall it's a great game, a solid 8/10 in my opinion. If you're looking for a good metroidvania, this is your game. If you're unfamiliar with the Shantae games, here's the basic gameplay: Shantae uses her hair to attack, and you can purchase spells for her to use, like a spinning ball around her, a fireball, and a stormcloud, all these spells can be upgraded a few times, and Shantae's basic abilities can be upgraded, like her hair doing more damage and being faster, or magic regain. Shantae unlocks different forms that allow her to access new areas, which I won't spoil, that she accesses through belly dancing. The PC director's cut is mostly the same as the DSi/IOS versions, with a few changes like a new gameplay mode that focuses on magic, but makes Shantae physically weaker(think a Game+ mode) and the warp system allows for free travel, instead of two warp points being assigned to eachother, and a better map system.","July 16, 2014","true","2.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Their development staff bypass most of the BS difficulty and give you challenge based upon genuine skill progression. This title is no different. If you seek a game that is challenging without the frustration of a standard platformer, try this.\n\nThe game does not condescend and yet will not pander to the lowest common denominator. Instead, the game brings you up to its level with well designed puzzles, difficulty that grows linearly, excellent controls and non-linear game design. However, the non-linear approach is also one of its weaknesses as it also involves a lot of backtracking. To add insult to injury, the original title's warp system has been downgraded to this Warp Squid system that actually makes backtracking even slower and cumbersome. Add a mediocre map system and lack of note options and getting 100% can be a slog.\n\nFor those of us with children, this is a solid title and the female lead gives your little girls the rare opportunity to play as a girl in a newer title. I can't image too many boys who will have trouble playing as Shantae either. There is much potty humor in the text and the innuendos are kept to parental bonus level and will go right over their heads.\n\nFrom a graphical standpoint, it looks like a poorly upscaled DS game (which it is). I wish WayForward had modified the sprite sheets in a manner on par with SNK's techniques, but it is a $10 game. The sounds and music are fine and fit nicely into the world.\n\nDo I recommend this? You bet. Who do I recommend this to? Anyone that likes or are looking to get a foot in the door of traditional action platforming.","August 15, 2014","true","8.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The genre has seen such a resurgence as of late with entries flooding in from all corners of the world, which is quite a good thing for connoisseurs such as myself. Traversing a wide world map, backtracking to find hidden loot, unlocking upgrades that open new paths... these are hallmarks of the genre that I will personally never tire of. And Shantae: Risky's Revenge delivers them in spades! Originally released back in 2010 on the Nintendo Dsi, it has taken four years to arrive on PC in Director's Cut form.\n\nDespite it's somewhat lengthy crossover time, the lush and vibrant sprites still hold up perfectly. With an art style quite reminiscient of the 16-bit platformers of yesteryear, Risky's Revenge would be quite at home on any oldschool console, but also shines perfectly on the PC. Add to that an amazing chiptune-style soundtrack from Jake Kaufman, it's really a treat for both the eyes and the ears. Wayforward has done away with all the original cutscene portrait sprites, and replaced them all with new HD art. On top of that there are new menus, and an enhanced warp system. Our bodacious booty-shaking belly-dancing babe of a hero has never been in such top shape!\n\nSo if all of the above isn't awesome enough, Wayforward has added an entirely new mode complete with a new costume for Shantae, unlockable once you complete the main game. Not that the game wasn't replayable already. The only thing they could have done to make this a more perfect package IMO would be if they included the original GBC Shantae game as an unlockable. Still, this package is well worth the money, and anyone who is a fan of the genre or the series should buy it posthaste.","July 23, 2014","true","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

RR nixed the pointless lives system from the original game, trading it for more save points and hit points, which better suits this style of game. If I really had any problems with the game, it would be that there wasn't any sort of dedicated button to bring up the map, forcing you to access it through the inventory screen, which is a bit tedious. The map is also a little hard to read at times, but compared to the original game which didn't have a map at all, it's a definite improvement.\n\nHaving said all of that about the base game, let's talk about the port itself. This game was originally released on the DSi and was later ported to iOS, so this game is definitely no powerhouse. Considering what they had to work with, however, WayForward did an excellent job, especially with all of the screen resolution options. I'm hoping we get to see more of their games pop up on Steam at some point in the future, like the Mighty Switch Force duology and the upcoming Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, all 3 games currently exclusive to Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. Heck, even Mighty Flip Champs would be interesting to see, especially since that had a PSP port, which was a decent translation, even when considering the game's focus on utilizing the DSi's twin screens.","October 12, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I really liked how it's a platformer with quests and story lines, looking forward to the 4th installment as I'm already playing the Pirates Curse and would love to play the original Gameboy game.\n\nIt's a good fun game that is challenging but not the bad kind that gets annoying it has some really tricky areas that are often optional.

I played the entire game shortly after release and had a great time with it. The original version was for the DS. This is a port of the iOS version, which had an extra "magic" mode and enhanced cut-scene artwork. The gameplay runs at the original 4:3 aspect ratio, so you'll have black bars on the right/left of the screen. It scales nicely up to 1080p, though- very crisp pixels. There are no filters unfortunately, but you'll probably be sitting back with a controller, and it's really beautiful pixel art. The animation is great, too. I saw some people complaining that the pixel art wasn't totally redone in high res for PC, but I'm glad they kept the original presentation.\n\nOtherwise, very good music and fun gameplay that mixes melee and different types of magic attacks. Lots of exploration, looking for items, and backtracking. Some later parts get a bit confusing - especially the last dungeon. I got frustrated sometimes, but you can always check a guide online if you get lost.\n\nOverall, not quite as good as say Shovel Knight which I played the week before. But still a really worthy release for fans of 2D platformers on PC.","July 27, 2014","true","9.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Characters that you talk with are funny and sometimes witty, and Shantae has enough personality of her own on the cutscene dialogues.\n\nAs you can clearly see by screenshots or videos, the game is a beautiful display of carefully and lovingly drawn pixels, the music is very nice and everything falls in the right place to make an enjoyable experience, albeit a little on the short side; in just 4 hours I managed to clear the game (missing some pickups), and unlocked the magic mode by doing so.\n\nOne thing I didn't really like much was the way the map and warp systems were implemented. To see the map you have to go into your inventory and select it; this wouldn't be so bad if some parts of the map didn't feel a little less detailed than desired, and in some locations you can't see a "you are here" marker which adds to the confusion for a newcomer. The warping itself also feels weird, in the sense that some warp locations feel like they're forcing you to still walk most of the distance to where you want to go, to the point of sometimes making me decide to avoid using a nearby warp because the destination I'd like to reach was equally far to another warp point I had. But, overall, they are both useful for backtracking and collecting stuff that you couldn't get at first.\n\nI'd also like to add that the game is, compounded with short, a little on the easy side. You can carry eighteen potions, nine that refill your life hearts and another nine your magic gauge, and only in a few locations did I actually use them: no more than eight total through the course of the game. They are also relatively cheap to get. Death pits take some of your health instead of outright killing you, allowing less talented people a better chance of completing the game, and only in a few locations did I feel that I was being challenged. And on the final boss fight, but even there you can use however many potions you are carrying, to the point that even someone with zero hand coordination is likely to be able to complete the game if they know what they are doing.\n\nBut, with all things said and done, Shantae is a solid game. If you like platformers you'll definitely want to have Shantae on your collection, and if you're not into platformers you may want to get Shantae anyway: it's just that good.","July 16, 2014","true","5.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

As Metroidvanias go, I'm sorry to say Shantae kind of sucks. Almost all navigation is horizontally based except when in dungeons or caves, and the map tells you next to nothing. I know this game's development was a bit troubled; it was originally trying for a GBA release, then finally made it out on DSiWare with some major cutbacks. The main arc has 3 macguffins to collect which actually involves all of... 2 dungeons and boss battles prior to the finale. The original design document for this game had the overworld set on rotational plates, which would mean that you'd come back to the same places after hitting a trigger and they'd lead to different areas instead! Sounds cool on paper, but thank GOD that was scrapped, it'd have been an extra nightmarish layer of navigation.\n\nAs it is, halfway through the game you're forced to pursue some of the arbitrary collectathon crap to unlock moves for your transformations. Then once you've collected the third macguffin you're given no real clue on what to do next until you bump into some NPCs that are rather out of their way from where they usually are, which leads to more collectathon crap to progress yet again. Risky's Revenge feels like it had so much of the original game stripped away that they were forced to take half the mandatory stuff and just hide it in random spots around the world. It's like fishing for the Triforce shards in Wind Waker all over again.

Risky's Revenge came out 8 years later on the DSi and finally got ported to the PC mid 2014.\n\nThe first thing that is a little hard to grasp are the controls. Those used to plug-n-play gamepads will be a little confused at the start menu. On the 360 pad the A button is actually the cancel action and the B button is the accept/okay button.\n\nThis can lead to some confusion, and I've heard bad things about the button remapping although I didn't try it myself. The other options come primarily in video options. I did full screen 1600x900 (my native resolution) and the game didn't full screen itself. While these are minor and inconvenient issues I feel they're worth mentioning.\n\nThe game itself definitely has a learning curve but is consistent and makes sense once that learning curve is overcome. The learning curve come in the controls and the map. The game starts you off surrounded by enemies with no mention of the attack button (default X on the 360 controller) and the map is given no explanation either, except the knowledge that there is one you should purchase.\n\nDespite these negatives or oversights the game itself is great and everyone should give it at least one playthrough. It is on the short side, but the dungeons, story, combat, and collectables more than make up for it.\n\nI can't imagine the game being replayable more than once every few years or immediately after for the pseudo-NG+ mode/100%.\n\nSo if you're hurting for money and you want your five to ten dollars to last this might not be the best purchase.\n\nFinal notes: The game took me about 5.5 hours to beat. I didn't 100% the game. You can understand the entire game without having played the first one and as a final note: This is the only shantae game on steam. The first would need to be emulated or played through nintendo's e-shop (I know it's on the 3ds) and the third one is only on the Wii U and 3DS. If you want to play the trilogy, keep that in mind.","December 26, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think my only problem in this version is that weird "layered" map style. I believe it is not very common in platformers so it probably deserved a try but I didn't like it, I hope they don't implement it in future games.\n\nAn extra labyrinth and transformation (preferably for flight like in the GBC game) would be nice, this feels short gameplay but then again, it makes this easier to replay so it's sort of OK for me.","March 13, 2015","true","28.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I loved everything about it, especially the soundtrack. (Pumpkin Fields, Lilac Fields, Dungeons.)\n\nThe game is not hard, but some bosses are. The gamelife is good, you can speedrun or take your time to beat it (if your goal is 100%) plus a hard difficulty is unlock when you finish the game for the 1st time.\n\nOf course this game is like Metroid, multiple endings but with some requirement.\n\nI recommend the game ? Sure ! The series deserve that, i can't wait the next Shantae game called Half-Genie Hero on Wii U and PC !\n\nWhile waiting for the next Shantae, i'm gonna play Pirate Curse on Wii U and of course replaying this one on Hard and getting the achievements i missed.","March 23, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Leading to me enjoying the start of the game a lot less, as well as parts of the rest. If you play windowed and/or with a keyboard, skip this part.\n\n1)  Game not fullscreening properly. I spent 10 minutes trying to get the options to work out because, by all means, it should have been working. Gave up and looked for a fix on the forums. Turns out pressing ''alt + enter'' just once while the game is open is a permanent fix. Why this hasn't been fixed yet, or is mentioned nowhere in a sticky or something is beyond me.\n\n2) The most annoying thing, because it can't easily be fixed, is that for some reason they preset A to jump and CANCEL while B is Talk/Accept (for Xbox 360 controller). THIS CANNOT BE REBOUND. You cannot give keys a double function yourself. It's preset Jump/Cancel on A, or seperate button for cancel/jump. I can't stress enough how weird it is to have those two basic keys swapped. People used to the common ''A for accept, B for cancel'' will be pressing the wrong one a lot. Note that the devs are apparently aware of this (looking at a forum post on March 12th), so this could see a fix soon. I soldiered on but if you're bothered by this one, it may be best to switch to keyboard until the fix is in.\n\nNow, on to the actual game, which I'll keep fairly short.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Great art. Backgrounds/Character Cutouts/Sprites/... .\n- Quirky story/dialogue. Not too serious, lots of funny quips.\n- Music is ok. Not too memorable but never annoying in either of my 2 playthroughs. Just there as decent background tunes.\n- Spells are fun.\n- Transformation dances are even better. Very fun to play around with.\n- Platforming is solid for the most part.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Relatively linear for most parts which gets somewhat dropped during other parts (trying to figure out which of the caves holds the next powerup). May feel a bit disjointed. (''What do you mean I can't progress here yet?'').\n- Fairly short game. My first run took 5 hours and I'm really, really good at still getting lost or taking my sweet time.\n- Hitboxes can be a bit wonky (don't try jumping over enemies that are not going towards you).\n- Spells are a bit unbalanced. Spike ball and upgrades are just too useful to not have activated 24/7, so to speak. The 2 others just take too long or are too wasteful.\n- Bosses could really use a health bar. You never really know how far down they are since they don't really change their attack patterns much.\n\n\nOveral, I'd still recommend picking it up (on sale or not). It's got its issues, but it's an okay game if you're looking for some not too serious, fairly short, metroidvania style action.","April 4, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Note that this is the only Shantae game I've ever played so I can't say how it is in relation to the series. The simple version of the story is that Risky, the villain, has stolen a magic lamp that has great evil powers. The only way to unlock the powers, however, is to use the three magic seals along with it. So your job is to collect the seals first and stop this from happening. Also, your job was to protect Scuttle Town and... in failing to stop Risky's theft you have been fired from your position of protector and asked to leave... so you must also do this task to prove your worth to the town's mayor.\n\nYou play as Shantae, a half genie that starts off being able to run, duck, jump, and whip enemies with her hair. As the game progresses you will gain more powerups. You find items to increase your health. You will find the power to transform in different animals, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, along with their own unique abilities that will help you access new parts of the world as well as find secrets. There are items available for purchase in a shop in town. Some are spells that you can use for more range and protection at the cost of magic. Some are refills for health or magic. Some are upgrades, like getting the ability to have dropped treasure gravitate towards you or better versions of your attack spells. Some of the upgrades and items will also cost a number of magic jam jars, which are hidden throughout the world as well. This makes your choices of what to buy and when more interesting. Thankfully, there are warp points and a map you can pull up to help get you from place to place faster for backtracking and exploring. The game does an interesting take on managing space. Instead of making a map very long or tall, it has you jumping into different planes, forward or backward, in order to move around the world and give it some semblence of 3D space even though the game is all 2D. There are some neat boss fights and a few interesting puzzles in the game. It's just a lovely mix of elements I really enjoy.\n\nThe game isn't that hard, but it's very satisfying. I like the music. The graphics are vibrant and colorful with fluid animations. The sound effects are crisp. It basically does what most Kirby games do. It mixes pleasing music, sounds, and visuals with cute art and fun gameplay. It's a bit more complex than most Kirby games and a different kind of gameplay, but you get the idea. It's rather simple, but it's fun. Also... sexy ladies everywhere. I mean... come on. I guess I should mention that the characters in the game actually have personalities and some of the dialogue made me genuinely laugh, which many games that try to be funny have failed to do. That's a nice touch. The game is charming, performs well, and does a lot of things that I really enjoy.\n\nThat's not to say there are no downsides, but I didn't find many. You could say it's too easy, but that depends on your own definition of easy or hard. You could say it's too short, but that depends on what you consider short or long. And also, I have to admit that while it wasn't that hard, it was fun. Plus, it didn't FEEL short to me, regardless of the 9 hours of playtime, which I honestly think is fine. Those are just possible problems you might have. The only real problems I came across while playing were a lack of dungeon maps and difficulty remembering where all the secrets were. The secrets aren't marked, which makes sense, but sometimes I'd think I had been to a place already and find out later I hadn't gone back to get that secret because the area looked the same as another. More my own fault than the game, though. And none of the dungeons are too big to navigate so the lack of a map inside them wasn't too terrible. Aside from that, I had a screen sizing issue that I found a quick fix for in the forums, but it still shouldn't have happened to start with. And the last thing is the weird adjustment of hitting B to confirm things and A to cancel them. It's not hard to adjust to that, it's just a weird thing to adjust to and it can make navigating the menu for the first time a bit confusing.\n\nOverall Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut is a very good game. It's well designed with fun gameplay, good control, interesting metroidvania style, colorful 16 bit graphics, low to moderate difficulty level, good music, and some sexy art. It's a wonderful experience. I got it gifted to me when it was on sale for 2.50, but even at the full 10 bucks, it's worth price. Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut gets a 9/10 for being a charming retro style platformer that prioritizes fun.","March 23, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

For the sake of simplicity I'll be referring to the game as Shantae from here on out.\n\nShantae is a 2D platformer port. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles and the entire game can be completed in under 5 hours on a blind playthrough. There is replay value due to "Magic Mode" (Which decreases your defense in exchange for decreased magic consumption and an even skimpier alternate costume)\n\nThe game is fun and easy to pick up. Controls are fluid and Shantae herself is well animated, making the entire game feel "Smooth". Transformation (one of the games key mechanics) is easily performed and swapped out of with no need for menues or anything like that.  Item selection, however does involve menus. The DS version lacked this problem due to the menu being on the lower screen.\n\nDifficulty is low. Enemies are easy to deal with for the most part (I hate you, Mermaids and Archers), and bosses follow patterns that can be figured out fairly easily. You have a variety of magic spells and the ability to store up to 9 potions for both health and magic. These completely refill your meter no matter how low you are.\n\nThe story is entertaining, though simple. Characters are bright and colorful and have personalities that make them stand out from eachother - even NPCs without portratis have plenty of fun and interesting things to say. There are plenty of collectibles and options for completing the game (It's a great candidate for speed runs btw, and achievements actually reward this. A second playthrough is inevitable if you want to go for the speedy route.) The game can easily be beaten in under 3 hours if you know what you're doing. Some runners have times less than 2.\n\nThe game does feature plenty of skin on display, huge cleavage and skimpy clothing are the norm for ALL female characters and there's some "Monster Girl" nudity. So if you have issues with sexual overtones in character design you've been warned.\n\nOverall it's a fun and cheap 2D platforming experience. Though a bit too short and easy for most these days.\n\nI give Shantae: Risky's Revenge Director's Cut a 7/10.","August 3, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think, had I seen this game back then I'd have love it to bits, its just a shame it arrived post Genesis and SNES era... Still...

It provides good enough difficulty that you feel it's in line with classics such as Disney's Aladdin, or Quackshot.  It's also very amusing.  I don't mean funny, so much, as amusing.  They break the 4th wall, indicating multiple times that the characters are more or less actors playing roles as written by a script, while doing it with enough enthusiasm it feels appropriately exciting.  You're never sure exactly what is "really real" and what is "scripted" from the characters' perspectives, but that doesn't matter, because it's got a great balance to their portrayal.   I'd personally like to believe that Shantae is a real full fledged Genie who is putting on a play with the rest of her friends for everyones' enjoyment!\n\nBut, whatever the "real story is", the videogame story we're given is awesome fun!  Shantae may be a story of three girl characters (Shantae, Risky Boots and Rotty Tops), but it's not "girly".  It's just plain adventurous fun!  She's also been around for a very long time, and I'm somewhat disappoitned that we don't have more of her on Steam!\n\nC'MON, WAYFORWARD!

For the sake of simplicity I'll be referring to the game as Shantae from here on out.\n\nShantae is a 2D platformer port. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles and the entire game can be completed in under 5 hours on a blind playthrough. There is replay value due to "Magic Mode" (Which decreases your defense in exchange for decreased magic consumption and an even skimpier alternate costume)\n\nThe game is fun and easy to pick up. Controls are fluid and Shantae herself is well animated, making the entire game feel "Smooth". Transformation (one of the games key mechanics) is easily performed and swapped out of with no need for menues or anything like that.  Item selection, however does involve menus. The DS version lacked this problem due to the menu being on the lower screen.\n\nDifficulty is low. Enemies are easy to deal with for the most part (I hate you, Mermaids and Archers), and bosses follow patterns that can be figured out fairly easily. You have a variety of magic spells and the ability to store up to 9 potions for both health and magic. These completely refill your meter no matter how low you are.\n\nThe story is entertaining, though simple. Characters are bright and colorful and have personalities that make them stand out from eachother - even NPCs without portratis have plenty of fun and interesting things to say. There are plenty of collectibles and options for completing the game (It's a great candidate for speed runs btw, and achievements actually reward this. A second playthrough is inevitable if you want to go for the speedy route.) The game can easily be beaten in under 3 hours if you know what you're doing. Some runners have times less than 2.\n\nThe game does feature plenty of skin on display, huge cleavage and skimpy clothing are the norm for ALL female characters and there's some "Monster Girl" nudity. So if you have issues with sexual overtones in character design you've been warned.\n\nOverall it's a fun and cheap 2D platforming experience. Though a bit too short and easy for most these days.\n\nI give Shantae: Risky's Revenge Director's Cut a 7/10.","August 3, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a genie, actually, a HALF-GENIE called Shantae, and she was going to destroy Risky's plans. After lots of Dungeons and new powers and Transformation Dances to solve Puzzles, she managed to stop Risky Boots for good.\nNow, almost a decade later, Shantae has to go to her uncle's workshop to see what he found on a trip, he start talking about his Indiana Jones-Like Adventures until something stops him, a weird noise coming from above, it's Risky Boots and she's back for her revenge against Shantae by stealing the Magic Lamp that Shantae's Uncle found, after a battle with Risky, the Mayor appears to say that Shantae is not the Guardian Genie of Sequin Land from now on. And so, the game truly begins!\nShantae has the quest of finding Three Magic Seals hidden in 2 Dungeons and 1 Challenge Tower. In each of the Dungeons, Shantae gains one of three new powers, Elephant, Monkey and Mermaid. Also, each time you get a seal, Risky appears trying to take the seals. Don't forget to do twice the Challenge Tower for a secret in the 2nd time. After this, Shantae returns home to discover that Uncle got kidnapped, but since she didn't know where he was, she needed help, that's where Squid Baron comes in. after he explodes in a Stage Clear Sequence (Shantae asks what happened, he said for her to not blame him for putting up a fight) he says he saw who kidnapped Her Uncle, but he needed help, so, yeah, help him, it's not like you have a choice, it's for more fun! After finding 3 Squid Baby, Squid Baron says Rottytops kidnapped Shantae's Uncle and it was in Risky's Hideout. After a Rayman Origins/Any 2D Shooters-Like sequence, you go through the Final (4th,3rd if you don't consider Challenge Tower a Dungeon) Dungeon of the game and battles the Final Boss!

For the sake of simplicity I'll be referring to the game as Shantae from here on out.\n\nShantae is a 2D platformer port. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles and the entire game can be completed in under 5 hours on a blind playthrough. There is replay value due to "Magic Mode" (Which decreases your defense in exchange for decreased magic consumption and an even skimpier alternate costume)\n\nThe game is fun and easy to pick up. Controls are fluid and Shantae herself is well animated, making the entire game feel "Smooth". Transformation (one of the games key mechanics) is easily performed and swapped out of with no need for menues or anything like that.  Item selection, however does involve menus. The DS version lacked this problem due to the menu being on the lower screen.\n\nDifficulty is low. Enemies are easy to deal with for the most part (I hate you, Mermaids and Archers), and bosses follow patterns that can be figured out fairly easily. You have a variety of magic spells and the ability to store up to 9 potions for both health and magic. These completely refill your meter no matter how low you are.\n\nThe story is entertaining, though simple. Characters are bright and colorful and have personalities that make them stand out from eachother - even NPCs without portratis have plenty of fun and interesting things to say. There are plenty of collectibles and options for completing the game (It's a great candidate for speed runs btw, and achievements actually reward this. A second playthrough is inevitable if you want to go for the speedy route.) The game can easily be beaten in under 3 hours if you know what you're doing. Some runners have times less than 2.\n\nThe game does feature plenty of skin on display, huge cleavage and skimpy clothing are the norm for ALL female characters and there's some "Monster Girl" nudity. So if you have issues with sexual overtones in character design you've been warned.\n\nOverall it's a fun and cheap 2D platforming experience. Though a bit too short and easy for most these days.\n\nI give Shantae: Risky's Revenge Director's Cut a 7/10.","August 3, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a platformer, which these days I normally avoid since I don't like them anymore.  Its got female main character, who is clearly built to be eye-candy... Yet... I bought Shantae's original game for the virutal console, and why didn't complete it enjoyed it.\n\nShantae feels like a decently polished game, like someone actually put some thought into things.  Its a shame some of the mechanics of the first game didn't make it into this game, a shame, but considering Shantae's status when this particular game was made, she was on hit or miss on if anything would come of her in the future.\n\nThere is *something* about the character and game which is attractive enough to you you buy and play the game, even if you never seem to find the time of day to sit down and complete it (*ahem* like me).  All and all, I find the series that is the type of game you feel like you should have played as a kid in the 90s when you were playing with Mario and Sonic... It feels on par with them.  I think, had I seen this game back then I'd have love it to bits, its just a shame it arrived post Genesis and SNES era... Still... It says something about the game, if it feels like you SHOULD have played it, when you know it hadn't come out then.  In other words, its got all the appeal factors in the right place to be something rememberable - it just wasn't when you would have expected it to be released. Thats not a bad thing, it just feels like Shantae is 10 years behind in cultural status to many of the industries other characters.\n\nI recommend playing it.\n\nThen delete the save file.\n\nAnd play it again from scratch.\n\n\n","August 6, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a genie, actually, a HALF-GENIE called Shantae, and she was going to destroy Risky's plans. After lots of Dungeons and new powers and Transformation Dances to solve Puzzles, she managed to stop Risky Boots for good.\nNow, almost a decade later, Shantae has to go to her uncle's workshop to see what he found on a trip, he start talking about his Indiana Jones-Like Adventures until something stops him, a weird noise coming from above, it's Risky Boots and she's back for her revenge against Shantae by stealing the Magic Lamp that Shantae's Uncle found, after a battle with Risky, the Mayor appears to say that Shantae is not the Guardian Genie of Sequin Land from now on. And so, the game truly begins!\nShantae has the quest of finding Three Magic Seals hidden in 2 Dungeons and 1 Challenge Tower. In each of the Dungeons, Shantae gains one of three new powers, Elephant, Monkey and Mermaid. Also, each time you get a seal, Risky appears trying to take the seals. Don't forget to do twice the Challenge Tower for a secret in the 2nd time. After this, Shantae returns home to discover that Uncle got kidnapped, but since she didn't know where he was, she needed help, that's where Squid Baron comes in. after he explodes in a Stage Clear Sequence (Shantae asks what happened, he said for her to not blame him for putting up a fight) he says he saw who kidnapped Her Uncle, but he needed help, so, yeah, help him, it's not like you have a choice, it's for more fun! After finding 3 Squid Baby, Squid Baron says Rottytops kidnapped Shantae's Uncle and it was in Risky's Hideout. After a Rayman Origins/Any 2D Shooters-Like sequence, you go through the Final (4th,3rd if you don't consider Challenge Tower a Dungeon) Dungeon of the game and battles the Final Boss! But Risky steals Shantae's powers by using the Magic Lamp and creating Nega-Shantae. As it's supposed to, Shantae wins and returns home without powers because she destroyed Nega-Shantae, she returns as the Guardian Genie of Sequin Land and everyone is happy again!

Nothing overly repetitive until final stages.\n- Speedruns. Achievements and optimizations available (it means stuff to use your brain on -- or just follow a guide if you're too lazy).\n- Excellent port with more than adequate options including 4k res setting and respectable scaling on the HD images.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Combat is a wash.

Just to remind people, the original game was first released, on the Game Boy Color,  and, while Capcom didn't make it or own copyright of it, they DID publish it. Those were the days, back when it was MUCH more obscure.\nAnyways, sometime in the future, later games led the character to become more well-known, and this was the first sequel to be released; it was originally released for the Nintendo DSi, as a downloadable game. But, as for this game, it's clearly worth checking out. Saying that, if you like open-world action platformers, you'd definitely like this game.\nIs this a non-linear adventure? Not quite. But however; there ARE some interesting achievements, that I thought seemed HILARIOUSLY awkward. But, on the other hand, the game has nicely designed graphics, a slightly interesting story, and even an iconic main heroine, that happens to be half-genie.\n----\nIs it worth buying this game? For only $9.99, it's defintely a decent deal; saying that, this game DEFINITELY doesn't have multiplayer, but it's still worth checking out. So in other words, if you want a single player game for that much money, it's a fair deal, and overall, that depends on how much you want to try it out. But overall, they did put a lot of hard work into this game, so I'd say that in my opinion, this is definitely a good deal.\nAlso, there IS A third game in the franchise; specifically being "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse", where, as a half-genie, had lost her powers, and until then, had to learn some new techniques and also rely on gadgets, to help deal with a far greater evil, and form an alliance, with an old enemy... (The price is about twice as much, but I believe that, if you aren't entirely sure about buying that game, I suggest playing this game first.)\n----\nBTW, some critics may have complained about some female characters within this franchise, seeming to them as being "over-sexualized", but if you believe me, I don't find that to be true because, it's definitely PG-rated, in nature and dialogue, saying, it's definitely a game that's actually clean, compared to some non-explicit video games of today's standards. (This includes Koei Tecmo's "Dead or Alive" franchise, which is, while nothing explicit, still being a dirty, and possibly sexist video game series, and overall, is none of my concern, because I'm not even a fan of that franchise, anyway.)","May 13","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shantae and company have very nice fluid animations and character models look bright and cartoonish, which is perfect for this style of game.\n\nSounds: 4.75 - I give it a slight knock here because I still have memories of the original game.  The music, while very well done, is missing something, and that something is the dance button music.  While it's easier to transform into animals, the original had to make use of limited buttons, but did so in an amazing way.  You hit select to enter dance mode and you used the d-pad and A/B buttons for different dance moves.  The music changes to correspond to Shantae's dance moves, which this is absent in this game.  It's one of the unique changes that was lost in this version.  Nevertheless, the music and sounds are well done, and the addition of very clear grunts from hits make up a tiny bit of this score.\n\nControls: 5 - I haven't tried the keyboard controls, but controller support is amazing.  The config options have it mapped out perfectly for anyone who has a 360 controller in their posession.  They work fluidly and near flawless.\n\nGameplay: 4.5 - This one I had trouble with, because it's STILL an amazing game to play, but I have to admit, the missing mini games and dance mode simplification dropped the score a bit.  There was a mini game in the original similar in style to DDR, but with d-pad and A/B button presses.  This is absent, but the game itself is overall fun and definitely worth every penny.\n\nOverall: 4.75 - Don't let the little changes deter you from purchase.  This is one of the greatest and underrated games from the GBC era that has a sweet sequel and a second mode to add more challenge to an already challenging platformer.  Despite the absense of the mini game and dance mode manual dance button presses, this game is a solid platformer that shouldn't be missed.  Get out there and get your belly dance on!\n\n(Caution: the belly dancing performed in this game is done by a professional belly dancer.  Do NOT attempt to try this at home....unless you REALLY REALLY want to, in which case, seek out a dance school that offers belly dancing lessons since books and video lessons only go so far.)","August 5, 2015","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've only tried the very beginning on the steam version yet and don't know the differences with the original but I can tell that in the beginning of the original there was a particular originality is how the background is designed that makes you walk on slight slopes and a little bit confusing about where to go because of how you go back and forth behind or in front. But it was precisely something I found totally original and very enjoyable actually. In this game there's a system of foreground and background zone that uses special spots to jump back and forth. I Love both the version I tried on gameboy color emulator and this one which has veeeery cute pleasing graphics and both are a pleasure for the eyes and the gameplay.

Because seriously it is.\n\nThis incarnation is a little less Nintendo hard than the original and deals with usable items and magic better as well as providing more save points.  Transformation sequences have also been simplified, which is a benefit as these got a little tedious in the original game and didn't add to the gameplay (as the transformations themselves are the real gameplay gold).\n\nGraphically the game is pretty solid, the music is fantastic, and the controls improve greatly upon the original scheme.\n\nSome might be deterred because this game is also free on IOS, I've tried playing it on IOS and it is a horrible mess because touch controls are horrendous for a game like this.  Additionally this directors cut version includes extra modes of play and a map that is not in other versions (3DS or IOS) and it is a bit cheaper than the 3DS version.\n\nIf you like platformers at all this is one to buy, especially as it is a bit more accessible than the original, bypasses the travesty that is IOS controls, and has a bit more content than the 3DS version.\n\nI'm certainly looking Wayforward to the next game from this developer.\n","July 15, 2014","true","10.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I say casual as it's a very laid back game. Not to say that it isn't boring, but it's not too difficult. There is an advanced mode unlocked at the end of the game though, which poses more of a challenge.\n\nOne of the things that really stands out in S:RR is the overall design. From the pixel graphics to the music, it all has a very nice cartoonish feel to it. It doesn't try to be super-serious. And for something that's been ported/adapted from a handheld console game, it comes across very well.\n\nThe main play style has some RPG elements, you can choose from some magic items and upgrades depending on how you want to play it, but there's not really much on that front. Most of the gameplay is standard 2D platformer fare: You're given a world and must traverse it in order to fight enemies / collect items to save your home town. Most of this works well, as it's broken up with puzzles and challenges [The battle tower is quite a good one]. My only gripe is that it's a bit easy to get lost as the map isn't great.\n\nThe window seemed a bit odd when playing. There didn't seem to be a force fullscreen option, and the game seems locked to a 4:3-ish aspect ratio. But other than those minor things, this is a good casual platformer, best played with a gamepad of some sort.","May 7","true","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While you progress through the game you revisit most of the places lots of times. It's especially enerving since the only way the game is getting more difficult is by adding more and more enemies to the screens you have to pass to get where you want and fighting them is no fun at all. Most of the screens on the map or in the dungeons just go horizontal on one plattform, means usually pressing right or left and wait till you get to the end of the screen is all you do in between fighting enemies. The jump n run parts are rarely a challenge and the overall design of the levels is pretty boring.\n\nThe art direction on the other hand is quite nice and charming and the hypno-barons lair isn't that bad.\n\nIf you wonder why the time I spend with the game is so high although it is pretty short and I obviously do not like it...

How many minutes are required before you say to yourself “Well, that was ten bucks wasted, thanks for nothing Steam’s Refund Policy.”\n\nFor me and Shantae: Risky’s Revenge the answer is “about an hour.”\n\nI’ve always wanted to play a Shantae game. The moment I saw the first one I thought it looked amazing. And it does, it totally does. The graphics, by Henk Nieborg, are lush and gorgeous and detailed in ways that few other pixel artists can approach. It’s a very beautiful game.\n\nBut these graphics hide a horrible secret: the simple, tragic truth is that the guys responsible for creating the game itself had nothing to say. They had no interesting ideas, and based on the dumbass errors they made along the way, I don’t think they’ve been paying attention to games for at least a decade, possibly since 16 bits was a lot.\n\nI don’t like the level design. Long horizontal strips with jump pads for moving into and out of the screen must have been amazing on the 3DS, but here it's just a lot of parallax that serves only to create confusing, maze-like levels.  And at the edges of these horizontal strips are, sometimes, exits to the next horizontal strip.  There's no visible indicator, so you have to walk all the way to the end to see if you can go through it or not.  And if you're not paying very close attention, you'll walk all the way over there again and again as the similar-looking strips start to blur together and you just want to find the freaking exit and get on with it.\n\nWhen the levels aren't annoyingly 3D they're almost totally linear, and somehow even this is annoying.  There are destructible blocks that look the same as indestructible blocks, except that the ones you can destroy are between you and the next place you need to go.  If it's not between you and something else, it's probably not something you can clear away.  There's no way to tell until you try, of course, the game hates you.\n\nThere are a lot of level elements that look like they should be platforms but they’re not, or they’re part of the level behind the one you’re on. It’s not at all obvious where you can and can’t go. A platform game that can’t make this clear has suffered a critical failure very early.\n\nThe game just isn’t fun. Shantae’s attacks take just that split second too long, and there’s a separate button for clearing a dialogue box instead of just using one of the existing buttons like every other game ever and I just can’t get used to it.\n\nIt feels like the best artists in the world got together with talented designers and made amazing things but then, when it came to making a game that made sense, that was tight and fun and exciting and new, they just had nothing to say. They had run dry, they weren’t the guys who knew how to game, they were artists, the best of the best, and that’s just not enough.\n\nLooks great though.","May 23, 2015","false","29.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Shantae: Risky's Revenge, is a very pretty game for those who adore pixel-art, but it does absolutely nothing else other than being pretty.\n\nThere's so much to say, but the basic fact about this game, is that it's empty. It's hollow. The devs didn't have a vision, they didn't have anything. They don't try to "talk" to you, the player. It's just yet another platformer that's only distinct by its art.\nYou enter as Shantae, a half-genie, who goes off to bring the 3 magical seals together, in order to prevent Risky, the evil pirate, from collecting them herself, from the powerful 3 barons. Because that makes sense, considering that Risky keeps beating Shantae in their every exchange.\nYou do not interact with any of the core-characters, you learn next to nothing about their world -- yet the game makes you feel like these characters are actually important, without letting you even experience them.\nFrom there, there's the actual gameplay, in which you go back-and-forth exhaustingly from one end of the map to another -- while having very few actually fun platforming challenges. Most of the time, you're just wondering: "where the heck am I supposed to go?", and the only thing that'll keep you, is that the game is not actually bad, it's just mediocre. It's sufficiently good and bad to the point you'll just go "meh", but never toss your controller over. In a way, that's its own achievement...But do not actually pay the full price for this game.\n\nI can recommend people to play the game, but not to buy it. It's a very basic platformer, and the graphics are very lovely -- you'll easily sink in at least 6 hours into this if you're into these sort of games, but for the love of god -- do not buy it for full price. I got it for about 1$ at humblebundle, and I have to say -- I got my money's worth. This game is seriously bare of any form of content, that it feels more like a walking advertisement for the Shantae series, than an actual full game.\nI enjoyed my time playing it, but I'd be seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I paid 5 or even 10 bucks for this thing.","May 9","false","8.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Elephant was pretty good, as you can cause a small AOE with a high damage with it, would've been nice for the elephant's dash to be continuous though. Mermaid... well I can't fault it really, since it opens up the last areas of the game and even gets a combat section.\n\nThe hair whip is pretty fun and upgrades thankfully make it faster. The fire special attacks were my favorite, though I typically used the fireball or flamethrower, as the triple shot was of limited use due to its angle. The balls that rotate around you are a nice bonus for the hair whip enthusiast, but I personally found the flamethrower did more when fighting bosses. Of the cloud special attacks, I only liked the first because it was useful for a boss, and overall they require more effort to use than they are worth.\n\nThe characters are alright, but I can't say any of them stood out. The character do serve their purpose of not letting you get lost very well with the hints they offer. Shantae was very well animated, and I can't quite say the last time I saw pixel boobs and booty shake so well.\n\nStory is a simple good vs. evil affair, but it gets the job done.  The level design in general is average and wasn't a fan of the stacked in front of each other level design in the forest, but I suppose it did avoid a lot of backtracking that would've otherwise occurred. Didn't like some of the enemies and how you have to jump and attack them over and over.","January 28","false","24.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

Platforming was also fair and never left me thinking that the game was being cheap. On that note, the game has just aged poorly everywhere else. The difficulty just isn't there, the level design is simplistic and requires an almost unfun amount of backtracking, item and power variety is pretty weak, and not to mention the game will take you about 5 hours at max. Your animal transformations, which should be the bulk of the game, don't really do much for you except get through small traps and whatnot. One form doesn't even see use for more than a few minutes before a plot related event makes you unable to access it, so it might as well not exist. As for items, most are useless. you'll use one or two, and then leave the rest.\n\nThe bottom line? Not a bad deal for 10 dollars, I know. If you're a fan of the series and metroidvanias, I would give this title a try if you haven't already, but get it on sale like I did. I assume that most people have already played it since it's so old. It's no La Mulana or Cave Story though, so don't go in expecting a masterpiece.","March 20, 2015","false","5.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"

But I didn't despise Shantae, and maybe that makes it more disappointing than all the developer's other lackluster offerings, because Wayforward had finally seemed to begun to show a talent for game design beyond their consistently excellent presentations. And yet here I am, full of as many reservations of recommending this as ever, yet somehow even more saddened by them.\n\nIf you've missed the Shantae series (typically a handheld series going back to the Game Boy Color), you play as the titular shape-shifting, belly dancing, half genie Shantae, sole protector of the rundown but fairly pleasant Scuttle Town. As the subtitle suggests, pirate Risky Boots has returned to have her revenge (or maybe she just likes causing trouble for no reason) and thus you embark to find the conveniently scattered magical seals to stop her schemes and save the day. Familiar? Yeah, sure, but for as limited as Shantae's narrative is its characters are endearing enough and its writing fully aware of the tropes its playing with that I actually found it surprisingly fun, for what it is. Wayforward's love of the female form continues to be on broad display, but in this instance its buxom heroine and compatriots are developed and cute enough that their bulbous chests don't end up as 90% of their personality, which if nothing else is minor progress (though the amount of jiggling can still be more than a little silly at times).\n\nThe parts I wasn't as in love with are predictably those which Wayforward had the most ground to make up with, that being the general design of the game at large. Shantae works as something of a compact exploration and upgrade focused platformer, but its aspirations are a bit too large to work within this framework. What at first seems to be a world full of hidden paths and secrets quickly dissolves to reveal one far smaller with little of interest to find, that's an enormous chore to navigate.\n\nThe amount of backtracking that was crammed into such a short game is a little astonishing, with the majority of your time being spent warping to out of the way teleporters and then having to run back through several more screens until you finally arrive where you originally wanted. It's baffling to me why the fast travel is as poorly implemented as it is, or why the map is so completely useless, keeping track of absolutely nothing (including your position on it). You're essentially expected to either posses a photographic memory, take notes of every obstacle you couldn't already pass, or tediously retread every location again and again as you unlock you moves but have no idea where to use them.\n\nWhen you finally arrive in one of the handful of dungeons the game actually stops being nearly as monotonous, but with how short these moments are in the vast expanse of repetition and mindless navigation they were nearly insignificant beyond showcasing what could have been a much better game. The lack of a map in these sections is still fairly bothersome, but there's some clever platform designs and the limited implementation of Shantae's shape-shifting ability still allows for some interesting puzzles.\n\nI feel like Wayforward came really close at times in making Shantae something worth playing, and maybe they succeeded in the sequel (or the one after that), but try as I might Risky's Revenge is still quintessentially the developer's work. Delightful spritework, fun characters, a phenomenal soundtrack, and so many poor design decisions it just makes me sad they haven't been hired onto another studio yet to work solely in the areas they really excel at.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 26, 2014","false","5.8"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","28","58","2","0"

We were both interested and I went ahead playing it and he asked me to tell him how it was when I finished it. I suppose this review is for you my friend. :)\n\nNow Shantae: Risky's Revenge was my first time ever playing from the series and I knew next to nothing about the game's story. Only the development history. I found the story to be a bit interesting but not a whole lot. The dialogue and the characters however are pretty funny, often making fourth wall jokes and jabbing at one or two video game tropes which I like. It's not the story itself you'll get invested in it's most likely the characters and their interactions you'll enjoy.\n\nVisually I'm a bit stumped. It uses pixel art and it's rather well detailed. This is some danm fine pixel art here. The odd problem I have though is that (and this is probably going to sound like the dumbest thing I've ever said) the colour palette is too strong for my taste. It's really bright and fruity and I don't exactly find that personally appealing though this is more of a personal matter. I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy the look of it. I did but just not entirely. In terms of music it's alright but I've got nothing much to say about it. It's a little on the bland side.\n\nGameplay wise it's good, it's a metroidvania game so a lot of upgrades, secrets, puzzles and backtracking which I didn't mind too much. Combat is simple and you can use abilities to help you fight but you'll most often then not just keep hitting enemies with Shantae's ridiculously agile hair. The game is actually in 2.5D which is really cool. Even though it's 2D there are muliple layers in an area to explore for goodies. Boss battles range from fun to "how long is she going to take to die?"\n\nI liked Shantae: Risky's Revenge but I didn't really love it or anything. It was a nice trip to ride and it offered a good game to play. Shantae is really cool to play as and her friends and enemies are a really cool bunch to listen to. I don't think I'm planning to get The Pirate's Curse anytime soon or the original for that matter but I'll keep an eye on Half Genie Hero and see how that's going. Risky's Revenge didn't make me a fan but I am interested in the series if you can get my idea (hope so because I don't).

Even if you rebind the buttons in the options, thouse two actions are always binded to the same button. I'm very used to jump with the accept button, so, that was VERY confusing for me.\nIn this game you need to see the map a lot and there is no way to see the map pressing just one button, you must to open the inventory and select the map in the inventory every time you want to see it. And the cursor in the inventory never starts pointing to the map.\nThe game always has two vertical bars at the sides of the screen, even when most of the levels are very wide. In this game there is no purpose for the 4:3 field of view, is not used to divide the map on "tiles" nor used to hide secrets, it was just a side effect of being a port.\nSeeing the other reviews, looks like most of the people don't care about that points, and I envy them for being able to enjoy the game, but at the same time, I think somebody has to complain about these issues.","May 4","false","3.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

There is a single key binding for "talk" (in game) and "confirm" (in menus).  I would like the confirm button to be "A" (on a controller), but doing that means that the talk button also has to be "A", meaning I can't use that for any other bindings in game, such as, oh, I don't know, JUMP.  By default, you have to press the "B" button to confirm in menus and "A" to cancel, which is completely backwards from every single other game that has ever existed.  It took me several tries to quit the game, because every time I would get into the menu and hover "exit game", I would instinctively press "A" and be brought back in.\n\nI couldn't give less of a darn how good or bad the game is because I can't freaking play it.","January 4, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","4","15","2","1"

It's sluggish, clumsy, boring, and unsatisfying. With her primary attack being a hair whip, it's really sad that it can only go out horizontally. Multi-directional whipping would have brought a lot combat, particularly against the more annoying small enemies that always come at wierd angles.\n\nStarting fire magic can't be used in the air and suffers a frustrating amount of lag to cast for a single hit plus a very slow to damage burn.\n\nThe lighting cloud does seem to have potential, but simplies takes too long to activate and alternate its attack angles to really shine.\n\nThe ball attack is the only one that seems to have practical use, but it's such a passive magic that it could just as easily be replaced by a hair damage upgrade combine with multi directional attacking.\n\nWhat further drags combat out is no cancels. In Castlevania games, you could time a jump attack so landing would interupt the lag, allowing you to attack again. Attacks on the ground could be canceled by back dashing, which Shantae can do. However, Castlevania games in many cases allowed you to cancel the back dash in some form, either with a crouch or jump, allowing practiced players to maximize damage (and feel like a badass) when an enemy was open.\n\nShantae has no way to cancel her backdash, reducing it to a meager retreat button and an clumsy sprint for speed runners.\n\n\nAs the enemies got more difficult through a combo of more attacks, more HP, and level design basically forcing you to fight them or get hit to pass by, combat had deteriorated to a yawn fest of cast ball and mash attack until it's dead. This completely steals focus from exploration and platforming, which are actually a lot of fun. But combat situations are basically forced into the spotlight constantly to the point that exploration becomes a chore instead of being fun.","September 5, 2014","false","4.4"," 11 of 35 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","11","35","2","0"

Having not played the original game, I was still able to enjoy everything this game had to offer.\n\nStory: Shantae, our Half-Genie Hero, is still the guardian of Scuttle Town, but one day, Risky Boots steals a magical lamp that has unknown properties to our hero, but since Risky took it and attacked Shantae for going after her, it could only mean bad news for Shantae and Scuttle Town. After being fired as the Guardian of the Town by the Mayor, Shantae stlll wants to stop Risky's new evil scheme, In order for the Lamp to work, it needs 3 Magic seals in order to unleash it's full power. Can Shantae collect these 3 seals and stop Risky's plot before its too late?!\n\nStory, of course is very simple, however, the dialogue and humor is what saves it. There isn't alot of Fourth Wall humor which I feel is very common for these types of indie games, (only w/ Squid Baron), and the game is very well written which made me smile alot of times. Also, I feel Shantae is one of the greater female protagonist. She's strong, funny, independent, and she is pretty cute. :3\n\nGameplay:\nThe major selling point about this game is the gameplay. Since this is a WayFoward Title, it understands foremost that it is a game. Its more of a MetroidVania or Zelda game, as you go from area to area, explore dungeons, buy and gain upgrades, discover secrets, dispose of enemies quickly in your path, solve puzzles, all that fun stuff!\n\nYou can purchase fire magic, cloud of thunder, rotating balls, all of which can be upgraded for more efficiency and use in your playthrough.\n\nIt's one of those games that keeps it's longevity through multiple playthroughs. It's a short game (5 hrs on first try, 2:30 on second go) but I still enjoyed it alot. It's not hard either, however, this version includes a "Magic Mode" where you get a new costume, however you take twice as much damage, but get a really good magic meter. There's even new dialogue when Shantae has the magic mode costume which is a cool little touch!\n\nMusic:\nJake Kaufman is a beast. He remixed tracks from the old game, created new tracks, and made me even hum some of the tracks while playing the game! Nothing to say here other than its great!\n\nGraphics:\nIts not a 3D or 2.5D game, but the sprite work and animations on the characters and enemies are still a thumbs up!\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend Risky's Revenge to anyone who enjoys these types of games.\n\nAlso, Shantae for Smash....

Slow controls and most of the game is just enemies on a flat surface. It's an alright game. Getting around works well with warp points and there's some choice in combat. (Though all of them involve stopping your movement to hit an enemy that... really.. could be jumped over. However, shops sell goodies, so you need money. What you find in chests isn't enough.) It's just that combat is so slow and the level design is sloppy. Enemies should have a function, which should rarely be wasting your time.\n\nThe game's stronger point is definitely it's colourful graphics, cheerful and cute atmosphere and the world feeling alive. When you're not in combat, the game's quite good.\n\nSo should you buy this? The answer to that is: ''Eh, I dunno''\nSome people are more tolerant to pointless combat and sloppy level design than others.\n\nEdit: It's not a bad game, but not my type of game.

It plays well, has a wonderful soundtrack, and doesn't outstay its welcome. For the asking price, I have no complaints other than the default controls. they are terrible and the rebinding can be a pain. The game does support a gamepad, so you can opt for that if the keyboard gives you problems.\n\nFor rebinding, I recommend going without the mouse, as it can't be rebound to something more useful. WASD for movement, space for jump, Q for dance, E for interaction, tab for magic. The remaining buttons can be whatever you want. Backdash, inventory, and attack will need to be rebound. You can rebind them to be used on your opposite hand (example, O for backdash, "i" for inventory, and U for attack. Anything that's comfortable. Also, since inventory pauses the screen, you can place it on "i" and have backdash and attack on the numpad).\n\nFor left handed users, i'm not sure what to set it too.","March 25, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I'll summarize it as best as I can.\n\nStory:(No Spoilers) 7/10\nPoint A to Point B to Point C. Simple, but could have used a little more. Shantae and Risky are both lively characters, every other character only has a few lines of dialogue and one or two side quests. Which isn't a lot since there aren't many upgrades and collectables.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nIt plays really similar to Castlevania. Shantae can transform into 3 different forms, Monkey, Elephant, and Mermaid. Mermaid is only used for one area of the game and felt sort of useless. Boss battles are great all the way to the final boss. The secondary power-ups didn't seem well worth it except for the Super Pike ball. Platforming is great, every dungeon has a certain way to get past them using Shantae's different forms.\n\nVisuals: 8/10\nI'm a fan of the pixel sprites, and they are well animated.Some of the characters such as Risky, Sky, and Shantae herself can be a bit off-putting for some(Cleavage and breasts), but you move past it. You know.... for the plot. The environments themselves are ok. Dungeons became very samey after a bit, but there's only four of them, and you spend most of your time running around the varied areas which are pleasing to the eye.","April 14, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And if you crave for a challenge, beating the game unlocks "magic mode" which makes you take twice the damage but you have twice the mana. Perfect for people that want more after fnishing the game or just want a challenge.\n\nIn the long run, this game is extrmely fun and it is worth the $$$.

Even tho it is a port of a game that was released some years ago on DSiWare, the games visuals look quite nice on a bigger screen with several video modes to choose from. Sound and music are quite nice, with some catchy tunes to go along the exploration and action that the game delivers. The gameplay is perfect, using a gamepad with no flaws at all that I'm aware of. I've played it using a USB adapter for a PS2 controller and it worked well after some button mapping on the options since the game is set to work with the Xbox360 controller by default. As for the game itself, well there's a lot to explore and discover resembling games such as Metroid and Castlevania but on a smaller scale, with great replay value after the first run.\n\nIf you're a fan of this genre, get this game, it worth every cent even if bought on a price drop sale (like I did).","June 14, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I actually began by contributing to the kickstarter for the upcoming forth entry, Half-Genie Hero. I had always heard good things about the series. I started with the original- an odd game by any measure, being a Gameboy Color game released at the extreme end of that console's lifespan- 2002, so extreme in fact that it had code that enabled richer colors and additional gameplay features if played on a Gameboy Advance. Sadly, though that entry was eventually available as a digital download on the Wii, it has yet to grace PC, as this entry has.\n\nRisky's Revenge is the sophmore entry in the series, also an oddball, being originally released as a digital download on, of all things, the DSi's download service. It subsequently made its way to iOS before find its true home here on Steam. Like its predecessor, Shantae: Risky's Revenge is a lighthearted metroidvania rich with the same quality of color, character design and music that characterized the console games that inspired it. The music in particular deserves special recognition, another striking example of Virt Kaufman's work- a chiptune luminary who has also worked on Shovel Knight, Scurge: Hive and Contra 4. Shantae herself is adorable and endearing, with her short temper and unconventional fighting style, using her hair to whip enemies and performing belly dances to cast transformation spells, allowing her to traverse walls as a monkey, crush rocks as an elephant or explore the depths as a mermaid. The game is alive with equally likable characters and great environments, and the fine detail down to individual enemies is notable. It also has surprisingly entertaining and occasionally risque dialogue. The PC controls are extremely solid and can be remapped to your liking, and support for several screen resolutions is available, so you can find the right balance between visibility and pixel quality. Risky's Revenge improves upon the original game in almost every category: previously disposable combat items now work off a Zelda style magic meter, the lives system is gone, falling in a pit now simply removes some health instead of killing you outright, enemies have much less health, there's an actual map, the dances are easier to perform, and generally, the cheapness factor is gone, though the loss of the bathouse in town is sorely felt, as this was the easiest way to get your health back in the original. However, for metroidvania standards, Risky's Revenge is very easy and also quite short, about five hours at even a leisurely pace, but for the price this isn't unforgivable. This PC Port is the "Director's cut" previously seen on iOS, and features an alternate costume for Shantae, unlockable after completing the game once. This outfit halves Shantae's magic usage but also her defense. This version also includes steam achievements and trading cards, if you're into that sort of thing. If you love metroidvanias or platformers of any kind, Shantae is well worth your time, and will delight you as it did me.","November 9, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of tight, metroidvania style platformers, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.\n\nThe game is extremely fun, but it does have some difficulty issues. Most of the game is a cakewalk, but the third dungeon dramatically increases difficulty and then everything just falls by the wayside again.\n\nIf I had another complaint, it would be that the game picks up too much from the initial game in the series, which was a  2002 Gameboy Color release. You can understand the plot just fine, but it feels like you are missing a lot of the character's history with each other. Nonetheless, the plot of the game is completely understandable.\n\nMinor flaws aside, this game is fantastic.

Is it a great game? No, not really.\n\nI do enjoy this game, but it doesn't do much to stand out from the crowd. In fact, the most notable things it does are probably its biggest flaws.\nFor one, the bosses in this game are all incredibly tanky despite not exactly having compelx patterns, and the fights barely escalate as they go on. The final boss especially takes ages and only changes its pattern *once*, though admittedly it's the only boss that really does pose any challenge.\nThere's also the matter of the game being pretty small for a metroidvania. Not tiny tiny small, but not very large either. The only thing that makes it hard to explore is the (kind of useless) map not alerting you to, well, anything. Collected everything in an area? Map won't tell you. Want to know where the last cave you need to visit is? Map won't tell you. It's small enough that it *can* get away with this, but being small isn't a point in its favor.\nAlso there's this stupid way-too-long shmup section near the end. Don't do that.\nOtherwise the game's good though, yeah. The mechanics are solid and there's plenty of variety in stuff to do; the overworld has more combat than platforming, but the dungeons tend to have more platforming than combat (though the battle tower, obviously, doesn't). I'd say there's a focus on combat over platforming in general but technically most combat in the game is optional, aside from any locked room with enemies or bosses.\nThere's plenty of use for all your powers, though the very last power does come a bit late and is kind of situational. I don't really feel the game ever got repetitive; the older areas, even, get new enemies the further you get into the game, so they're not just "easy town run through the easy town areas" like a lot of games, which I thought was a nice touch. Getting items is also generally unnecessary, interestingly. You can beat the game (normally) getting no extra collectibles and buying exactly two of the 9 spells. There's even an achievement for beating the game with no health upgrades, which isn't hard to do. It leaves things up to skill a lot more than the standard metroidvania, which I do appreciate.\nThe game looks great, too, nice 16-bit art style and plenty of dynamic sprites. The music is alright, a bit GBA-quality though. The dialogue's amusing enough and the plot is simply but effective, and surprisingly doesn't status-quo its ending.\nOverall I do like this game. I didn't find myself frustrated often but it can provide a decent challenge and it's certainly fun, but with a few flaws and especially a lack of content keep it from being a great game.","May 5, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And Shantae: Risky's Revenge DC is a great one. For starters, the characters are great, well animated, full of small details and same goes for graphics with that 16-bit flavour all over. Even tho it is a port of a game that was released some years ago on DSiWare, the games visuals look quite nice on a bigger screen with several video modes to choose from. Sound and music are quite nice, with some catchy tunes to go along the exploration and action that the game delivers. The gameplay is perfect, using a gamepad with no flaws at all that I'm aware of. I've played it using a USB adapter for a PS2 controller and it worked well after some button mapping on the options since the game is set to work with the Xbox360 controller by default. As for the game itself, well there's a lot to explore and discover resembling games such as Metroid and Castlevania but on a smaller scale, with great replay value after the first run.\n\nIf you're a fan of this genre, get this game, it worth every cent even if bought on a price drop sale (like I did).","June 14, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played the original Shantae, so I knew what to expect with this game. It's very similar, but greatly improved. This was originally a Nintendo DSi game, so the game isn't huge. The pixel art was also meant for a small screen, so I recommend playing in a small window.\n\nI really like the characters. They are well designed and have funny dialogue. This includes the NPCs as well. Each stage is visually pleasing with good pixel graphics and an awesome soundtrack to go with them.  The game also provides a pretty good challenge during some parts, and is a bit easier during others. The platforming is a mix of easy and tricky, and the controls are really responsive.\n\nI do wish the game was a bit longer. I felt like most of my time was spent running through stages I've already been before, even though they give you reasons to go back to them. I think if the world was slightly bigger, it would have not felt as repetitive. There are some stages that lack creativity as well. For example, some stages are just black rooms that are supposed to be dark, and you navigate blindly through them. The overall story was also a bit bland, but acceptable.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good Metroidvania style platformer. I can't say it's the best one I've played, but definitely worth buying if you can catch it on sale. I think $10 is acceptable too if you are really looking for a game to play in this genre. I will definitely be playing this again since it has a NG+ mode and would also be fun to try and speed run!","June 22, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was originally a Nintendo DSi downloadable software, but it finally makes it way to the PC... and it still looks awesome.\n\nIn Shantae, you control a half genie, explore the world and sometimes clear a few interesting dungeons. Progressing in this game is never too straightforward, so you have to explore areas carefully in order to proceed. I even got stuck a few times, but you can always return to your town in order to get help. Still, what differentiate Shantae from many other same kind of games, at least for me, is that the world is not too overwhelmingly huge. Areas are quite small, and they feel just nice to check out. You may even want to hang out in order to find all the secrets, since there's quite few of them hidden as well.\n\nGame is packed with some basic RPG elements, too. Fortunately you don't have any stats, but you can collect money in order to buy new items, abilities or attacks in the shop. Like areas, there is not too much of them, but you still won't be able to get them all in one normal playthrough. There's skills that for example speeds up your attack, absorb nearby items, etc. None of them are required to clear the game, but they'll make the game a lot easier and at a lot more fun to play.\n\nI liked this game very much. It's very well designed, art style is great and animations are really suberb. Music is catchy and writing is hilarious. It took me five hours to clear Shantae: RR, but I enjoyed almost every minute of it.

And Shantae: Risky's Revenge original and director's cut was the first shantae game release on the PC and IOS.  Shantae was a half-genie hero who is protection of Scuttle town owned by Mayor Scuttlebutt and Risky Boots was the enemy of the game was a lady-pirate who hates Shantae and have her crew of Tinkerbats to take down ScuttleTown to steal Uncle Mimic's lamp after he discovered that she needs 3 genie relems from 3 Barons: Squid Baron, Ammo Baron (that will appear in the 3rd game after giving the towns deed and become Ammo Town), and Hypno Baron(Which he disguise Shantae's uncle who mix potions that causes a fire spread when you landed on the ground and in the air, and his finger as a lasergun). the magic jam is used to buy items like puff clouds, Pike balls, and fireballs. You can buy potions, books and anything to upgrade Shantae to beat the game.  The 3 dances that has in the game is the monkey, elephant, and Mermaid (Both Monkey and Elephant has been in the first game but the monkey replace the Monkey's claw with a Monkey's climb that zoomed from one wall to another). The mermaid power-up is the bubble shooter that kills enemies underwater and in the sunking ship stage, it feels like a horizontal shooter like Gradius or R-Type.  The objective is to find magic jam scattered all over Sequin land even heart containers, special items and talisman just like the first game and i have to say, the first game Shantae was the rarest and most espensive game in Game Boy Color's library that i check on ebay that it spend about $200-300 on the real cartridge so for once i spend on at the nintendo Eshop on my 3ds.  But in this second game, it remove the lives with 3 full heart containers to start with and in a directors cut that if you kill chef's puppy, you get a bad ending and the final bosses is a TInkertub that was the beginning of the game and the end but if you destroy it you give Risky boot's all 3 genie relics, she set her uncle free and suck her half-genie magic in the lamp and become human and the leftover magic turn into Nega-Shantae or dark or shadow shantae whatever you call it and you can use items or your hair and Nega-shantae was defeated and 20 dark magic scattered over the tinkerbats and became cacklebats in the 3rd game and about it i can't get the PC version because i got the 3ds version. So i say Shantae: Risky's revenge Original and Directors Cut is one of the good Metroidvania games i play and know that it has Great controls, awesome soundtrack that was composed by Jake Kaufman(Composer of such games such as Shovel Knight, Mighty Switch Force, And Ducktales Remastered even though is one of my favorite video game composers) and better animation that Matt Bozon did well on it and I like him, he a good game designer for Wayforward Technologies and wait, the very first game he did was Mickey's ultimate challenge that he uses backgrounds for the project with the help with his wife Erin Bozon And Ret-2-go that shantae said was a reference from Xtreme Sports for Game Boy Color. My rating for this game is 87 out of 100% that i love shantae and i have all shantae games and i hope the forth game will be out someday this year.

I played the original Shantae, so I knew what to expect with this game. It's very similar, but greatly improved. This was originally a Nintendo DSi game, so the game isn't huge. The pixel art was also meant for a small screen, so I recommend playing in a small window.\n\nI really like the characters. They are well designed and have funny dialogue. This includes the NPCs as well. Each stage is visually pleasing with good pixel graphics and an awesome soundtrack to go with them.  The game also provides a pretty good challenge during some parts, and is a bit easier during others. The platforming is a mix of easy and tricky, and the controls are really responsive.\n\nI do wish the game was a bit longer. I felt like most of my time was spent running through stages I've already been before, even though they give you reasons to go back to them. I think if the world was slightly bigger, it would have not felt as repetitive. There are some stages that lack creativity as well. For example, some stages are just black rooms that are supposed to be dark, and you navigate blindly through them. The overall story was also a bit bland, but acceptable.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good Metroidvania style platformer. I can't say it's the best one I've played, but definitely worth buying if you can catch it on sale. I think $10 is acceptable too if you are really looking for a game to play in this genre. I will definitely be playing this again since it has a NG+ mode and would also be fun to try and speed run!","June 22, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was originally a Nintendo DSi downloadable software, but it finally makes it way to the PC... and it still looks awesome.\n\nIn Shantae, you control a half genie, explore the world and sometimes clear a few interesting dungeons. Progressing in this game is never too straightforward, so you have to explore areas carefully in order to proceed. I even got stuck a few times, but you can always return to your town in order to get help. Still, what differentiate Shantae from many other same kind of games, at least for me, is that the world is not too overwhelmingly huge. Areas are quite small, and they feel just nice to check out. You may even want to hang out in order to find all the secrets, since there's quite few of them hidden as well.\n\nGame is packed with some basic RPG elements, too. Fortunately you don't have any stats, but you can collect money in order to buy new items, abilities or attacks in the shop. Like areas, there is not too much of them, but you still won't be able to get them all in one normal playthrough. There's skills that for example speeds up your attack, absorb nearby items, etc. None of them are required to clear the game, but they'll make the game a lot easier and at a lot more fun to play.\n\nI liked this game very much. It's very well designed, art style is great and animations are really suberb. Music is catchy and writing is hilarious. It took me five hours to clear Shantae: RR, but I enjoyed almost every minute of it. It's not a hard game, so anyone can clear it.","September 6, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game, you are given a vague idea of where to go (if that much) and then you spend your time revisiting areas over and over until you finally find somewhere new to go.

I actually began by contributing to the kickstarter for the upcoming forth entry, Half-Genie Hero. I had always heard good things about the series. I started with the original- an odd game by any measure, being a Gameboy Color game released at the extreme end of that console's lifespan- 2002, so extreme in fact that it had code that enabled richer colors and additional gameplay features if played on a Gameboy Advance. Sadly, though that entry was eventually available as a digital download on the Wii, it has yet to grace PC, as this entry has.\n\nRisky's Revenge is the sophmore entry in the series, also an oddball, being originally released as a digital download on, of all things, the DSi's download service. It subsequently made its way to iOS before find its true home here on Steam. Like its predecessor, Shantae: Risky's Revenge is a lighthearted metroidvania rich with the same quality of color, character design and music that characterized the console games that inspired it. The music in particular deserves special recognition, another striking example of Virt Kaufman's work- a chiptune luminary who has also worked on Shovel Knight, Scurge: Hive and Contra 4. Shantae herself is adorable and endearing, with her short temper and unconventional fighting style, using her hair to whip enemies and performing belly dances to cast transformation spells, allowing her to traverse walls as a monkey, crush rocks as an elephant or explore the depths as a mermaid. The game is alive with equally likable characters and great environments, and the fine detail down to individual enemies is notable. It also has surprisingly entertaining and occasionally risque dialogue. The PC controls are extremely solid and can be remapped to your liking, and support for several screen resolutions is available, so you can find the right balance between visibility and pixel quality. Risky's Revenge improves upon the original game in almost every category: previously disposable combat items now work off a Zelda style magic meter, the lives system is gone, falling in a pit now simply removes some health instead of killing you outright, enemies have much less health, there's an actual map, the dances are easier to perform, and generally, the cheapness factor is gone, though the loss of the bathouse in town is sorely felt, as this was the easiest way to get your health back in the original. However, for metroidvania standards, Risky's Revenge is very easy and also quite short, about five hours at even a leisurely pace, but for the price this isn't unforgivable. This PC Port is the "Director's cut" previously seen on iOS, and features an alternate costume for Shantae, unlockable after completing the game once. This outfit halves Shantae's magic usage but also her defense. This version also includes steam achievements and trading cards, if you're into that sort of thing. If you love metroidvanias or platformers of any kind, Shantae is well worth your time, and will delight you as it did me.","November 9, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Expect the characters to dance around the fourth wall and keep you interested in the story! The whole experience is very well polished in part because of its length. You can't beat this kind of professional quality artwork and game design for the price tag; more so if it's on sale.\n\nWhile I would say I enjoy shorter games, the only downside here is how I wish you were given more time to spend with the Mermaid form, and I consider it one of the main reasons to purchase Risky's Revenge. (Especially since you won't see this form again until Half-Genie Hero!) It's simply awesome diving deep into the ocean, blasting away your enemies with supersonic bubbles etc. Shantae's very unique mermaid design by itself is a refreshing take on the usual depictions of mermaids in media or mythology.\n\nThe addition of Magic Mode effectively gave this edition more replay value for me as well, and arguably gives Director's Cut better value than the DSi/3DS versions of the game. ($10 here versus $12 on the eShop!) You can play as Shantae in a beautiful belly dancer outfit with twice the magical power. Shantae rocks those lovely braids! I find myself casting powerful magic at my enemies like I'm a dark mage more than I am attacking with her hair.\n\nOverall, I would gladly recommend this game, if only to experience Magic Mode, the Mermaid Form, and give someone better context for Pirate's Curse's story. Short or not, it's another sweet, humorous Shantae experience to add to your library.\n\nPros:\n• Colorful and lively animations, artwork, backgrounds, and characters. Even the enemies can be charming or cute.\n• More awesome music by Jake Kaufman. Every track in RR's OST is an earworm that keeps up with the game's own rhythm.\n• Three adorable animal forms that are faster to access than in the first Shantae, while keeping her iconic dancing animations intact.\n• Tongue-in-cheek humor with a mild awareness of the fourth wall.\n• Excellent enemies and dungeon design keep you on your toes.\n• Tons of upgrades that can make each playthrough a different experience.\n• The Squid Baron is an awesome reoccurring character.\n• A fairly large overworld with lots to see!\n• If you look for it, many of the NPCs have hilarious things to say.\n• Magic Mode. Need I say more?\n\nCons:\n• You might be mad at the length if you like 100-hour long JRPGs.\n• Having to collect talismans to unlock attacks for each animal form was a little cumbersome for me. In such a short game, this means you get even less time to use each animal form to their full potential.\n• Most of the bosses are non-engaging damage sponges. (The final boss is the worst offender.) Simply stay out of range of their attacks and use magic until they disappear in a satisfying, big boss battle explosion.\n• While the layered structure of the overworld is neat, it can be a little confusing on the first playthrough.\n• An option to switch between running by holding the attack button or not would be nice.\n• WHY IS KILLING WOBBLE BELL AN OPTION OH MY HEART WHEN THAT POOR PUPPY EXPLODED INTO GEMS","December 7, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The pixel art is nice, the controls are tight are responsive and the transformation and spells ability allow you to explore and eliminate enemies in different ways.\nThe level design is clever and build around two concepts: the ability to move between foreground/background and the need of backtracking when you get a new form that allow you to get trough a obstacle that blocked you before. This two things can leave you in a "where do I have to go next?" situation but is nothing major and you will eventually figure it out without getting the feeling of challenge into frustration.\n\nThe game is about 4-6 hours long in your first run.

This game really brought me back to my days playing super Mario world, super adventure island and other such games that got me into the hobby of playing games in the first place. The controls are tight as a drum and I never once doubted where I was going to land. Shantae is floaty enough to make jumping easy while not being so floaty that you miss your jump entirely. Playing this with an xbox controller felt natural (except for A and B being switched in the menus) and the controls just work as they should. The game has many areas to explore with vastly different sceneries to take in. however this brings me to my first gripe about the game. This game happens to suffer from the where the f*** do I go now syndrome. The map is almost completely useless and when you do find where to go you have to back track to get that one item you missed so you can progress. I several times spent too much time going the wrong direction because the game wasn't clear. There is a hint system to help alleviate this however its vague at best. I will forgive this to some degree as this is just how the genre of metroidvainia is. The only other gripe I have is that this game WAS not made for a 27 inch HD monitor as the game just looks stretched out however again I can again forgive this due to it being originally on the DSI and I did get used to how it looked and actually preferred it as again it brought me back to those old NES and SNES days. The story is nothing to be awe inspired by however it is written well and there's some witty lines in the dialogue that in one instance I think broke the 4th wall somewhat. Overall if I had to give this game a score out of 10 I would give it a 9. The game is almost perfect for what its trying to do however the lack of direction is the only real reason I have not to give this a perfect score.","January 13","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not sure if I am the best person to look up to for a New York Times or IGN review given that my current grade is a B+ in my English class, but I'll try. *Ahem* To sum this game up, it reflects a tone of different game style mashed into one, beautifully done game granted how short it is. While it's average playtime length for me doesn't seem to surpass it's predecessor, it still some how feels longer and is even more fun than I would of imagined. Now while I won't go to gamer slang like relating and connecting it to other games like most other reviews that this one will be joining soon, I will say that for platformer it blew my expections away for what that genre can do in the right hands. I never thought before I played this game that a 2-D platformer with a camera looking at you from the side could have such a huge and diverse open-world with constant secrets for you to go back to when you got new abilities and skills that made for me a complete change in the gameplay feel. The story is still interesting despite how short it is, and the next game in the series uses that to make an even better game even though the ending of the story destroyed a major mechanic in the game's core. Now if I have seemed to beat around the bush, I probably have since my English teacher says I do that in my papers a lot, but as long as they don't set up a steam account and comment about all the possible mistakes I probably have made, I'll be fine! To go back to what I said in the beginning, this game is very well done even though it's length feels less than the price suggests to me. Do I honestly recommend the game to you, random steam user #13089? Of course I will! Have you been just skimming to hear me text rant?! Do I think it's the perfect game? No, because there is no such thing because it was made by humans, and as long as that remains a fact, it shall exist naught. And have I gone on long enough? Probably so, but I can always make it longer >:3. With that final remark, I finish this review with a big ol' yes on wheter to buy it or not.","December 2, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And Shantae: Risky's Revenge original and director's cut was the first shantae game release on the PC and IOS.  Shantae was a half-genie hero who is protection of Scuttle town owned by Mayor Scuttlebutt and Risky Boots was the enemy of the game was a lady-pirate who hates Shantae and have her crew of Tinkerbats to take down ScuttleTown to steal Uncle Mimic's lamp after he discovered that she needs 3 genie relems from 3 Barons: Squid Baron, Ammo Baron (that will appear in the 3rd game after giving the towns deed and become Ammo Town), and Hypno Baron(Which he disguise Shantae's uncle who mix potions that causes a fire spread when you landed on the ground and in the air, and his finger as a lasergun). the magic jam is used to buy items like puff clouds, Pike balls, and fireballs. You can buy potions, books and anything to upgrade Shantae to beat the game.  The 3 dances that has in the game is the monkey, elephant, and Mermaid (Both Monkey and Elephant has been in the first game but the monkey replace the Monkey's claw with a Monkey's climb that zoomed from one wall to another). The mermaid power-up is the bubble shooter that kills enemies underwater and in the sunking ship stage, it feels like a horizontal shooter like Gradius or R-Type.  The objective is to find magic jam scattered all over Sequin land even heart containers, special items and talisman just like the first game and i have to say, the first game Shantae was the rarest and most espensive game in Game Boy Color's library that i check on ebay that it spend about $200-300 on the real cartridge so for once i spend on at the nintendo Eshop on my 3ds.  But in this second game, it remove the lives with 3 full heart containers to start with and in a directors cut that if you kill chef's puppy, you get a bad ending and the final bosses is a TInkertub that was the beginning of the game and the end but if you destroy it you give Risky boot's all 3 genie relics, she set her uncle free and suck her half-genie magic in the lamp and become human and the leftover magic turn into Nega-Shantae or dark or shadow shantae whatever you call it and you can use items or your hair and Nega-shantae was defeated and 20 dark magic scattered over the tinkerbats and became cacklebats in the 3rd game and about it i can't get the PC version because i got the 3ds version. So i say Shantae: Risky's revenge Original and Directors Cut is one of the good Metroidvania games i play and know that it has Great controls, awesome soundtrack that was composed by Jake Kaufman(Composer of such games such as Shovel Knight, Mighty Switch Force, And Ducktales Remastered even though is one of my favorite video game composers) and better animation that Matt Bozon did well on it and I like him, he a good game designer for Wayforward Technologies and wait, the very first game he did was Mickey's ultimate challenge that he uses backgrounds for the project with the help with his wife Erin Bozon And Ret-2-go that shantae said was a reference from Xtreme Sports for Game Boy Color. My rating for this game is 87 out of 100% that i love shantae and i have all shantae games and i hope the forth game will be out someday this year.

And since I have beaten this game I feel like I can give my 2 cents. Risky's Revenge was the highly anticipated sequel for Shantae on the Gameboy Color and it really delivers. While not as big and expansive as the first game it is still good. Everything from the graphics, music, and gameplay is amazing for a port of a dsi game. This version however has extra features that the dsi version doesn't have hence the label DX. If you beat the game once you get a different mode which decreases your defense but gives you more MP, which is good for an extra challenge, the resolution is upscaled of course, instead of the warp points only taking you to its matching one, one warp point can take you to any activated warp point which is a good reason to buy this version isntead of the dsi version, and I noticed a lot more enemies on screen than on the dsi version but I could be wrong on that one. The game plays like metroid or the ds castlevania games and while those games can be cryptic in nature, this could be beaten without a guide. It could take the average person about 3-4 hours to beat the game and the game is about 10 bucks so if you want to wait for a sale that might make it a better deal, but I don't feel like it hindered the expirience at all for me which is why I recomend this game.\n\nGraphics: This is a port of a dsi game so the graphics are very DS like. The sprites and enviroments look really good though. 8.5/10\nGameplay: Gameplay is really good. It will keep you on your toes and you wont get bored throughout the entire adventure. Again if you like metroid or ds castlevania you will feel right at home. 9/10\nSound: The sound is rocking. Some of it is cleaned up music from the first game and it was cool to see them remastered. But because there is no voice acting you wont really miss anything from muting your speakers, Although the bgm is still worth listening to. 8/10\nControl: I used the keyboard throughout my first playthrough and the controls are really responsive despite the bottomless pits and hazards thrown in your way. While I would assume using a controller would be the proper way, the keyboard controls are amazing. 10/10\nKeeping interest: You will want to play this game until the conclusion, and with multiple endings and a second mode this will keep you busy, definitely worth 10 bucks for me. 9/10\n\nAverage Score: 8.9/10","July 30, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can understand the plot just fine, but it feels like you are missing a lot of the character's history with each other.

The element is there, don't get me wrong. But the more that I've played this, the more that I just find myself saying, "No, this is leaning more and more towards Castlevania than it is a mix of the two." This is not a criticism, mind you, but rather a general observation. I'm just saying that I've played quite a few Metroidvania types of games in the past and this doesn't feel as such. I'm not saying that it isn't there, but even if it is, it's very miniscule.\n\nBut which Castlevania does it closely resemble, is what I find myself asking time and time again. The one game, based on this one's mechanics of transformations, weapon and magic upgrades, the amount of sidequesting, the amount of exploration, the big ♥♥♥♥♥ boss fights and all that other shebang in my honest opinion would have to be Symphony of the Night. Or maybe not even Symphony of the Night, maybe more like Dracula X on the SNES. The only differences here are that you got a bellydancing, hair-whipping half-genie, it's set in a faux Middle Eastern area and there's not nearly as much SERIOUS BUSINESS bullcrap going on. Because believe this or not, this game has a lot of charm for something that started out as a simple GBC title that just never got the chance to shine. It's a sad shame, really.\n\nBut now that WayForward decided to take this game over to Steam, how did I cope with this? Chances are, you're going to find yourself lost quite often. But it's only up until you find that one powerup whether it was told to you by an NPC as to where you should go next or completely by accident is where you'll end up smacking yourself in the forehead and go, "Ah, crap! That's what I needed to do!" Dungeon crawling will no doubt feel the same way, for the puzzle aspects can and will get you confused and maybe even a tad bit frustrated at a few parts, but it never feels cheap. Rather, it's this game's way of telling you that you're doing it wrong and that you need to be a little more patient on the next go-around, ya schmuck!\n\nThe graphics in this game, even if it does look like a DS port are absolutely eye-catching. You can tell that the creators at WayForward literally put their all into it and wasted no effort in making sure that this game was honed to a razor's edge. The controls may need some degree of modification on the user's part if they're stuck using a keyboard instead of a gamepad, but even then, nothing is either unwieldly, slippery, too precise or too tight. In terms of the music, oh good lord, the music fits everything to a T, whether you're in the main town, passing through the forest, plunging deep into the caverns of the unknown or taking on a boss.\n\nThere's also quite a bit of self-aware humor this game decides to throw at you, which may end up getting a chuckle out of you as well as the occasional fanservice remarks, even if it's a completely innocent sounding line, which will probably happen more often than you think.\n\nBut hey, I know what you're all wanting to know. Do I recommend this game? Freshly risen Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday, yes, I do. Wholeheartedly. This game deserves a purchase. This game deserves a spot in your library. More importantly, this game deserves a spot in your heart. It's not too often we get games like this these days and this one is definitely one for your collection.","February 21","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game really brought me back to my days playing super Mario world, super adventure island and other such games that got me into the hobby of playing games in the first place. The controls are tight as a drum and I never once doubted where I was going to land. Shantae is floaty enough to make jumping easy while not being so floaty that you miss your jump entirely. Playing this with an xbox controller felt natural (except for A and B being switched in the menus) and the controls just work as they should.

I found Shantae to be highly overrated, it's a nice metroidvania-style game, but very limited in what it does and especially short; the combat system in particular is straight on garbage, with a single option for the main attack and only three, forgettable, options as far as side weapons go. The enemies are few and featuring too many recolours, the plot is lacking, the setting nothing phenomenal, but the transformations and graphics are charming, the map is one of the most confusing and convoluted I've ever seen, the warps are placed in a very inconvenient way, so you still have to backtrack a lot. The metroidvania formula though holds up well and the two main dungeons are pretty good, especially the second one, however the game doesn't really try to do anything new or to perfect what's already there: its shortcomings are apparent.","January 30","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are, however, worth playing.\n\nYou do gain powers that open up areas you couldn't reach before, but everything is still pretty linear as far as where you can go and what you can do.\n\nI do have a couple complaints. Opening the map is a chore, as you have to hit start to go into your inventory, then select the map and use it. But not with the use item button, with the "confirm" button. Use item is for using items outside of the menu, and why there isn't just a button that opens the map on its own, I don't know. Also, the confirm button really should be something I can remap, because it feels like it should be where the cancel button is, and vice versa.\n\nThese problems are addressed in the sequel.\n\nAlso on the controls, some of the things you have to do for some of the optional areas to reach power-ups feel like the controls are overly complicated, leading to you falling in pits a lot. I'm looking at you, Monkey Bullet areas. At least all of these that I have seen are in optional areas, and aren't something the game forces you to do.\n\nThe optional power-ups in general, mainly extra hearts for your life meter, and Magic Jam (a rare currency used to upgrade spells and whatnot) aren't really something you need to actually hunt down, either. You can carry 9 potions, each healing you to full. Money isn't a problem so extending your life meter isn't ever something you feel needs to happen. Likewise, most of the spells aren't worth using 99.9% of the time.\n\nThe second fireball spell is needed for some optional item hunting, but other than that I can't really see a use for most of them.\n\nThe best part of the series, to me at least, is the writing. The characters are neat and interesting, and the main characters have interesting interactions that span both this game and its follow-up.\n\nI'd highly recommend this series if you enjoy games similar to this, and even if you don't, you should still at least get it while there is a sale. It's well worth it.","February 13","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before I say anything else, I just want to gush a little over Shantae's character design.  I only learned about this character somewhat recently, but I absolutely love her design.  She's absolutely adorable; and matches perfectly with the overall setting and mood of this game.  Her personality, hairstyle, clothes and color palette are absolutely spot on.  I couldn't think of a better protagonist for this game.  It makes me sad that this series hasn't caught on with consumers as much as I feel it should.\n\nShantae: Risky's Revenge is a very "tongue-in-cheek," Metroidvania style of game that never takes itself too seriously.  If you're looking for a deep story or characters, you won't find them here.  That said, the gameplay is no joke.  I had never played a Shantae game before; I originally thought that it was a kid's game and that it would be super easy.  However, this game was surprisingly difficult, without being frustrating.  As a platformer, the controls felt nice and tight, there were only a couple of moments when I felt like the game didn't register a button press; and that very well could have just been my controller.  As a Metroidvania style game, it's got your standard fare of money, upgrades and secrets; although the map can be a little hard to read at first, after a few minutes that difficulty had vanished.  However, I would like to point out that there were one or two moments when I felt that the game didn't make it very clear where I needed to go or what I needed to do.  Other than those select moments, the game does a very good job of teaching you the mechanics and telling you where to go without expressly holding your hand.  Throw in some fun and mildly challenging bosses and you've got yourself a pretty solid game here.  I just finished my first playthrough; I'm excited to go through it a few more times before I boot up Shantae: The Pirate's Curse.  Overall, I think this is a great game and everyone who loves this style of game should definitely check it out.","April 24","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is by no means perfect, but it is decent, and I would identify it as a flawed gem. There are perhaps very minor spoilers ahead, but they are nothing that I would consider game ruining, especially since you'll likely forget all about them as soon as you start playing.\n\nThe thing I liked the most about the game was the Baron's Lair where you get the third seal. It had just the right amount of difficulty and creativity to make it good. Admittedly, most areas of the game are a bit on a easy side, which was disappointing, but the Baron's Lair is as fine as something I would see in one of the better Zelda games. I also liked Shantae's shapeshifting abilities, which gives a new spin to the genre. The controls are pretty good too, though I used a controller. (As a sidenote, if you are button mapping for a controller, use the one in Steam's Big Picture rather than Joy2Key, because it is easier and I could not figure out how to map the control stick/d-pad. My controller has both control sticks located on the inside of the controller and the d-pad on the edges, so I found I had to map the d-pad as an axis and my left control stick as the d-pad, and it worked perfectly. I used the d-pad to play with). I did not try playing with keyboard and mouse controls, so I cannot opine on their quality.\n\nIn terms of the cons, the game tends to be too easy. It is rare to lose a significant portion of health, and the only time you will die is if you aren't paying attention to your hearts. I have not played through the harder difficulty that unlocks when you beat the game, but this might help with that. Apart from that, though, the puzzles tend to be a little easier too, which is fine sometimes, but I think the best games have a variety of difficulties for puzzles, like La Mulana (though those still tend to be more on the difficult side). Additionally the game is short and the map is relatively small, but they do a lot with the space they have, so the size of the map is not a major concern of mine. I completed my first run in a little over 6 hours.\n\nAs I said, the game is a flawed gem. I look forward to playing the third game in the series on my 3DS (also from the Humble Bundle). Overall I think I would rate the game a 7/10 (with 5/10 being average). If it had more harder parts and more content it may easily be a 10/10 game though.","May 9","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only regret not doing this earlier. But without any further ado, here is my review.\n\nOverview:\n\nShantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut is a 2D action sidescrolling platformer set in the colorful world of Sequin Land, and with the playable protagonist taking form of a half-genie called Shantae.\n\nGameplay: As expected\n\nFairly basic with no big surprises, but with plenty of interesting twists. As Shantae, navigation is limited to basic walking and jumping. But as the story unfolds, "jump pads" are introduced, allowing Shantae to swap between planes. As cool as they are, however, they only amass in two distinct biomes (Scuttle Town and Tangled Forest), and absent everywhere else.\n\nCombat is not that much different from the more well known series of platformers, but instead of turtle-resistant shoes or some crude blunderbuss loaded with candy-colored bullets, Shantae's choice of weapon is her magic-enpowered ponytail used as a hard-hitting whip, and with plenty of baddies to hit it with.\n\nAnd for the baddies that just don't go down fast enough, a small slew of unearthly powers is available for those who have whipped enough scarecrows and smashed enough pots to scratch up the necessary funds. Though initially weak and tend to gnaw down on your "magic meter", a well aimed fireball or storm puff will solve most disputes. Lastly, they can be upgraded, albeit with hefty price tags and bought in tandem with "magic jams", which are scattered around the map in such a way that you won't be in full power until the near of the end of the game.\n\nAnd to put the icing on the cake, Shantae has the unique gimmick of shape-shifting into animals via belly-dancing, but they must be "learned" by approaching a magic fountain, which appear only in the few labyrinths scattered across the region. Not a whole lot of animal transformations to speak of, but the plot cannot be advanced without the agile monkey, the powerhouse elephant, and the obviously-useless-on-land mermaid.\n\nPlot: Not left wondering\n\nNot a lot of plot to speak of, but there's plenty to go around. After neglecting an egg-sitting duty and witnessing the one and only Risky Boots stealing a "worthless"  magic lamp , Shantae is tasked with finding the  three magic seals  to ensure Risky doesn't do the same and to activate the  magic lamp's hidden power.\n\nAnd nearing the game finale, Shantae is forced to  give up  the  magic seals  to  ransom  her  adoptive uncle.  With the  magic seals  used to activate the  lamp,  Risky Boots uses it to  steal Shantae's genie half  and turns it into an  enbodiment of Shantae's genie half,  and then commands it to  destroy Shantae, who has been rendered a full human.\n\nNot surprisingly, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse follows the events of Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut.\n\nGraphics: Beautiful\n\nLike it or not, the pixel motif this game proudly displays is a nice little break from the ultra-high graphics today we crave.\nDemonstrating masterful 16-bit stylings and rich color wherever the map takes you, this game could very well disprove the dogma of polygons proving dominance over pixels.\n\nSprite-wise, this game doesn't fall short, with fluid animation breathing life into the various baddies, NPCs, and of course, Shantae herself, who doesn't miss an opportunity to express her infinite happiness.\n\nSound: Excellent\n\nBeing only a notch behind the perfection of Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, the sound effects and the soundtrack are very much worth noting, especially if the graphics weren't the redeeming factor.\n\nNot much to say about the sound effects, but in all honesty I found the scratching sound made when Shantae enters a building/door more than irritating. Good thing that really is only a problem in the  Hypno Baron's Lair .\n\nThe soundtrack, however, is most definitely worth mentioning, worthy enough in fact to just find a safe place to hold down the dance button, and to enjoy the careless waste of time. Not something I'd recommend doing, but the soundtrack really is that good.\n\nConclusion (May include things I haven't mentioned)\n\n+ Gameplay is basic enough to pick up\n+ Plenty of baddies to dispatch\n+ Jump pads add to the map\n+ Cute and colorful characters\n+ Fun-sized map\n+ Fluid sprite-work\n+ Plenty of secrets to discover and reveal\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Interesting plot twist at end\n+ Achievements add in to the replay value\n+ Gimmick belly-dancing to transform into animals\n+ Final boss fight\n\n- Shop is limited, gems severely worsen in value when everything is upgraded\n- Fun-sized map, but after the first playthough it really shows its small size\n- Jump pads only appear in two biomes\n- Higher resolutions may slow things down more than expected\n- "Alternate endings" are just portraits\n- Enemy mermaids are frustrating to kill\n- Seeing the same character portraits over and over again is a little tiring\n- Elephant and mermaid forms useless outside of their intended use\n- Annoying Soundtrack (only kidding!)\n\nExcellent game, all in all. It may not have ultra-high HD graphics, or a map as large as Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, but it doesn't have to, and that's good enough.\n\n\n\n","May 2","true","76.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Personally, my fave in that series was Simon's Quest. But that's a rabbit trail.) That and her dancing. Moving right along . . .\n\nA new touch, and rather nice, is the inclusion of "jump pads" where one may move forward and backward through the game and not just left and right.
