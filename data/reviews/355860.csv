You find yourself thrown into this strange world and everything is so strange and off-putting. Notes scattered all over the place give you an insight into it's strange inhabitants thoughts, which only adds to the creepyness. In this surreal Victorian town you meet some weird creatures that are somehow both goofy in appearance, yet oddly offputting and creepy at the same time. Several of them have dialogue that exposes some of their creepy culture and odd society. They consider you a "worm" that must be caught, and you will need to avoid them by any means necessary and escape this place.\n\nFor this, you have at your disposal several gameplay mechanics, which are introduced in a fairly gradual way.You will need to use stealth to avoid these creatures and progress, initially. You can use special lamps scattered throughout the level to make "safe spots" the creatures can't go to, but only for some seconds. And then one of the best features of the game, the switching and activating of various traps that transform the level layout itselft. The world is full of moving parts that work very well together to make various death traps that will both challenge you and help you by manipulating them to your needs.\nThere's also some sections where you need to run and evade the creatures as fast as possible, and you also get a device that helps you make the creatures dissapear for a bit so you can progress (this device can sometimes take away a bit of the tension of being chased, but I think it's used sparringly enough).\nDo mind that the game isn't really what someone would normally call "scary". You will not find the usual scares that would appear on your average horror game. It goes for unsettling and surreal imagery and sound design that always make you consider this world such a creepy and off-putting one. I think this where the game shines, by being atmospheric rather than outright scary. You will also find some disturbing more disturbing imagery and refrences that while won't scare you, they will creep the hell out of you.\n\nCoupled with great world building, I really have to mention the sound design of the game- It's legit one of the most professional crafting of sound i've ever seen(or rather, heard) in a indie game. The sound-mixing is really top-notch, and it really contributes to the atmosphere. Doors opening, floor creaking, pieces and gears moving, sound cues of enemies,  all feels very well placed and of great quality. If you have a good audio system you will really appreciate all of this as well as the great audio positioning.\nTo add to that, I have to say that there's also great voice acting, coupled with good use of voice modulation. The voices fit the characters perfectly and constitue a big part of their creepyness.\nThe soundtrack is also of note, with themes that are both soothing and calm while at same time feeding into the whole surreal vibe.\n\n\n\nWhile I really enjoyed, that  is of course not say that I didn't have some issues. The game does have a few flaws. My biggest pet-peeve is a certain section of the game(won't spoil much, but involves luring a creature) that breaks the pacing the game a bit and wasn't particularly creepy or added nothing of substance to the game in that particular area. The game does recover after that and gets the pace up again.\nThere's a few sections where the game doesn't seem to direct you to progress, and you may find yourself lost or even stuck sometimes. Biggest offender was a place where I was apparently(though I could have missed something, fair enough, although I did explore quite a bit the area) supposed to use the logic of a map exploiter and jump on a fence at a certain angle to be able to access the area. Nothing on this area suggests that's the way to take or hint a it in the slightest.\n\nI've also run into a few bugs:\n\n- Sometimes, when you respawn, the enemy spawns can get messed up(this only appears to happen in one area however). Specifically, there will be more enemies each time you respawn, sometimes spawning upwards of 30/40 enemies where normally would have been 15 or less, and can actively make your progress impossible as the sheer number of them will be enough to block you. This bug can be "fixed" by restarting the game.\n\n- I've had severe performance issues in the final area. Until this area, I was running the game comfortably @2880x1620 without a hitch. However, upon reaching this area, it immediately dropped to lower 20s. Scaled back to 1080p and while better, it still struggles to hold 30 fps and will be in the mid-twenties a lot throughout most the level. However, there's one specific room in this are where the issues the most drastic: upon this room  "spawning" the game will imeddiately drop to 15-17fps,  and if you further venture into it will get even lower, not even managing 10 fps and if you go some specific places it will even go as low as 2 FPS. My rig is a 4690k with a GTX 970, so It doesn't seem to be an issue with my build. I hope this gets patched quickly as it can really sour the enjoyment of a otherwise great performing game.\n\nOverall, I think it's a very promissing game based on this episode, and manages to keep the gameplay somewhat fresh throughout the episode, never having really a boring moment to speak of. I'd really recommend keeping a eye on this game, which as the potential to be really, really good in the following episodes.\n\n7.5/10(easily a 8 after the issues are fixed)\n+ Great artstyle, coupled with wonderful atmosphere and world building\n+ Creepyness oozes throughout everything and always keeps you on your toes\n+ Gameplay that feels fresh through the whole episode\n+ Amazing sound design\n\n- Bugs that can affect progress\n- Performance issues in the final area\n- Level design sometimes does not lead the player properly\n\nDisclaimer:Key was provided by the devs for the purpose of reviewing.","September 14, 2015","true","4.9"," 104 of 141 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","104","141","3","0"

The VR implementation of it is in a word, awful. With my new Vive in hand, I've been looking for some horror games to sink my teeth into, and decided to try this one because it looks different.\n\nThe VR implementation is braindead. It should never have been released like this. There is no movement of neck and body, your head is on a pivot. Leaning over will not move you an inch, but it sure will make you sick. Just as bad, the scale of the world is completely wrong. I feel like a giant running through and even more giant house, and turning with everything this big makes me even more sick. I do not get Sim-sickness easily, but this is one of the few first person games that has managed to make me ill. Not as bad as Town of Light, but still so bad it ruins the fun.\n\nIf the devs ever fix the game up to work with VR PROPERLY, I will revisit this review.

Creepy and claustrophobic in some places and nightmarish and adrenaline pumped in others.\nThe graphics seem a little basic and underwhelming at first, until you start to get into the game and the realization hits that you no longer see them as a negative, but they fit the atmosphere perfectly.\nThe sound and music are absolutely spot-on.  The music plinks and plonks spookily in the background but swells to fever-pitch when you get spotted.  The voice acting is probably some of the best and worst I've seen in recent years, you can tell the voice actors put their all into the work.  The problem is that, again, it all fits together perfectly, both the good and the bad.\nThe gameplay is probably the hardest to review as the game seems to change it up from time to time, first it's an exploration game as you look around to try to find out who? what? where? and why?  Then it turns into a stealth\ngame, then it's a chase game as you run away from the enemies, then it's a puzzle game, then all combined.\nAll in all, yet again, it fits together well.\n\nI would say if you enjoy horror games, or just fancy something a little different give it a try.\nGrandmother would be very dissapointed in if you don't...","September 21, 2015","true","3.0"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","28","31","2","0"

Also, Halloween is right around the corner – and the upcoming flurry of spooky titles is reflective of that: SOMA, SKYHILL, and NBA 2K16 to name just a few. Leading the pack is one Albino Lullaby, an indie title from developer Ape Law who boldly claims their horror game doesn't rely on jumpscares, blood, or gore! Pretty exciting stuff... if they can deliver.\n\nBut unlike the ape-men in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Albino Lullaby regrettably just sort of stares quizzically at the monolith that is HORROR and promptly returns to throwing monkey spunk at one another until the heat death of the universe, never realizing their true potential. What could have been a terrifying, unique experience ends up looking like a half-baked horror walking sim with an (admittedly) lovely palette.\n\nIn Albino Lullaby you're just some guy having a midnight drive when you have an entirely avoidable accident. You awaken to find yourself in an otherworldly sort of prison that appears to be seemingly empty – ironically the best sort of prison situation to be in! It's at this point the game reaches peak spookiness for better or worse. I walked around slowly, checking every corner, waiting for the other shoe to drop. When that shoe finally does drop I was pursued by the suddenly ubiquitous Grandchildren (Giant Tim Curry Heads). While initially frightening the novelty wears off quickly after you're inevitably cornered. The Grandchildren just sort of menacingly gawk at you, sliding slowly towards you as your screen fades to black (it fades quicker in the proximity of multiple Grandchildren). First time I was cornered I just, well, laughed. After being “captured” the Grandchildren are toothless and slow; more comical than sinister (e.g., Tim Curry).\n\nAs you explore the strange carnival funhouse that is the primary environment of Albino Lullaby you'll find bizarre notes that kind-of-sort-of elaborate on the weird story behind the Grandchildren. It really isn't all that special (blah blah blah they're turning us into Tim Curry heads blah blah bizarre punishment/torture blah blah) and there's so damn many of them you'll eventually tire of collecting them and just push towards the unsatisfying end that felt longer to get to than the paltry two hours it actually took (M. Night Shyamalan levels of lame predictability - groan). It wasn't compelling, just nonsensical. That's pretty much the extent of the narrative.\n\nGameplay is fairly sparse. The primary element amounts to searching for keys or pressing a series of buttons hidden throughout a level. There's also, like, a “weapon” you get in the late game and a stupid containment puzzle and plugging in cords... what little gameplay there is feels tacked on simply to avoid the dreaded "walking sim" denouncement - but that doesn't stop Albino Lullaby from being just that.\n\nIt isn't very good I'm afraid. Furthermore, it isn't scary! Creepy, strange, but never actually scary. I wanted to like it, to love it – I really did. It looks absolutely gorgeous at times (though there are some ugly textures here and there and near the end I experienced some serious frame dropping and glitches); some of the sparse dialogue you hear from the Grandchildren can be genuinely funny AND unsettling; the creepy carnival funhouse motif was a nice change of pace from dreary gray and brown hallways spattered with blood and filled with jumpscares; the music is wonderfully weird, and perhaps, perhaps with an Occulus Rift setup some will experience actual horror... but I certainly didn't, and I'm a big God damned coward! In the end, Albino Lullaby just feels like Disney's Haunted Mansion ride but somehow (unintentionally) sillier and much less memorable.\n\nThis is an episodic one so I'll likely revisit it when Episode Two rolls out around...\n\nQ1 2016.\n\nIn the meantime I'd urge you to think carefully and consider a scarier to-be-released title.\n\nLike NBA 2K16.","September 14, 2015","false","2.6"," 287 of 469 people (61%) found this review helpful 136 people found this review funny","61","287","469","136","44"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/355860/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Summary:\n\n* Atmospheric Victorian steampunk environment with a suitably grotesque story\n* A darkly cartoonish nightmare that's about rich imagery rather than scaring you silly\n* Sometimes slow and puzzly, other times fast and forcing you to think on your feet.\n* Creepiness is diluted by the time you get to the more action-driven later scenes\n* Roughly 5 hours playthrough, with optional notes to collect\n* Episode 2 is currently promised for Q2 2016\n\nFull review:\n\nHorror-wise, it's true that Albino Lullaby doesn't rely on jump scares or gore, although it does give you one or two sudden shocks and some unsettling grotesque imagery. It's more a forboding, dreamlike feeling, and use of dark surreal imagery that taps RIGHT into your dreams. It's paced nicely, with longer, slower bits building up dread, then the short release of a panicked chase or plummeting through madness.\n\nThe game is split loosely into a series of scenes, each letting you explore an area until you work out the puzzle/objective. Often it's just a case of finding the key or pressing enough buttons, but it mixes this up with mild stealth sections, panic-chases, rooftop navigation puzzles, arena fights and a clever action-puzzle towards the end where you need to work out how to trap somebody.\n\nGameplay highlights video of the first section:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1S6mNxdBMQ\n\nThe core story is best experienced free of spoilers - the creepy evil worms you see on the advertising are obviously a major part of it, and beyond that it's all about slowly revealing the horrifying truth of who they are and who you are, all the time with the threat of a sinister Grandmother hanging over it all. The story happens through action (and figuring stuff out yourself) rather than cut scenes, although occasionally it'll freeze you to the spot so you can only look around while something crucial happens.\n\nIt looks beautiful and is lit brilliantly. Every scene sets a consistent mood of suffocating Victorian creepiness, with a dash of Steampunk and a dark hand-drawn cartoon aesthetic. Most locations are packed with little details that you can easily miss if you're in a rush - such as one of the evil worms taking a bath, or gravestones whose text reveals on inspection some disturbingly young deaths.\n\nSimilar detail is found on the now-traditional horror-game notes you can pick up. As usual they flesh out the story and provide atmosphere (or just jokes), while sometimes offering clues about stuff such as how the worms are afraid of something, suggesting that maybe you could use that to your advantage. You'll probably not miss much by ignoring them, though.\n\nThe game is never unfair, always making sure to teach you stuff before you have to rely on that knowledge during more dangerous situations (eg letting you work out how to fix a broken power line at your own pace before making you do it later in a panic).\n\nAs the story goes on, you get used to the initially creepy worms and by the time you have a weapon late in the game, you'll see them as cartoonish fodder. It's definitely less spooky and more plain surreal later on - at one point you're surrounded by broken clocks, toilets and furniture, and the on-screen mission objective literally becomes "I dunno, WTF?", which did make me laugh a lot but ain't exactly horror! The final, large scene where you (sort of) take on a boss isn't scary either, but there's  satisfaction as it guides you into piecing together the final parts of the backstory.\n\nIt felt like an okay length for episode one of a story-based game - I played it through in around 5 hours. It's probably a one-shot deal; because it's all about reacting to unfamiliar situations and figuring stuff out, you'd be able to do a second runthrough in a fraction of that. Even the actions bits are mostly simple after you've figured out the knack.\n\nOn the technical side, occasionally it's a bit too dark - literally - so you simply can't see stuff. I had one major bug (too many enemies spawning and blocking a door on one level after dying several times) but this is bound to be fixed asap. I hit a few massive frame rate dips later on. It's odd how a few game props have physics (particularly the chairs), but most don't. Finally, the font can be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to read!\n\nThanks to Big Ape for supplying the pre-release version.","September 14, 2015","true","9.2"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","40","56","3","0"

One minute you're in a head-on collision with a truck, the next minute you're walking around a mansion/underground lab full of "WTF" moments and messed-up characters. This almost sounds like a bad thing, but the confusion only adds to the fear and the situation of trying to escape it all. All you need to know is that this is a place where you are not welcome and you need to get out of it.\n\nThe art design of the world has a great "scribbly/hand-drawn" quality to it and the colours and structure of the main building it all takes place in remind me of the cartoon "Courage The Cowardly Dog" and that's no bad thing :) It's not the most realistic game using the Unreal 4 Engine, but it doesn't have to be, it's still damn impressive.\n\nThe sound design and soundtrack are also perfect! Never intrusive, always tense, and the reverb and sense of space based on sound location is also good.\n\nThe enemies of this games, the "Grandchildren", freak. me. out! (In a creepy comical sense, of course!). They're pretty much sausages with faces, but its the animations, personalities (mostly left through notes found in the mansion) and the wibbly-wobbly voice-acting of them that are so off-putting, so startling, etc.\n\nThe first time you see them, they immediately grab your attention and they will follow you to kill you until it's no longer possible. Every time I saw one, I felt like I was gonna have my organs chewed on and left to die. They're insane, unreasonable and very self-preserving. I've never played a game where I felt like I was such a threat just for walking around and observing the world.\n\nMy only gripe is that I find the checkpoints to be few and far between. Many times I'd take a wrong turn, die, only to have to restart a good 30 minutes/hour of repeating a segment. But I guess this is a very unforgiving world to be in, after all.\n\nBut right now, I'm only through the first available episode and I am fully invested to see the end of episode 3!\n\nIf you're a fan of horror games but tired of the youtube-fodder of jumpscares and *sigh* Zombie Survival Horror Games, get this game.\n\nDo NOT hesistate to pick this one up! :)","October 14, 2015","true","2.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

It's a first person horror game adventure, that promises no jump scares! That's great for people like me, who enjoy horror games, but not the jump scares.\n\nMechanically Albino Lullaby is a pretty simple game. Walk around taking in the sights, collecting notes, and try not to get creeped out too much. Later on the game will introduce some minor stealth and combat mechanics as well. The game is really a lot more about the experience of it's atmosphere and story much more than it's mechanics.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWumjp91t-Y\nThe game's visuals is probably one the high points for Albino Lullaby. The textures have this pencil sketch look to it, the environments and characters are both beautiful and creepy at the same time. The game utilizes Unreal 4's engine for some pretty impressive lighting and rendering. The visuals are complimented by it's audio, with creepy background noises, subtle musical cues, and impressive voice acting. The game's presentation is spot on with what it's trying to achieve.\n\nThough I certainly enjoyed the game greatly, it's not with out it's faults. My number one compliant has to be it's performance. Though the beginning half of the game runs relatively well with above 60FPS consistently, the second half is mired with tons of frame drops. The end part of episode 1 is so bad, that my frames dipped below 10FPS and I couldn't finish it because it was just torturous to put myself through it. The game also suffers a bit from poor difficulty scaling. The first half was mostly a "walking simulator" but the game all of a sudden injects such a challenge level, that I went from a relaxing (albeit creepy) walk in the park, to having to restart a section a half dozen or more times, then it teeters off back to easy mode. These are my biggest complaints about the game. The difficulty scaling didn't mire my experience too much, but the performance issues prevented me from completing the first episode. It should go with out saying, it definitely impacted my experience negatively. Luckily for us, performance issues can be patched out, and hopefully it will be in the near future.\n\nOverall Albino Lullaby is an episodic game that seem to have a ton of potential. It's gorgeous in it's visuals, creepy in it's atmosphere, and features some damn good voice acting and dialog. It's really too bad about the performance issues, but at the time of this impression, it is a major negative factor. Luckily, I still found a lot of enjoyment out of Albino Lullaby. Here's hoping for some optimization patches soon.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing art design\n- Great dialog and voice acting\n- Atmospheric\n\nCons:\n- Terrible optimization on the 2nd half of episode 1\n- Awkward difficulty scaling","September 15, 2015","true","4.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/355860/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Introduction.\nWhen the scariest part of a horror game is the framerate, you know you’re in trouble.\n\nAlbino Lullaby: Episode One is a ‘horror’ game set in a strange mansion filled with what the game calls Grandchildren. Neither knowing how you’ve ended up in this strange place nor what it is, you have to navigate through the mansion in order to find a way out. At least that’s what I think is going on, it doesn’t really explain it. I don’t want to dedicate an entire paragraph to a non-existent story so I’ll just go ahead and say that the ending is disappointing to say the least.\n\nPresentation.\nAlbino Lullaby has an interesting art style, somewhere between cel-shaded and realistic. However, this art style is rarely visible in anything other than the game world itself, the Grandchildren aren’t of this style and neither are the notes, keys, ghost shadow things etc. On top of inconsistency, many of the textures are low quality, particularly the larger ones, as they end up looking like they’ve just been stretched. There’s not really any user interface in the game, apart from the occasional tooltip, but there’s not really any need for one. Visual effects are also lacking, in particular the fire and the clouds of debris coming off of crushed objects.\n\n\nGameplay.\nAlbino Lullaby is, effectively, a walking simulator set in a really odd house. You’re given no direction in the game so you have to figure out everything for yourself, I’ll let you decide whether or not that’s something you like. When you do figure out what to do, it’s almost always: go find x number of buttons, press them and then come back here to press this other button that’ll let open something so you can progress. If it isn’t that, you’re just walking around trying to find your way to the next place with buttons. Now, this could be somewhat interesting if you were absolutely bricking it while playing the game but as you may have guessed from my intro, this game isn’t even slightly scary. Why isn’t it scary you ask? It’s a combination of three things. First off, the game isn’t atmospheric at all, audio isn’t used very well and the contrast of light and dark isn’t used well either, it’s generally either really bright or really dark. Next, we have the fact that the Grandchildren, the only ‘threat’ to you, are not even slightly scary, if anything they’re amusing due to their resemblance to the male genitalia. Lastly, we have the fact that our only ‘threat’ pose absolutely no threat to you. Early on in the game it’s remarkably easy to just walk past them with no consequence and later on in the game you get a tool which helps you, shall we say, get rid of danger with ease.\n\nPerformance.\nNow for the most part, the game run okay-ish. I managed to maintain 30FPS with maxed out settings with a few minor framerate drops every so often. However, when you get to the last part of the game, performance takes a hit, a really big hit and things get rough. At this point in the game you’ll be luck to scrape 15FPS running on minimum graphics setting across the board and as you can imagine, trying to play a game at 15FPS is not fun. Albino Lullaby is also riddled with bugs and glitches. I regularly encountered bugs where I would just end up walking through walls and into the maps as well as lots of graphical glitches such as texture flickering when turning. Most notably, I have a game-breaking bug which actually prevents me from completing the game myself so I’ve relied upon friends to tell me the bitterly disappointing ending.\n\nAudio.\nAs I mentioned, the audio in Albino Lullaby does nothing to create a scary or even slightly creepy atmosphere. In a lot of horror games that I’ve played, the sound effects themselves (when timed correctly of course) are terrifying, even just basic, everyday noises. Albino Lullaby fails on this front, the sound effects seem to just be randomly played now and again and had no real effect on me. Unfortunately the voice acting isn’t much better. Now, don’t get me wrong, the voice actors are actually pretty good, the reason the voice acting is overall lacking is due to the fact the voice acting doesn’t fit the game. It’s so over the top that you’d expect it to be in a more humorous game, perhaps this was meant to be a humorous game (?) but instead it just feels out of place.\n\nVerdict.\nNot Worth Purchasing Unless Heavily Discounted.\n\nAlbino Lullaby is a nice idea, horror without gore, jump scares and blood. Perhaps it could have pulled it off if the game had a scary atmosphere, but it doesn’t, and so Albino Lullaby is just a walking simulator with some buttons to press and some Grandkids to run away from. Hopefully the devs will learn from episode one and the second of three will be better but I’m not going to hold my breath.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","September 15, 2015","false","4.3"," 98 of 169 people (58%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","58","98","169","19","12"

Although majority of the game was good there were some bad points. Alot of bugs still, like very early on in the game managed to walk through a wall and after a bit of walking around and managing to get back in I could progress fairly far in the game (around 20 mins of actual gameplay could be skipped).

This world is interesting, it's worth having stories told about it.....it's just a shame that the gameplay doesn't match that atmosphere. While adventuring can discover small things that help supplement the story, mechanics like the stealth sections are inaccurate, and really, can be too harsh one second, while overly sensitive the next. And there's technically issues that are hopefully fixed with this last patch, but the ability to get stuck was present, to the point where enemies were spawned so many times that it stopped you from going through door ways. Sadly that's why the game doesn't get a recommendation in the end, and hopefully the next episodes will improve the engine to help tell this story.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/wg8fPXSDKjE\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nUnsettling atmosphere creates a cool atmosphere that can makes you want to explore the world.\nThe artwork may not be graphically intense, but the contrast between the Victorian setting of the house and the monsters within works and does really well to portray the horror.\nThe Easter Island Statues are equally hilarious and scary.\nMolding of different sides of this world does work rather well.\n-:\nTechnical issues, not only on performance, but issues that stopped progress entirely that forced me to restart. While the devs are looking at the issues, but in particular, the performance issues stand out due to the lack of gameplay. I am not the only one who has faced this issue.\nThe stealth mechanics do not work. At one point, you'll have a person see you across the room, but others, you'll walk right in front of them and they won't see you. It's infuriating.\nAdventure mechanics doesn't naturally send the player to the right locations, and it can have you get off course, and get stuck.\nCollision mechanics are off. Sometimes you'll hit a gear for example, and you'll hear the sound of your flesh hitting it 2 seconds later.\nMenus are clunky in several ways. Text choice can be hard on the eyes.","September 14, 2015","false","3.4"," 82 of 142 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","82","142","5","13"

I like the fact the 'horror' is more hidden; it was almost too creepy to play and that is a huge plus in my book. To those asking what it is about ******POSSIBLE SPOILER*******\n\nI am fairly sure this is about children who are abducted by some sort of weird alien race (or perhaps the mutated form of the children themselves after they have been altered for the Grandmother? But I am not finished with game, so I could be way off) To me it has a lot of old but classic 20th century horror swirled in,  it has a bit of "Killer Clowns from Outer Space", a dash of Lovecrafts nihilistic tendencies, and maybe a bit of Machens "Lair of White Worm". I really, really like it! But I can understand that people looking for a 'shoot em up lets kill the zombies before they eat us'  type of game might not like the depth or intricacy of what is being done, no guns so far, which for me makes the game far scarier. Additionally, it has an artistic style that is incredibly cool. I feel like I am going through some kids nightmare when playing it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/355860/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","I made a video review of this game. There's a lot to love, but there's definetely hiccups\n\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmRzAYGQ-z8\n\nTranscript:\n\nWhen I began Albino Lullaby, I was completely captivated; by the art style, by the music everything. I was interested in the world that was being presented to me, and, honestly, for the first 5 - 10 minutes it doesn’t feel that much like a horror game. As the game continues on I started to feel the creepiness coming through, with clever little details around in the world that really make you uneasy. So, as I approached the end of the game, I began to wonder “What went wrong?”\n\nApe Law sold this game as horror without cheap jump-scares; they promised fear, but that fear would be built through the world and the atmosphere, rather than exploiting that surprise reflex that the horror genre really likes to ♥♥♥♥ with.\n\nAnd, for the most part, they accomplish this, though after a while it stopped being all that scary for me. The atmosphere was awesome all the way throughout, but from about the half-way point I was playing pretty recklessly -- I didn’t feel the need to hide or sneak my way past any of the monsters; because they aren’t all that hard to avoid, though I recognize that might not be the point.\n\nLike I said, the best part of the game is about the first half. And, unfortunately, that’s only about 1-2 hours in. The game isn’t very long -- it’s supposed to be the first part of an episodic trilogy, which is, as we’ve seen with Telltale, a perfectly viable business model. But, this episode took me about 3-4 hours to complete; not much longer than a Telltale episode, but it’s double the price. As far as I’m aware, a single Telltale episode goes for around $5. This game is $10, and it’s season pass is $25. That’s a pretty premium price.\n\nI also feel the gameplay was padded out with some tedious sections, and the checkpoints are very sparse. Now, this wouldn’t be a problem if the game required any skill, but it’s basically trial and error. Trial and error with barely any checkpoints leads to a pretty frustrating experience a lot of the time. In particular, one section with an elevator. You need to survive here for a couple of minutes with the main enemies of the game, but the checkpoint takes you to a spot way before you even reach the elevator. It doesn’t help that it’s easy to die, and simply not knowing what you have to do means you have to start over a lot.\n\nThe reason that particular section sticks out for me, is because up until that point the framerate was fine. But in this section with the elevator (and for even longer than that, this goes on for maybe 30 minutes) the average frame-rate was at 20. At one point I say it go down to 7 frames per second. I’m not sure if they just didn’t have time, because up until that point the performance was ok. It would sometimes drop to 50ish frames but that was the worst of it. This section of the game becomes nearly unplayable, and I even tested it on lower settings and with recording turned off; no dice.\n\nUnfortunately, I’d have to say wait for a sale unless you are REALLY into story-driven horror games that have an impressive and creative world. It’s a real shame because, like I said, there’s a lot to love in this game, and there is clearly talent behind it. I am excited for the next part, which is slated for quarter 2 of 2016 I think it said at the end, because I want to see where the story goes. I liked the ending to this episode, and I liked all of the crazy world building details throughout the mechanical mansion. And I haven’t even mentioned how they managed to strike this bizarrely effective balance, between the monsters being comedic, and them being terrifying at the same time.\n\nThe game is absolutely worth a look. But it’s gotta be on sale, or you have to be a massive fan of the atmosphere for it to be worth it.\n\nThanks for watching,\n\nSee ya!\n","September 15, 2015","true","1.5"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

Sad how a game has to say that in order to tell others how they aren't really cheap and annoying youtube-bait game, ehh?   Anyway, onto the review.\n\n\nStory:    So the story is a little bit confusing since so much is happening and the basic jist of it is that you are someone who crashes in a car, and then are put into this cage.   Not sure what happens, but then you escape from it and try to escape from the massive area that you are trapped in.  As you make your way through the game, you come across these giant worms/slugs/thumbs/ things that are really creepy and disturbing in how they look.  Avoiding them best you can, you progress further in the game to find out who they are, what they are, and find out who you are.    So the story is fair but this is just episode 1, so plenty to come hopefully.\n\n\n\nGameplay:   In a way, this is loosely like Outlast in that you run around places trying to find keys or switches to flip, all while complting objectives.  Its not quite a walking simulator in that you actually have to do things and you can die, but its not too hard to figure out what you need to do.   The controls are simple to understand and the overall gameplay experience, is straight forward.  There are papers left around to collect that have randomly written things on them.  Can't say they were useful, but the style they are written in, is fun to read lol.\n\n\nGraphics:    The graphics are interesting because the background and the props are mostly drawn or they have the LOOK that they were drawn by someone.  In a way, this makes it nice because its not the type of drawing that is annoying and childish, but its just, well, its hard to describe but it just has a feel to it that enhances the erieness of the game itself.   There are some things that are not drawn-like, and the creatures themself, are not drawn either.\n\n\nSounds:      Not much to say here except that the voicing for the creatures is great.  Creepy, weird, but fitting.   Music is minimal but its fitting as well.\n\n\n\nOthers:   For the time being, the only other thing to  say is that the Checkpoint system, is kind of tough at times.   Also, the framerate was a hassle , even with some of the graphic settings lowered so some optimization is needed.  I there are no steam cards or anything yet, so they might be added eventually.    Besides that, the game is not that bad.     If you enjoy episodic  games, then check this out.  If you want horror games that are not scary but down right creepy and weird, then check this game out.   And yes, there were no jump scares, blood, or gore.\n\n","September 28, 2015","true","2.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

They sell themselves on not relying on jumpscares or gore, and they provide a colorful and (usually) well lit environment, as opposed to corridor after corridor of pitch black rooms, lit only by the protagonist's flashlight.  The scare factor in this horror game comes from the outlandish and warped imagry, a nightmarish Victorian metropolis littered with mad, rambling messages and instructional signs suggesting a myriad of disturbing imagery, building slow and steady and coming to a peak with the introduction of the antagonists, 'The Grandchildren', disturbing, limbless slugmen with demonic faces who....  I think I've gone on long enough.\n\nI mentioned earlier this feels like a dream. I wish to clarify this into a David Lynch-inspired fever dream, and I mean that in the best possible way.

Also some plugging stuff in and doing things and other stuff.\n\nThere is one point in particular where I’m not sure if I broke the game, or if it’s what I was supposed to do. Regardless, it worked and carried me forward, towards it’s conclusion. Though, since this is an episodic game I don’t feel that conclusion should be used here. It’s break until the next chapter.\n\nThe game makes you laugh while remaining creepy and giving you a sense of unease. No jump scares here, it’s all in your head.\n\nWith this title please place your seats into the upright position, attach your headphones firmly to your ears and turn the lights down low.

There are monsters and enemies and the first encounter with them is simply chilling. Their effect does wear off but I'm still left with a creepy feeling of needing to run when I see them. Also, now that I've made it a little further into the game, the story is slowly starting to reveal itself. It just comes at you a little slowly.\n\nAll in all, I am excited to continue playing this game. I am only a short way into it and I really want to see what else this game has to offer.

There is always a feeling where something may happen while exploring this surreal place full of these creatures.  Some of the creatures aren't actually wanting to kill you but remark about your escape.  There is actually one that actually ran away from me.  Probably because I did the whole "Ferris wheel of death" before.\n\nThis is a relatively entertaining game but if you are looking for some massive horror, monsters ripping you to shreds, with gore and blood then this is not a game you are looking for.

Review changed a bit below.\n\nReview\nAlbino lullaby is an exploration based horror game by Ape Law, in it you play an unnamed character who wakes up in a strange mechanical house and must explore to find out why you're there and what brought you there.\n\nPros     Grapics, are beautiful and interesting, with a style reminiscent of crayon colouring books.\nThe music is beautiful, at times haunting.\nThe atmosphere created in this game through the clever use of music and sounds is very creepy and gives a feeling of emptyness throughout gameplay.\nThe backstory is interesting and very discomforting, the way the story is given through the use of scattered notes as well as environmentally (such as the dentist chair seen in the screenshots above) is very intuitive and to some degree allows players to choose how much story they want to ingest.\nGameplay is simple, the game is easy to pick up and play (double edged sword, see cons.)\nNo jumpscares! They decided to not take the lazy way out when scaring players.\nThe weird head things are pretty neat.\nCons     Found the game to lag quite a bit after the first play area. (I have a GTX 970 and I7 for reference)\nHad issues with recording the game in some areas.\nGameplay is rather simple, meaning some players may easily become bored if they don't enjoy exploring.\nWhen I first played I thought my character was a baby because of a glitch (can be seen in video), also couldn't run.\nThe game seems to crash if you tab out on the opening cutscene (not a huge issue, just don't tab out until you reach the start menu.)\nConclusion\nThis game is very well done in terms of fear factor and atmosphere, the music is beautiful and creepy which adds to the atmosphere of the game as well as giving the player something interesting to listen to. While the gameplay mechanics and puzzles are rather simple, I personally enjoyed the exploration aspect of the game enough that it didn't get boring to play. No jumpscares! not much more needs to be said about that. The story is discomforting and, at times, made me stop playing briefly to digest it, which is how a horror game should be.\n\nFor content creators, this game can be quite buggy and I found it lagged substantially during recording, so unless you really want to record this game, maybe think about recording a different series.\n\n6/10 If you enjoy exploring worlds with a good backstory.\n5/10 otherwise.\n\nOriginal gameplay video for reference: https://youtu.be/erl0ymSqjmI","September 15, 2015","true","2.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The game's music is as "trippy" as the visuals which is very key for this title.

Well at least the first episode as of this review. The world is inventive and intriguing. I read every bit of paper I could find. Normally reserved for Slender knock-offs, I usually ignore these collectibles. In this game, they are short, sweet, interesting, and often pretty funny.\n\nIt straddles a strange line between creepy atmosphere, interesting world building, and humor. My only major issue with the first episode was the frame rate on the final chapter. Before that point in the game, it was smooth sailing. I was down into the 15-20fps range with a GTX 660 at the end, which is not great. It reminded me of the Meat Circus in Psychonauts before the recent patch. The solid frame rate combined with amazing level designs of the earlier sections were thrown out of Psychonauts and this game at the end, which is a major bummer. I don't think it completely destroys the game, but I would recommend waiting until they patch this bug.

One of the few indie games I was hoping to be good in 2015 turned out to be f@cking amazing! Originally I saw this game when the kickstarter for it first came out which was almost a year ago and that's when this game really hooked me in. Almost daily, I would check to see if there was anymore news about the game because I was truely excited for it. When I finally played it here are my thoughts. (I will also use the demo in comparison).\n\nWhat really got me hooked was the art style. It is really good in my opinion and I just love it although I dont know what this would be classified as. Another cool thing I was worried was the statement "Albino Lullaby is a horror adventure game that doesn't rely on jump scares or gore." This was really good since I hate the games that rely on those cheap tactics and I was a little worried that the game wouldn't be scary (granted, each of us experiences horror a little bit differently so my reflection probably will be different from your experience). I honestly found the game to be scary, like in the middle to end parts. My heart was pounding and I feel they got the suspense right. What I TRUELY love is the dual control type (I don't know what's its classified as) but if you're a person who just loves to press the ctrl button to crouch and tap it again to get up, you're good. If you're a person like me who holds it, it has that too. Now this is the cool part that I wish more games would do, You can switch to either anytime you would like wihtout going in the options menu. One final note is that the developers DO LISTEN. I have complained about the motion blur in the demo which gave me horrendous headaches and truely made me feel sick. It looks like they got rid of it entirely or they toned it down to where its really good I honestly can't tell.\n\nNow, the bad things about this game. The frame rate. In the demo, it was smooth as butter. Here, there can be MASSIVE drops. Near the end I went from 60 to a good 23 fps. Another thing is where are they going to go with the story? Mostly the things from the demo that made you curious on what those are have already dealth with.  Some things are left out but I'm still confused on where the story will go, that's just me. Probably just try to escape and help Piotr. The final one is  level design especially on the roof tops and the ending bits. They can be a little confusing but I had no problem. I haven't had any bugs yet so I can't comment on that.\n\nAll in all, I am happy that this game is good. After waiting a year and it living up to what you expect it to be is, in my opinion, on of the greatest feelings in the world. This game is great but with a few problems, so I would rate this game a 7.5-8/10 depending if they fix the problems in future episodes.","September 20, 2015","true","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There wasn't really an explanation, just 'Here's a random guy who is now driving a car, sees a ghost in the road and drives to the other lane, aaaanndd dead.'  Introductions are arguably the most important aspect when jumping into a game like this.  You really need to know what the story/backgound is to understand the game.  It'd be nice had there been a bit more explanation.\n\nFor whatever reason alt-tabbing is not a thing.  When I tried, the game acted like I had alt-tabbed, as the music stopped, but the game remained on my screen, and I couldn't click within it.  It appears that when you try and alt-tab,  you do technically alt-tab out of the game, but the game fails to minimize.  Alt-tabbing is something everyone does on all games, so it baffles me why developers make it so that the game has to stay on your screen the entire time it's open.\n\nThe game sounds were really well put together.  I'm normally not a huge fan of music in games, whether it be eery music or actual songs, but in AL it's actually very enjoyable to listen to.  You also seem to always be on edge due to the sounds, which fits this game perfectly.\n\nIndie horror games usually aren't as good as you'd hope.  They'd either lack actual fright, or the story would just be terribly done.  AL has done horror right.  As I previously said, when you walk around in game you're on edge, and you're wondering what is coming.\n\nThere is controller support, which I found it better to use a controller.  You can still play it perfectly well with keyboard and mouse, but if you have a controller, I advise using it.  It was just easier for me.\n\n\nPositives:\n\nCan be played in VR.\n\nController support.\n\nGood music/general game sounds.\n\nOne of the better horror games.\nNegatives:\n\nCan't alt-tab.\n\nPoorly done intro.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators.","April 7","true","1.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It throws you into the world of the grotesque Grandchildren, a world of neon colours and moving houses, a world you must escape if you wish to avoid joining the Grandchildren's ranks.\n\nPros:\n\n- A lovely aesthetic. The game is not afraid to be daring in its use of colour and light, creating a setting straight out of a child's nightmare. The use of the term 'lovely' might be misleading, the game has its share of torture devices and monsters, but I imagine every player will want to stand still and admire their surroundings at least once during their playthrough.\n\n- A unique setting and story. Like several indie games, Albino Lullaby dripfeeds its story to you steadily throughout your time playing, both through the use of collectible notes but also through the environment itself. You'll be left with many questions by the time the credits roll but, if you're like me, you'll also have many theories and guesses as to what the answers might be. Albino Lullaby provides just enough story to keep the player interested, but keeps enough hidden that you'll be thinking about it for some time afterwards.\n\n- Excellent voice acting. The voices of the Grandchildren go a long way to making the game as enjoyable as it is. From panicked screaming over the tannoy to snide taunts, the Grandchildren's voice acting really makes their characters shine.\n\nCons\n- The occassional glitch. Albino Lullaby suffers from one or two glitches, from questionable physics to gamestopping dead ends. However Ape Law have been incredibly responsive to their community when these issues have been raised, and it seems unlikely that these glitches will be around for long.\n\n- Occassional optimisation issues. Particulary in busy scenes, Albino Lullaby will begin chugging. However this happens only occasionally (Two times, in this reviewer's experience) and can be fixed by dropping the graphics settings.\n\nMisc\n- Simple gameplay. The gameplay of Albino Lullaby is not necessarily the focus of the experience, that place instead taken by the story and setting. Any 'challenge' within the game comes from succesfully navigating safe paths through the levels, something done quite easily through trial and error. This allows the setting to really shine, but those seeking a challenge might wish to look elsewhere.\n- A horror without scares. This isn't a horror game in the same way F.E.A.R or Slender might be considered a horror game. It's the Lovecraft of horror, creating a sense of unease and dread rather than outright terror.\n\nAlbino Lullaby creates an excellent, horrific story, if you can piece it together, displayed through a masterful aesthetic. This is not a game for those looking for fast-paced thrills or action, but rather those looking for a game with a novel sense of surreal horror to lose themselves in.","October 29, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Relying almost exclusively on atmosphere and general creepyness to obtain scares, it delivers them beautifully. Starting in a cage, you must traverse a strange environment in hopes of finding a way to escape. You'll find notes scattered around, which gives some expostition of the game as well as the thoughts of the game's inhabitants. The 'Grandchildren' (as the inhabitants are called) also give interesting dialogue that'll provide some insight to their culture and social hierarchy.\n\nThe game focuses much more on exploration than anything. This, however, is not a hinderance; in fact, I would say that this improves the experience. The atmosphere is also amazing in this game. The objects and backgrounds have a sort of hand-drawn look about them. This seems very appropriate, and did nothing to lessen the immersion I had with the game.\n\nSeveral game mechanics, which are introduced at a very fair pace throughtout the game, help with your survival in this world. Various lamps are scattered throughout the world, which, when lit, provide temporary "Safe Zones". There is also a single iteam (that can be qualified as a weapon) that will become your primary means of survival.\n\nBesides the beautiful looks to the world, the sound within the game are absolutely amazing; for an Indie Game, it definitely has one of the most professional sounding audio (in fact, the sound is better in this game than some AAA titles). This really contributes to the ambience, and you will come to really appreciate just how well the audio system compliments the games visual style. The soundtrack is also extremely well done. As a personal note, I don't generally purchase soundtracks for games, but this one will definitely be added to my library!\n\nFor all the praise that has been given to the game, it does have its flaws. There was a certain part where my framerate would drop significantly. Although I won't give any sort of spoilers, this section did break immersion for me momentarily. However, the pacing did pick back up once I was able to get through that section. There also didn't seem to be any sort of guidance or sense of direction in certain segments. The most prominent was the beginning; I was simply wandering around, not for the sake of exploration, but simply because I had no direction on what I was suppose to be looking for.\n\nOverall, though, based on Episode 1, this game is very promising. With an interesting take on the horror genre, an amazing soundtrack and audio system, and a unique presentation style, this game has quickly become one of my favorites. I highly recommend watching the progress of this game, and am eagerly awaiting Episode 2!\n\n\n8/10 (easily a 9 once certain flaws are ironed out)\n+Amazing and unique art style.\n+Incredible atmosphere.\n+Fantastic music and sound.\n+Incredibly creepy!\n\n-Performance hit at certain sections.\n-Sometimes, there isn't a clear direction for the player.","December 17, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, that does not mean it did not come with its share of annoyances.\nNOTE: This is not a full review. So, before you pull your panties up to your chin and blow steam in my face; This is simply me quickly noting how I feel about the game with the time I have played. Which, mind you, is not an awful lot. Despite that, I feel like a game's finest moments should be in the beginning and end. Of which the end I have not yet experienced.\n\nPros:\n1) Atmospheric: Semi-unique, unlike most lackluster 'horror' games out there. For some reason every single horror game developer seems to think that making the game as grim as America's future would suffice in creating atmosphere ... it is not. It's nice to see that there are still developers out there that are willing to stand out in a market dominated by mediocrity.\n2) Interesting Monsters (Grandchildren): They look and sound funny, yet eerie, which does suit the sinister tone that the game sets from the start. Too bad there's so b@stardly many of them, which removes the tension when coming across one.\n3) Performance: Who cares. Is alright. I can appreciate Style over Insane Graphics.\n4) Next to no jumpscares. The game was advertised as a horror game completely without jumpscares, which is unfortunately not entirely true. I suppose it depends on how you interpret the term 'jumpscare.' It is certainly nice to not have developers throw cheap jumpscare after jumpscare in your face, like we are used to with Until Dawn, Layers of Fear, Outlast, and all those other horrendous wannabe horror games.\n\nCons:\n1) Story sets off oddly vague. I'm not sure if there is supposed to be a story line here ... if so I completely missed it, despite reading pretty much every single one of the notes.\n2) Press a couple of buttons on walls, die, repeat. There's 'puzzles' which consist of you running around, pressing buttons on walls, whilst avoiding the absolutely butt♥♥♥♥fest around you. The Grandchildren spawn rate is a bit rediculous. It does not take long for them to swarm most of the map. Not to mention floors disappearing, leaving you falling into Oblivion and dying, and ceiling dropping on your head, killing you instantly. ''Try Harder Next Time.'' .... Try Polishing Your Game Next Time. It's just insulting.\n3) Missed opportunity after the beginning section. Instead of being the trippy, mind♥♥♥♥y horror game that it is advertised to be, you will mostly find yourself running around the map not knowing what you're doing or where you should be looking for objectives. The entire pace of the game is dimished VERY quickly, and not in a good way. I'm hoping this will improve towards the end.","April 5","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But with all that said, it still totally freaks me out! Like an old-style horror movie as you see your assailants slowly move toward you but know that you might be trapped in the next turn.\n\nAlbino Lulluby doesn't go for the hyper-realism that we've come to expect either which adds a lot of character to how the world is viewed and really adds to the enjoyment of exploring that environment.\n\nLastly, I absolutely love the drama of making the player uncrouch when you are seen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickMcSlabHouse/recommended/355860/","BrickMcSlabHouse","Viktor Vasko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickMcSlabHouse/","297 products in account","Albino Lullaby. A game with a well deserved horror tag, and a semi well placed pricetag all things considering. Now the game itself isn't particularly "Scary", It goes down the route of making you think. With that said looking at the game it has a genuinely good asthetic to it with the dreak and almost cel-shaded graphics paired with the low light in a large portion of the game. The games graphics also really cater to the design of the monsters/enemies trying to chase you down throughtout the game, as it lets them fit in with the rest of the world and gives a feel as though you could actual be in the characters position. Now even saying that the scenery and the monsters blend together to form a fine cream of a game with alot to think about after playing it means nothing with the overall scheme of things. The plot is generally slowly unravelled throughout the game with notes that pattern the scenery around you which can occasionally be easy to miss while running from the giant thumb monsters. And what story you do get is rather vague which adds to you having to think about what is actually going on but leaves major holes in the whole swing of things. But that's neither here nor there. The gameplay is what we want to know about. The gameplay is rather dull and leaves quite a bit to be desired to be honest but truly I can't say much since it's right along the lines of amnesia minus the one item that lets you throw these horrific faces for a spin stunning them temporarily. The gameplay focuses around stealthing past these things which honestly isn't too hard overall and then proceeding to hit buttons in no specific order and proceeding to hit another button in another location which opens something in order to progress this doesnt bring alot of variety into the game to be honest and it's required you do it 3-4 times alone in just these chapter. This game could honestly benefit from some decent puzzles. Moving on from that the combat is rather wonky and solely exists with one weapons the "Buck Clicker" which completely obstructs your view from anything withing a 180 degree radius in front of yourself leaving it to help the thumbs more than yourself. And it's really just annoying to deal with as soon as you fire it you must rush to another charger station to charge it since it's only a one use thing. And to aim you sort of just wiggle your mouse while the obstruction of view green bubble is in your way. So overall the combat is rather lame and wonky and really not needed or atleast it wouldn't be if the game didn't go the route of DS2 and equate numbers with difficulty. Now I will put that last sentence into perspective towards the end of this 1 chapter that is out currently you bump into Buck who was locked up for who knows what reason anyway the entire fight is based around a mechanic of luring him in and out of doors to lock him up so you can progress in the game. This is easier said than done with roughly 20-30 monstrous heads hot on your tail at just about any given time. Now really it only takes 3 in a clump to end your game damn near instantaniously so 20-30 is really just there to ♥♥♥♥ you off like it did with me. So you lead Buck through these doors and if you can somehow manage to avoid not only that mummified turd as well as his lackeys you are rewarded with the way out. Anyway I'm done speaking about the game. Should you buy it? Yes. To this games credit yes indeed it is wonky beyond recognition and does deserve a fair amount of harsh critic but it does not deserve to be burned at the stake as it was a complete breath of fresh air deviating from the norm of crappy jumpscares and slender clones that litter the market today. So yes absolutely you should buy it and check it out even if the ending for this chapter is rather lackluster and goes towards the absolute bull-♥♥♥♥ end of things it's worth checking out and getting something other than lackluster "horror" getting something you can ponder on is nice in todays overflowed crap market. So go ahead and buy the game as I said for 10 bucks you can't beat it, it's a one of a kind experience. And what else are you gonna use that money on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ twin stick shooter that's still in beta? I'd give this game a 7.5/10 nearing an 8 but not worth it if only for it's wonkier bits. If you would like to see some gameplay here is a link, The gameplay is rather long since I did it on stream and didn't cut it so feel free to skip around...\nhttps://youtu.be/WaGWHfPbIUM\nQUICK ADDITION: The ending is damn near unplayable and completely broken with tons of clipping issues and a huge framerate drop. On top of the framerate they expect you to deal with enemies at like a blazing 2 FPS and also once you pick up the key once they you need to complete the game if you die you seemingly can't get it again which is absolute bullocks. New score 7/10 make the game ♥♥♥♥ing completable please...","September 16, 2015","true","3.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","3"

You could finish a game like this very fast if you ignored everything around yourself and just moved from objective to objective, but that is basically the least important aspect of the game. My point is, it gets the -experience- part of the game very right.\n\nAlbino Lullaby (ep 1) mixes the scariness of walking around a weird old empty house with scary-funny bits of writing and talking.

Loved the environment and the atmosphere. And then...the Grandchildren...dear god. They may be creepy, or even humorous looking, BUT if you collected all the notes up until that point and connect a few dots, they suddenly become terrifying.\n\nI bought my copy specifically to conduct a stream on it. The reaction of my audience was positive. The general consensus was it had a great level of creepiness. Not focusing on jump-scares and instead allowing for tension to build as you sneak about put me on edge. Hearing them talk to each other in their horrid, warbling voices run a shudder through me (although this was sometimes made hilarious when one would randomly shriek in falsetto as he lectured others). If they spot you, the jump from their exclamation  is better than any other jump scare.\n\nThis is a first impression, will be playing more in the days to come.

Which is sad, because most horror games consists of puzzles. This game managed to scare me, but not as much that I would stop playing to take a break. Which isn't a bad thing, because I like to continue on with the game instead of consistently being jumpscared and confuzed. Surprisingly it is not that difficult to solve the problems, after you find out that almost all of them consists of buttons and it is really incredible to how they manage to scare me mulitple times without the use of jumpscares. This is defintely an extremely well-made horror game, which I would be proud to recommend.\n\nButtttttt-- There are some bad sides to this game, which I will just shorten.\n-What the heck is even going on in the beginning of the game? Story... needs improving.\n-The Grandchildren respawn wayy too quickly, which is difficult as the only weapon (to my knowledge/secret weapons?) present in the game, is only a one-time use which needs constant recharging, and the blue lamps don't appear everywhere, so that complex things.\n-Grandchildren are able to capture me when underneath me? I don't know if this is intentional, but they shouldn't be allowed to capture me, if they can't touch me.\n\nThis is all I have to say about this game, but I truly recommend it as I plan to purchase the next couple episodes as well.\n\n7/10 - Can turn into a fantastic horror game with some tweaks.","May 2","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Here's the good, bad, and VERY ugly.\n\nPros:\n+ The gameplay is nice, with very few bugs\n+ The sound quality is awesome, as well as the art style of the landscapes and characters. Very well polished.\n+ Although not being able to relate to the characters, trying to understand their mindset from a psychological perspective makes for a neat time.\n+ It's under $20. HOLD UP. I know it's the first chapter and the whole thing might end up costing more than $20 but at least you can try this and see if you like where they're headed!\n+ Narrative is to die for. Literally. Dying. Lots of it.\n\nCons:\n- With a few bugs as I played, sometimes my save game would spawn me back in with NO enemies around at all, stopping progress and forcing a reload. Not ideal, but nothing terrible.\n- "No jumpscares" is very tricky wording, considering you might cause yourself to have some with stupid things like thAT STUPID CHAIR IN THE LIVING ROOM.\n- Another tricky word is "photosensitve seizure"...Oh wait. That's two. Regardless, be wary.\n\nAll in all, this is literally, in the first chapter, not only caught my attention to the fact that horror games don't need screaming or jumpscares to be scary, but also that this is a diamond in the rough. +1 to you, ApeLaw.\n\nSCORE: 9/10\n\n-Renpix","October 6, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything is random, nothing makes sense.\nAs far as atmosphere goes it's great, the game's visual style supports this trippy approach, I can definietly see someone hallucinating a world like this and be scared as hell, wanting to get out, but not being able to. So for that surreal experience, which is serious, but what we see makes it a weird mess. People who are hallucinating and see unordinary things may explain what they saw (thinking it's reality) and we would find it dumb or funny. This game is exactly like that, the "grandchildren" aren't scary, but I'm sure that all of us would feel at least uneasy if you saw these trying to gang you up. And the game is exactly like that, an intoxicated state which got unpleasant, but it's too late to go back, you've gotta face it.\nI hope the game is aware of what it is and won't act like we're supposed to take everything super seriously, this game won't work that way.\n\nHowever, there are some technical issues with the game. The FPS is waaaay too jumpy, I've got values ranging from 1 to 100, but it's never stable, even though I'm well beyong the recommended specs. Also, the physics engine behind is horrendous, with a lot of glitches. The occasional camera very annoying too.\n\nI still recommend this though, the game's atmosphere is unique and I'm stoked to see what they can bring in the next episode.","February 27","true","2.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You wake up in this very distorted world where you have no memory of anything and you just sorta walk along. There isn't much of a story, the game just makes you walk around from area to area doing miscellanious tasks. There are also notes you find around the place which don't really add much, they are pretty pointless. I won't spoil the "story" of it but there are a lot of lose ends and a lot of questions unanswered. The story feels quiet boring and honesly I couldn't really understand it.\n\nArtstyle:\nThe game has a very nice Don't Strave like drawn artstyle. It's very dark and appealing. It goes well with what the game is trying to deliver but I also found a lot of overlapping textures and missing textures. Also I found that some areas were way too dark. I had a hard time appreciating the artworks around the game because half the time I was squinting to see where I was trying to go.\n\nGameplay and "Combat":\nThe gameplay in the game is rather boring, you run around pressing buttons and just doing chores to progress while avoiding the hilariously pathetic "Grandchildren" that chase you around. They are suppose to pose a threat but all they really do is just run up to you and then your screen fades to black and you restart. Also the game dosen't really tell you anything, for most of the game I just ran around not sure what I was suppose to do until I realised I just needed to find more buttons to push and progress. I didn't really see any horror in the game, it was a bit spooky at the start but after that it just sort of became silly and not very fun to play. All the "combat" there is, is just  A little remote with that you can charge from panels you find through the game, with the charge you can push away the Grandchildren and make them faint for a few seconds.\n\nAudio:\nThe audio in the game is alright, the soundtrack works well with the game but it didn't really stand out. My friend and I also noticed that there were also a few misplaced audio queues. For example, jumping on a bed made the noise of jumping on a wooden floor.\n\nThe World/ Map:\nThe whole map of the game consists of small areas split up into sections. The map is sort of in this factory area where there are a lot of gears all around and things moving all over the place which I found was actually quiet nice. I liked most of the map layouts, even though like I said in the gameplay, most of the time I spent running around not knowing what the the world I'm looking for.\n\nPerformance:\nGame ran at around 30 FPS at the highests settings and at around 40-60 on medium. When things got a little tense the framrate did drop and throughout the enitre finale of the episode I couldn't get above 15 FPS no matter what I did.\n\nAdded Notes:\n- The game has next to no save points, so if you slightly mess up somewhere on a large multistage area have fun replaying 20 minutes of the same thing you just did.\n- I finished the game in around 4-5 hours after having to replay the final part a few times because it was a long multistage event with no checkpoints in between. So the game is around 3-4 hours long depending on how many times you mess up.\n-It's not a horror game, it's a lot more of a walking simulator with very very light stealth.\n\nOverall I rate Albino Lullaby: Episode 1 a   3/10.   Stay away, bad game.\nRecommended Purchase Price:  $2 or less.\n\nReview key provided by developer and does not change my opinion about the game in any way.","September 15, 2015","false","7.7"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

What I experienced was a buggy mess with gameplay that barely functioned correctly and a horror element that wasn't scary.\n\nBefore I go into what made me hate the game so much I will briefly talk about the few thing I did like about the game. The first of them is the graphics style. I love the cartoony style that the characters and world are animated in. It's simple but very effective. The world is full of colour.\n\nAdded into this is just purely the setting of the world. The basics of the setting is a mechanical household world with rooms that can move about by the press of buttons. Parts of the world seem to be a kind of mad house setting. The outdoors sections of the world are beautiful colourful settings. The world is set upon a seemingly endless pit. The setting of the world really got my attention.\n\nI was also rather fond of the story. Fitting into this uniquely designed world is also a very unique story. It seems to be that there is a cult following from grandchildren to what they call the grandmother. You find out some very creepy facts around the world. The majority of the story is told through notes found around the world. Unfortunately the story has a cliffhanger ending at the moment due to it being episodic though.\n\nUnfortunately this is about as far as my good experiences went for the game. I guess I'll probably start with explaining what I didn't like about the horror, since thats probably why your looking at this game in the first place. The game seems to pride itself on not using jump scares. This means they have limited options on how to carry out horror. They needed to create a horrifying atmosphere instead. Unfortunately they didn't do this. There only attempt at horror was the enemies (called the grandchildren). They're creepy for about the first minute you see them and then they just get to be neusance. The way they focus on the horror in these enemies are through the voices. They have a kind of creepy tone to them. This creeped me out when I first saw them and then just got annoying.\n\nWhich brings me nicely into my next point. The voice acting. I mean it's kind of a mixed bag. I enjoyed the enemies voices at first. There voices were usually in a kinda high pitched old man kinda tone. But this gets old quickly and very annoying. And then you realize the voice acting isn't actually good at all. The other issue with this is that the enemies repeat the same quotes multiple times. There isn't enough variety in what they say to last through the game.\n\nThe biggest issue I had throughout play was a game breaking bug. Through fault of the game I had managed to go backwards an objective through a door opening when it shouldn't have. This made me had to complete this section again. However I couldn't. When I got to a door that I had went through before when completing the objective it was seemingly blocked by a rock. This meant there was no way for me to continue to progress. It meant I had to completely restart the entire game from the beginning again. I was about 1.5 hours into the game so I wasn't particularly happy about this. I attempted to speed run the game again to the point I was up to which took me about an extra half hour of gameplay still. I reached out to the developer about this issue and they are looking into it. Whats worse is it isn't the only game breaking bug out there. A friend of mine also experienced one that had an inmovable enemy blocking his way.\n\nAnother buggy part of the game is the way stealth mechanics work. To be honest they don't really work at all. Sometimes enemies seem to spot you when your nowhere near in sight to them and other times they don't spot you when your right in front of them. This means you have to be extra careful to try and make sure the game doesn't mess it up for you. But whats even worse is when you do get spotted. There is seemingly no way to escape them. Hiding out for a while doesn't make them loose attention for you. Every enemy in the world seems to locked to pathing towards you whether they have any kind of vision on you or not. Stealth missions really aren't fun to do because of this.\n\nThen combat isn't much better either. Later in the game you get this device called the clicker. When you use it it creates a green orb in front of you. All enemies in this orb at the time get knocked out for a while. The problem with this is that the orb makes is so you can't see were your going. It is exceedingly bright and large so much so it covers basically all of your visiblity.\n\nTalking about visibility you don't really have much of that throughout the world either. The game is way too dark in a lot of areas. It's so dark that at various points throughout the game I found myself having to guess where I could actually go. So therefore a lot of the time I also found myself walking off of the world accidently. The settings has no option for brightness so I couldn't fix this. The only option there is was for the detail of the shadows which seemed to make no difference.\n\nPerformance is also terrible on Albino Lullaby. I have a system that should easily be capable of playing through this game at a constant 60fps. However I barely managed to get 40fps throughout most of the game and had frequent framerate drops to unplayable levels. At one point in the game it dropped to an abismal 5fps and stayed like that. I had to change all my settings to the lowest and still only got about 20fps. It is unacceptable to have a game this poorly optimized!\n\nAnother small complaint is with the notes. When I am being chased by enemies I don't want to be having to read notes. If I do have to then I would like the game to pause for me to read it. I found myself having to rush my reading so I don't get killed by an enemy while doing it.\n\nOn top of all this issues I had other smaller bugs with clipping, getting stuck in the world, jumpiness in elevators and bad parkour mechanics. I also completed the game in probably about between 2-3 hours so it's not long of a length.\n\nAt the state this game is in at the moment I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. The developers really need to try and fix a lot of these issues and make the game just overall more fun in general. I really think the game has a lot of potential with the setting and story drawing it forward but it's not living up to it. It may be worth picking up in a few months time after a load of patches but for now I don't think it is.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided a free early review key by the developer to make this review.","September 15, 2015","false","5.6"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","17","32","2","0"

This provides not only a surreal level of creepiness, but also gives you the sense that you are in a place that is far beyond the reach of logic and sanity, a sort of, Subterranean city filled with bizarre inhabitants who all share a near-incomprehensible manner of distorted thinking.\n\nThe atmosphere is incredibly eerie, the music is great, the art style reminds me a bit of The Walkind Dead by telltale, and, again the framerate was great for my measly laptop, with the exception of the area near the end, in which you are bouncing from green bubble to green bubble; at that point, the framerate promptly defecated the sheets of the sleeping chambers, or, as the average layman would say, "it ♥♥♥♥ the bed."\n\nI recommend this game to all fans of horror, and to people who enjoy surreal environments and dialogue.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shimaaji/recommended/355860/","shimaaji","Urisk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shimaaji/","1792 products in account","Okay, this review has previously been negative and I'll have to change that now. There was a small collection of reasons that made me believe that Albino Lullaby on Steam doesn't actually have proper Oculus Rift support but instead hooks up to Steam VR. (Which, for games that do it this way, somewhat works but usually leads to a suboptimal performance / experience.)\n\nWhen launching the game the following happens:\n\n- When starting Albion Lullaby you have to pick the option to launch it in Steam VR. (otherwise it will be pure 2D)\n- At first Steam VR starts, but when launching the game in VR afterwards (and this is what I didn't notice) Steam VR isn't actually used, but Albino Lullaby hooks up to the Oculus Rift runtime directly. (version 1.3 at the time of this review)\n\nThis behaviour combined with the fact that the runtime 1.3 version of this game wasn't available at the time of the launch on Steam (but on the Oculus Home Store) led me to believe that 'proper' Rift support was only available in the version of the Oculus Home Store, which made me quite angry. ;)\n\nAlso note the following before reading my review:\nI have a bit of offline playtime, but I haven't finished the game yet.\nI'm playing on the Oculus Rift DK2 using runtime 1.3.\n\n------\n\nNow that this is out of the way I can get back to the game:\n\nThe game is actually really nice. The environments are extremely surreal and the atmosphere is built up quite effectively. IMHO this is one of the horror games owners of VR headsets really should get! One specialty of Albino Lullaby is, that it doesn't rely on jumpscares. Others have stated that the game is 'not scary', but I suppose that depends on how one defines the term 'scary' ... depending on what one considers to be scary the statement might be true, but then again: Scaring someone, at least in my opinion, isn't really the objective of this game for the most part. It does build what I'd call a cocktail of certain other feelings like "anxiety", "uncertainty", etc.. and it is very effective at that.\n\nConsidering how much more effective jumpscares are in VR one might think it's strange why the developer would just refrain from using them in a Horror game, but consider this: Jumpscares in VR are in fact 'that much more' effective than on a conventional monitor that the circle of people who can actually bear playing Horror games with jumpscares becomes even smaller. Albino Lullaby thus opens up the genre of horror games to VR users who like the genre, but actually think that jumpscares are too much for them. (And I can't blame them. ;) )\n\nIf I were to mention one caveat it would be, that the movement patterns in Albiono Lullaby are somewhat close to what one would have in a not-extremely-fast shooter. The developer did implement movement in the way that 'forward' moves one into the direction the player is looking towards. As a consequence looking sideways while pressing forward does not lead to a (less comfortable) strafing motion, though strafing is possible if one so desires. I'll have to show this game to a few people (and I certainly will!) as soon as I get the chance, but I at least 'assume', that Albiono Lullaby is not one of the most gentle games for people who are prone to suffering simulator sickness. (Since I've been using VR for almost 18 months now I can't tell myself, being quite used to it already.)\n\nOther first person games without cockpits have implemented various comfort features which are not to be found here. (Many have 'comfort turning', which is just a non-fluid kind of turning. At least one very popular first person VR platformer offers something called a 'comfort cage', which gives the player a non-obtrusive static element that works surprisingly well.)\n\nAs mentioned before: I still recommend this game to everyone having a VR headset. Especially since, as I've said, it is one of the VERY few VR horror games not relying on cheap jumpscares, but on atmosphere instead ... and it is so damn good at it! HOWEVER: If you just now got your VR headset my recommendation is NOT to start with this game, since it's just to good to have the experience ruined by simulator sickness. Depending on the person in question the risk might not be particularly high, but it's 'probably' higher than with some other good VR titles out there. So don't get me wrong: I do NOT think it is uncomfortable in VR. It's just a game that does not protect you from certain mistakes one might make when just starting out.","April 10","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

I was hoping for some novel motion solution but no, the experience is using a standard first person controller which you control either by a mouse or controller. The constant turning eventually made me feel quite sick and I just had to put the experience down.\n\nOther aspects of the game have simply NOT been thought through for VR; you constantly pick up obscurely written notes, but they appear so close to your eyes with the lense distortion on the Oculus/HTC at the peripheral of the lense you cant make out the first couple of sentences.\n\nVirtual Reality is all about depth & spatial perception. Which means flat textures that you can get away with in a standard FPS do not work in VR. Things like door handles were not modelled onto doors, but simply on the texture.\n\nIn conclusion although visually very rich and obviously with a lot of character this is NOT a VR game. At best its a first person puzzle game injected into VR.\n\nEasily feel sick? Stay clear!!","March 31","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The horror found in this game reaches much deeper than a scary face and "boogityboogityboo", it's the constant sense of mystery and intrigue when you read a note or stare at the world you're escaping from that really drives the terror home.\n\nIf you just want to be scared then Albino Lullaby is not for you, but if you want a bizzare story that keeps you engages with a hint of panic, Pick this game up immediately!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuJteN2h648&list=PL02MF-8t55wNPUE8GbxN_QbFi5BtR8Oc7&index=1\n","October 6, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The surreal element and excellent voice acting may make this enjoyable for those that enjoy a bizarre walking simulator through.\n\nAlbino Lullaby proclaims itself to be an adventure horror game with no jump scares or gore.  You are transported by who knows what means to a surreal world that you are attempting to escape from while avoiding bizarre monsters. The game offers little notes to explain more fully about your surroundings and answer some questions, but the combination of the notes end up not really explaining too much, and the save points being so far spread out gives the player little incentive to seek out and find them all. The story overall is confusing, and the atmosphere of the game can best be described as the product of a carnival haunted house, and the Rocky Horror Picture show. It doesn't make all that much sense, just attempt to navigate the odd environment. The voice acting of the monsters is very well done, and adds an interesting element of intrigue to the game.\n\nThe scale and detail of the levels really shows that a lot of creativity, effort and love has gone into it. It is unique in it's design, where even when you have to go back to previously explored areas,those areas have changed just enough to make it seem like an all new experience.\n\nThe game relies on stealth to maintain a sense of horror, and the players ability to remain excited and engaged in avoiding getting caught by monsters. In this aspect, I feel the game falls short. The monsters, while at the start of the game may be spooky and frightening, do not change as you play the game, and do not carry the weight needed to keep that sense of horror. Its more so becomes an intense game of tag, as when one monster notices you, all on that level do, and you spend your time trying to dodge them not hide.To make it worse, even if you are able to manipulate the environment to kill them, they respawn, so you never feel as if you have cleared an area completely. In a stealth game, one relies on sneaking in shadows to avoid being seen, but the lighting is such that even if you think you are in complete darkness, in a pitch black corner, the monsters can still see you.  Then you end up just trying to run through the level, as once you are seen, as I have said, you are seen by all. No light gem or floor sounds that differ on the types of floors you walk on makes you always unsure if the monster will or will not see you.\n\nI would describe this game more as spooky than horror. The game does feel a bit drawn out because of the distance between checkpoints, meaning if you fail its a long way to back track. I didn't feel drawn to the character, or particularly motivated to do what the game wants me to. There may be answers in further episodes to the slew of unanswered ones here, but as it stands right now, I didn't feel a sense of intrigue or desire to know what happens.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\n\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","November 21, 2015","false","3.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It had potential, but it was so clumsily done that it fell flat on its face. There are a plethora of bugs, clipping issues and framerate issues, mediocre art and level design, and it's so pretentious that I feel like I'm in a coffee shop full of hipsters.\n\nOf course, that's kind of my take on this game: a game for hipsters, by hipsters, more concerned with being accepted by the "in" crowd than constructing a game that even moderately resembles playability. The monsters are eye rollingly bad, the actual mechanics are both cheesy and poorly done, and the game engine chugs at the first sign of anything resembling a physics calculation.\n\nThat's not to say that the game is completely worthless. The voice acting, dialogue, and level design are all genius, but even those small boons don't even come close to making the game enjoyable.\n\nI'm not buying the sequels.","November 8, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Albino Lullaby is one of the funniest, yet surreal/creepiest games I have played in a long time. It's very unique, I can't pick a game to compare.\n\nThe game shows such an imaginative world that I can't help but speculate about it constantly. You get a real feel for the personality for the game.\n\nHOWEVER. I wish I hadn't purchased it just yet. The creator is constantly pushing back the release date for episode 2 that I fear it will never be realised.\n\nFirst we had a date of early February, this actually influenced my purchase. Then we were given a date around 15th of February, which was annoying but not too bad.\n\nNow the second episode with not be released until January 2017. This is unacceptable in my opinion, I can't even think of how long it will be until episode 3.\n\nThe shame is, the game shows such promise and it's the most refreshing thing I have played in a long, long time.\n\nIf you buy this game, you will be left waiting for a long, long time also.","March 26","false","3.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","2"

They didn't tag this game as 'surreal' for nothing. After all, the atmosphere and environments remind me of an illustrated fictional horror novel, in which deformed Moai heads chase after you relentlessly, rambilng a bunch of nonsense as they creep ever so slowly towards you.\n\nMy only real quarrel with this game is the optimization.

Gameplay: Indie-core Audio: Absolutely.  Story: Welcome home.\n\nThis is a game for someone who isn't looking for another AAA horror experience. This is a triple I kind of game, many of the devs ex-AAA themselves though. The game's designs and methods actually pay several homages to different devs, if you know what you're looking for. But priorities of the game are essentially indie: quality in music, story, art. Gameplay is not an after thought, and some creative things are done with it, but you might want to call this more of an adventure game before you call it a puzzle game or a survival game (though there are hints of those). The main activities you are doing often have to do with keeping any sort of coherency. It is a weird and confusing and fun and creepy experience.\n\nPlay this game if you like story first games. If you want to be creeped out and if you're willing to invest in a deep scare. Episode one ends on a high note where things promise to go from somewhat scary to deeply disturbing. It's an honest and impressive show for a small indie's first release. It comes with some bugs and so forth, but with the boost of sales a successful release (here's hoping), the sequels promise to be even better than what the first episode delivers, as they'll have the capitol to insure even greater production quality. It's an exciting and creepy little seed, which I expect will grow into a beautiful monstrosity in the near future.","September 27, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only played Episode 1, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!\nIt's true, there are NO jump scares and no gore. It's just environmentally... eerie and weird. Like being in a weird dream with these weird guys following you. There are 'puzzles', but really it's almost more like a scavenger hunt trying to find buttons to push. I only found one instance where the hunt for buttons seemed like a puzzle, and that's near the end of Episode 1. Still, I enjoyed the ease of it. :)\n\nFinished Episode 1 in under 4 hours.\n\nControlling: Your standard first person view. Keyboard and mouse. Not many buttons needed to play the game.\n\nBugs: None that I experienced! So far so good :)\n\nMotion sickness: I experienced a little bit of queasiness, but I didn't mess around witht he POV (there is an option in the menu!). I think it was just because of the tight corridors and trying to rush around in a hurry trying to avoid the creatures.\n\nWould I recommend? If you were a fan of the Alice games, then definitely!
