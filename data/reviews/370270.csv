The other ports added some additional features and Health Points, which wasn't featured on the Original Amiga version. You should also check Chris Huelsbeck's soundtracks as he is one of Amiga's legendary composer.","October 3, 2015","true","6.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/recommended/370270/","pxabstraction","Parallax Abstraction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/","985 products in account","I also covered this game on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL-keuI9nso\n\nThis is an old-school platformer mash-up title that many probably haven't heard of. It was more popular in Europe but not so much in North America. It blends together side-scrolling action, top-down action and shoot em' up levels into the same game, something very different and ambitious for the time. None of these are shining examples of their respective genres but they're all competently done. There's a lot of content here compared to many 90s era platformers, especially PC platformers. This game is rock hard though and only suited for those who enjoy a significant challenge and/or want to practice a lot to iterate their progress.\n\nUnfortunately, this collection is a technical mess and isn't even worth $5 in the state Piko Interactive shipped it in, especially since as of this writing, they seemed to have stopped supporting or talking about it. It includes the MS-DOS and SNES versions of this game, as well as an "enhanced" SNES version, which is essentially a ROM hack that adds more life points and removes the double parallax scrolling which is hard on the eyes. Unreleased Genesis and NES versions were promised to be added as free DLC but these are nowhere to be seen and status is unknown.\n\nThe MS-DOS version uses the DOSBox emulator and is improperly configured when first installed from Steam. In order to get the digitised sound effects, you have to manually edit the DOSBox configuration file (instructions are in the Steam forums.) It also runs at a very inconsistent frame rate with awful screen tearing, even on my overclocked Core i7 machine. Other DOSBox games which are properly configured run like butter on this machine. This has never been fixed. You're charging money to provide the optimal way to play this game. If your users have to fix it for you, you shouldn't be charging for it.\n\nThe SNES versions use a re-badged implementation of what looks like the Snes9x emulator and while it runs at a much better frame rate and with better sound, it doesn't have proper XInput support. Trying to use an Xbox One controller results in the game thinking that B is being constantly pressed and even after rebinding the controls manually, I couldn't fix it. Playing with an old Xbox 360 controller worked fine and the DOS version of the game works fine with an Xbox One controller. Unacceptable in a 2015 release.\n\nI would have refunded this game if I hadn't had it in my collection for months before I finally got around to playing it. Jim Power is an interesting historical series that platformer fans will like but in this state, with the lacking promised content and near silence from Piko Interactive for the last several months, you should not buy this package. If they ever get around to fixing it, optimising it and adding in the promised missing content, maybe then but not before. This is the last thing I'll be buying from this company.","February 29","false","1.3"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","0"

You get the DOS, SNES original and a SNES enhanced version.  Essentially the enhanced version just uses filters to give it a more HD look and the SNES Original is a less defined version that you remember playing on the SNES.\n\nThere is a minor issue that is fixed by manually changing the graphics settings to higher performance as well as turning on V-Sync which will fix the problems with screen tearing.  Okay so how about the game play well it features two different genre's in one game.  You get  action sidescrolling platforming and a side scrolling shmup which is much like your favorite arcade counterparts.\n\nThe great part of this is that the game has an amazing difficulty setting but the DOS version and SNES are different.  The DOS version is a lot slower which makes it a lot easier and the SNES version is a lot faster and is a lot more difficult.  But hey both games are still quite difficult its just I find the DOS version a lot more easy to handle.\n\nThe music in the game is outstanding and if you know Chris Huelsback you'll know he has done music for a lot of classics which include Turricane, The Great Giana Sisters and he is now producing new music for newer games like The Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams and more so check him out.  I usually don't know how to review sound effects but hey they sound great for the 16bit genre of gaming with all the classic slashing sounds and explosion sounds you remember.\n\nI haven't fully completed the game and its one of those games your going to have a very hard time completing but hopefully the DOS version will make things a lot more easier for you.  Its still a very fun game and something you should have in your collection if your a fan of retro gaming.\n\nCheck out https://www.pikointeractive.com/ for more information on some new and amazing classic games.","October 30, 2015","true","3.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It screams "I want to be a japanese console game so bad" but has all the weaknesses of typical homecomputer games of the late 80ies and early 90ies. Everything is wrong with this game and unnecessarily so.\n\nThink of a very linear, very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Turrican (with a bit of Gods and other clunky, western character-action games added to the mix) and you are on the right track what Jim Power actually feels like. Now imagine a presentation with the worst parallax scrolling and acid-trip like colors while Chris Hülsbeck music is blasting from your speakers, only interrupted by bleeps and bloops from the weird guns you are firing. That, and a good amount of ripping ideas for sprites, backgrounds and mechanics from other games - among them R-Type, Gradius, Ghouls'n'Ghosts and Contra.\n\nLoriciel tried to mix it up with shmup-sequences and top-down maze-action that were supposed to complement the run'n'gun action. But each of these segments is as horribly broken as the sidescrolling bits and demanding insane precision while navigating pixel perfectly through hitbox-hell, unfair death traps and awful attack patterns.\n\nAnd they released this pile of crap on a ton of different systems - though, for the time being you are only getting the PC and the SNES version here on Steam. The SNES version (which I unfortunately happen to own physically) manages to be even LESS playable and MORE ♥♥♥♥ than the MS-DOS game. Funny enough, the MS DOS version is the one Jim Power game that is almost playable and just so bad it is still kinda entertaining.\n\nNo one in their right mind should buy this for playing a good old game (I don't even get why this was released) - so, why am I giving it a thumbs up? Because this one of the greatest ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games - a piece of history and a timeless lesson in how to NOT make a character action game. You can learn so much from this prime example of bad design that is so complete in its craptasticness. And besides, how many old games do you know that can make you physically sick just by using all the colours possible on as much parallax layers the powerhouses of the past could render? Jim Power manages to be the only 2D game ever to make me feel motion sick, which in itself is an incredible feat.\n\n~ REMEMBER THE FALLEN AND NEVER LET A GAME LIKE JIM POWER HAPPEN AGAIN ~","October 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","55","11","20","8","1"

I mean, not even the original Amstrad CPC version, or the popular Amiga version was included.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a fairly enjoyable, if frustratingly hardcore platformer, which is saved from the pit of mediocrity by the fantastic soundtrack by the legendary Chris Hulsbeck.\n\nI can't really recommend it for £4 as it stands, but if it ever drops into a sale, or if the "developers" release other versions as free DLC at some point down the road, then sure, pick it up.","October 3, 2015","false","12.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","0"

The recent trend of "pixel" art style games are because of titles like Jim Power- while super detailed, the graphics are still able to hold up due to trends in gaming today.  What is even cooler is, right now, you get three games with one purchase in this deal.\n\nPC version- original title, full of challenge.\nSNES version- port of the PC title.\nSNES Enhanced version- Piko made some adjustments to the SNES original, reworked a few things and added little stuff here and there.  All around, this is the version to play.\n\nDoesn't matter which version you play though, if you want a quality challenge then play Jim Power.","October 31, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That said, the game is still more suited for a long, exacting and gruesome game design autopsy rather than any actual jump-and-shoot 16-bit fun; but that's at least a possibility now. Don't even bother with the SNES original unless you have a nearby toilet or sink to vomit into.\n\nOnce you've had your fill of laughing at all the hilariously emasculating ways ol' Jim bites it on just the first stage (death by water droplet, death by moist dog nose, etc.) in that, you can safely move on to the DOS version, which is not only graphically superior, it's infinitely closer to a polished and playable game. It's still quirky, odd and a bit off-kilter; but there's less annoying obstacles in the way of your potential platforming fun.\n\nI also really have to commend Piko just for offering multiple ports of JP - it shouldn't be lost on younger generations that the same game was often wildly different on varying home computers and consoles. Thanks for giving customers some bang for their buck in a retro re-release! :)","April 2","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
