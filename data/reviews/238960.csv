"http://steamcommunity.com/id/folm/recommended/238960/","folm","ƒḺö♏","http://steamcommunity.com/id/folm/","355 products in account","I've been playing Path of Exile since 2011 closed beta and it's remarkable how far the game has come purely from crowd funding.  The passion of the userbase is equally matched by it's developers.  They've shown throughout the years to constantly improve and tweak the game with regularly scheduled content additions.  I still feel I don't know everything there is to know about this game, and that isn't changing any time soon.  Path of Exile is an incredibly complex and rewarding game that is definitely worth your time.\n\nOutside of having an absurdly intricate skill tree and a fantastic crafting/currency system,  the other large appeal of this game is the end-game.  Most ARPGs fail to offer incentive to continue to play your character after you've exhausted the content.  Usually this just comes in the form of a easily attainable level cap or grinding the same final zone of the game at length.  Instead, in POE you are given item drop instances, as described by the developers:\n\n"Maps can drop as normal, magic, rare or unique with higher rarity Maps yielding more items. Using a Map item opens six portals to the area, which can each only be used once. Like most other items in Path of Exile, Maps have mods that change their risks and rewards. Map mods can affect the size or complexity of the level, monster packs, monster properties or even alter characters while in the level. Players can modify Maps themselves using their currency items. For example, you can use an Orb of Transmutation to turn a normal Map into a magic Map, or use an Orb of Alteration to reroll its mods."\n\nIt goes to say that each and every map is a different experience, with room for countless variation in modifiers letting you push the limits of your character.  Not all characters are equal.  You will find that some characters that excell in early progression have difficulty in the end-game and visa versa.  Each character I've made has informed the next which is critical in a game that rewards experience and skill.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, POE offers alternative ARPG experiences in the form of daily race events which are time based leveling with unique modifiers that you won't see in the real game like 'Turbo Mode'.  Moreover some of these races have entirely unique content like Descent: Champions or Endless Ledge which offer players the ability to win special art reskins of legendary items for the leagues of their choice.\n\nAll in all POE is a truly exciting game and a breath of fresh air for the genre.","October 25, 2013","true","570.7"," 2,573 of 2,739 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","573","2","3","18"

If you start playing it, you will keep coming back for more all the time. Before I started playing Path of Exile, my attitude towards Hack'n'Slash genre was... let's say bad. This is my first game of such genre and I am completly satisfied.\n\nNow let's go straight to good and bad points of PoE.\n\n-PROS:\n+ truly Free To Play model, there is no such thing as Pay To Win, there are microtransactions that are all about purchasing visual effects for your character and his abilities (you can also purchase more tabs in stash, but that does not impact the game),\n+ developers actually care about the game, listen to their community and keep fixing bugs, creating new content or reworking old visual effects (I have been watching development of PoE since open beta and it constantly changes until this day, successfully becoming better),\n+ the desynchronisation issue has been fixed with the introduction of the update 2.0.0 - this was one of the biggest flaws of this game, it is gone now! Hurray!\n+ new leagues and events are started on a regular basis,\n+ huge amount of passive skill points which gives you enormous combinations for character developement, every build is unique (unless you begin copying others' builds which kills the fun). There are so many possibilities that you are even able to turn an archer into a melee character!\n+ large variety of active skills - you want to sweep your axe? You want to cleave through enemies with your sword? Maybe you fancy raining arrows or using various kinds of magic? No problem, you can choose anything you want and upgrade your skills so they can consume less mana, become faster or fire more projectiles at once and that is not everything.\n+ many armors and weapons: one handed or two handed: axes, maces, swords also daggers, claws, bows, wands and staves, items also have different stats and 4 grades: normal, magic, rare and unique, same thing applies to monsters,\n+ crafting-currency trade system, it might come out to be hard to understand at first, but then you keep realising that everything has its value, there is no gold, just barter trade system. Crafting-currency items have one important function - they slow / prevent inflation which is a disadvantage of gold based systems,\n+ this game has challenging end-game consisting of large variety of special maps that can be modified to become more rewarding and demanding at once, if you reach high level [80+] with decent items and statistics you will simply feel satisfied\n+ nice, vivid and helpful community,\n+ with the introduction of version 2.0.0 majority of in-game locations have been reworked, thanks to that some quests are now less time-consuming and do not get you bored!\n\n-CONS:*\n* - with the introduction of version 2.0.0 this game has become flawless in my opinion.\n\nI hope that I managed to describe this game generally, but I have to say one more thing: you will not be able to experience the game by reading others' reviews, just give it a try and you might fall in eternal love.","August 13, 2014","true","355.4"," 1,228 of 1,287 people (95%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","95","228","1","25","9"

I'm going to be writing a new one for the Ascendancy expansion soon.\n\nThis is probably one of the most in depth ARPGs I have ever played, and its free to play! The character customization in this game is absolutely crazy. The game may seem daunting at first with its unique currency system and absolutely huge skill tree but once you learn how these works you will get addicted to this game.\n\nNow lets look at the Pros and Cons. I will list them in a very detailed manner. TLDR version will be at the bottom for those of you that just a brief look because this is going to be a long one.\n\nPros:\n\n+This game is free to play. And when I say free to play I don't mean free to play and buy your way to the top. There is no way possible to buy any sort of advantage in-game. The only things you can buy are visual armor sets that can be applied to your in-game items, alternate skill visuals, pets that do not fight, more character slots (which you have about 24 slots to start with), and extra stash tabs (which again you start with plenty space).\n\n+Character Customization is amazing. There are 7 classes. Marauder, templar, witch, shadow, ranger, duelist, and scion(has to be unlocked by completing normal mode). All of these classes lean toward certain builds but if you wanted to play the strength heavy marauder as an int caster then that is very possible. The skill tree is huge and any class can go in any direction. It may seem daunting at first but once you learn your way around its fun to plan out the rest of your build or your next character.\n\n+Unique currency system. This is one of my favorite things about the game. In this game you don't have gold or anything like it. Instead you buy and sell things with orbs. There are many types of orbs with varying rarity. I won't go over all the orbs but I'll talk about a few as an example. For instance, the orb of chance can change a white common item into a magic, rare, or even unique item (the different rarities, think magic as uncommon, rare as well rare, and unique as legendary). Or say a chaos orb which can change the properties of a rare item. Orbs like these can be traded to npcs for items or upgrades in your hideout(I'll explain this later). Or players will buy and sell items using these orbs. So you can use these orbs as currency or to upgrade your own gear.\n\n+Leagues. This game has a couple permanent leagues as well as temporary leagues. The 2 perma leagues are standard and hardcore. Standard is pretty simple. There are 3 acts in 3 game modes at the time this review is written (I believe a 4th act is coming next year). In normal you suffer no penalty at death. In the next difficulty, which you access by beating all acts on normal, is a little more punishing. In  cruel if you die you lose 5% of your experience (don't worry you can't lose a level if you are at less than 5% exp for that level). In the last difficulty, merciless, you lose 10% experience for death. In the hardcore league if your character dies at all it is moved to standard league.\n\nEach league can only share a stash with characters in the same league. GGG also releases temporary leagues. The big highlight of this is their 3 month leagues. These are good for providing a fresh start and for people who enjoy tring to race to the top first can do so. It also lets players play in a fresh economy. When they release these 3 month leagues they release of them. One of them is a Standard league and the other hardcore.\n\nHowever, these aren't copy-paste modes. The 3 month leagues have something exta to them that the perma leagues don't have. For example, at the time of this review the torment(standard) and bloodline(hardcore) leagues are going on. In torment there are tormented souls that fly around making enemies stronger but they drop better loot. In bloodlines there are enemies who gain synergetic abilities that make them way stronger. And with these temp leagues they also have access to several new unique items that the perma leagues won't have access to until the temp leagues are over. If a character dies in bloodline they will be moved to standard league.\n\n+The developers care about this game. This one is pretty simple. They update the game a lot. There's always new things coming into this game. You can even spot GGG staff members from time to time talking to people in global chat. It is very obvious that they care about this game and its community.\n\n+Gems. Gems are what you will use for all of your skills. There are red (strength) gems, blue (int) gems, and green (dex) gems. You can get these gems by questing or by finding them as random drops. To use these gems you have to put them in the correct colored socket that your gear has. If your gear doesn't have enough sockets or the wrong color sockets then that's okay, you can manipulate this with the use of orbs. For example, the chromatic orb can change all the socket colors on a piece of gear and the jewelers orb can change th number of sockets on gear. Your gems also gain experience just as you do. The higher level the gem, the better. Gems have a max level of 20.\n\n+Endgame. Endgame begins once you are at the end of act 3 merciless. You can get maps that drop from enemies. These maps will generate a random level with random enemies. Thats not all they will gain extra effects or maybe you will gain extra effects or lose them! The harder the map the more rewarding it is. You can also use orbs on the maps! If you have a white quality map then you can use something like an orb of alchemy which will change its quality from common to rare making it a harder but more rewarding map.\n\nCONS\n\n-Desync. This biggest problem with this game is that it suffers from desynchronisation problems. This means you will sometimes randomly lag back a couple seconds which can sometimes kill you. If you keep this in mind most of the time you can play carefully and this won't really effect you much.\n\n-Starting out as a new player in this game can be rough at first. There is so much to learn and the game has a lot of depth to it. With all the skill gems, skill points, and currency orbs its hard to know what to do with everything. However there are ways to learn. The official poe website is a good place to learn more about the game. The class forums are a good place to go to see how people build their characters. People can even post the path they went on their skill tree and you can look at each node they took to help you gain an understanding at what it takes to make a decent character.\n\n-This game can also be a little bit boring getting to end game if leveling isn't really your thing. You have to complete all 3 acts on all 3 difficulties before you make it to end game. Doing all the same quests 3 times over per character may seem a bit boring at times.\n\nTLDR PROS\n\n+Free to play\n+great character customization\n+fun skill system\n+unique currency & trading system\n+developers care about this game and its community a lot\n+geat end game\n+frequent updates\n+fun league system\n\nTLDR CONS\n\n-game suffers from desync\n-game can be rough on beginners\n-leveling characters through each difficulty can get tedious.\n\nThank you for reading. I know this review was extremely long but I just wanted to make sure I put out as much info as I could think of for people who are interested in trying this game out. I hope this review has helped you.\n\nThis game is extremely fun and I def reccommend it to anyone who likes diabloish type games. Starting out may be rough because of everything you have to learn but it is worth it if you stick through.

Grinding Gear Games, an indie gaming company with their entirely free-to-play game, have created one of the most complex, in-depth and innovative ARPG in the gaming industry.\n\nBusiness ModelFirst of all, this game has one of the most fair and ethical business model you could ever see in the free-to-play market. Absolutely nothing you can get with real money gives you advantage over other players. This encourage players to support the game because they actually want to donate for the developing and its developers and not because they are forced to progress.\n\nAudiovisual artThe developers have stated that they "are sick of the recent trend towards bright, cartoony RPGs. The art style [they] chose for Path of Exile is dark, gritty and realistic". The graphics are beautifully detailed, the music is iconig and the voice acting is outstanding.\n\nGameplay & MechanicsThe customization and character progression in Path of Exile is complex and impressively in-depth, with a vast diversity in their mechanics.\n\nClasses\nEach one of the 7 classes starts at different location of a passive skill tree, composed by 1325 nodes, with non-linear progression (the tree is actually a web).\n\nItems & Gears\nSet items is a horrible decision for builds diversity, so this is not what you will find here. Of course there are Unique items, but having a full set of Uniques of the same theme/type does not grant you bonus mods. This is meant to be this way to avoid forcing players to play with sets, breaking their character building freedom.\n\nThe item drops: maps, divination cards, jewels, gear items (their category, rarity, mods, gem sockets and links), are randomly generated.\n\nJewels\nThere are socketable nodes in the Passive Skill Tree that makes possible to socket Jewels that grants bonus and special attributes to your skill tree. These jewels have rarity, mods and can be crafted too.\n\nSkills\nThe skill system made by gems makes possible that the characters are not limitative to a few skills, so the game does not dictate how the player is going to play. These gems have level and attribute requirements according to their color (Strength, red; Dexterity, green; Intelligence, blue), they can be leveled up, have quality % and can be corrupted for bonus mods.\n\nDivination Cards\nThis kind of items are collectibles that gives you a specific item once you have gather enough cards of a set. Each card is dropped in a specific areas of the map. This system allow players to systematically work their way to the acquisition of the items they want, without having to rely on an eternal grinding.\n\nMaps\nTheir structures and pack of monsters are randomly generated, and is the main focus of the end-game, since they can be crafted.\n\nCurrency & Crafting\nThere is no gold in Path of Exile, there are 25 currency items (orbs) that have crafting functionality. They can add/remove/re-roll the mods of the items, modify the sockets (number, colors and links) of the gear items, they can corrupt the items, change their rarity, etc. Basically people trade items for items they are going to use, and not for gold. This makes the trade highly in-depth and open.\n\nForsaken Masters\nThere are 6 Masters (NPCs). Each one of them can be leveled up to level 8 by doing daily missions, and they offer crafting bench and hideouts that can be decorated and customized as the player wish.\n\nThe variety of builds and the hideout customization is so open that the developers runs two series called Build of the Week and Hideout of the Week.\n\nDevelopers & SupportThe developers work along side with the community to improve the game and add new content. They do a great job balancing the game and deploying constant patches and updates. The support is surprisingly responsive and open to any kind of feedback.\n\nConclusionAll these elements makes the different ways a character may progress literally infinite, and the game always encourage to make new builds and try different mechanics. Some players likes to experiment with builds and other players likes to break the "rules" and metas to come with insane mechanics. The developers are, as explained, the most ethical and responsive gaming company you could find out there considering the success of their game. Reason to be disclosed: they are hardcore gamers creating a game after all, what would be better than that?","April 29, 2015","true","200.6"," 456 of 482 people (95%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","95","456","482","16","3"

The team at Grinding Gear Games actually care about the integrity of what they are producing and also have an incredibly fair buisness model, no pay to win here.\n\nIf you are looking for a new ARPG or even just something different to play then give it a shot. 100% free to play with only ethical microtransactions, there is no reason not to try it.\n\nAct 4 - The Awakening will take Path to even greater heights. Extended storyline, new areas, streamlining of the older content, new skills, new items and more QoL improvements than you can poke a "Lifesprig" at.\n\nIf you have wanted to try Path and keep putting it off, then now is the time!

You can buy extras, although guilds don't start with any stash space so all guild tabs require purchase.

Everything that went wrong with Diablo 1 that I can call out myself and Diablo 2 & 3 by others - as it's a constant comparison with the now ex-king of the genre - is made right in Path of Exile. It's even considered by some its rightful successor: what was expected from the latest Diablo title and just came out short. As Team Fortress 2 draws people from many likings into a first-person shooter, PoE has players who are not even that into RPG's, but there's something that lures them in: the lore, the scenery, the loot system... Something. Aside from the latency drawback, it's a game that has much to give to the hardcore players as to the casual ones.

That said, it's a game with many facets to explore that is certain to scratch some niche itches better than any other.\n\nIn essence, a character in PoE is a means to an end which is up to you to decide on.\n\nTypical characters can do any generic content alone with relative ease but within that spectrum there's a huge variety of character types tailored to each preference and if what you like doesn't exist yet, you can most certainly try your hand at creating it.\n\nWhat's this variety you speak of?\nTo name a few general archetypes amongst the quite literal thousands of possibilities:\n\n• Melee - with access to a large variety of weapon types (recently expanded upon in the 2.0 Awakening expansion with the exotic Maraketh weapons) and build enabling unique items with special properties. You can wield a shield and a weapon for what is traditionally the most defensive approach, take up dual wielding any two melee weapon types which provides less blocking chance than a shield but enables many interesting combos and 'stat-stick' strategies, and of course you can take the typical barbarian approach and wield a variety of two-handed weapons that allow you to stomp everything in your wake;\n\n• Spell Caster - there are droves of spells in PoE. There are your three classical elements in Fire, Cold and Lightning as well as Chaos and Physical spells thrown in for good measure. The latter have been greatly expanded upon in the recent 2.1 Talisman content update. Spell casters can, like melee characters, wield a shield, two weapons or a single two-handed weapon. But unlike the attack-based characters, spell-casters' damage is provided by their skill gems directly rather than the weapon, which only grants bonuses to the damage. There exist a variety of elemental statuses and styles of spell with different interactions; the main categories being AoE spells and Projectile spells, all with a unique twist or mechanic that more often than not results in different gameplay;\n\n• Archer - although archers will be the characters who most often play generically, they've been a solid bet during the game's history thanks to their clear speed and ease of play. As an archer you  have a choice between bows and quivers. Most attacks will use your bow to deal damage with the exceptions being Explosive Arrow and Caustic Arrow, which deal damage based on the skill gem (akin to spell casters, but restricted to a bow). There also exist wandslingers in PoE, which use their wands to directly damage enemies rather than through spells. Usually regarded as 'wanders', they are best known for being a hybrid between a bow user and a shield wielder, sacrifing damage for defense at range;\n\n• Summoner -  I'd venture to guess you don't think this warrants being distinguished, and they really are what you are likely picturing: a pet class. But in PoE the variety of combinations has spawned a plethora of different summoner types, generally coming down to builds specialising in either permanent minions or temporary minions to do your bidding, stacking auras or stacking survivability (with the strongest end-game builds acchieving both). To the inexperienced, a summoner may become synonymous with a necromancer in most other games, but in reality there is good reason for the nomenclature used - not all summons in PoE are necromantic. A good variety of them are animatronic. The game includes a variety of golems and two animatronic minions you can use directly that are solid components of builds (as well as some you can access indirectly through the Rampage mechanic).\n\nSecondly, there are characters that are fit for very specific purposes rather than generic content (maps) such as: boss farming (atziri/uber), "culling" (finishing off bosses with gear that augments loot dropped), and even pure supporting (Whispering Ice/Ice Shot/Aurabot and some brands of summoner). These can be built with wide variation and Uber builds are theorycrafted and discussed very often.\n\nThese are only examples. There's everything in-between. Spell casters can wield bows to gain projectile speed which results in incredible range, or for damage conversion. Every spell and bow ability can be turned into a mine that can be detonated at will or a trap that is triggered when stepped on. Wandslingers can forfeit damaging enemies directly and turn into a hybrid that shoots out spells triggered by attacks.\n\nYou can set yourself on fire and run into people. Seriously.\n\nThere are many ways to build your character defensively too, usually focusing on either life or shield for building an effective HP pool and regeneration, leech, armour, evasion or elemental resistances for mitigation of damage taken. Or a mixture of all of them to your liking.\n\nThe same equipment that provides defenses also provides the sockets for your skill gems that you gain from quests and drops or acquire from NPC vendors. This creates another layer of customization, since you can also socket modifiers called Support Gems that alter your skills' behaviour if their sockets are linked, and there are tens of these modifiers for you to create what is essentially your own custom skill with.\n\nThe Node Forest\nDid I mention the passive skill tree? There's a passive skill tree.\n\nIt has 1325 nodes.\n\nAlthough it may sound rather intimidating, it is only a web that connects all 7 classes and grants passive bonuses to your character. Traversing it is quite easy if your mind is honed for efficiency.\n\nIt's where a lot of the magic happens when you're new, and you will fall in love with it as your understanding develops.\n\nWhat now?\nIf you have a knack for collecting, grinding or engineering, my recommendation is for you specifically. Welcome to theorycrafting heaven, exile.\n\nPost Scriptum:\nThe original review consisted of the first line only.\n\nAnd now, over a hundred people have added me because of this review. I don't mind you adding me, but please do it if you have a question or need help, not if you might have a question or might need help in the future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/risingpun/recommended/238960/","risingpun","Osirus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/risingpun/","1454 products in account","The best isometric aRPG I've ever played... and it's free. That should be enough to get you to try the game; a character-limit in-depth review follows:\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nA top-down isometric action RPG. This genre has for many years been called "Diablo clones", and no doubt the game feels like Diablo -- questing, levelling up, finding gear, and using skills to kill stuff -- but the systems behind the gameplay are really well thought out, and especially the skill system is much deeper than any other aRPG.\n\nPath of Exile is completely, utterly free. And don't let this dissuade you from trying it, because I think it's the best isometric aRPG I've ever played. Microtransaction cash offers no competitive advantage in the game, just cosmetic enhancements, extra stash tabs, and character slots. So if the game sounds interesting, just try it for yourself! But meanwhile, here's why you should:\n\nSTORY\n\nOkay, let's be honest: This probably isn't a game you're playing for the story. Without the huge budget of a Blizzard Entertainment, you're not going to get 3-minute epic cutscenes that draw you in with movie quality. Grinding Gear Games seems to have focused on making the game good instead, and I support that decision. That being said, the underlying narrative isn't bad per se, just fairly standard and doesn't really distinguish itself.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are perfectly good for my purposes. They look decent, even if they didn't blow me away in the fully zoomed out mode. They actually look pretty good zoomed in, but of course when enemies can attack you from offscreen even fully zoomed out, nobody is going to play zoomed in. Regardless, the graphics made the game much more gritty. While Diablo went cartoonish, and Torchlight was brightly colored and animated, the world of Wraeclast is dark and dangerous, and everything in the game re-enforces that harshness. Levels are nicely differentiated: cavernous dungeons, a waste of sunken ships, temples of polished marble, rocky cliffs, forests, etc. Some of the dungeons are really downright creepy. As are some enemies. Heck, even your hero -- You are a criminal, an exile, and as such are portrayed with a harsh ugliness that works pretty well. Other minor things show attention to detail, like arrows sticking out of enemies or walls after you fire them. While the graphics may not impress on a technological level, the art direction here is well done.\n\n(I'm also led to believe that various spell effects become a lot more impressive-looking if you buy a microtransaction.)\n\nSOUND\n\nI didn't really notice the sound. And I think that's not a bad thing; while it would be nice to have music tracks that really blew me away, other than that I tend to think good sound in a game is like good service at a restaurant -- mostly invisible, because it delivers what you need without belaboring the point. Creepy areas felt creepy, spiders skittered, armor clanked, spell effects were satisfying, and perhaps most importantly, commentary from my character was just frequent enough to be interesting. I easily tire of games where my character blathers on every third minute with the same tired catchphrases. Likewise, there was never any lull in music where the game felt too silent, nor irritating track repeated so often that an annoying melody got stuck in my head. So I'll again say the sound is perfectly fine; unlikely to impress, but no negative marks here either.\n\nGAMEPLAY MECHANICS\n\nAh, finally the thing that matters most, and the reason you should be downloading this game right now. The fighting itself is fairly standard aRPG; click on things and push letters to use various skills to attack the enemies. There's more strategy than that, because you can drop traps and totems and have forking and radius skills etc. etc. But the systems behind all of this game are what put Path of Exile far ahead of the pack. So let's talk about them. There are a lot of small things that show some thought behind the game, from the various loot settings, to the ease of dropping into pick-up groups, to the simple way instances are handled, to the large 4-tabbed stash shared between all of your characters. But the main gameplay innovations, the reasons Path of Exile is the game I've been playing non-stop for weeks on end, can be divided into two main categories: Skills, and Economy.\n\nSKILLS\n\nSkills in Path of Exile are complex. The briefest way to describe it is that their active skills were inspired by Final Fantasy VII, and their passive skills by Final Fantasy X. But that would be far from giving you the whole story.\n\nSo, the first thing to explain is that any character can gain any skill. Your class determines starting stats and starting location in the "Skill Forest". Every active skill exists in the form of a gem that is red (str), green (dex), or blue (int). Gear has sockets of those colors to hold gems. When a gem is placed into your gear, you now have that skill. Skill gems can be removed at any time, so no worries about experimenting. Some gear has linked sockets, allowing you to equip support gems that augment other linked gem skills. Equipped gems gain experience over time, and you can choose to level them up, raising their power, but also raising the stat requirements. So any character can use any skill, but it will be tougher for a Marauder to use a level 15 Firestorm than it will for a Witch.\n\nEach time you level up, you will receive one passive skill point to spend in the Skill Forest. The Skill Forest contains something like 1,350 nodes. No, that's not a typo. There are 1,350 places to spend skill points. So even if you maxed out your character after a year of playing to the highest level, you'd have covered less than 1/10 of the grid.\n\nThere are basic +10 to a stat nodes, and your character will start near many of their favored stat, although you can follow a path anywhere you like. There are nodes to improve spellcasting, movement, accuracy, damage, and so on. At various places on the grid, there are clusters of nodes that grant bonuses to each weapon type or elemental damage type. Some nodes add life, evasion, or energy shield. Some nodes add resists, block rates, or criticals. Bigger nodes are fewer and farther between, but each one gives a benefit generally more than twice as good as a standard small node.\n\nAnd then there are keystone nodes. These giant circular nodes around the edges of the grid tend to be huge trade-offs that completely change your character. Eldritch Battery removes your character's energy shield, converting it entirely to extra mana. Chaos Innoculation reduces your life to 1, but makes you immune to chaos(poison) damage. Either one will change your character drastically; taking both will kill you. Other skills remove your armor, your evasion, or even your ability to deal damage with active skills, offering various trade-offs in return.\n\nAnyway, the skill system is incredibly complex, and while there are thankfully respec points you can gain by questing in game (and more from certain loot), it's worth pre-planning skills.\n\nECONOMY\n\nPath of Exile has no gold.\n\nBecause there is no accumulating pile of money, there is no money sink of repairs or potions. (Flasks are equipment items that refill automatically as you kill enemies, and can be enchanted.) Vendoring items nets you various orbs, and vendor items have orb purchase prices. But the key difference is that everything has inherent value. Orbs do not just accumulate uselessly like gold in many of these games, because every orb has inherent value. They improve your items in different ways, allowing you to enchant your new hybrid flask, reroll the enchantment on your boots, and reroll the number of sockets on your armor.\n\nCrafting is complex.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSkill Forest is complex too. Path of Exile is aiming for hardcore gamers when other games are streamlining more casual. This is a game by gamers, for gamers, and it shows.","November 4, 2015","true","89.5"," 117 of 123 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","117","123","6","6"

You look at the massively overwhelming passive tree and feel like running a mile. You'll either be blessed with awesome loot drops or cursed with crap all because RNG. Your first character, or even second, will probably feel rubbish eg. too slow, too squishy, not enough damage etc and you'll most likely struggle with later game content because of said character. In a word, this game is rather overwhelming for a new player and it's important to note that it is not on the casual side when it comes to ARPGS like, for example, Torchlight II. If you're looking for a more relaxed ARPG that you don't need to invest a bit of time into then this game isn't for you.\n\nHowever, if you can overcome some of those hurdles then you're in for a treat. As you start to learn the importance of different defences, capped resistances, allocating your passive skill points in a way that perfectly synergises with your skills and gear, skill gem setups, game mechanics and the like, you'll start to end up with a rather satisfyingly strong character. You'll begin to understand about crafting, what all those currency orbs mean and vendor recipes (the Path of Exile wiki will be your bible!). And of course, the never-ending quest for amazing loot and GG items.\n\nSo, if you're looking for an Action RPG that has a lot of depth to it, that offers a ton of replayability, a game that you can grow and learn with, offers a plethora of builds that are only limited by your imagination and has a fantastic Free to Play model, then this game is for you.","July 29, 2015","true","637.4"," 116 of 124 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","116","124","5","7"

No problem here.\n\nCurrency tabs: Functions as a bank. The max stack of currency items is increased (20 for orbs of alterations, for example) to 5000.\n\nIt is worth noting buying stash tabs is more bang for your buck if you don't amass lower tier currency, as currency tabs cannot contain items. For comparison, currency tabs are able to 5000 of each currency, while stash tabs are a grid of 144 boxes, each able to hold one stack of currency. Allocating one of your four default stash tabs for currency will suffice. No problem here.\n\nPremium stash tab: Default stash tabs which can be renamed, colored, and set to public. The benefit of purchasing this tab is for the easy indexing (selling) of items.\n\nGrinding Gear Games faced community backlash when they released the option of setting these tabs to public. Public premium stash tabs are able to be indexed by 'poe.trade', the 'auction house' of the economy. The option of indexing one's stash through the application 'Procurement,' is less efficient and not implemented as an in-game function.\n\nIf you do plan on selling items through poe.trade instead of trade chat, and index through premium stash tabs instead of 'Procurement', you buy one (4 USD), or premium a default tab (1.5 USD) and you're set.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTo my knowledge, this is one of the best MTX models on the market. It is worth noting you do not need to purchase the forementioned to progress and experience all of which this game has to offer. Contentwise, Path of Exile is an ARPG at the forefront of its genre. It's F2P, there's next to no reason as to why you shouldn't try it yourself instead of taking my word for it.\n\nWhile I downloaded and run PoE on the official standalone client, please feel free to message me on Steam if you need help.","May 4","true","37.8"," 81 of 87 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","81","87","2","0"

As a beginner i would recommend copying others builds for a start to learn the game and the different classes.\n\nWhat makes Path of Exile so great is that there is no such thing as "you can only play melee as the 'marauder'" or "The witch can only be played as a spellcaster". Sure, the witch is better at spellcasting than the marauder initially, but depending on your build a Marauder can do just as much damage as a spellcaster as the Witch.\n\nWhat makes Path of Exile hard for beginners is learning the passive tree and where to go, It's MASSIVE (1325 passive skills as i'm writing this), but i highly recommend anyone with some time to try it out!\n\nThe lategame offers a map system that you yourself as the player can craft the map mods and what you prefer.\n\nGrinding Gear Games (the people who made it) are very dedicated and updates the game frequently.

This tree takes the place of the all familiar splinter tree from most RPG's and at first glance can be overwhelming cause like most gamers we shun new things, but now that I've played in it, I feel like it will be hard to go back to the old way.\n\nGrinding Gears also does a great job in changing around other tropes of the genre most notably being the removal of currency. Instead now you use scrolls and other items that serve other purposes all well, so each purchase holds more weight and just like everything in this game requieres you to way the pro and cons to each decision. Being a impulse shopper can come back and bite you.\n\nYou will also forgo the common center laid hotbar for a new move system where socketed gems which are inserted into armor and weapons that level up themselves determine your move set. This in combonation with the skill tree lead to and endless ammount of customization for your character.\n\nPerformance wise the game has run great and I have very little bugs and none that jump too mind enough to note. Grinding Gears took their time too polish and while the graphics are not going to take any records they have not once felt outdated.\n\nToo some up this rant, I reccommend it highly. Cause it does what many recent dungeon crawlers have failed too do, and thats keep me and my friends discussing our trees, comparing our DPS and spending countless ours spilling the blood of anything that come within our mouse click, and then sifting the loot of course.","November 25, 2013","true","21.1"," 108 of 136 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","108","136","0","0"

From what I have read about POE many old Diablo programmers are involved with POE and its gameplay mechanics.  There are many saying that this is what Diablo 3 should be.  I am not hear for that and would rather not compare the two, as I am one of the few who really enjoy Diablo 3.  POE sports some interesting mechanics in gameplay as there is no gold or currency value in game or auction house of any sorts.  Gems play a big part in leveling your gear and increasing stats.  Inventory loadouts tend to fill quickly as you can not carry much.  The locations and minions of POE universe are interesting and varied.  POE has a rather dark tone to it with violent acts and blood.\n\nI do have a gripe with sync/lag as it has been an issue for a while and that nano second where you dont get a hit or take damage in a ARPG is critical and this can be become frustrating.  I do want to note that if you have not played this game yet and get started into it - the game starts very slowly and with very weak environments that are bland and a turn off.  Many people have quit thinking this is what the game will be and it does indeed get more varied and graphically interesting... just need to play through a couple of realms first.\n\nFor a FTP game this is just an amazing game where I would be willing to pay actual money for it, so I will consider donating with some visual items you can buy directly through Steam in the POE micro transaction shops.  These micro transactions are not pay to win and are cosmetic enhancements for the most part.  In case you missed it - Gamespot announced POE as the PC Game of the Year.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zarvon/recommended/238960/","zarvon","Zarvon ✔️","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zarvon/","30 products in account","So I've put a lot of thought into this review and a decent amount of time into the game - over 400 hours - so please don't disqualify this review if you're a longtime supporter of the game.\n\nFirst of all, I have to say that it is extremely enticing and enjoyable for at least a hundred hours of play. That's undeniable, and, to be honest, pretty great for a whopping 0$ required to play.  That's not to download the game - that's in general, period.  You really CAN'T enhance ingame experience much by paying money, and I for one absolutely love that.\n\nHere's the problem with the game - and if you're someone who doesn't plan on doing more than having a little fun for a few hours now and then, this probably won't matter to you. But if you're the kind of gamer who really likes endgame content - read on.  The problems that I have with the game are almost 100% related to endgame content, and deep endgame content at that.\n\n#1 - The endgame accessibility.\nIt's relatively easy to begin running maps after a maximum of about thirty hours - even if you don't know what you're doing.  When you are running maps, it's fun, challenging, and the content seems new and fresh.  Maps are relatively easy to get - most players will have hundreds of t1s and t2s hanging around. HOWEVER, this is extremely fleeting.  Once you start crafting your maps, they will very quickly become exponentially harder.  If you're an old player reading this, you'll probably laugh my response off because your gear can easily deal with a t2 map with, say, phys reflect and Temporal Chains.  But to new players, this is extremely frustrating because they can't really gain gear or orbs from these maps but also have an extremely difficult time with them.  The better maps you run, the better loot you get - or is it, really? I would contest that maps t1-t7 have generally the same loot reward, and t7s can be extremely difficult for people who don't have access to the loot of higher level maps.  Sure, you could get extremely lucky and get something great - but that's not likely for most of us.\n\n#2. The loot.\nYes, yes, as with most negative reviews here, I'm going to whine about the loot drop system.  If you're a new player who likes games in the same style as PoE, you'll probably laugh off my condemnation of RNGesus.  Let me explain: If you think you've experienced RNG walls before this, you have not.  Not even CLOSE.  It has nothing to do with luck. It's probably more likely that you'll win Powerball than actually get an item that you're farming for.  Yes, it's possible that you will get something else that you can sell, but this brings me to my third point - the economy.\n\n#3. Trading.\nPretty quickly into PoE, you'll probably begin to ask this question: "Why isn't there a public auction house of some sort where I can simply save up orbs and quickly sell and buy loot?"  The answer is that this type of system is extremely dangerous for games such as Path of Exile - and indeed, diablo experienced the repurcussions of incorporating such a system into their game.  The economy is such a huge problem that there have been, since open beta, serious third party clients and websites (Procurement, I'm talking to you) which cater to this demand.  The problem is that there is such a huge volume of loot that it's very, very annoying to scroll through thousands of results for items trying to find out what kind of price the item you're buying should be set at.  And this is a REQUIREMENT FOR ENDGAME CONTENT.  Let me repeat that: it is extremely difficult - or at the very least heavily counterproductive in terms of orb use - to craft your own gear, and it's a requirement to have full tri res gear if you're doing any decent maps.\n\n#4. The ability to true create your own build for endgame content.\nSpoilers! There is no ability for this.  The problem with PoE is that there is a select sect of the population which is SO UNBELIEVABLY GOOD AT THE GAME that all other content scales to them to simply make it interesting - these guys are, of course, the Twitch population.  I'm not talking sour grapes here, I'm quoting GGG - they actually said that "If we created content that would take streamers weeks to complete rather than days or hours, it would take an average player years to complete it."  They've created a paradox.  PoE was hailed when it first came out as having a fantastic loot drop system because it allowed players to create unique builds from "self-found" items.  And again, that's so great - for the first hundred hours. At the very most.  After that, you better pray you haven't focused a summoning build because you thought it was cool, cause let me tell ya, you're going to need a few dozen ex before you can do any maps with good modifiers.  And, of course, cheap builds that you find online won't stay cheap long.  You cannot genuinely build your own character off your gear because in the long run, all gear is trash unless it has very specific modifiers.  If you're running a niche build rather than a meta build, congrats: you just need slightly different extremely specific modifiers.\n\n#5. The devs.\nLast but far, far from least, I'll address the problem that probably most experienced players have with the game.  Personally, I feel that I haven't gotten to enough of the content to actually have this problem, but I recognize its existence and I feel that I should mention it.  If you ARE a player who has saved up hundreds of ex and perfected their gear, ask yourself these questions: "What's my favorite build? What do I like the most? What set of mechanics and gear do I like the best?"  The answer to that question is whatever is about to get nerfed next.  Oh, and it won't be a public nerf. That would inspire far too much backlash.  It'll be a nerf that subtly changes the mechanics so that your character will get absolutely terminated all the time.  If you're softcore, that sucks, and if you're hardcore - well, I hope you like softcore, because your character just got sent there for good.  (Again, this isn't sour grapes - I've just heard this story countless times.)\n\nSo, to sum things up a bit - Path of Exile suffers from a rather unique affliction.  The endgame content is extremely varied and challenging, with lots of depth and ways to modify and improve your experience - but only if you've already spent hundreds and hundreds or thousands of hours playing the game and have the resources to adapt to extremely varied situations.  Getting your own gear from drops is prohibitively difficult, selling your own drops to incrementally obtain said gear is tedious to an extreme and often will result in you getting scammed or at the very least told 'ur a highballer fggt'.  Even without looking at dealing with the varied situations, the basic endgame content itself is so wierdly difficult that it is very hard to understand without large amounts of research.  Turns out that evasion actually kinda sucks, but hey, at least it's not as easy to get one-shot as with armor, right? Better have both! Oh, damn. That gear looks like it's a few dozen exalts.  Bummer.\n\nAt the end of my Path of Exile run, I felt like I was no longer actually playing the game.  I was grinding in an unusually unpleasant manner for items which ultimately would be basically useless and chosen entirely at random.  I felt that the game itself had huge amounts of promise but eventually did not deliver.  It is grueling at the very least and indescribably frustrating for most of the time.  It got to the point where I simply did not enjoy the game anymore - the choices were either to suicide into unplayable content trying to get gear that would make said content playable or to re-grind endlessly the beginning map content and get no xp or items.\n\nMaybe I'll revisit the game at a later point in time, but at the moment I can't imagine wanting to return anytime soon.","February 8","false","535.9"," 330 of 497 people (66%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","66","330","497","26","24"

Coupled with how skills and unique items interact with each other, that would be enough to get you playing for a handful of hours. On the bad side, only a few combinations will actually work if you want to play high level content. Not only that, but the mentioned passive skill tree can be overwheling for new players, and even if point reallocation is possible, it will not be free and will cost you ingame currency. For this, your will never get the most out of your first character unless you are following someone else's build right from the beginning. In addition to this, many unique items provide new mechanics, so some of them will be needed for certain builds. The problem about this build-enabler unique items is that not all of them are easy to find; some being incredibly expensive. While all of this is not inherently bad, it makes Path of Exile an incredibly time consuming game (if you want to experience its endgame, that is).\n\nTalking about its endgame, it turned out to be pretty disappointing. The more you advance through the game and get closer to the maximum level, the more it turns into a real market simulator. You will need to trade to earn enough currency if you want to afford certain items. Of course you can always rely on farming, but the drop rate of some items is so incredibly low that I would not count on that. Remember that those pricy items are expensive for a reason. If you can tolerate trading this might not be bad for you, but I personally enjoy farming and getting those valuable items myself - Who doesn't like to obtain epic loot in an ARPG at all? Sadly, Path of Exile is not a rewarding game in that aspect.\n\nThis leads us to trading. Usually you would use the in-game trade chat... if you want to get ripped off, that is. Almost every single item listed in the chat will be priced higher that its real value. For this, people use an external website to search for items that meet certain criteria: By posting the items on the official forums, they get indexed. This is a very handy way of trading whether you're looking for a certain item or want to open up a shop. Whatever method you use to trade, be ready to deal with the worst of the community. Speculation is a big thing in the game and most rich players have not amassed their wealth by playing.\n\nI would also like to mention how harsh and unfriendly this game's community has been for a very long time now. You will constantly be looked down on or simply ignored if you dare to ask something.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/g859/recommended/238960/","g859","g8","http://steamcommunity.com/id/g859/","544 products in account","Started playing back in Closed Beta and thought there wasn't a lot to hold my interest. Fast forward 18 months, and I can't get enough of it. Insanely deep skill tree allows for an near-infinite amount of ways to build a character through self-found builds, though these may not work out for beginning players. On the flip side, builds by other players on the official forums are easy to follow and helpful for first-time players. This game is easy to play, hard to master, and very replayable. Rerolling characters in other games, at least for me, is very repetitive and tedious, but not in PoE. Because of the depth and complexity offered by the game, even making a character the same class as your previous one can be drastically different.\n\nCurrency in PoE is one of key features that sets it apart from other ARPGs. Basic Scrolls of Wisdom allow you to identify Magic/Rare/Unique gear as in other games, but "Orbs" are the de facto currency of the game. Not only do they allow you to modify/reroll your gear, they allow you to trade for other gear with other players.\n\nAnother stand-out feature of PoE are the skill gems. There are hundreds of Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Support gems that are placed into sockets in weapons and equipment that allow players to use them as skills. Different from other ARPGs that just unlock skills the higher level a player is depending on their class. Not so with PoE. The way skill gems can be mixed with each other, especially with support gems, can really affect how the game is played from build to build. In addition to this, skill gems can level up from 1 through 20 and have increasingly more powerful effects as they level up. An item modifier, quality, also affects gems. Quality further increases the effects of a gem and ranges from 1-20%.\n\nThe gear/loot in PoE is as extensive as the rest of the game. Standard qualities like magic (blue) and rare (yellow) exist as in other ARPGs, but the implicit and explicit mods on these items is what makes the game interesting. There are so many different mods that exist and affect gameplay as much as the way a character is built or the skills that it uses. In addition to these items, sockets are also an integral part of the game. Without sockets, skill gems would be useless, and without certain sockets, important combinations cannot be achieved. Socket colors in PoE are red (strength gems), green (dexterity gems), blue (intelligence gems), and white (any gem). These sockets can be rerolled using Chromatic Orbs as well as linked using Orbs of Fusing. This really changes up how skill gems can be used in conjunction with other gems, especially later in the game.\n\nThe story/lore of the game is not necessarily an integral part of the experience, but the settings and locales are decent and the overall art direction and visuals have a real dark feel, which do lend themselves to that story. There are three acts in PoE, up from two that the game previously started with. Each increases in monster level until Act III is beaten, upon which the difficulty goes up (Normal -> Cruel -> Merciless) and Act I begins again. I have not reached endgame maps yet, but they add a lot of content to the endgame experience.\n\nSpeaking of experience, leveling in PoE requires a lot of experience near the end. Leveling from 1-50 takes little time, and then the experience required jumps quickly as one might expect. Even then, leveling is still not too tedious until much later. My main character is only level 56 so I cannot speak to how long it takes, but other players have reached the upper 90s, so it is feasible.\n\nOverall, PoE is a great game at a great price tag: FREE. No pay to win aspects here. If you're looking for an fun, deep, replayable ARPG, this is it. GGG does not mind streaming of their game or even monetizing their game. They value feedback and release patches at a decent clip. In addition to this support, they run races that reward rare currencies or items over a season, though winners are usually the same few, especially in party races. Still fun to play, though.\n\nI recommend getting this game...now!","December 4, 2013","true","441.8"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","0"

This proves my oppinion yet again.\n\nI've put 4000 hours into this game according to steam, I never had a lot of luck while playing and I built up everything I had with hard work and thousands of hours playing. I liked it and it is the only game I've been playing this long.\n\nNow to my story:\nAfter a very very long time I finally traded myself a Mirror of Kalandra to start over in their new expansion that is coming out soon. The mirror is the most valued currency item you can get in this game. (around $300 in real money).\n*edit: I traded this Item legally and did not RMT. Sorry for the misunderstanding due to my exhibition\n\nA recent "bug"(afterwards found, fixed and admitted) deleted and modified some Items from player stashes. Unfortunately my mirror was one of them. After some email trades with multiple persons of the support it turned out that the items would not be returned and that I don't have any right to claim according to their TOS. I wrote the first email a month before they even considered a bug btw.\n\nAfter 4k hours of playing, putting around $700 into their supporter packs I’m now left with nothing.\n\nconclusion:\nPath of Exile as a long-term game where it takes like forever to obtain high-end Items and actually beat the endgame content. There is no reason to play a game based around required Items which can disappear at any point without any way to get them back. Bugs are common in games that are in continuous development and they happen again. Save your time and play something else.\n\nTLDR - I don't recommend this game for players seeking for a long-term game\n\nsorry for the long post.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiristo/recommended/238960/","Kiristo","Kiristo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiristo/","172 products in account","In my opinion, Path of Exile is the greatest ARPG currently available.  The fact that the game is free to play, yet offers an incredible amount of depth, frequent updates and solid gameplay sets it apart as not only the best ARPG currently, but also one of the best F2P games created to date.  If you are a fan Diablo-style games, then I must recommend you give PoE a go.  I have played Grim Dawn, all three Diablo games, Marvel Heroes, both Torchlight games, Titan's Quest and several other ARPGs (these mentioned are the best of the lot to date, in my opinion).  It is my favorite style of video game, and that has made PoE my favorite game for some time.\n\nThe early game is a bit slower/clunkier feeling than say Diablo 3's due to the way skills work in PoE, but by mid to late game, it becomes much faster-paced.  The skill and class system is an interesting thing in PoE.  You are not bound to a set of skills or play type by the class you pick.  Certain classes lend themselves better to certain playstyles, but you can certainly play a tanky, melee witch and a glass cannon marauder.  Skill gems must be socketed into your gear you are wearing to grant skills to be used, and skills can be modified to augment the way they work and their damage by socketing support gems into linked sockets.  PoE doesn't tend to explain things, or make things so simple that they require no explanation/figuring out.  The wiki for PoE is an extremely valuable source of information, and trading in the game nearly necessitates the use of a third party site - which is essentially an Auction House where one lists or finds items for sale.  Nearly every item in the game is tradeable, and the currency in the game is expendable and usable, making it useful both for trading for items as well as crafting/upgrading your own items.  There are recipes in the game that still have not been discovered (or at least made public) since the game was released!\n\nThat is not to say the game is not without its faults.  Chief amoungst them is the game's engine.  It was developed before there were great engines available for free to build your games with (such as Unreal Engine and Unity).  As such, the developers made their own engine, which allows them to custom tailor it to their game.  It also means that upgrades are more difficult and solely on the shoulders of the development team.  The engine does not handle graphical effects such as particle effects as well as say, Diablo 3's does, and this can cause framerate issues.  As the game has gotten more popular in the past year+, they have been able to expand their team, allowing them to dedicate folks on fixing such issues as well as make regular updates - new content is released every 3 months alternating between an expansion and a smaller content update.  ARPGs are a grindfest, a grind for loot and experience.  PoE keeps things fairly fresh (or gives you a reason to come back every 3 months, at least) by adding regular content.  The 3 month cycle also includes the release of a new challenge leagues, which introduces some new element to the game.  At the end of the challenge leagues, characters from those leagues (there is a hardcore and softcore challenge league) are moved to the permanent hardcore and softcore leagues.  Sometimes the content/mechanics from these challenge leagues is permanently added to the core game, sometimes it is not.  There are a couple things (like stash space and special stash tabs that make organizing things & trading things easier) that are available for purchase that will make the game more convenient.  I played the game for a long time without paying for anything though as you are in no way impaired from enjoying the game without extra stash space.  Cosmetic items make up the bulk of the cash shop, and provide no stat bonuses or any kind of edge other than looking different.\n\nIn conclusion: If you like ARPGs, you really ought to give this a try.  It's better (in my opinion) than any other game in this genre, releases new content updates far more often as well, and all of the other games in the genre cost money to play (Marvel Heroes being the other exception).  Even if you don't end up liking it more than Diablo 3 or Grim Dawn, I highly recommend at least giving Path of Exile an hour or two.  You may find, a couple thousand hours later, you're still learning new things about the game and still having a lot of fun playing it.","May 25","true","423.5"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","0"

You propably never heared of the studio before, but looking at Path of Exile i hope more good stuff is coming from these guys in the future.\n\nPoE is a Diablo Style morpg setting place in a medivial/fantasy world. The game design is done with a lot of love, though to some it might look outdated or old fashioned. The top down style that can only zoom but not rotate can be charming though for all those who hoped for a remade Diablo 1/2 style game for years.\nGetting into the game is not as easy as with Blizzards famous titles though, the way how trading and currencys work seems a bit weird before you got into the system. There is no ingame currency, but a bunch of different orbs that are interchanged for items at different rates between the players. The system works though, and there is various sites on the web to search gear and items with that you can purchase for orbs you found ingame.\nKind of normal for a grind&loot title this game can be very time consuming - i would not advice this title for the casual gamer who wishes to try out epic gear quickly. But the game has means of rewarding you permanently for your spent time, and the permanent updates from the developers with new leagues every couple of month make this title a good choice for the determinated long time player.\nWith a well filled wiki, good forum, a nice community and interesting trading system POE has a lot to offer. Endless variations of character trees and builds are possible - the reward for the time it will take to figure out how everything works in Path of Exiles world. The massive skilltree and possible combinations of skill gems can indeed be a bit too much for some, but if you like depth and don´t mind a bit of work to get started you will propably get addicted to Path of Exile soon. The endgame system where you can run a bunch of different maps that can be crafted with modifiers is something remarkable, and although some ideas of the games wherre Blizzards brainchilt, GGG came up with a bunch of own good ideas to revive the concept of the top down hack&slash game, good old Diablo style.","September 16, 2014","true","402.7"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","21","23","4","3"

W-WE'LL DO IT LIVE DAMNIT!\n\n#I Want Malachais Spike\n\nANYWAY, What's Path of Exile? It's Diablo, done right, pretty much. Yeah I know some of the fanboys are PROBABLY going to downvote me for this, but it's still true. The game is free, and is more dynamic and polished than Diablo ever was. That can be a bad as well as a good thing...With Diablo you don't get in-game stores cause you already paid for it a-...Wait you can buy stuff for it on battlenet?...Well...Uhm...okay!\n\nThe game's pretty much you picking one of 7 different classes...From brute monster dudes to a creepy witch gal, and then you get pitted against four chapters of various horrifying and SUPER edgy monsters, while being forced to tackle the most INTIMIDATING SKILL TREE THAT YOU WILL EVER EVER SEE FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!!![i.imgur.com]. Seriously, it's flipping mind blowing! There are dozens of different paths to take and things to do and stuff and what have you! It's outrageous! And to add insult to injury: There's no tutorial what so ever! After getting to a certain point in the first playthrough, you unlock a jack of all, ace of none character, named Scion, who's pretty much a blank slate character. Do what you want with type of deal.\n\nThe graphics are a-okay and it actually gives you a wide range of spec requirements...the recommended is nice and high and lets even the toughest rigs get to make the game into a gorey HD experience, while the minimum are so low that even the worst old crappy laptops(Like my own) can play it with little to no complications!\n\nOnce you've completed the game on normal difficulty....you...GET TO PLAY THROUGH IT AGAIN!...This time on cruel difficulty, and then merciless!!! Yes, you have to backtrack the same stuff you just did if you want to level past 35-40 -.- Cause thats when you reach the last bit of chapter 4 and the game starts from scratch 1 difficulty level higher.\n\nBut it's okay cause you'll NEED to know how this stuff works anyway! Normal difficulty is more like a 'let me show you how its done' stage, and cruel difficulty is actually the INTENDED difficulty of the game! Or that's the feeling I got from it, anyway.\n\nSo now lets do some pros and cons...\n\nPros:\nIt's better than Sakura Clicker\nYou have the most freedom skill wise than in any other game that I've ever seen.\nLarge assortment of classes to choose from, including one ace of none jack of all character to unlock.\nVery large community, which is commonly adult\nThe game is INSANELY gorey and kind of horror based. Lots of impaled corpses and body parts and literal RIVERS of blood. If you're a gorefest lover, you'll ADORE this game!\nNaked golden statue women with really nice golden asses...BIG plus for that one.\nPvP is a thing!\nCrazy difficulty curve...Easy at first, IMPOSSIBLE to solo at the end.\nA real e-peen fertilizer! You feel you have a boner that could lift your desk when you're wrecking parts of the game that shouldnt be soloable, by yourself!\nYou can raise the dead to fight for you, then make them explode when they die, then raise the dead who just died to your zombie minions...It's AMAZING!!!\n\nCons:\nThe currency system is a complete mess...\nIt's based on 'orbs' and there are literally 15+ different orbs to keep track of, each more valuable than another and WHAT value they exactly are switches from day to day and from person to person, so you might buy something for 10 regal orbs but can only seem to sell it for 5 etc.\n\nHow good you are is RNG based.\nWhen you get a good piece of gear, it might not fit your needs exactly(You might do lightning dmg mainly and the piece has cold dmg!). So you use an orb of chance or whatever it is to change the attributes of it to fit your needs....And you might end up making it WORSE, like putting strength on some mage gloves or something stupid like that! Being good in this game relies a LOT!!! on luck of the draw.\n\nRepetitive as all hell.\nYou play through the game...next difficulty...Play through the game...NEXT difficulty...OH there's an event! Make a new character, play through the game, event ends, new character again, new league to get better get...Play through the game, next difficulty, league ends, character gets put in hardcore league....If character died, character's bumped to standard league. Make new character etc. It's the same exact stuff over and over again.\n\nBit of a random storyline.\nIt's kinda hard to follow the lore of the game, as it's all kind of just thrown at you as you go along :\ Unless you sit and waste 30 seconds - 3 minutes reading dialogue from NPCs, you will have NO IDEA whats going on, or why Merveil has to die, or why Malachai is a grade A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, etc.\n\n\nOther than that, the game is, for its few, not super crippling flaws, a really good one, and I do indeed recommend it.","August 4, 2015","true","107.4"," 41 of 58 people (71%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","71","41","58","17","3"

Have not played Diablo? Then you now have an idea of what Diablo is like. [Congratulations, if you like this you may now just be tempted to buy some of the Diablo games.]\n\nActual Review:\nThis game has been amazing and it's definatly not like any of your other Free-To-Play Steam Games. As mentioned by the producers, they actually tried to make MADE this game no where close to Pay-To-Play "if" at all. There is an option to spend money on some costume/gear but does not effect your stats which I like a lot. So if you are  Sir/Madam Moneybags  who enjoys just tossing money around, there is an option for that. Graphics are very good, I have yet to find a superior glitch that affects game play and the game runs smooth on my computer. However there has been many complaints about a long loading screen when you open up the game, but I have no problem with it as it actually does not take that long. [Sometimes it helps to click around or minimize it then pull it back up.] All n' all everything is great, the gear is fitting, battle is smooth, and the story is really good. Love that their is seperate pieces that you can find and look into.\nAnother thing I tend to enjoy is that you don't have to deal with numerous of players on the maps which usually causes lag as you run through the maps by yourself (Or with friends). Though if you do enjoy seeing other people, you will be able to see them in the towns and you can chat with them through a Global Chat. That annoys me however as most of them are only trying to sell gear or are being utterly ridiculous. If you can happen to ignore it, you will be fine.\n\nTo the Haters:\nIt's unfortunate people try to down this game for silly reasons. Those who don't enjoy the game for silly reasons should understand that it could be because of your computer, you are not playing a genre you are familiar with, you are just too damn picky, or you have nothing better to do. Though I do understand if someone has an actualy reason, then I respect that but is there really a true reason to not like this game?","November 21, 2014","true","15.5"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","26","32","6","0"

I found out later it was locked because of this review. For more info on why the locked account my account. You can find at the bottome of the review.\n\nThe Review:\nThis game is challenging. It’s not so much the gameplay that is challenging, but your knowledge of the game itself that challenges you. There are many nuances in the game that you have to learn. First the vocabulary. For example 5% increased damage is very different from 5% more damage. And because of this don’t expect to make that perfect char your first go. Especially if you don’t follow a guide. This isn't really a bad thing, but it is not friendly to new players.\n\nThe point of the game is to make the most OP character you can. I enjoy doing this, and is the reason I started to play the game. However; even if you succeed in making a character work the way you wanted it too. Don’t expect it to last. GGG has been constantly nerfing build after build. The build diversity has gone way down sense the game first released. And you may not even be able to play your character even remotely close to the way you did before.\n\nGGG is on a never ending quest to balance the game. As if things HAVE to be balanced. Meaning anything main stream or popular gets nerfed. In 1.3 it was block. In Awakening it was life leach, and auras. And many other things. Anyways; the point of nerfs where to balance things. But the truth is you can’t really balance defensive vs offensive skills. If you want an explanation on that read here http://www.diabloii.net/blog/comments/mad-prophecies-2-defensive-skills But in GGG’s quest to balance these, they instead have made it so you need multiple defensive things going instead of one.\n\nPatches are big problems for existing characters. For example: Reduce Mana used to work on auras. But in the awakening patch... Reduced Mana changed so it wouldn’t work with auras or similar gems. They then took the enlightened gem and made it do what reduced mana used to do. This is a huge problem for existing builds. The biggest problem being the color of gem changing. Many people might have corrupted there gear, and can’t change the color of it to match the new gem. Meaning your once level 100 character is now all messed up gear and gems. GGG just expects you to level a new guy. And when they mess up your character they don’t let you redo in game key choices. Like the bandit reward choice. They only give you a passive re-spec. And that is only because they change the passive tree so much. It is usually impossible to leave your old tree in tack.\n\nThat is my biggest grip of this game. Many people like this. They think it keeps the game fresh. But for many others... GGG is just destroying builds constantly patch after patch. And you as the player you are just expected to deal with it. Builds come and go. I don’t see this changing, and it will just continue. Until the least popular build is the only viable one.\n\nPatch changes are not announced before they happen either. However; beta testers get to play with the changes before anyone else. And most of the major changes can be found in the form of rumors. But the actual patch notes come the same day as the patch. Leaving many builds broken in their wake. And forum jerks going around telling people they had plenty of time to prepare.\n\nThis gives beta testers a big advantages in many different areas of the game. Like what items to buy, or sell based off upcoming nerfs/buffs. Even way before the patch notes, let alone the patch release. But the biggest annoyance is the race events. Right after a huge major patch like the awakening. They will offer prizes. Such as a laptop to the first person to kill the new boss. They highly show favoritism to a few select people. Weather they realize it or not. So if you don't cheat and are not able to play on the test servers. Then don't expect to win anything. EVER!!!\n\nBut there is still hope for the game. It is fun to play when you first get the hang of it. It is also fun to make your own builds. It is just very, and I mean VERY poorly managed. And most people will be happy; until the next patch comes out, and your character is completely gutted again. Because of this I don’t recommend picking up any of the bandit rewards. Just kill all 3. It leaves you with more flexibility; for when the next patch does come out. And don’t spend money on the game. It’s not a matter of “if they will” but “when they will” destroy your current character/build. Very few builds survive from patch to patch. One of the patches actually de-leveled your gems for you. This is a game where patches are your worst nightmare.\n\nPlay this game if you really don’t have anything else to do. And know beforehand that many players have a huge unfair advantages in races. This is not just from there beta/testRealm either. They also have maphacks. So don’t bother with them. Also know that your character build weather OP or just OK will be destroyed sometime in the future. So don’t get attached to it. Don’t play this game thinking anything will last. And know that melee vs ranged is not balanced at all. And they destroy many builds trying to balance this. When they should just let them be OP in their own rights. I guess it’s because they are trying to turn this into a PVP game.\n\nOther things to note are: PVP go ranged or loose. Don’t expect to do groups/parties. The reward isn’t worth the penalties that come with it. Don’t ever corrupt stuff except for gems. Because gems change not just in stats, but in color too.\n\nLocked account Info:\nThey say they won't unlock my account until this review goes away, and that I apologies.

At first i had my difficulties with the game since i was only playing D3 before. After spenging a couple of hours i started to see the depth of this game and the endless possibilities and choices you are given.\n\nThe huge passive skilltree combined with your own creativity can produce a powerful and fun build the world has yet not seen. Other like in D3 you can spend time outside of the game to prepare, study skillgem and supportgem combinations and think of new builds.\n\nGGG works hard on PoE and its content. New expansions, challenging races, monthly events or 3 month races, it feels like this game is never ending and never becoming boring at all. And the best thing? It's FREE TO PLAY and NOT pay to win.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to everyone. Do you want to play a game that does all the thinking for you? Do you like high-end visual effects? Do you expect a helping hand from the game after you start playing it? Do you want to create a char and stick with it forever? Well then PoE might not be for you. If you like preparing, thinking and doing research, challenging new leagues and are compfortable with creating new chars and testing new builds and maybe abandon one or another character because of reasons then take a look at PoE and spend some time with it.\n\nMy personal rating:\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nCommunity: 10/10\nContent/Updates: 10/10\n","November 14, 2015","true","640.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","19","22","3","0"

I just remember Goatmen, because I feel like they're following me around in dungeon crawlers. *looks out window*\nYou won't be playing this game for its story, while the game does provide fully voiced dialogue with the various npc's, my best friend never gave me time to listen to the dialogue, so we just kept dungeon grinding and skipped the conversations. The basic gist of the story is: You're an exile, go get your revenge, got your revenge? Restart! You're an exile, go get your revenge, got your revenge? One more time! You're an Exile, go get your revenge, got your revenge? Yay! Now you need to map grind.\n\nGame Play: As with dungeon crawler games you control movement with clicking, you're in the above view watching your exile run all over your screen. additionally you can set various action butons, 1,2,3,4,5 are quick buttons to use flasks. you can bind left, middle or right click to different attacks, as well as several keys on your keyboard.\nYou also face some npc's that are a different color or have a different health bar, indicating they're  cooler than other npc's; if you see these smug npc's be sure to slap them and tell 'em Atratzu sent you. But, on a more serious note, they have different abilities, and attack types, sometimes they can leap, sometimes curse, other times they shoot hyper beam at you.\n\nAchievements: there are really two types of achievements, the ones regular people can do, and the ones that will require a commitment to the game. This game is meant to appeal to hardcore gamers, there is also a hardcore mode.\n\nPrice:  The game's free, you have no excuse to not at least try it sometime. If you want to look like a badass, then you need to pay real money to get the aesthetics or bank space. But if you are just looking to play a dungeon crawler for a little while, go for it.\n\nConclusion: Story: What story? Why are we killing this guy again? because that random guy said so? Okay! *murders face*. Game Play: Fun, but unforgiving in the skill point tree. Achievements: Mostly challenging grindy or RNG achievements. Price: Free, for everything else... there's Master card.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update April 11, 2015:\nsmall grammar, spelling, and punctuation fix","January 7, 2015","true","168.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","19","25","6","0"

It expects you to put in some effort. It will be daunting at first. Very daunting.\n\nNow the good news- It is not nearly as bad as it looks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jmomo/recommended/238960/","jmomo","jmomo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jmomo/","232 products in account","PoE (Path of Exile) 2.0 came out and I've got like 2000 hours on this game, so I guess it's time to update the review.\n\nThis is a great game, but it doesn't have mass appeal. Many players will try it, not like it, and move along. But for some, this is it. This is the Diablo III they were waiting for. PoE does a great job of catering to a specific set of players who want a particular product.\n\nMonetization occurs from selling character cosmetic items, stash tabs (item storage), and similar. These items are not required to play, and it's not pay-to-win. GGG calls these "ethical micro transactions".\n\nIn other words, you buy a wild turkey pet to fund the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RHxRgw-jK4\n\nPoE (Path of Exile) has a number of really interesting mechanics which makes gameplay interesting, but since they are following the path laid out by Diablo II (DII)  in front of them, we can't give them too much credit for originality.\n\nMy opinion is that PoE is a better successor to DII than Diablo III was. However, I also doubt that this is what the casual average DII player wanted.\n\nPoE is the vision of the intensely dedicated Diablo II nerd who spent hours comparing gear to get the maximum numbers they desired. It's the product that people who “farmed” for loot wanted. It is the game that DII PvP players asked for.\n\nHowever, PoE is not a game that most casual gamers want to play. That's it's problem.\n\nPoE is extremely complicated. Even GGG, to their credit, acknowledges this issue. This is both a positive in that it means the end-game has depth, but negative in that it is very difficult for new players to get into the game and understand it.\n\nPoE has it's own community-specific terminology, metaphors, acronyms, and memes:\nhttp://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Community_shorthand\n\nPoE has it's own currency system, used for crafting, trading gear, and services:\nhttp://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Currency\n\nThe passive skill tree will make your head explode:\nhttp://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree\n\nThe active skill gem system will make the little fragments of brains left over from your head exploding explode some more, like cluster bomby brainy bits:\nhttp://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/List_of_skills\n\nTrue power players will need to understand the modifier system of how character stats are generated:\nhttp://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Modifier#Advanced_Example\n\nItem prefixes, suffixes, implicit/explicit attributes, legacy items, netcode, masters, the chat system, and more. Eyes glaze over, mouth falls open, saliva dribbles out, head hits desk.\n\nIf you work real hard, and put thousands of hours into the game, you might be able to be this guy some day:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNPAz1ESm00\n\nIf you say, “BUT I JUST WANNA SHOOT STUFF AND HAVE FUN.”, then this game probably isn't for you.\n\nIf reading wikis and forums for hours and hours just to learn how to play the game doesn't sound fun, then this game isn't for you.\n\nThe PoE community actively hates on casual players.\n\nIf, however, you really like grinding for rare loot, specing out strange gear and skill combinations, or winning PvP matches because you live closer to the servers than anyone else, then you might care enough to keep reading.\n\nThe story, storytelling, characters, and other story-related aspects of the game are awful. Characters are forgettable, I am not really sure what is going on or what we are fighting for, and I would have a very difficult time explaining the background of what's going on in this universe or what your character's compelling interest is. The narrative is unintelligible and I've played through the game nearly a hundred times now! The dialogue is a wordy assemblage of random metaphors and pseudo-shakespearian mind-numbing dribble. 2.0 helped a little, but then it just opened up the obvious need for a 5th act to explain WTF just happened in Act 4.\n\nTo be fair, it seems like there is a deep story beneath PoE, but you will go through the entire story three times over and still not know what it is.\n\nOther complaints...\n\nThe first play-through of the game (normal difficulty) is of such trivial ease that it's basically a trainer for the second go-around. It's a slow chore, and does not feel rewarding. Learning the gem and passive skill system is daunting and non-intuitive to a new player.\n\nThe worst offense this game has to offer is that it's an always-online server-based game like Diablo III and factors such as server load and network latency, which are completely outside of your control, can have a dramatic effect on the quality of your game playing experience.\n\nEVERY SINGLE MOUSE CLICK gets sent to their servers and you have to wait for a reply before it happens. Picking up and item with your mouse in your inventory is a network event. Putting it down again is a second network event. This is true even after the 2.0/netcode improvements.\n\nGoogle for “path of exile desync” to find out more, or better yet, to go Youtube and watch the videos of people dying and ranting about it.\n\nBefore the 2.0 patch, I had a daily 180-200ms ping, and it was miserable. I had a lot of bad things to say about that. However, now that there are more servers in more locations, my ping has dropped to 35ms, and with the new network code improvements, the game is really a different experience. Every once in awhile though, I get reminded that my quality of gameplay is determined by the routers and switches between me and their servers. I get disconnected or lag happens and keyboards get thrown.\n\nOn the up side...\n\nI have been very positively impressed by how GGG as a company, and especially it's founder, Chris Wilson have operated.\n\nThe community, while full of angsty tweens of all ages and nationalities, is pretty good and there are plenty of friendly players out there to party with. It's also very international and you get to play with people from all over the world.\n\nThe endgame content is very good. There's always the opportunity to improve your gear, trade items, start a new character, do a new build, level up towards 100, and find that rare unique item you want.\n\n\n\nIf you are still reading by this point, I would tell you to try out PoE. It's free, so you can't really go wrong there. The product has really deep gameplay and a lot of talented work went into making the system challenging for high-end technical players who want to spend hours farming, collecting loot, and then spending more hours milling over their loot stash and character stats.\n\nI like PoE, but it is a frustrating experience.","January 23, 2015","true","429.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","15","19","3","0"

Generally F2P games always have some kind of gimmick or hook that gets players to pay out cash for perks or bonuses but not Path of Exile.  Being a huge fan of Diablo 2 I've been waiting for something to come along that captures what made that game so great back in its time and I've finally found it.\n\nI've played other similar titles such as Torchlight 1 and 2 and while both of them are good games in their own right this still trumps them in nearly every way possible.  Enemy variation, item customization via the gem system, skill trees, difficulty, as well as area design this game has it all.  So far I've put in around 15 or so hours and I'm still nowhere near being done yet.\n\nIf you like these types of games and especially if you have friends to play with online this title is for you.","November 27, 2013","true","18.1"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","0"

Not free as in "I got this game for free to review.", just free.  I've never gotten a game free to review, and I don't think I would want to anyway.  I mean, even though people say it has no influence over their review, can that be possible?  Not if you're a parent, that's for sure.\n\nParents will know quite well the feeling.  You kid comes home from kindergarten with a picture they drew.  "Look, I drew our house!" they exclaim, holding out a drawing that resembles the house in the way Taco Bell resembles food.  But while you're wondering if it was possible the Zika virus was around when your child was born, you don't tell them that they have the artistic ability of a blind baboon, you simply say "That's lovely!" and hang it on the refrigerator next to the twenty other incoherent scribblings they have produced this month.\n\nThat's the sort of pressure I would feel when reviewing a free copy of a game, but Path of Exile has no need for such shenanigans, it's a totally free ARPG with character customization so detailed that you will just go on the forums and find a build to use.\n\nPath of Exile is best summed up as Diablo on steroids, but then it gets banned for using performance-enhancing drugs and goes out and starts its own league, becoming even more successful than it was before.  Well, that's my opinion anyway, and I did get the game for free, but then again, so can you.","May 17","true","109.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","10","11","6","0"

In addition the sinister atmosphere and believable presentation of Wraeclast in combination with the deep gameplay mechanics (e.g. crafting & currency system and various leagues) create an immersive gaming experience.\n\nThe other large appeal of PoE is the end-game with its randomly created instances, which can be accessed from the map room. The replayability profits enormously from the randomly generated maps, with room for countless variation in map modifiers, increasing the difficulty with each added attribute.\n\nAnd for the masochistic gamers among us there is of course a hardcore mode. But upon the death of your hardcore character, he or she will be transferred into normal mode, so basically you can keep everything and continue your quest under non-hardcore rules. It should also be mentioned that there are several leagues in normal and hardcore mode, each of them providing different challenges and bonuses.\n\nThe only shortcoming of this game lies in the presentation and simplicity of the story. Although the different NPCs fill you in about the historic and current events in Wraeclast, no other means are used to bolster up the storyline.\n\nYou can read the pieced together history of Wraeclast on the following link.\n\nhttp://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/History_of_Wraeclast\n\nAll in all PoE is a great example for an online action role-playing game, on a free-to-play basis, that can be completed, enjoyed and continued without spending a penny.\n\nFun fact: While 60 percent of donors were in the $10 range, the ‘diamond tier’, in which someone commits to $1,000 or more, found 183 supporters.\n--\n\nMy rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:\n\n-	Atmosphere\n-	Combat & Controls\n-	Details\n-	Tactical gameplay\n-	Characters\n-	Story\n\nBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading:\n\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).\n--\n\nAtmosphere: S-Rank\n\n(The crack of bone, the spray of blood. Is there any sweeter music?)\n\nCombat & Controls: S-Rank\n\n(‘Shoot first, ask no questions.’ – Karui wisdom)\n\nDetails: S-Rank\n\n(A skill tree with 1350 skills that provide passive bonuses to your character. What more do you want?!)\n\nTactical gameplay: S-Rank\n\n(Good tacticians learn that consistency often trumps potential.)\n\nCharacters: B-Rank\n\nStory: C-Rank\n--\n\nTo conquer all achievements of Path of Exile, you will most likely spend several hundred hours, due to the very high complexity of the challenges. You have to play the single-player campaign with all seven characters at least once. In addition one of your characters has to reach level 90 on normal mode and another one level 90 on hardcore mode. Both require massive farming in the special map room.\n\nThe most interesting achievement is ‘All Ears’ and an appropriate guide can be found on the link below (thanks to Ionn).\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqhAF_tCmlPtdDZwREQ4ZldSYTRkN2toVWlpOGduUGc&usp=sharing#gid=0\n\nIn addition there are several achievements based on pure chance, like ‘Beginner’s Luck’, ‘Left to Chance’, ‘Well-Connected’ etc. Good luck with them and may the odds be ever in your favour.\n\nAchievement difficulty: 10 of 10\n\nCommon:\n- Singleplayer [+2]\n- Multiplayer [+1]\n- Teamwork [+1]\n\nSpecial:\n- All Ears [+1]\n- Capture the Flag [+1]\n- Diminishing Returns [+1]\n- Dream within a Dream [+1]\n- Eternal [+2]\n--\n\nPath of Exile (PC) – Online action role-playing game + Hack & Slash\n(Dark Fantasy) – 2013","March 28, 2014","true","267.5"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

Do you want a game where the only purchasable items in the microtransaction shop are visual effects and won't help a uber rich person ruin the game? How about a very fleshed out damage and defense system? And finally, do like RPG's? Well then, this Free-2-Play Action RPG is for you! You get the ability to create a build that could be super tanky, super DPS oriented, or a mixture of both. There are so many Unique (Legendary) items with interesting stats and mechanics that you can be an adept Spellcaster that has mastered Lightning attacks, or a Berserker that has invested points in Fire and can crush his enemies with a menacing maul! Or maybe a Ranger who could freeze her enemies using her Ice based arrows! Or you could be the support, the one who masters Auras and gives huge buffs to themself and their party members! You can call upon Ancient Totems to do your dirty work, or raise Zombies and Skeletons, and maybe even raise a Ghost of a fallen enemy or two! With this game, the ways you can dispatch enemies is almost limitless, and the fact that this game is F2P is awesome. Path of Exile is constantly updated, and every few months a new content patch is implemented, so you can expect this game to live for a long time to come. The only problems I have with it are the always online DRM. Desync has accounted for many of my deaths, some of them in Races, and that is a giant bummer. If we were able to rely on our internet as little as possible, then I think this game could get a lot better. Trading is also hit and miss, as there is no universal currency. You pick up currency items, which are, for the most part, Orbs and Scrolls, and trade them up and down, depending on how rare they are and what  you need. All Currency is usable in the way that resources in other games such as Minecraft are. A Alchemy Orb will upgrade a normal item to a rare, and thus is worth more than a Transmutaion Orb which only goes to a Blue, etc. Overall, I love this game and will continue to create new builds and characters. I'd give PoE a 8/10 on my scale.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT!!!\nAfter playing this game for hours, I am dropping the naive rating of 8/10 to 6.5/10, JUST FOR THE ♥♥♥♥ING LAG. ♥♥♥♥ the lag. This game would be 100% more fun if your very life didn't depend on the server's synchronization with your client. 80% of my game deaths have been from a sudden lag surge from 50~ ping to 1000 ping, which occur VERY OFTEN. I really wish they would add in an offline mode or just fix the desynchronization issues, because they REALLY just kill the game after good sessions of wrecking faces in.","April 16, 2014","true","382.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It offers a great amount of fun and challenge to players who are willing to spend time and effort in developing their character. There is a nice variety of classes to choose from and there are more than enough character slots available to try out different classes.\n\nPlayer's adventure starts in Normal mode where encounters are quite easy and balanced for new and veteran players. However things start getting rough as the player gradually goes through the acts (there are currently 3 acts, act 4 to be added soon) and difficulty levels (Cruel and Merciless). After completing the game in all available difficulties, players get to experience the many available maps, which are generally used for leveling and farming gear.\n\nThe most fun thing about PoE is the freedom of choice regarding character development and selection of passive, and active skills. PoE's passive skill tree is extremely detailed and comprehensive. Almost all action RPGs allow for stat and skill allocation based on a character's archetype. However this level of detail is absolutely amazing. It pretty much allows for creating any type of character (mage, rogue, warrior and etc) with any class. Additionally, players are free to acquire and utilize any available skill and subsequently upgrade these (Naturally as long as their basic stats allow it).\n\nOne thing about PoE that somewhat bothers me is the restriction on respecifying skill points. Players acquire some passive refund points as a reward for certain missions, additionally there are "Orbs of regret" that provide 1 passive refund point on use. However a full respec is virtually impossible except after any major patch release. So here's a word of advice to new players; plan ahead, spend your points wisely and don't be shy on reading the class forums. There is much useful knowledge to be gained that could save you a lot of time.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game and invite you to try it. After all, Path of Exile is a free game and it won't cost you anything to experience it. Do try to buy some in-game (fluff)items to support the developers if you get hooked! (they really deserve it).\n\n-Sinner","May 28, 2015","true","225.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","0"

But this game needs it. I installed it a long time ago when it released and played 10 hours or so and said "This game is to indepth for me" and moved on. I came back a few months ago after being burnt out on games like Diablo 3, Torchlight *insert any ARPG besides Grim dawn*. Path of Exile is extreme, its not noob friendly, its hard, builds take time, currency takes time to get, some builds are only viable upon certain rare items, that you either have to pray to RNG jesus for drops or trade for, and they are expensive. And some takes days if not weeks of farming to obtain. That being said, i've never found a game that offers more build variation and replayability than POE. Its a steep learning curve, but its incredibly worth it. This game destroys any other game in its genre. I've played 60+ hours, not sure what my steam time says atm, and have found only a few rares. In diablo 3, rares rain down upon the noobs. The sense of joy and accomplishment when you get a rare drop is almost drug like. This game has revolutionized the ARPG genre IMO. Its almost perfect.\n\nSo TLDR\n\nIf you can can be patient and look up youtube videos, and how to play guides (Since this game has almost zero tutorial on anything), learn from the forums and reddit, learn from your deaths, you will be rewarded with a incredibly well designed game with almost endless replay value, and a type of atmosphere i've never found in any other game of its kind.

I love the idea of the huge passive skill tree and Final Fantasy style active skill system. Instead of providing a linear active skill tree, skills in Path of Exile are itemized onto "Skill Gems". These gems can be activated by socketing them into your equipment. With the addition of a "Support-Gem", you can make your own unique skill. For example a simple fireball gem combined with "Multiple Projectiles" gem will turn your fireball skill into multiple fireballs. You can experiment and make your own active skills. There are thousands of combinations of skills and augmentations.\n\nThe most important thing -- the game is completely free! PoE offers ethical micro-transactions. There is no pay-to-win element. People can buy only cosmetic items for real-world money.\n\nIf you are going to give this game a try then remember to pre-plan your build or get ready to create new characters many times because "Math of Exile" punishes casual players.","November 26, 2013","true","605.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

I won't necessarily say this game is what Diablo 3 should have been, but it's certainly not difficult for me to imagine that most people would have been much happier if it had turned out exactly like PoE has. As it states in the last bullet point in the "Key Features" section: "You cannot gain gameplay advantage by spending real money in Path of Exile." This alone is such a massive gamechanger, and in a good way. I don't know about you, but I don't particularly tend to enjoy games which incorporate a "pay to win" mentality. Sure it isn't absolutely necessary to shell out any additional cash to be sucessful in D3, but just the fact that it is an option eventually helped drive me and many others away. Also, let's be honest - the loot system in D3 was (and still is) horrendous and only serves to further the agenda of Diablo 3's Real Money Auction House (which they are finally going to do away with early next year along with most likely bettering your chances of finding good gear). Go figure that! Anyway I digress, this isn't about D3. I only mention it because if you intend to play an ARPG on the PC, it's probably going to be one of these two. What you need to know is that PoE offers a truly rewarding and deep experience throughout. Character development boasts outstanding flexibility and viability of unique builds with a complex and rich skill-point system coupled with ability gems that allow you to specifically tailor any class in the game to be played the way you prefer. Of course some work better than others, but that's just how it goes. In summation, whether you are tired of D3 and looking for your ARPG fix elsewhere or just plain want a fun new game to play in this genre, do yourself a favor and click "Play Game." After all, who needs to be convinced by reviews from strangers when you can experience it yourself for free?","December 25, 2013","true","142.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

That said I was very relieved when I first played the beta to Path of Exile. Although the beta for POE was not as polished and the gameplay abit clunky compared to D3, when POE launched the final version they did so with "guns ablazing". The final version is slick, fluid and visually pleasing. And with the FF7 inspired "MATERIA" or "GEMS" as POE calls them I  find no reason to return to the D3 debauchery that many of us waited so long for. In the end I give POE an 8\10 only falling short a 9\10 because of how short the game is. But I highly recommend POE to anyone who is a fan of action RPG's and Diablo 2.","October 31, 2014","true","80.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

I don't think I can recommend this anymore after the 2.0 patch.\n\nBiggest complaints:\nGame risk/reward does not exist.  They destroyed player defense and offense, increased monster health and damage across the board, and made the high-end maps drop even less.  So you prepare yourself, make the tankiest / decent character you can, roll the hard mods and then what happens?  You get nothing valuable in the entire run, no map to replenish your stock and are worse off than before you started.\n\nTrading/economy is awful.  A literal hellhole.  There are players that scam people all day long for currency, work the market, and create monopolies all over the board; essentially, making it impossible for people to advance in the game depending on your build unless you give them all your currency.  Most of the time?  They're AFK!  Feels like a giant troll cesspool.\nThere is no auction place, the trading utilites are limited (like, one or two external sites that require additional external software to run in conjunction with PoE to properly operate)\n\nThe racing scene feels impossible to get into.  Not a twitch.tv streamer?  Good luck ever winning non-solo events!\n\nGameplay becomes stale.  After you create enough characters, look at enough builds on the forums, theorycraft your own, etc.  You realize something, you do the same thing for every character and only replace a few skills and links appropriately.  You have auto-casted defensive skills, spam one skill and run around while popping potions.  It's boring.  And this feels like the only way to be successful, not die and continue progressing.  And to really try something out of the norm, you better be rich or one of those people creating the monopoly or you'll just get stuck into a loop of poorly performing budget builds.\n\nLast point on negatives: build enabling uniques, div cards, etc. are all too rare still.  They added these div cards to increase diversity and make it possible to farm for unique items or otherwise, but it's still useless.  The individual cards are as rare as the item you're trying to find, making them pointless to exist in the first place!  Seemingly zero influence on the economy of items they exist for.\n\n\nAfter all that, the game does have good points, though.  It was a fun thousand hours for the majority.  It was worth the few hundred I donated to GGG.  I still play because it is still the best ARPG I've found.  If I had the opportunity to not try in the first place, I probably would take it.  It has been a very frustrating run with all the build nerfs, item nerfs, drop rate nerfs, and almost nothing in the opposite direction to make it feel like everything might not be getting worse.  They had a series called "Build of the week" which may as well have been "nerf of the week" since they destroyed any build that appeared in it in the patch following the video release.","September 9, 2015","false","406.7"," 107 of 196 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","107","196","7","3"

Diablo 2 was amazing, years past it's prime. Median mod brought life back to it as it aged. Diablo 3 was announced and everyone celebrated but as more and more came out about it gamer's hopes were dashed. All the brilliance that Blizzard North had created in the franchise, the things that made Diablo what it was, left the company with the people who originally made it. Thanks to some active, gamer-friendly, chatty developers in New Zealand, Path of Exile is as close as what would have been as crowdfunding and copyrights allow.\n\nPros: Free to play, reasonable system requirements, Diablo 3, wonderous innovations to the genre, very deep, infinite endgame, friendly chat-available developers, great events and leagues.\n\nCons: No classic Diablo story or characters, no offline/LAN play, complex trading economy, higher learning curve than more popular titles. No full tutorial.\n\nOther: BRUTAL sometimes offensive and very "mature" community in chat. Not a game, nor community for children or people with delicate sensibilities. Remember classic Battle.net? It's like that but ruder and smarter. I entirely prefer the "free speech" approach but some, maybe most, may not.\n\nI don't think there's anything Diablo 3 got right that Path of Exile got wrong. The only issue I personally have with the game is the complexity of attempting to trade for gear and currency items that I need. WHEN you play the game, make sure to pay close attention to what little instructional help it provides, because you don't get much.","January 20, 2014","true","748.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There is no pay to win mumbo jumbo in this one folks.\n\nI have found many hours of enjoyment in this game and highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys top down games like Diablo & Diablo 2. I mean, might as well give it a shot. It's free, and it's fun.\n\nI can't really seem to get into the story very well however. My main character is a witch.

The story itself just seems sort of boring. Anyway, none of that ♥♥♥♥ matters very much.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nupraptor1/recommended/238960/","nupraptor1","Azimuth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nupraptor1/","375 products in account","One of my main problems with the Action RPG genre is that they tend to be repetitive and boring, which is something that Path of Exile managed to surprise me with, especially so when you consider it's Free to Play (and not Pay to Win -all in game purchases are vanity purchases or stash spaces). The game can seem a little overwhelming at first with it's enormous and deeply complex skill tree and its myriad of skills. The combination of the two mean that you can make hundreds, even thousands of different combinations of characters and still find fresh and new builds.\n\nThe game content (storyline) itself is rather short with it being easily possible to move through the story on all three difficulties within 10-15 hours before reaching the endgame content known as Maps. Maps have endless possibilities and are actually item drops much like weapons and armour which can also be enchanted using the various orbs in the game which also double as the currency as Path of Exile relies on a barter trade system rather than gold which is an interesting solution to the currency sink/inflation balance issue that plagues many games which rely on an economy.\n\nPath of Exile also has multiple leagues running at once, there are standard and hardcore leagues which are the life-long leagues which will run till the servers shutdown for the game which have economies that never get reset. Along side the two long running leagues there are 'mutation' 4 month leagues which will add a flavour onto the standard gameplay model and also allow players to start in a fresh economy on a regular basis which gives newer players an equal chance to acquire wealth. Once these leagues come to an end the player's wealth will be moved to the respective parent league (standard/hardcore). Further more Path of Exile also challenges players in short term leagues known as races where players will compete to reach the highest level or the furtherest through the content with different modifiers on each short term race, from turbo enemies, to endless monster farming zones ranging anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 week. Players will earn points during these races which get added up over the course of a race season to earn valuable unique items as rewards.\n\nThat said, the thing that stopped me from playing the game was issues with ping spikes and lagging out, albeit most likely due to my connection, it seemed to be exacerbated by their lag compensation methods with consant desyncs and disconnects something I rarely suffer from in most other games I've played. That aside I would still strong recommend Path of Exile to anyone even remotely interested in ARPGs or looking for something new to play but don't want to spend much money.\n-----------------------------------------------------\ntl;dr\n-F2P not P2W.\n-Complex and deep. High replayability\n-Interesting economy.\n-Lag/internet issues seem to be more noticeable in this game compared to most other games.","April 6, 2014","true","326.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I never played diablo 2, but based on all the hype surrounding D3 I bought and played it. I couldnt get into it at all and got bored with it pretty fast. I saw this game got good reviews and was free so figured what the hell. Glad I did because it is great. For one thing, its completly free. No need to buy anything to progress in the game. I love the massive skill tree....it would have been incredible if they had an active skill tree like that as well. But on the flip side you have the skill orbs which adds an amazing amount of depth to the game. The further you go the more cool things you find that allow you to play around with the gem sockets to create some cool power effects. I love having cool spells to cast and the visuals in the game look great. No framerate drops or lagging ever.\n\nBeating up on bad guys never gets old and finding those rare peices of loot is always a joy. I have no idea what the story is about and dont really care. I just want to level up and expand on that massive skill tree while creating some killer gear.\n\nHighly recommend giving this game a look. You cant go wrong with free. This game could easily get retail value if they wanted. The folks at GGG should be commended for their efforts.

Most importantly Path of exile is one of the most fair free to play games available.  As such there really is no good reason to not to try it.\n\nGood/bad:\n+ One of the most fair free to play games\n+ Gameplay\n+ Variety of viable character builds\n+ Graphics\n+ Economy (from stability point of view)\n- Legacy items\n- More content would be appreciated (more coming but slowly)\n- Trading is difficult\n\nFull review:\nBefore going to actual gameplay I want to emphasize the fact how fair this game is for a free to play game. Usually free to play games are more or less pay to win games but Path of exile is almost complete exception to this. Only pay to win feature of Path of exile is that with real money player can buy more stash tabs to which store stuff that can be shared by player’s characters in the same league.\n\nThe extra stash tabs naturally do give minor advantage but this really starts to have an effect only when the player has played the game for hundreds of hours.  Thus the money grabbing is aimed at those players who already have played and enjoyed the game a lot and thus one could claim that these players ought to pay a little to support such an enjoyable game. Even then the payment is one time as those bought tabs are permanent. Most importantly however the extra stash tabs are definitely not mandatory even after hundreds of hours of gameplay.\n\nNext to the game itself. I am not expert when it comes to Action RPG games. As a prime example I never played Diablo 2 for which many people claim Path of exile to be better successor than Diablo 3 (which I haven’t played either). I would however claim Path of exile to be very good game. The main reason for this is the gameplay itself. It feels satiffying and the enemies are difficult but not too impossible. With many different viable builds in the game (more on this on nextt paragraph) can be replayed many times with different experience. with different characters (more on this later. As free game, you can easily go and verify this if you don't believe me.\n\nAnother good thing is the skill tree, which is identical for all the classes. (classes only have different starting positions in the tree). This allows creating very interesting builds for your characters and actually surprisingly many of them are viable. With viable I mean reaching the end game. Naturally the amount of end game builds is bit smaller but even it is surprisingly large (especially according to what I have heard to be the case in other action RPG games. The different builds also seem to relatively balanced except temporary anomalies created by game updates. These are fixed usually sooner or later.\n\nGraphics are great which is always nice. The minimum graphical settings in this game are however quite high so low end PC owners may be in need of upgrade for playing this game (but as free game, try before upgrading)\n\nAs he last notable good thing (writing more would make this review way too long) I am going to mention economy. All I can personally say is that it seems to work. Why this is important is that I have heard that in many other RPG games the economy does not work but instead for example the inflation of prices becomes ridiculous and starts to affect the game negatively.\n\n<The complaints about desynchronisation were here. Now GGG has finally introduced lockstep mode --> By default hit and movement detection works now like in MOBA's and RTS games, which is much much better than the original implementation. Desycnhronization issues are now problem only for those living really far from servers>\n\nThe main flaw of the game is legacy items in permanent leagues. Legacy items are items that are no longer obtainable other than by trading from other players who already own them (with extremely high price of course). Unfortunately most of the legacy items were created by weakening the normally obtainable versions of these items. As result people who have these legacy versions are in practice equipped with items that are too powerful (balance wise) and obtaining these items is difficult for new players.Legacy items are not a problem in temporary leagues but some people like myself who would like to play in permanent leagues are forced to choose between two bad options: living with legacy items or playing temporary leagues.\n\nSecond problem of Path of exile is lack story content. At the time of writing this the game has 4 chapters, which player has to pass in three difficulties before the "end game". More acts are coming but the progress is painfully slow. It should be noted that the end game is well done and that lessens this problem. When 5th chapter comes I will consider the amount of content acceptable.\n\nThird problem is that trading is impractical. The intended way to sell or buy items happens through trade chat, which is horribly flooded and yet very likely the people who would be willing to sell or buy what you want are not there when you are. There however are for example third party websites for listing items which helps a lot but GGG should really do something to fix this in-game.\n\nTo summarize. The game definitely has some flaws but the good sides very clearly overcome these problems. As a very fair free to play game there is therefore no reason for not trying this game.","January 17, 2015","true","803.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

That is already a problem itself, but the game has a HUGE problem of desync. You can't move when you are surrounded by mobs or you may risk a desync.\nYou can't use movement skills when near corners or you may risk a desync. That gets really annoying and completely remove some possible builds of the game. Why? You can't go glass cannon and rely in your skill to stay alive when the server can just say it didn't like what you were doing and throw you back 2 secs in the past, a place that now is surrounded by enemies.\n\nThere's no "class". Every character can use all items and skills in the game. In fact skills are actual gems, that you equip in items. Nice idea... but the characters lose identity. Instead of picking the character they should allow you to make your own customization.\n\nAnd what is worse.\nThe game has a clean HUD, BUT it has 0 notification. miss, damage taken, damage done or whatever. You have 0 notifications if your character that is swinging the weapon in the air is missing, got desynced or is just out of range.\nFor what i googled people were complaining since release but the devs want to keep the game "clean". Instead of allowing the player to turn notification on and off, they play the game "daddy know better" and make a game with alot of potential into something that you end with mixed feelings about.\n\nTL:DR The game is good, but there's issues that will make you made. At lower difficulties you will not notice, but later on you will feel and hate it, ALOT.\n\nEdit: I forgot a important point.\nBack into the "no class" thing. While it looks nice and all, it kills melee characters. Why? Ranged characters can have the same armor, life, evasion and damage that you while being ranged, there's no mechanic that a melee character can do that one ranged can't do. Add that with Monsters that have skills that kite, blind, freeze, release cloud of poison/fire/ice/lightning or even, in most of the bosses, oneshot your character there's NO reason to play a melee character unless you want to prove something. And i'm serious. Playing melee is at least 3x harder than a ranged character.\nAnd again the devs play the "daddy know better" game.","July 28, 2015","true","320.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

If you like ARPG, Path of Exile is the must play to end all must plays.\n\nPros\nEconomic design is intricate and thriving\nSkill and character progression has depth beyond measure\nArt, sound, and animation is beautiful\nCustomizable player housing\nPerfect league and ladder design\nFrequent large content updates\nTrue free to play, no pay walls period\n\nCons\nMy singular issue with the game is how anticheat is handled. The methods used are extremely overbearing. All actions are controlled by a prediction system at the server level, and it is frequently confused. The result feels like lag but is actually the server forcing erronious corrections on your client. This has a large negative impact on the game.\n\nOverall, 9/10. If they rethought and redesigned their anticheat system it would be 11/10.\n\nVersion 2.0 Edit:\n\nThought I'd update this and say they have now greatly improved, if not entirely fixed my concerns with the predictive server syncing. They've improved this from a few different angles. Firstly they've diversified their datacenter locations so you're much more likely to be on a low latency server. Secondly they've added a new primary data sync mode called lockstep which does not desync but only works well on low latency connections. Thirdly they've improved the overall responsiveness and accuracy of the predictive sync mode for high latency players. I was not the only one who felt the old predictive mode stifled this game's quality feel. They've heard our concerns and went to incredible lengths to do right for us. Game is now a serious, solid 11/10.","October 21, 2014","true","236.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

It does have a rather classical feel, though. Actually, this is the only other game which gave me that Diablo II feeling.

Despite this the developers are maintaining a range of dedicated servers so even though you're forced to play online (just like D3), more people are able to have a decent online experience (they're even running an Australian server - something Blizzard has never bothered to do). In terms of visuals PoE might lack some polish, but it's refreshing to see the return of a gritty art style in a dark universe that isn't compromised so that more kiddies are able to play.\n\nAs it stands PoE is definitely worth a try if you're into dungeon crawlers or just looking for a quick bash at multiplayer with friends.","October 23, 2013","true","4.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

Had the most fun I've ever had in a game with a build (Facebreaker Cyclone) which actually 'caused desync quite a bit and it didn't irritated me at all to be honest. The gem system is really worked out well and the replay value of endgame is amazingly high. Don't expect to see other mobs or other maps a lot, but expect to see dangerous and deadly combinations of these two a lot if you wan't to risk it!

This game suffers from some of the worst RNG issues i've ever seen, and generally is designed to cater to the super hardcore element.\n\nThe cosmetic microtransactions which fund the game are extremely expensive however there is no pay to win, unless you count buying extra stash space which to be honest is kind of necessary for any serious player; expect to dump $50-$100 on stash tabs if you get sucked into this game just to have room for your basic needs. The amount of storage space you get for free is rather pitiful; my advice is to wait for a stash tab bundle sale as they seem to happen on average once a month.\n\nThe biggest thing holding this game back is the antiquated trade system. Because of the bad RNG issue the only way to truely progress into end game is to trade for the things you need, if you try and play only self found you will get no where in end game very slowly. The developer promissed a robust trade system through their website back in beta but have so far failed to deliver and don't seem to have it as a development priority; the game suffers immensely because of this.\n\nI'd recommend POE If you were a fan of diablo 2 and thought diablo 3 was terrible, you will probably enjoy this game.

The player character is foisted onto the terrible and foreign land of Wraeclast, an exile fighting all manner of monsters to survive.  Smash through waves of giant critters, evil demons, vile undead, and even worse in order to accumulate loot, power, and prestige.  It is the type of game that, at its core, is as simple as pointing and clicking on bad guys, yet is nuanced enough to be utterly compelling.  If you've ever fallen into a "just one more level" trap with a game and then realized that you'd been playing far too long, then you know the allure of Path of Exile.\n\nCast as a game "for hardcore gamers, by hardcore gamers" by developer Grinding Gear Games (GGG), the gameplay captures the same compelling level of complexity that made Diablo 2 and Torchlight worth playing long after release, and is still accessible enough for newcomers to enjoy and find immersive.  The passive point tree is a massive web of incremental upgrades, occasionally accumulating into a great big power up.  Touching on those big power-ups captures the feeling of climbing a mountain, reaching the peak, and beholding your new plateau.  Similarly, the power gem system creates as much complexity or simplicity as a player wants, combining active abilities and supporting powers to customize your might in whatever fashion you want.\n\nIn all, the combination of the passive power web and the ability gems borrow from Final Fantasy X and VIII, respectively, and take what appears to be just another Diablo clone at first glance and makes the game its own.  Path of Exile is fresh while also familiar.\n\nThe microtransaction model requires some reassurance.  Most games featuring microtransactions are on a spectrum of abusiveness from "alleviation of grind" to "pay to win".  When GGG advertises Path of Exile as a truly free game to play and enjoy, they mean it.  Microtransactions will only buy cosmetic changes, stash expansions (the base amount is entirely adequate, even for a mild-to-moderate pack rat), and a sort of "tip jar" supporter feature that adds bling to forum titles and avatars.\n\n(As a brief aside, Athene makes an interesting case that this game is in fact pay-to-win in the sense that players on the bleeding-edge of the game utilize grey market transactions to buy top-notch gear in order to side-step the grind.  His commentary is easily searched on YouTube.  It is my opinion that casual enthusiasts -- that is to say, anyone except for the extreme hardcore ladder-ranking players -- need not deal with shady websites in order to play the game for what it is.)\n\nPath of Exile is truly best in breed.  If you enjoy Action RPGs, or have ever enjoyed one before, then you lose nothing by giving this game a shot.","February 12, 2014","true","061.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

If you love the Diablo game but weren't crazy about Diablo 3, I'd highly recommend checking this game out if you haven't already.\n\nPros\n- The amount of customization and ways you can tweak your powers are limitless.  Whole builds can be made around single unique items that change your powers in interesting ways.\n- Solid story and interesting world.\n- Uses FF7 Materia system for powers\n- Has really solid hardcore play for those who hate themselves (me)\n- Powers fit the mood, no sparkly effect or silly sounds.\n- Free!\n- Purchase amounts are fair and are usable/tradable between characters.\n\nCons\n- Skill tree can be off-putting for new players, you may have to look up some builds on the internet\n- Actual gameplay can get repetative after a while, most of the fun is in building cool characters and trying to survive\n- Bosses can be ruthless if you're not prepared, you can be easily carving your way through minions then get 1 shot by a unique boss (build defense and offense)\n\nOverall I'd say the game's greatest asset is how much customization you can do in building and leveling characters.

The game has a slow start (though that's one of the issues being addressed in today's expansion) but once the combination of skills and variety of environments becomes apparent it really comes into its own.\n\nThe skill tree is huge (really, absolutely massive) and offers countless build customisation options, which is in complete contrast to (e.g.) Diablo 3. You can combine skill gems to give your skills different effects -- sort of like runes in D3, but much deeper. I enjoy the loot and itemisation much more than other games in the genre too because of the possibility of crafting and improving any 'trash' item that drops.\n\nThe replayability is fantastic. New 'challenge leagues' are launched every few months which offer the option of an economy reset and always change the game in interesting ways. They also usually adjust the balance of the game (it can be a bit flavour-of-the-month-ish) regularly which means that different builds are enticing, and since builds play very differently this also helps replayability.\n\nThen there's 'races' - short and challenging events of between 12 mins and three hours which offer a unique challenge and a nice way to get into competitive online gaming in a non-PvP setting. Race seasons run for six weeks or so every few months, with several events per day and unique rewards.\n\nPoE is free-to-play but never pay-to-win.

It's makes the FFXII licence board look like a little plate of NOTHING.\n\nYou got so many option on this tree, you could create a Witch that hacks people with axes and swords.\n\nOr an big, strong and scary marauder that walk around casting fireballs with a wand that's only the size of his fingers.\n\nThat is what makes this game so awesome, you can do whatever you want.\nWant a fire casting and teleporting necromancer that has an army of dead at his command? Go for it, works just fine.\n\nAnd never forget to ask in the general chat for advice... Though sometimes you can get some.. odd answers.\n\nI won't say to much, cuz that's not how i do.\n\nKnow this.. The game might be slow in the beginning, but when you reach the mid to higher levels... This turn into a crash fest of chopping, freezing, burning and exploding every foul dark creatures that stand in your way.\nBut never let your guard down... Anything can kill you if you're not carefull.\n\n*Edit: They also gradually add more content to the game, Skills, areas, expansions, visual effects etc.\n\nAll i gotta say is i really think this game is awesome and that it's totally free, yet It's got better quality gameplay than most games that cost over 20 Euro to play.","June 16, 2014","true","432.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I spent the weekend I got it playing it, instead of doing work I had intended to do.\n\nThis is an ARPG, and as such, there's not a whole lot of innovation when it comes to the actualy gameplay.  Overhead view, point a spam your mousebutton, pick up loot.  This isn't to say it doesn't do this well, as I found the experience to be enjoyable.  Intuitive controls, good challenge level (i.e., I'm not throwing my mouse in frustration of how hard it is, but I do sometimes have to think tactically, and retreat to defeat the horde against me).\n\nWhere this game earns its points is in its passive skill tree, it's gem-based skills (think materia from FFVII), and its in-game economy.\n\nThe passive skill tree can be a little overwhelming at first, since there is a LOT.  Once you spend a little time perusing it, and understanding how it works, it can start to seem kind of dull (how many times can you get a +10 to dex before you're looking for a little more, though there are other nodes to work with!).  Then, it hits you.  I can completely customize this character, and how it plays.  Want to be a duel-weilding lighning specialist?  Can do.  Fire-based summoner?  Alright, we can do that.  Want to just TANK with a really big axe?  We can do that, too.  The possibilities for different builds are bountiful.\nCombine the skill tree with experience-gaining leveling skill orbs that can be socketed into items, and you have a great combination for customization.\n\nThe economy is another place where the devs took a different route than many others.  Money doesn't exist in this game.  Instead, you have barter system.  Normal items give you pieces of Wisdom scrolls (read: identify item), which eventually form into a whole scroll.  Whole scrolls also drop as loot, so this isn't your only means of ID'g an item.  Magical itmes might be worth augmentation shards, or transmutation shards, or other items.  While there is a formula to what the vendors give in exchange for what, it does teach you to think about loot grabs differently than other games.  In Diablo, or Torchlight for example, eventually normal items got left behind for magical, and even those eventaully weren't worth the inventory space.  In PoE, every item gets looked at individually.  Are you in need of ID scrolls?  Start picking up low-space normals.  Are you looking for a specific socket pattern for a weapon you want to try to craft?  Each item could be that thing you want!  Even that normal sword that, in other ARPGs would get left behind!  I personally found this to be a refreshing change of pace.\nEven the meta-economy gets a little more interesting with no money.  What exactly is that unique piece of armor worth to you?\n\nThe best part of this game is its price.  Free.  And actually FREE.  Not, "free to sign up, but in order to beat this boss you need to spend $5 to get this one item you will only use once."  GGG has made a commitment to makig this game truly free.  While there are microtransactions available, they are purely cosmetic, offer no advantage, and are completely voluntary.  I am more likely to spend money on these, because they aren't forced on me, than I am any "need to buy to progress" stuff.  If you are enjoying the game, I suggest grabbing some of this as it helps the devs continue to make great games, and you get nifty effects for your character (like flaming footprints, or glowing blue weapons!)\n\nI haven't done any parties or PvP yet, so I can't comment on those mechanics, but I plan to check those out a little more as the time goes on.\n\nSo far, great game.

Let's get started\n\nI'd like to preface this review by saying that This Game Is Free. You've got nothing to lose by installing it.\n\n"Path of Exile" is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (I could have said "MMO RPG" but I sound like a legitimate game critic when I say it like that) Which I'm sure is a genre that we've all had our experiences in (Runescape, Rift Ect.) I have to say out of all the games I've played in this genre, this one is done very well. The mechanics are commendable but not overly different, the storyline and variation of the missions, average. The graphics aren't fantastic, but hey, it's a free game. What do you expect? I'm yet to try out the Co-op (Mainly because I have a serious lack of friends) But the duelling system is fairly balanced and fair and overall, games like this are just generally addicting\n\nNow, I know your probably losing interest because this is sounding like every other MMO RPG but hold on, I'm getting to the good stuff\n\nThe best thing about this game is easily the passive skill tree. I know that sounds underwhelming but trust me, It could take days to plot a good path through this thing, I'm just trying to guess which direction I should head but in reality, this skill tree is so big it doesn't even fit on my computer screen. It's taken me 10 hours to figure out how the class and items work together (shown directly below.)\n\nForgive me if I’ve gotten this wrong, I've only played through the first act as a witch (Yeah, I'm still a noob)\n\nI like to think of the class system as a colour wheel. There are 3 primary classes (one focused on intelligence, one on strength and one on dexterity) and 3 secondary classes, each one composed of 2 others (The duellist focuses on Strength and dexterity, the cleric focuses on strength and intelligence and the thief focuses on dexterity and intelligence.) These different classes all dictate where you start on the passive skill tree, shaped like a colour wheel. Most of the powerful items are clearly designed for a certain class as the all require a combination of the three traits (Intelligence, strength and dexterity) One that only requires intelligence is obviously designed for the person who is starts in the middle of the "Intelligence" area in the passive skill tree Whereas an item that requires dexterity and strength is made for the class which is a combo of dexterity and strength.\n\nWow, that probably confused the F*ck out of you guys, it's really difficult to explain, it's so complex you could spend hours researching it.\n\nThe items all have combinations of 3 different traits (Wow, the developers must've really liked the number 3!) Evasion, energy shield and amour. Evasion determines how likely you are to dodge an attack, Amour determines how much of the damage is block and energy shield reminds me a lot of the "overshield" from Halo or Mass Effect. It exists and if attacked, the energy shield is drained rather than your health. When the energy shield is depleted, you will have no defences other than your amour and evasion skills. The energy shield will restore after a period of not being attacked. However, your health will regenerate very slowly regardless of which items you wear. Each of the traits the amour has (Evasion, Amour and Energy shield) Link up to the traits the class has (Dexterity for Evasion, Amour for strength and Energy shield for intelligence) This is not a set rule but most items will have a requirement to meet.\n\nAre you still following me? If you're not, it's okay. Even If I confused you, you’re probably noticing how in-depth this game is.\n\nFinally, slots of amour have different coloured gem slots. There are three different coloured gems (So many ♥♥♥♥ING THREES!) And 3 different coloured gems (AHHHHHHH) which all link up to the 3 traits of the classes (I think I'm developing a "3" fetish) The red gems are usually for Melee combat, the green ones are for archery and the blue ones for magic. Some monsters resist certain types of these abilities, some resist fire, frost or lightning. Some monsters also can summon smaller units, perform similar abilities to what the player can perform and some monsters have energy shields.\n\nOkay, I'm done. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Click the like button if you did. I swear, it took ages to write this out and last review I did, not a single person liked it :(. I strongly recommend this game for all people who love a good MMO RPG. I would love to have one of my close friend (Jacob, Brodie, Dom, Josh, Lachlan, Sam, I'm looking at you guys.) to pick up this game so that I wouldn't have to continue this crazily confusing experience alone.\n\nAll in all, because it's a free game I'm giving it an 8.5/10","April 27, 2014","true","42.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

Path of Exile is a true marvel in its approach and achievement. Everything in the game is solid and simple but with a lot of its own ideas to make it different from most other ARPGs. From the colossal sized skill tree and open ended character building to skill gems and support gems and to the land of Wraeclast itself, it’s a unique enough experience that I haven’t encountered anything quite like Path of Exile before. Its non-standard approach is a nice breather from typical tropes of ARPGs and the fact that it works so well is a great achievement.  The game not only looks great but its sound design and overall ambiance is dark and dreary and very fitting of the setting. The story and lore of Wraeclast is quite disturbing and is quite interesting to unravel although, like most ARPGs its story is more akin to a movie rather than a true role-playing experience, where you make hard decisions and live out consequences of those choices. The game also suffers a bit with regards to its own character system, in that each character can potentially be the same, it loses its replay-ability a bit when compared to other ARPGs where characters are a class unto themselves with their own unique skills and spells and the skill tree in general will take a lot of careful planning and getting used to. Overall the experience of Path of Exile is solid and fun with the most frustration coming from the fact that it is an online game and with that comes some technical issues such as lag and issues from other players themselves. Personally, I would have gladly had paid whatever the asking price for this game, for it to be single player and online as optional. As a free-to-play title it does come with its own store which thankfully I can report does not have any content within it that feels like it has to be purchased in order to enjoy the game. Items in the are generally either cosmetic items, purely for looks or things like stash or character expansions, but they give you so many to start out with that these won’t feel like immediate needs or purchases ever. Path of Exile is a great ARPG, everyone can enjoy this game and it is simple and easy to get into and play and it at least offers 20+ of content for a first time through the entire game and it’s all completely free without any extra game content being behind a paywall.\n\n-Double Thumbs up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork","November 24, 2013","true","33.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","3"

Yes, the game is a really hard at the next difficulty however game is not that impossible to finish when we play with friends or some people on servers. We can play on regular mode where we dont lose our items and experience we dont lose that much after our death. Hardcore its much harder because if you die your char placed in the regular mode. We have to choose one of the seven classes like such as duelist, witch, ranger, templar, marauder, schadow and scion. All of this classes use different skills. This game have a really huge skill tree and when we got new level they are give us a points which we can put to various abilities like a faster HP and MP regeneration,an  damage to various weapons and magic. The last thing is a gems thatsthats we can find at our path and use at the armors or weapons to be more effective.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanduar/recommended/238960/","Zanduar","Zengineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanduar/","480 products in account","Path of Exile is a truly free to play dungeon crawler that will make someone watching a video clip think it is from the "Diablo" series. It isn't Diablo but it is in my opinion a better game than the Diablo series. There are six playable characters at the start and once the game has been beaten once and a side mission at the end of the game (that is along the required walking path but is optional) unlocks the seventh class.\n\nAll skills are based on gems that are tied to either Intelligence (Blue), Strength (Red), or Dexterity (Green). While gems of a certain color do highly favor one syle of gameplay (red = melee attacks most of the time) their are exceptions such as a red gem unlocking a "Totem", basically a distraction device skill. Items have sockets to place the gems in. While you can use more than 8 skills, the UI sets up the bindable skill keys to Mouse Left Click, Mouse Middle Click, Mouse Right Click, Q, W, E, R, T keys. So when playing 8 skills are generally available with Mouse Left Click usually being bound to a hybrid of basic weapon melee attack and movement. Gems level up from the same experience your character gains. The gems just level up at different rates from your character class. The gems also have the same type of restrictions that items do such as minimum level and minimum stats (intelligence, strength, and dexterity) in order to equip them. This means that you could play as a Witch (Pure intelligence character build) and socket a red gem for a skill you'll never use. The gem will gain levels but it would be a better choice to stash the red gem for another character to use.\n\nGems/skills are modified by the extensive passive leveling system. Each level up and some quests give points to follow along the giant path available to you. The leveling "board" for lack of a better term is the same for all characters but different characters start at different places on the board. Here is a link for the seventh class, the Scion, who starts in the very middle of the board. https://poebuilder.com/character/AAAAAgAA\n\nThe most interesting part of this game is that it does not have gold as a currency. There are something like 40 different currency items but they are acquired by trading in equipment. So everything you sell will come back as a currency that benefits in game as well as allowing trading with other players to be a lot more varied. Static prices don't really exist and almost all items that can be bought from NPCs are there for a specific reason.\n\nThis leads to the one flaw in the game, inventory management. Trading with NPC vendors requires knowing some "recipes", certain combinations of items that give back the best payment. You start the game with 4 pages in your cross-character "stash" and the same inventory size for every character. There is no increasing character inventory size. You can increase your stash size but that does cost real life money. A 4 page stash means making stockpiles to fulfill recipe requirements and frequently selling. With more tabs a user could get better returns on their equipment. I'd like more stash pages but the game doesn't require having 4 to be a good player. It just severally restricts how many items you can horde. Hording wouldn't be a problem if there was any type of inventory sorting but there is not. Unfortunately at latter game interverals art assets get reused so it can be difficult to tell between the low level item you want to trade versus the high level item you've been saving.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend the game. Just be sure to learn the economic system of the game before you start playing it.","November 18, 2014","true","112.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_tetris/recommended/238960/","blue_tetris","yellow_tetris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_tetris/","94 products in account","Henk Lostsword isn't your average exile.  He's on a path.  Is he on a path of good or of bad?  Well, that's up to you.\n\nIt's easy to criticize this game for what it is not.  It's not Diablo, despite what others may tell you, and the differences can be a letdown to some.  It's not a first-person shooter, nor is it a side-scrolling beat 'em up.  It's not particularly novel in its handling of top down, hack-slash-and-loot gameplay.  It's not an episode of "Cheers" re-recorded on VHS with a two minute portion of "Scarecrow and Mrs. King" still left at the beginning that you have to wait through.  It's not a warm buttered scone on a Tuesday morning.  What the game is, is a solid beefsome electronic hoppy experience with a bold hearty finish and a wide variety of gameplay options to delight gamers of any age group or gender identity.\n\nYou play as one of two types of mystical beings from the Immortal Cube, a land beyond time and space where immaterial aberrations sleep until it is their time to manifest as Daemons in the mortal realm.  One playable Daemon type is the Whiteshadow, who benefits from high Space and low Time; a natural healer and tank, who pulls damage and watches over the party's HP during critical combat encounters.  The other playable Dragoon is Melissa: She's a hacker from a near-future Australia, during a cyberwar that threatens to destroy both Western and Asian infrastructure.  Exiled from her home country as the world is divided into two key factions, she takes refuge on a series of interconnected rogue naval vessels in international waters and plans her digital assault from her "pirate flotilla".\n\nSo here's the deal: Each piece of equipment that the party obtains has "battle magic slots", refered to in the game's media as BMS.  Each BMS lets you assign a new battle magic to your mech.  Some of the slots are linked together, allowing for Fusion Magic and other neat ways to upgrade your Core Stats.  Coming up with creative ways to augment and empower your spells is critical to your success, as the game's many different challenges diminish the successes of raw number stacking.  Adaptation Gems, when slotted in the correct gear, can make this task easier, by automatically mutating your battle magic to the necessary Color that will deal the most damage.  I had the most fun using Adaptation Gems and series of low level Fusions, linked together so I didn't have to worry about picking which magic to use.  This allowed me to focus on the dodge and roll techniques crucial to the game's action.  But there's definitely a play style for the calculating tacticians, too, where deliberate decision-making and pre-battle planning can give your mech an unbeatable advantage.\n\nGet this ♥♥♥♥:\n\nThe game's level pacing is excellent.  Every fifteen to thirty minutes of gameplay, you increase in level and get to add a new Spirit Sphere to your Mana Web.  Every four of those causes one of your Core Stats to increment, allowing you to hold a new piece of gear associated with that stat.  What starts as a simple game becomes intriguingly complex after just a few hours of gameplay, and those decisions are neatly folded into your gameplay before other considerations arise later on.  But if you make a bad choice early on, don't fret!  Take-Em-Bax, a special Game Token provided in the in-game store, allows you to reassign any one skill that you regret assigning.  Take-Em-Bax cost a mere $0.75 per skill, allowing you to build a fresh new character at level 100 for about $8.  The cosmetics available in the store, however, have price tags that are a little too lofty for my liking.  You Rockafellers out there may disagree.\n\nThe hacking minigame still needs work, as does the lockpicking drudgery (I found myself using triangle to "skip action sequence" at least five separate times), but the other aspects of gameplay fall neatly into place without disrupting the continuous "movie-like" quality of the game.  While not the most visually-stunning game of 2014, it has the best audio by far and has committed much of its budget to its all-star cast, including Joan Jett voicing one of the game's more memorable NPCs.\n\nAll things considered, I give this game 500 value points for art, 800 for gameplay, and another 150 bonus, and 15 points.  Pick this game up if you have some wealth, ♥♥♥♥o.  If not, why not get paid already?  People respect you and they respect your talents.  Just apply what you do here to your career, to your family, to everything you do.  You are important.  But you sell yourself short too often--we all see it.\n\nHow do you know they won't hire you if you don't try?  Just put out the application and say "♥♥♥♥ it" if it doesn't pan out.  You do this five or ten times, you're getting hired somewhere.  No one lands that dream job first thing.  The baby boomer's ideal of the American dream is over.  Jobs are scarce, so learn to make your goals a little more realistic.  Start reasonable and work your way up.  Before you know it, you've got $30 in your pocket--and that's enough to get started on your very own Path\n\nof Exile.","March 12, 2014","true","58.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

No pay-to-win BS, either; all you can buy are cosmetic effects for spells and equipment, more stash space for hoarding items, and character slots. Most people won't even need to buy the latter, though, because you start with 24 slots for free. Endless character builds to try out, regular content updates and free expansions planned, on-going series of race events where you can compete and earn limited edition prizes... If you're a fan of the genre, there's no reason not to be playing this.\n\nMy only complaint with this game is the de-sync. They had to make the game always-online to prevent cheating, but then to accomodate the fast-paced, highly reactive and tactical combat, they're constantly syncing game state between your client and the server... Which, when their servers are overloaded by the huge influx of players on Steam, can often mean rubber-banding or lag in performing actions. It's most frustrating when playing hardcore, and a half-second delay can be the difference between life and death. They've been working hard to alleviate such problems, so hopefully they can make it better soon.","November 25, 2013","true","401.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

After weighing all the pros and cons I have to "not recommend" this game in the end. Anyway, let's get into some details.\n\nARPGs are something I love to spend countless hours in. I love the grind and getting those sweet loot drops and then repeating this process over and over again until every slot is GG/BiS gear. I love trying different builds and min/maxing my stats as much as possible. All of this is possible in PoE. In fact, PoE is one of the most hardcore ARPGs out there. Many people have compared it favorably to D2. The build diversity in this game is absolutely insane due to the passive tree and skill gems, along with how these skill gems interact with each other by linking them in armor and weapons. If you want depth you absolutely will find it in this game - in fact at first I was quite overwhelmed. For example, when discussing "crits" in this game you need to keep in mind the difference between local critical chance on weapon attacks, critical chance on spells, global critical chance, and critical damage multipliers (which I guess can be both local and global and can either be on attacks and/or spells). It is not like D3 in which critical chance is a flat additive percentage for everything. Anyway, this is only one example. The game is very nuanced and Google is your best friend if you don't understand something.\n\nSo yeah, I love all the depth in the game, so why am I not recommending this? Simple. The endgame trading is absolutely horrendous. I reached the beginning of endgame (level 70) and I should just grind low level maps or areas like merciless Dried Lake for loot and currency. Well...that doesn't really work. In order to get the best items for your build you NEED to trade. But since there's no gold in the game it's difficult to judge whether an item is worth 1 Chaos or 2 Chaos or whatever other currency. This is especially true for new players like me who want to get started in trading but the entire buisness is already monopolized by the streamers and other "pro players". The loot drops are terrible - the chance of finding a rare or unique that's worth a few Chaos or Exalted is extremely low. Maybe if you do a pure MF build it'll be better, but my point is, I just want to use my build and farm enemies and find good endgame gear. There would be no point in build diversity if you have to use a MF build just to have a chance of finding some BiS stuff.\n\nSo here I am, at endgame with a few Chaos orbs and zero Exalted. I want to buy some items by using poe.trade (community trade site) but most people are not online and/or they are fake accounts. Using trade chat is a joke - just full of spammers and people trying to lowball you for profit. And how am I suppose to sell anything? Use poe.trade? Set up a shop on the forums? Very tedious and troublesome because not only do I have to jump through hoops to do it, there's no gurantee anyone will buy my stuff or offer fair prices. I want to play an ARPG not "trade simulator extreme edition".\n\ntl;dr - The biggest turn off for me is the endgame trading. It's absolutely garbage and DAS (dumb as ♥♥♥♥). The rest of the game is quite good and I did enjoy it. But we all know for games like this the endgame will either make or break the game. I hope the developers will add in a streamlined in-game trading system in the near future, but until then, I will not be coming back.","December 2, 2015","false","54.2"," 71 of 134 people (53%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","53","71","134","8","12"

I'm sure you'll find the same praise in most of the Steam and online reviews.  However, I cannot wholly recommend the game because of the continuous problems with lag or as the community often refers to it:  desync.  No, it's not a problem with my computer or connection.  It's widespread and encountered often.  I've lost 2 hardcore characters to desync; it's not fun when all the time you invested into your character is thrown away due to lag.  The problem is that everything has to run online through their server (no offline play), and due to how well they developed the game, there are too many people playing on the server resources currently in place.  If they made it so that you could play a character offline or seriously revamped the network code and server resources, this would be a perfect game.  In its current state, as good as the game is, I find it too frustrating to consistently enjoy.  The devs are very good about listening to the community and improving/updating the game, so hopefully it's only a matter of time before the desync issues are fixed.","December 15, 2013","false","18.4"," 389 of 751 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","389","751","3","11"

Real "Free to play", forgot pay to win stuff. After months of playing i can assure you it is the best action RPG i have ever played. A lot of people will compare it with Diablo but for me its much more. First of all game have amazing community and developers who are patching and fixing all issues on a regular base. To be honest i never saw a company ready to listen the community.\n\nBefore you start playing for real you should definitely register at official forums, check out guides about game mechanics, builds and gameplay tips. You should also drop a look at offical forum shops for gear trade threads, deals between players.\n\nOne thing that makes this game unique is customization. Passive and active skills can be combined in thousand different ways to make your character exactly as you want him to be, no strict classes. Every single active skill can be modified to work the way you want and match your passive skill setup.\n\nSince there is no standard currency like gold or cash, developers decided to implement very interesting currency type - orbs, many different orbs. Each orb type have its primary use for crafting gear mods, thats the main reason people started to use them as a currency.\n\nAfter great community and customization options i would like to point out trade and bargain as a second most important thing in Path Of Exile. To gear up your character fast and build immortal god of hack and slash you should follow the trade chat and official forum trade threads, learn how to buy and sell, dont hesitate to bargain and earn profit. Work on your bargain skills and you will progress much faster.\n\nI could really say a lot about it since game content is huge and nicely polished. These first few lines i mentioned was something that really impressed me. Its something that makes a difference between huge, deep games like this one that are obviously made for action RPG community and all other games released exclusivley for building up the company profit.\n\nThis is one of those games made for community. From gamers for gamers\n\nHave fun!","December 31, 2013","true","45.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However...\n\nThe always-online aspect of this game is not so great, though. Rubberbanding is fairly consistent, even with a low ping. The game itself is the gatekeeper for your fun, dictating how viable you are by not only gear drops, but what skills you have access to. The time-sink basis of the game is a bit of a turn off. Expect to carefully plan a character and have it nerfed to bejesus, thereby ending your character as many have been so vocal about online, since resetting a character's skills is basically impossible. The currency system favors NPCs at every level, and the loot system is a free-for-all grabfest, so play with people you trust.\n\nIf you play this game, play with a group. Play with friends. Solo I can imagine is a nightmare considering how tempermental drops can be, but crushing things in a group and splitting loot means there's fun times for those seeking them.","November 9, 2013","true","40.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The combat itself isn't really different from any other MMORPG's, but the gem system and how they give you skills is definitely pretty unique. You aren't bombarded by microtransactions, if at all, and I like how it works on an instance system.\n\nSo far the game hasn't been overly hard, but I've died here and there. There are a few especially hard parts that I really liked, like the final boss of Act 1.\n\nThe community is definitely a big part of the game. Most people in chat are kind enough to give new players help, and having the trade chat helps people trade stuff for other stuff.\n\nWhat I really love is the flexibility of each character, due to the passive skills. It's totally viable to make your duelist magic-focused, ranged, or even all-around.\n\nGraphics-wise, the game looks pretty great. The places in game are beautiful, especially the forest areas in Act 2 and the town in Act 3. It's also pretty aesthetically pleasing, and has a nice vibrant mood to it.\n\nThe only complaints I have are how long it takes for the game to load up sometimes, but that's probably because of my mediocre laptop. The story is a little negligible and none of the NPCs so far have really been memorable, but they're nice to have around anyways.\n\nOverall, yes, you should try this game. It's free to play, so you've got nothing to lose by at least trying it out, but if you like other games like Torchlight or Diablo, then you'll definitely like this game too.","September 23, 2014","true","33.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Real "Free to play", forgot pay to win stuff. After months of playing i can assure you it is the best action RPG i have ever played. A lot of people will compare it with Diablo but for me its much more. First of all game have amazing community and developers who are patching and fixing all issues on a regular base. To be honest i never saw a company ready to listen the community.\n\nBefore you start playing for real you should definitely register at official forums, check out guides about game mechanics, builds and gameplay tips. You should also drop a look at offical forum shops for gear trade threads, deals between players.\n\nOne thing that makes this game unique is customization. Passive and active skills can be combined in thousand different ways to make your character exactly as you want him to be, no strict classes. Every single active skill can be modified to work the way you want and match your passive skill setup.\n\nSince there is no standard currency like gold or cash, developers decided to implement very interesting currency type - orbs, many different orbs. Each orb type have its primary use for crafting gear mods, thats the main reason people started to use them as a currency.\n\nAfter great community and customization options i would like to point out trade and bargain as a second most important thing in Path Of Exile. To gear up your character fast and build immortal god of hack and slash you should follow the trade chat and official forum trade threads, learn how to buy and sell, dont hesitate to bargain and earn profit. Work on your bargain skills and you will progress much faster.\n\nI could really say a lot about it since game content is huge and nicely polished. These first few lines i mentioned was something that really impressed me. Its something that makes a difference between huge, deep games like this one that are obviously made for action RPG community and all other games released exclusivley for building up the company profit.\n\nThis is one of those games made for community.

I still remember the first time I played it, the felling of going down to Hell to kill Diablo itself kept me going on. Do not expect something that remarkable on Path of Exile.\nThe are some innovation on this game. The first is the fact that your potions replenish as you kill enemies. This saves you to keep returning to town to buy extra health/mana potions and make the game more dynamic. Also, you don't have money/gold in this game. The game currency are the items that you use to improve your weaponry/armory (as orbs or scrolls of identify). So, you need to decide between using the items to buy new weapons/armors or to improve the ones you already have.\nIn conclusion, this game is a must play for fans of hack and slash action-RPG, like myself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akutare/recommended/238960/","Akutare","Akutare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akutare/","890 products in account","To start: this game is probably one of the best structured free to play games simply because the extent of the cash shop outside of cosmetic items is extra shared stash tabs (which you might need more tabs later on, but with a bit of organization it's usually not too bad). The way the skill system works allows for some nice builds, with a slotting and linking system not too different from Final Fantasy 7, like if you have a spell that shoots a fireball, you can put that gem in a socket in your armor and have it linked to a gem that makes it a spell totem and allows you to summon a totem that shoots fireballs. Keeping on with the Final Fantasy comparisons, the Passive tree is huge, with each class starting off in different areas of it, sort of similar to how Final Fantasy 10 was like and each point making a decent difference, and there is the choice of respeccing, but it's a bit tough to do (it partially requires a currency item for large respecs, you get respec points for some quests throughout the game but for anything more than 10 points it requires this currency item).\n\nA very unique aspect about the game as well is that it has no gold or equivalent, rather there are "Currency Items" that all have different uses like a scroll that identifies items, an orb that creates a rare from a normal weapon, and even an extremely rare item that can clone an item. All of these types of items take the place of gold and it works fairly well for the most part except for when trying to first start player trading, as it's a bit hard to learn the rates of all the items if you're hard pressed to get a certain item/currency.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it feels good, especially with critical hits where if certain elements crit, they'll have a different effect, like if an Ice spell crits the enemies that get hit by it are frozen. There are also different leagues that change up how the game itself works, and even race leagues that are only open for usually an hour and earns you "Season Points" for collecting and getting alternate artwork uniques in game. It plays really well with certain builds getting ludicrously fast paced later on or if you want to take your time there are builds for that too, the game is very flexible when it comes to available builds but that has a problem for me: Desync. Since this game is online only it is always correcting itself to the server, and it's fairly common to end up getting warped to a different area that you were earlier because the server didn't think you were actually able to walk somewhere when you could (for example you got surrounded but were able to get out of it, sometimes the server will warp you back into it because it thought the tiny opening you walked out of was closed.) For the impact this has on builds is simple: some builds just aren't viable because of the danger of being placed into an area you didn't want to go, and not to mention some skills just plain desync more often than others because of being movement skills/spells.\n\nIn short: The game is pretty much perfect in my opinion except for desync, which is a very large issue that can really kill any enjoyment I'm having no matter where I'm at in the game if it happens in a fatal way.\n\nScore: 4/5","December 1, 2013","true","355.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can make literally anything you want, from a necromancer templar to a dual wielder dealing elemental damage.\n\nSince i was such a big fan of D2 back in the day, i had to try this game. If you dont want to read all of it, skip to the end.\n\nYou have several classes to play, the one you pick basically sets where you start on the passive skill tree. At the end of chapter 3, you unlock the Scion class, which is the most versatile and can easy become whatever you want.\n\nWhen you level up you get points you can use on the passive skill tree to make your character stronger. The passive skill tree is truly gigantic, hence the huge variety of choices when building your char.\n\nYou also get gems, that you slot into your  items. Each gem has a skill, and the gems level up as you do. You can connect gems for extra effects, as there are many "support" gems, that dont do anything for themselves but enhance other gems, with damage, skill duration, blinding enemies, extra effects like making melee single target skills splash for targets around, etc. There are 3 types of gems and gem slots, red, green, and blue, red being typically the "brute" ones and therefore require strength, the greens require dexterity, and the blues inteligence.\nThis gem system is very versatile, just like the passive skill tree.\n\nThe game currently has 4 chapters. While chapter 1 and 2 are kinda easy, chapter 3 gets harder, and final boss on chapter 4 is pretty damn hard.\n\nSo lets sum it up:\n\nPro's:\n-Easy to play.\n-Highly character customization. Want to shoot a cone of fireballs as wide as the screen, that also deal lighting and cold damage?  Want to have an army of zombies, spirits and totems? Miss your whirlwhind D2 barbarian and want it back, but now dealing elemental damage? Yes please madam.\n-Free to play.\n-Areas change, so each time you replay each area the map is different.\n\nCons:\n-Visual perks like wings and stuff is paid, like guild chest, or extra chest tabs(but you start with 4 so that is hardly an issue).\n-Takes a while to learn and master the gem system, but once you get rolling you can make truly amazing things.\n-Gets kinda boring after a while. So just start another class lol.","August 2, 2015","true","475.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But nothing more.\n\nPoE embodies the addictive hack and slay clickfest experience we have enjoyed since Diablo,\nbut comes with a completely open, intelligently designed map of passive skills, combinable active skill gems, all wrapped\nin up to date graphics and an epic, immersive soundtrack. PoE combines all the good stuff we know with some new ideas,\nincluding:\n\n- Active skills can not be learned but are used as gems you put into socketed items.\n- There is no gold. Instead, there is a number of useful currency items in the game's purely trade based item sink shops.\n- Although the game is free to play and comes with an ingame shop, it's clearly not pay to win. The shop only offers a variety of vanity items and slots for characters and storage space.\n\nIt's a fun game, but it's very genre-typical and after a few hours of monster grinding you might come to realize that you're just not 14 anymore and that as you matured hack and slay, or "action RPG" as it is generally euphemized, might not exactly be the most stimulating experience for you anymore. However, what the game does, it does masterfully. The vortex of "I need +10 dex to be able to use this an that....." and "let's just keep going until 4am or to the next waypoint..." while playing with friends, tends to remind of old D2 times.\n\nIt's nothing less than the best hack and slay I have seen since D2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akutare/recommended/238960/","Akutare","Akutare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akutare/","890 products in account","To start: this game is probably one of the best structured free to play games simply because the extent of the cash shop outside of cosmetic items is extra shared stash tabs (which you might need more tabs later on, but with a bit of organization it's usually not too bad). The way the skill system works allows for some nice builds, with a slotting and linking system not too different from Final Fantasy 7, like if you have a spell that shoots a fireball, you can put that gem in a socket in your armor and have it linked to a gem that makes it a spell totem and allows you to summon a totem that shoots fireballs. Keeping on with the Final Fantasy comparisons, the Passive tree is huge, with each class starting off in different areas of it, sort of similar to how Final Fantasy 10 was like and each point making a decent difference, and there is the choice of respeccing, but it's a bit tough to do (it partially requires a currency item for large respecs, you get respec points for some quests throughout the game but for anything more than 10 points it requires this currency item).\n\nA very unique aspect about the game as well is that it has no gold or equivalent, rather there are "Currency Items" that all have different uses like a scroll that identifies items, an orb that creates a rare from a normal weapon, and even an extremely rare item that can clone an item. All of these types of items take the place of gold and it works fairly well for the most part except for when trying to first start player trading, as it's a bit hard to learn the rates of all the items if you're hard pressed to get a certain item/currency.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it feels good, especially with critical hits where if certain elements crit, they'll have a different effect, like if an Ice spell crits the enemies that get hit by it are frozen. There are also different leagues that change up how the game itself works, and even race leagues that are only open for usually an hour and earns you "Season Points" for collecting and getting alternate artwork uniques in game. It plays really well with certain builds getting ludicrously fast paced later on or if you want to take your time there are builds for that too, the game is very flexible when it comes to available builds but that has a problem for me: Desync. Since this game is online only it is always correcting itself to the server, and it's fairly common to end up getting warped to a different area that you were earlier because the server didn't think you were actually able to walk somewhere when you could (for example you got surrounded but were able to get out of it, sometimes the server will warp you back into it because it thought the tiny opening you walked out of was closed.) For the impact this has on builds is simple: some builds just aren't viable because of the danger of being placed into an area you didn't want to go, and not to mention some skills just plain desync more often than others because of being movement skills/spells.\n\nIn short: The game is pretty much perfect in my opinion except for desync, which is a very large issue that can really kill any enjoyment I'm having no matter where I'm at in the game if it happens in a fatal way.\n\nScore: 4/5","December 1, 2013","true","355.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It combines the itemization of Diablo II with the Materia system of Final Fantasy VII and the Sphere Grid of Final Fantasy X.\n\nIf you liked Diablo II or were disappointed by the mess that was Diablo III, I absolutely cannot recommend checking out this game enough.","January 4, 2014","true","11.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Seriously, this should be a paid game because the amount of free content you get is pretty ridiculous. All story, class related and gameplay related parts of the game are accessible to everyone, and there is absolutely no element of "pay to win". Yes, there are microtransactions, but these are all for either cosmetic things like weapon effects or skins, or stash tabs which means you can store items.\n\nThe story itself is pretty decent, but the depth of gameplay is where it shines. The passive tree is huge, and opens up a ton of different build ideas based on passives. The uniqueness of these builds are further enhanced by the large number of skills and support gems that go with them, with gems adding different effects to each skills in order to change their role or strengthen them. Skills and support gems can be switched up any time, encouraging a lot of customisation, and while there are no full respec items (although usually the devs hand out full respecs when the passive tree changes), there are items which enable the respeccing of passives, point-by point.\n\nI havent actually needed to use the support for the game yet, but I hear it's pretty good with the devs responding relatively quickly. I do know however that they do keep good contact with the community and do strive to improve the game as muh as they can.\n\nThere are however, two minor problems with this game. One is that you can have an infinite number of particles on screen at any given time, which means that when the spells start flying around, certain builds can get laggy fast. Second of all, is the desync that you get sometimes. It can be quite frustrating to die due to desync, and unfortunately we don't know when/if this problem will be fixed\n\nOverall, if you enjoy the ARPG genre, or games such as Diablo II and Torchlight II, this is a must play. It is not only fully free for you to try, but it has a level of customisation that surpasses that of even some paid games.","May 29, 2014","true","136.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can make literally anything you want, from a necromancer templar to a dual wielder dealing elemental damage.\n\nSince i was such a big fan of D2 back in the day, i had to try this game. If you dont want to read all of it, skip to the end.\n\nYou have several classes to play, the one you pick basically sets where you start on the passive skill tree. At the end of chapter 3, you unlock the Scion class, which is the most versatile and can easy become whatever you want.\n\nWhen you level up you get points you can use on the passive skill tree to make your character stronger. The passive skill tree is truly gigantic, hence the huge variety of choices when building your char.\n\nYou also get gems, that you slot into your  items. Each gem has a skill, and the gems level up as you do. You can connect gems for extra effects, as there are many "support" gems, that dont do anything for themselves but enhance other gems, with damage, skill duration, blinding enemies, extra effects like making melee single target skills splash for targets around, etc. There are 3 types of gems and gem slots, red, green, and blue, red being typically the "brute" ones and therefore require strength, the greens require dexterity, and the blues inteligence.\nThis gem system is very versatile, just like the passive skill tree.\n\nThe game currently has 4 chapters. While chapter 1 and 2 are kinda easy, chapter 3 gets harder, and final boss on chapter 4 is pretty damn hard.\n\nSo lets sum it up:\n\nPro's:\n-Easy to play.\n-Highly character customization. Want to shoot a cone of fireballs as wide as the screen, that also deal lighting and cold damage?  Want to have an army of zombies, spirits and totems? Miss your whirlwhind D2 barbarian and want it back, but now dealing elemental damage? Yes please madam.\n-Free to play.\n-Areas change, so each time you replay each area the map is different.\n\nCons:\n-Visual perks like wings and stuff is paid, like guild chest, or extra chest tabs(but you start with 4 so that is hardly an issue).\n-Takes a while to learn and master the gem system, but once you get rolling you can make truly amazing things.\n-Gets kinda boring after a while.

The only thing you get by paying money is cool skins for your gear. It doesn't have have any effect on the actual gameplay. The game is quite complicated, but that is what keeps me coming back for more, as there is a near-infinite amount of combinations of skills and character builds, most of them with significantly different playstyles. While the campaign does get a little old after a while, (on one character, you have to repeat the campaign 3 times on different difficulties), Grinding Gear Games has said that they have more content in the works that will eliminate this, with a new act scheduled for release in early 2015.

This is one of the best Hack 'n Slash Action RPG games that you will find this year and what's more it is entirely free to play (yes a real free to play the only thing you pay real money for are cosmetics like extra gore, different skin on items so that you look a little unique, pets that do nothing but follow you or more warehouse slots etc).\n\nThe gameplay it self is pretty much Diablo 2 style. One amazing thing about the game to note is the skill tree and the way you can develop it... the possibilities are endless! Basically the skill tree is just passive skills while the spells and similar that you use to fight are "gems" which you have to embed in your weapons/armors, what's more is that there are no class bound items so basically you can make a Ranger use staffs and use magic, a Marauder use bow and a Witch use a giant sword and that's not all, every single class has the same skill tree with the class being just the way you character looks and the starting possition in the skill tree.\nThe skills in this game are amazing. To use a skill you have to find a gem with that skill, meet the level and stat requerments and put it inside a gem slow in your weapon/armor. Each weapon/armor can have up to 4/6 slots with 3 different color and skill gems also have 3 different color types (based on Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence) and those slots on the weapon can be linked together so you can merge 2 or 3 different skills effects (using support gems with normal skills gems) to add new type of effects to your skills and make them even stronger.\nThe crafting and currency systems in the game are really unique and awesome the normal currency used in other games like gold for example is totally removed and everything revolves around trading items and the currency items are the same as upgrade items (adding new options to you armor/weapons, socketing, changing their type from normal, magic, rare ..etc)\n\nPoE is definitely my favorite Hack 'n Slash game together with the classic Diablo 2. It's a must try game for RPG fans and I would recomend it to all of you ;).","January 25, 2014","true","109.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PatrickHaze/recommended/238960/","PatrickHaze","PatrickHaze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PatrickHaze/","390 products in account","Let me start of with the most important point: Path of Exile is the absolute best implementation of F2P I've experienced. I am not hesitant to try free-to-play games out, but I am very wary of pay-to-win or ♥♥♥♥ game design caused by a game being F2P. Not once have I felt like any pay-cash-for-me items were being pushed in my face. I'm currently playing through the third and final difficulty, and the game being F2P hasn't gotten in the way of it a single time. While the game is not without its flaws, it is silly to avoid it trying since the financial barrier to entry is $0.\n\nWith dungeon crawlers there are a few core components that come to mind, that seem to make or break a given game. 1) Replayability 2) Mechanics 3) Skill trees 4) Item dropping/randomization. I will try to briefly talk about each of these issues.\n\nIn terms of replayability, Path of Exile is fantastic. I got bored of Titan Quest, Torchlight, and Diablo 3 much faster than I have in PoE. I actually hated Titan Quest by the time I finished it, I was just determined to beat it. Diablo 3 I quit during the final difficulty because they were still figuring out how to make the game suck less. Torchlight I just got disinterested in very quickly, although I plan to revisit it in the future.\n\nThe mechanics are probably the biggest selling point of the game in my opinion. Rarely does casting skills in a game make you feel like as much of a badass as it does in Path of Exile. The punch you get from using some of the skills is quite rewarding. While the gameplay is hampered a bit by lag now and then, by and large the game is very fast paced, and quite challenging at times.\n\nThe skill trees, gems, and leveling system really are a fantastic piece of game design. I won't try to explain how it works because it is worth exploring and learning yourself. While it isn't without its flaws, I really do love the adaptability the skill trees give you. My second character might not turn out as absolutely awesome as my first did, I feel like I kind of nailed it with my first build. Also, it's worth mentioning the currency system is downright clever.\n\nThe item dropping and randomization is probably the weak point of the entire game imo. While it isn't completely terrible, I can almost completely ignore loot that drops at this point in the game (~Lvl 55). Most things have such a low chance of comparing to what I already have, that it isn't worth looking. I still do, but it is usually futile. The need to get items with both good stats, AND appropriate gem sockets, is really the core problem. It is hard to hold this weakness against it, as this is something almost every dungeon crawler that exists fails at, especially Diablo 3.\n\nThe fact that this game is online-only hampers it in the same way it did for Diablo 3. There are definitely lag/sync issues that come up now and then. The ability to play in LAN mode, especially for something like hardcore mode (which I will never ever attempt), is almost essential. This is only a slight gripe, as I haven't even paid a cent for the game yet. I do plan on dumping some money into it at some point, primarily just to support the game/devs.\n\nOverall, if you like dungeon crawlers, or even just trying solid free-to-play games, this is one is definitely worth checking out.","February 24, 2014","true","392.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The only thing you get by paying money is cool skins for your gear. It doesn't have have any effect on the actual gameplay. The game is quite complicated, but that is what keeps me coming back for more, as there is a near-infinite amount of combinations of skills and character builds, most of them with significantly different playstyles. While the campaign does get a little old after a while, (on one character, you have to repeat the campaign 3 times on different difficulties), Grinding Gear Games has said that they have more content in the works that will eliminate this, with a new act scheduled for release in early 2015.

It's a wonderful game with some fresh ideas and good mechanics that breaths some more life into the traditional ARPG format.\n\nIt is similar to Diablo 3, Torchlight 2 and Titan Quest in general gameplay. All your standard things such as levelling up, loot, random levels and monster slaying are here. Where it differs from the aforementioned games is the skill and level-up system, which is an interesting change. As you level up, you gain passive skill points to spend on things such as damage, armour, critical chance etc.\n\nYou gain your active skills from a variety of different gems, which can be freely plopped into items you find - and taken out without a fuss. This allows you to quickly swap skills in and out - completely changing your play-style in a matter of seconds. These gems also level-up with you and become more powerful. You can create powerful combos by linking support gems with active skills to augment your favourites.\n\nThis balance between "permanent" passive skills and changeable active skills is actually really good and works well together. You can still build a character to exactly what you want - and the passive skill "tree" is absolutely huge.\n\nDifferent classes start the game at different points in the skill tree, meaning they can gain access to abilities that suit them best earlier than other classes, but it also means, with a bit of work, you can turn pretty much any class in the game to do something different. It's unique and very well rounded.\n\nAs a free-to-play game, it's a must try for anyone that likes the format. It's a great game, made even better by being free to play. At no point does it feel like you *have* to pay to get the most out of it, like some other FTP games I have tried in the past.\n\nGo on, give it a whirl, it's free!\n\nJimbo Rating: 7.5/10","September 22, 2014","true","24.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You were right, but let me first tell you some general things and I will end with my opinion at the end of the review.\n\nPoE is a hack and slash ARPG that has an incredible amount of depth. It has so much depth that it was the main reason for me to switch from Diablo 3 to PoE. Apart from the many, many uniques there is a huge passive tree, so extensive that it gives you nearly endless possibilites to customise and direct your character build. It is responsive in terms of casting abilites, skills, attacking, moving, etc, much like Diablo 3. The graphics are simple-ish but ok in my opinion, the game uses less bright colors compared to diablo 3 and is less prone to giving you epileptic seizures.\n\nLet's first get rid of the cons:\n-inconcsistent FPS --> really demanding game in terms of requirements, it will run smoothly and then some cluster♥♥♥♥ of spells and abilities will produce an fps drop (maybe it's just me though, but I think I have a pretty good pc)\n-server crashes and bugs sometimes appear, altough it's not that often to really undermine the game. It's rare but it's there\n-if you are playing on an EU server it is possible to enter groups with NA players (for example) that will switch you to their server and consequently increase your ping to ~500ping\n-the start of the game is really slow, meaning that you will not have that start as in Diablo 3 for example where you start hacking and slashing furiously at lvl1, PoE requires higher attack speed/cast speed to achieve that level of speed/responsivnes. Meaning you will have the fast game in the late game.\n-it's a grinding game\n\nNow for the pros:\n-free to play (not pay to win, don't worry, all microtransactions are merely cosmetic apart from the stash extentions)\n-huge depth: a really high number of different builds that are all viable in some way and customisation of everything (from your gear and hideouts to the maps that you will be tackling on in late game)\n-responsivnes\n-large amount of late game content\n-races where you can earn unique gear rewards\n-fun leagues with unique rules that last for 3 months each: new economy, fresh start and rewards\n-permanent leagues\n-it's hard as ♥♥♥♥ to reach lvl100\n-it's a grinding game\n\nAll in all I recommend this game. Why? Because you have stuff to do. Yes it's grindy but at least you have the satisfactory soul fulfiling skills/abillities that destroy enemies to your hearts content in many more ways than one. My point is you will never get bored because you can always make a unique build that you will enjoy. A build tailored for you, by you, not by external sites. My only recommendation is that you plan and learn in advance. Well, those are my main reasons why I switched to this game. It's excellent, really and I would recommend you try it, after all, it's free to play. I'd rate this game 8.5/10.","April 3","true","149.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've put in hundreds of hours over many characters before this game hit Steam. If you like Diablo, you will likely enjoy PoE. This is the spiritual successor to Diablo 2.  Prepare yourself though - this isn't as simple as Diablo 3, and requires a lot more planning, thought, and testing to have an effective build.\n\nMath of Exile is a game where you afk in town while reading up on skill mechanics and planning out how you're going to set up your future passive skill points. The mechanics of combat, damage, and character resources (health, mana, energy shield, armor, etc) are very well thought out and make for strong ARPG combat, as a spiritual successor to the Diablo line should be. Early game (the first ~19 levels) has a little more variety than D3 per character, but after level 19 your character will be able to use a much wider variety of skills, provided you can get them from a Master or another player, or find them as drops. Gameplay is varied, but approaching late game becomes a grind not unlike running GRs over and over. I personally find PoE's grind more fun because there's more I can do while grinding, and there's a large, active community in each league, and I can chat and get responses and conversations at any time.\n\nOverall it's a modern Diablo 2 experience, with a more emphasis on grinding in the late game than D2, but in each respect is more rewarding than D3's "more fun less gameplay" twist on the Diablo recipe.\n\nYou will be tested, and you will be found wanting.

You start of with a selection from various characters, these include lulu the dark witch, taric the holy one, and lastly master yi the forgoten avanger. I myself played as yi and the story is great although it does have a few plot holes here and there. In any case you find yourself on a beach after the summer cruise ship you were on got assaulted by the deadswamp pirates. Yi was engaged to be married and had all of his family onboard the cruise at the time. unfortunately the pirates were ruthless and slayed every man woman and child. Yi tried to resist but was overpowerd by a surge of lightening on the stormy night that accompanied the deadswamp pirate assault. Amongst the wreckage of the ship he eventually floated to the island in which you start the game. Theres nothing much to it at first, you are lying face planted in the dirt. You learn to survive as you craft with various tools. Immersion breaks here because you cut down trees with your bare hands, but i suppose this could be attributed to Yi being a badass and so it can be justified.\n\nEventually you can build yourself a nice hut, and after you do some rather grindy farming you can establish a good forward outpost. You get promted mid game to purchase station cash from the soney online entertainment website to speed things up, but i never was a fan of DLC so i dont support EA's decision to monetise indie games like this. After you build the foward outpost you get to fight the first boss, a giant enemy crab which is symbolic of Yi's personal struggles from his japanese heritage. the crab is symbolic of real historical battles in ancient china and for the little historian in all of us i found this quite compelling as a plot twist. beating the crab allows you to advance to the next section, where you meet rico from just cause 2.\n\nRico gives you the grappleing hook as he too was on the cruise ship but took a bullet to the hip and just cant do what he did in the previous game. Fortunately for us, Yi gets to swing around the area pretty quickly. the hook allows you to make it to the central island, where the plot thickens once Yi discovers theres an american military base centred in the area that has been testing equipment. Yi appraoches the base in a freindly manner, but is instantly gunned down and escapes within an inch of his life. The game turns toward gurrilla warfare fromt his point on. You need to take out key military instillations over the island (such as propaganda stations and fuel depots) to try and win over the local populus. Once youve garnered enough strength you can take the military hq head on to liberate panaoa from the terrorist organisation that has rooted itself in the heart of the island.\n\nTHe final stages of the game involve strolling the halls of the HQ, which span deep underground. Yi uncovers the secrets this place holds. the organisation were responsible for the pirate attack on the ship, hired mercinaries trying to obtain a rare artifact being transported on the cruise that nobody knew about. This clearly explaines why rico was onboard and this was certainly no ordinary cruise. The artifact was being used to reanimate flesh to create necromongers to satisfy some weird cult called zoology established by Tom ultman. From this point on Yi knew what he had to do and where he needed to go... space... THe game ends with Yi having a choise to destroy the evil facility, or instead render it inert for future research by the alliance which hope to harness this power against the bretheren moons. Once you make your choice you can hitch  a ride on the ebon normandy, a test vehicle in the hanger which is fully developed and primed for space flight. YOu can take with you some local aquaintances you met on the island, or just go solo.

Its not only the best dungeon crawler RPG I've played. But it got the greatest skill tweaking I've ever seen. It got the biggest passive skilltree I've seen in a game to date, and if a skilltree is not enough for you to define your character: Well PoE has skill gems to add abilities to your character, which can be linked by support gems to enhance them. You can also add certain kind of gems to some slots in your skilltree, for even more character building.\n\nSome people claim this to be "a better Diablo then Diablo 3".

This game is perfect in any way possible, the Performance is flawless (unless you cast on crit), after 2.0 deployed Desync is fixed, still back in 1.3 it was fun to R.I.P to some desync, the endless build choices is the thing that stands out for me, you literally have no limits. I also love the fact that is completely free, you cant be better than someone, just because you've put more money in PoE. So i'd give it 10/10, no doubt, i will play it untill im dead or something, not stopping soon. ;) Thanks GGG for taking my life :( <3","October 25, 2015","true","960.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It will most likely take a while to get in to and it is not suited for quite a lot of gamers. However, this game is absolutely fantastic.\n\nPros and cons can be subjective, so I'll just point out main points.\n-Hardcore. Can be a heaven for hardcore gamers and a nightmare for casuals. Not recommended for your first ARPG.\n\n-Free-to-play but not pay-to-win. GGG's microtransaction system is very fair. Almost everything is cosmetics and nothing in microtransaction store gives anyone an advantage.\n\n-Realistic gritty graphics. I personally love the graphic and art style, but it is highly subjective.\n\n-Music varies from "meh" to absolute blasts. From boring lullabies to beautiful symphonies.\n\n-Sound design is pretty solid. Good voice acting and realistic sounds.\n\n-Support is great and quick. I personally had great time using it.\n\n-Game has classes, however, the class only changes how your character looks and from where he/she starts from the skill tree.\n\n-Characters can use any skills or items if they have required stats. Skills are skill gems that can be socketed in to items.\n\n-Ridiculously flexible and huge skill tree. You can make thousands or possibly even millions of builds with the tree provided. Skill tree consists of little upgrades (For example, 0.3% life regeneration or 12% more physical damage.)Some people don't like this, but those small upgrades stack fast, I personally love the freedom of the skill tree.\n\n-Game is based on leagues, so there will be different leagues where you can create a new character and try new things.\n\n-Lot of equipment variance, you can find, buy or craft items perfect for your build or even multiple ones.\n\n-Trading is decent but should be worked on. You either need to yell to chat or use 3rd party websites to make trades. Game has no auction houses or player shops in-game.\n\n-Leveling can be quick or slow, depending on build and skill. Max level is 100 and you can reach level 70 in 10-15 hours.\n\n-The game has 3 difficulties, Normal, Cruel and Merciless. You will move to the next difficulty after completing storyline. Story currently is composed of 3 acts (4th one is coming soon) and you complete those acts in each difficulty. This can be very boring, since it can feel like the game is repeating.\n\n-The endgame is a map system. You can craft mods in to your maps to make them fit your build or your needs. I personally love this system, since it offers a lot of variance, varying difficulties and different experiences.\n\n-The D-sync (Should be fixed in the Awakening expansion). Basically, you will be off sync from the game and you might in a different position than your character seems to be on your screen. This can and probably will cause a lot of deaths and frustration, but should be getting fixed soon. (Only thing that has really caused me frustration in the game. Glad to see it going)\n\nI might have forgotten some main points...\nOverall, I think Path of Exile is a fantastic game by a fantastic company and I recommend it whole heartedly.","April 24, 2015","true","776.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I love the classes, the items, the spells, the customization with the passive skill tree, the viability of many builds.  I love this game.  But this game suffers from a fundamental, glaring, insulting and infuriating flaw (well, flaws, but more about that later).\n\nIt desyncs constantly.  This may not be a big deal in early levels when mobs are fairly easy and the named/elite champs you fight aren't rocking proximity shields and damage reflection.  But when you're 60+, dealing with a room full of mobs that can literally 2-shot you if they get too close, it's borderline unplayable.  The difficulty factor would be perfect (probably a little too easy for archers) if it wasn't for these sneaky ninja-mobs that just show up and beat the living hell out of you.\n\nAnother flaw (imo) is the gem system.  In games like Diablo, gems/runes are used to augment abilities or add buffs/bonuses.  In PoE, however, gems are both your skills and your buffs/augments.  On my 61 Ranger I have maybe 13 gems, 6 of which are skills and 3 of which are buffs.  That leaves me with 4 or 5 support gems, not a big deal.  The problem is that in order to upgrade a piece of equipment, I have to find one that is an ilvl upgrade, has a specific number of sockets in specific colors and in a specifically-linked configuration, is a rare or better, and has to have good modifiers.  The alternative is finding a random piece of equipment and burning mats to change the number/color/linkage/quality/attributes/bonuses.  This makes the game feel like a grind-fest.   And even then, I'd forgive this aspect if I didn't constantly desync.\n\nI want to love this game.  I've spent quite a lot of time playing, but I simply cannot play it anymore.

It's been around too long to not have a succesful business model, but I'm astonished at how ethical the microtransactions are in this F2P Diablo-alike.\n\nNo, no hyperbole, I'm truly astonished.  I mean, it's almost hard to find the microtransactions, and they come in three flavors: Extra character slots, extra equipment tabs, and cosmetic appearances.\n\nI don't know how many character slots PoE has, because playing one character is dozens of hours of playtime.  Playing two (it's nice to have a "solo" character and a "co-op" character, which you can do without paying anything) is easily over 100 hours of playtime.\n\nI still have enough stash tabs to organize my stuff into appropriate tabs.  I might need more tabs some 200 hours into the game.  Maybe?\n\nAnd there's a huge amount of things to upgrade.  Weapons and armor that has slots for skill gems, but also "currency" items to buy items from vendors (no gold?  Yes, no gold) that also affects your items.  This helps the "trash loot" and "RNG gods" problems so much.  If you find an item with great slots, but not enough else,  you can enchant, disenchant, renchant, add more enchantments, craft on more enchantments, etc.  If you find a great item with poor numbers of slots, you can reroll slot, reroll links, etc.  How do you get these items in this Free-To-Play game, you ask?\n\n...from Grinding Gear Games, the answer is "NOT by paying money.  Ever."  You want those items, you find them or you trade for them.  But wait, doesn't that create a third-party economy that might sell stuff out of channel?  Maybe, but GGG resfuses to compromise the quality and feel of a game the depth of Diablo II to try and skim some profits.\n\nThe skill tree (web, really) is just bananas, too, in a great way.  The selection of passive skills and abilities mixed with the equipment in this game encourages, again, Diablo II leves of creative character building, with a shocking amount of high-end viable oddball creations.  (Just be aware of the vastly larger phase-space of useless characters you can make along the way, and assume you won't get your first character right.  Really, it's okay).\n\nThe difficulty level make for a fun experience for those looking for a fun ARPG romp, but challenging theorycrafting challenges at the higher levels for hardcore players.\n\nBest game I've played all year?  Maybe.  Most?  Hands down.","November 28, 2014","true","114.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It seems a little dull in the beginning, but the later zones and acts are substantially better in terms of graphics, level design, monsters, and boss tactics. A genuinely challnging game that is nevertheless fair and heavily skill-based. Crafting, lack of gold currency, an impressive skill tree, and an extremely flexible character design (no "class items") add additional spice.

Even tho I'm not an hardcore fan of genre I still did like it. Hardness added as you progress is really amazing as well, every enemy has interesting mechanic that will make you think if you don't want to die. This also doesn't mind the levels. If your stats are bad or you try to rush in group of them, you will find yourself dying even if you are couple of levels above the enemy. That's amazing but even more awesome is talent tree that is realy huge. I don't know will I be able to reset those later (there is refund for couple) but I'm quite sure I wont make the best out of it in my first play through. Sure, there is room for some improvements that will make gameplay experience even better, but this game is really alright and it managed to leave good impression on me.","December 9, 2013","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You get Path of Exile, a game which demands a great deal of theorycrafting and immense build diversity the likes of which you will never see in many ARPGs.\n\nPros:\n+ Free to play\n+ No pay-to-win, all microtransactions are aesthetic.\n+ Vast build diversity\n+ All skills are available to use by any class\n+ Helpful, active community\n+ New take on currency and how it affects trading\n+ Massive, comprehensive skill tree.\n+ (Personal interest) Competant summoning and minion features\n\nCons:\n- Always online\n- Trade chat is poorly implemented\n- Game has terrible problems with desync\n- Standard league economy is horribly inflated\n- Not for casual gaming, requires a great deal of time and effort to get to the real fun parts of the game\n\nPros explained:\nThe first thing that attracted me to this game the most was the summoning system. Diablo 2 had spoiled me rotten with the necromancer, nothing was more fun for me than running around with a large army of skeletons at my back, ready to charge forward to engage the enemy. Not many ARPGs can pull off a good summoning mechanic, but when they do, its always amazing. Path of Exile not only lets you raise hordes of zombies that fight until they die, but also allows you to summon skeletons that offer support and come in larger numbers. The best part of summoning, however, comes in the form of raising spectres. Imagine fighting a monster that is very proficient at wiping out your minions, and then turning that monster into your own minion to fight for you! And there's more, from summoning flaming skulls that bypass enemies and small obstacles to animating weapons to animating a full-blown suit of armor!\n\nThe next big feature I loved about this game is how they handle currency. Most games just give you basic currency like gold which you use to buy or sell things. Not in this game! Currency comes in the form of special orbs which also provide useful functions. One orb can be used to give you respecs to your passive tree for example, another can be used to turn a mundane (white) item into a rare quality item. There's lots of orbs and each orb is valued differently between each other based on rarity on usefulness. If you can find the 'mirror of kalandra', you've officially become a rich player, but good luck finding it!\n\nThere are no direct skills to speak of when leveling up, but they are passive improvements. When it comes to Path of Exile, it doesn't give you a skill tree, it gives you a passive skill jungle! Those who have played Final Fantasy X will know what I'm talking about. The passive skill tree is what allows for such an amazing build diversity. Its very complicating for new players, but thankfully the forum has many build guides you can use to teach you how to build yourself. I highly recommend you try and make your own build first to understand the passive skill tree before reading a build guide.\n\nAh, but the greatest feature of all about this game lies in the actual skills themselves. This game offers a myriad of abilities that are accessible to every player, so long as they can meet the stat requirements for them. Want to throw a fireball? Sure. How about raining fire on the enemy? Why not! Want to throw a spectral copy of your weapon at an enemy and watch it fly back to you? You can get it. The fun doesn't stop there, no. You can also augment your abilities with support gems to make them more powerful! Want to shoot more fireballs at once, or to make them split on impact? There's support gems for that! Want your arrows to bounce between multiple enemies or pierce right through them? That's possible. Want your melee attacks to attack multiple times in one cast, or to make your melee do AoE damage? You can do that. There's infinite possibilities when using skills, you just need to know what works best!\n\nCons explained:\nHowever, this game does have some downsides you will have to deal with. The first and perhaps biggest issue this game suffers from is desync. For those who don't know what desync is, the simplest way to describe it is that the client isn't in sync with the server. For instance, you're trying to escape from some enemies in a hall and while you think you have escaped, you're still taking damage and when you die, you wind up back where the enemies were. Rubberbanding is the best way to describe desync and you will be experiencing this a lot. If you play on the hardcore leagues, its IMPORTANT that you play carefully and utilize the '/oos' command in chat to resync.\n\nThis game is also not friendly to the more casual of gamers. Between build diversity, a complicated skill tree and a heavily inflated economy in the parent standard and hardcore leagues, this game demands a great deal of time and effort be invest before the game gets any fun. If you're not prepared to really sink your teeth into this game and hang on for dear life, you might want to consider playing something else.\n\nBut hey, this game is free. Free, and without pay-to-win microtransactions. There are microtransactions in this game, but they are all cosmetic and designed purely to make your character stand out from the rest. There are also pets you can buy as a microtransaction, but they are also purely for visual appeal and will not give you an advantage to combat. You will never have to worry about other players buying their way to greatness, everyone is on even ground here!\n\nI really suggest you give this game a try, especially if you were a fan of Diablo 2!\n\nHelpful resources:\n\nhttp://www.poe.xyz.is\nThis site is great if you're looking to find an item in the game that you need.

Easily amongst the greatest F2P models. Easily the most deep and creative ways to build your character. Easily a must-play for everyone.\n\nPros\n- FANTASTIC free to play model. You get the entire game right off the bat. There's really no 'except' or 'but' to this, you seriously just straight up get the entirety of the game. All the things you can spend $ on are things such as cosmetics for your character, pets, decorative set pieces for your hideout, and other petty stuff along those lines.\n\n- The game features perhaps the deepest way to create a character's build in video gaming history. You see, the game has a passives tree with over 1,000 nodes to invest in. The class you pick merely determines where in the tree you'll start. For example, The Duelist class starts on the bottom, where strength and dexterity meet.  Here is a picture [i.imgur.com] of the current passives tree. This massive tree combined with the strange way you mix skill gems with support gems to bend your spells to do exatecly what you want. For example, you can attach a fireball (skill gem) with Lesser Multiple Projectiles (a support gem). Now instead of 1 fireball, you now shoot 3. Or perhaps you want to summon a totem to shoot the fireballs for you? Or maybe your fireballs fork into two more fireballs when they hit an enemy. On top of that, "unique" items in the game can bend the normal rules for your character, to allow for even more creativity and possibilites present.\n\n- Three month leagues with special rules or permanent leagues. A multitude of various races to start a character at level 1 and reach the furthest in the game in a certain time under certain rules running every day. Softcore or hardcore. There's a lot of variety present in the game which is sure to find your niche.\n\n- Amazing developers deliver content on the regular. I took a break from the game (after about 1,200 hours) for 3 months and when I came back there were 14 new support gems, 7 new skills, a new master system, personal hideouts, and more bugfixes/quality of life changes than I cared to read in one session.\n\nCons\n\n- *...cough...\n\n- JK, there is a learning curve. It may take you a few hours to get a real feel for the game. For people like me, that's actually a Pro, but may be a bit off putting to some.\n\nI give the game 10/10, and award it 'Best Indie Game', 'Best Crowdfunded Game', and 'Best ARPG'\n\ngo play it u doofus","November 17, 2014","true","398.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Here are the things people forget to talk about.\n\nThe team behind the game, GGG, updates regularly and in fun ways. A lot of players, like me, rejoin the game when new content comes out. We play two, three months and then go play something else. We know we'll be back since twice a year a whole new league with new rules will be offered for the players.\n\nBut what if I'm an hardcore gamer and I don't want to stop playing, I want to be the king (or queen) of the game! Well lucky you, Endgame is perfect in Path of Exile. You can do races to gain point and unique items. You can use the same character and do the "maps". Those are random area that are pretty hard and fun. You could also start a new character since there's a lot (like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) of builds, and new skills / items are regularly added to the game to offer new possibilities.\n\nFor all the hack and slash people out there, it's a must try game. You will feel powerfull in this game. You will enjoy the loot. You will strategize fights and you will play with friends in a positive way.\n\nAnd did I say it's free! Free for everything!!!

All active skills are based on resocketable gems, making you're character build your own, and the passive talent system is very reminscent of the sphere grid/tree/maze in FFX, which gives you even more lattitude in determining how you want to create your character over the long run.\n\nSome downsides:\n- Online only. This will cause you to have desync issues so you'll get some moments where you or monsters will teleport.\n- Bit of a learning curve. You'll need to check a wiki to see how to get the most out of the merchants and how to use support gems).\n- No character customization for appearance.\n\nYou really have nothing to lose by playing this game, so give it a few hours and get a feel for it.","November 25, 2013","true","60.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're a fan of eerie & spine chilling, fantasy hack 'n' slash games where fighting huge mobs of ghastly creatures and ominous soldiers are the norm, Path of Exile is for you. As many have said already, this game has a very similar feel to the Diablo series and takes a large amount of influence from it (i.e. how the game is set into Acts and once you have completed them you can move onto harder difficulties), but also adds something of it's own into the mix such as having no currency in the game. Path of Exile is what Diablo 3 should have been and totally takes the cake between the two. The amount of content in the game is astounding and sometimes I can't believe that this game is free-to-play. Of course, you have your proverbial microtransactions but unlike other games, Path of Exile offers mostly non-competitive items for sale such as more character slots and guild options. Player vs. Player is another great element to the game and from what I have seen it contains 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 and 6 vs 6 arenas though the matchmaking is a bit buggy when joining a queue. So, if you are looking for an overly addicting, loot driven, online hack 'n' slash game with tons of gore and brutality, download this game now!

The monetization of the game is never shoved into your face and the game never feels like it is giving you a lesser experience for playing without spending.\n\nThe Action Role Playing Game (ARPG) elements are excelent as the various special abilities express variabilty in game mechanics while providing satisfying feedback in the form of crunchy-gory slaughter.  While there is plenty of good enemy variability throughout the campaign, your primary tactics will most likely not vary until you come accross large groups of enemies or platoons that mix range and melee combatants.\n\nThe character customization is limited to the items you wear and the sprawling skill tree that makes up the leveling system for the game.  While skill gems provide the meat of experience in terms of move sets, the skill tree simply determines what weapons and armor you can equip while providing percentage bonus to your damage and attack speeds.\n\nAll character classes are viable, however, it is important to note their specialties to best equip and advance your character for optimal slaying.  While the game is not necessarily difficult, deaths become common when you make haphazard or impatient mistakes to bring the fight to a large group of enemies.  Boss encounters can seem daunting at first, however, once you understand to eliminate their followers and then carefully avoid their primary attack, the fights become very manageable.\n\nPath of Exile introduces some innovations or rather differing mechanics for bartering and potion use.  When you trade an item into a vendor, you recieve peices of identifying scrolls or alchemy gems that can be used to identify or make magic items respectively.  This displaces the importance of accumulated wealth into a more free form experimentation with getting better gear as you can often make a better item from a non-magical item and a few alchemy gems.  Potions are recharged from slaying enemies rather than consumed on an individual basis, which adjusts your tactics as you become heavily damaged.\n\nOverall, I think Path of Exile is a great game, free-to-play or not.  I found it more engaging than Diablo III and Torchlight II, however, your experience might vary based on how the art style and story appeals to your tastes.  The game, though, is just fun and should be at least tried.\n\n[GET ASAP]","February 2, 2014","true","22.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You still have to earn your gear, levels, and skills.\n\nThis is the perfect successor to Diablo 2.","February 10, 2014","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The monetization of the game is never shoved into your face and the game never feels like it is giving you a lesser experience for playing without spending.\n\nThe Action Role Playing Game (ARPG) elements are excelent as the various special abilities express variabilty in game mechanics while providing satisfying feedback in the form of crunchy-gory slaughter.  While there is plenty of good enemy variability throughout the campaign, your primary tactics will most likely not vary until you come accross large groups of enemies or platoons that mix range and melee combatants.\n\nThe character customization is limited to the items you wear and the sprawling skill tree that makes up the leveling system for the game.  While skill gems provide the meat of experience in terms of move sets, the skill tree simply determines what weapons and armor you can equip while providing percentage bonus to your damage and attack speeds.\n\nAll character classes are viable, however, it is important to note their specialties to best equip and advance your character for optimal slaying.  While the game is not necessarily difficult, deaths become common when you make haphazard or impatient mistakes to bring the fight to a large group of enemies.  Boss encounters can seem daunting at first, however, once you understand to eliminate their followers and then carefully avoid their primary attack, the fights become very manageable.\n\nPath of Exile introduces some innovations or rather differing mechanics for bartering and potion use.  When you trade an item into a vendor, you recieve peices of identifying scrolls or alchemy gems that can be used to identify or make magic items respectively.  This displaces the importance of accumulated wealth into a more free form experimentation with getting better gear as you can often make a better item from a non-magical item and a few alchemy gems.  Potions are recharged from slaying enemies rather than consumed on an individual basis, which adjusts your tactics as you become heavily damaged.\n\nOverall, I think Path of Exile is a great game, free-to-play or not.  I found it more engaging than Diablo III and Torchlight II, however, your experience might vary based on how the art style and story appeals to your tastes.  The game, though, is just fun and should be at least tried.\n\n[GET ASAP]","February 2, 2014","true","22.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The graphics are ok, and there is a huge variety of possiblilities about leveling your character. So many that you can experiment and replay the game many times with differents characters and differents skills. That was one of the reasons why I expent more than 230 hours playing. The other reason, a feature called "Hardcore leagues". When you create a new character you can select this league. Is a permanent death style and I love that. I played Diablo that way and I know that is just a matter of quit the game when you die, but I like much that this is included as a part of the game.\n\nSometimes the smallest details make a big difference, and the developers have done a really good job with this game. They are also active improving the game and there are no tricks or pay to win, the game is free. You can buy cosmetic things such a flame texture for your weapon, a new texture for a pice or armor, a pet, etc.\n\nIf you liked once Diablo, try this. If you have never played Diablo or any other "hack and slash" game and want to give a chance to the genre, this is a good one.","October 28, 2013","true","249.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If one wishes to support the game developers, money can be spent for cosmetic changes and to increase your stash size, but neither are required to play the game.\n\nWhile the passive skill tree is enormous, it does require a bit of thought and planning to be utilized effectively.  Active skills are socketed to items, allowing unique combinations and a large amount of variety to gameplay (although, some options are far more effective than others).  Skills are leveled through experience that your character gains as they are socketed in an equipped item.\n\nDisadvantages...two in my experience: descynchronization from the required servers, even with ample internet capability; the targeting system is frustrating for melee type characters.  Both are irritating and exacerbate each other, often leading to character deaths.  As with Diablo 3 (the only other ARPG game that I have played with a server connection requirement), this has kept me from playing hardcore characters.  It's a shame, because I enjoy the challenge.\n\nOverall, I will wholeheartedly recommend the game, despite the above-mentioned flaws.  The developer seems committed and responsive to the fans / supporters, which is a nice bonus and will hopefully ensure future changes which allow for better, more reliable gameplay.  Additionally, the amount of variety and different gameplay options (races, ladder servers, etc.) should keep long term players' attention.","January 19, 2014","true","160.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These gems level independently of your character, can be traded with others, and can be augmented with support gems to fundementally change how they operate. Creative use of these gems is essential; for example, linking a "fireball" gem with a "lesser multiple projectiles" gem to turn your single fireball into a flurry of firey damage.\n\nDeveloper interaction with the community is notably strong: Grinding Gear Games are open and engaged developers who listen to community feedback and evolve their game with players in mind. Content updates and patches are regular and significant, with new unique items being introduced at frequent intervals, along with new skill gems. Race events are almost constantly available for those looking for the replayability that a ladder system can provide, while new acts are promised for the future to continue the story.\n\nPath of Exile is an extraordinary game, made even more appealing by the fact that it is completely free to play. Microtransactions exist in the form of harmless cosmetic trinkets that have no impact on gameplay whatsoever, something that cannot be applauded enough. This is one of the most ethical free to play titles available. Even people who paid $1000 - you read correctly - to design one of the game's unique items did NOT receive a copy of that item for themselves. They STILL had to discover the item ingame like everybody else.\n\nIf other action RPGs have let you down, you'd be a fool not to try this one. Even if you're happy with the other games on offer, for no cost you really have no reason not to try this stunning addition to the genre.","December 16, 2013","true","587.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you don't have a lot of time on your hands, you're better off playing some other game because you won't get much out of PoE.\n\nThe skill tree doesn't offer as much freedom as it first appears to. While the overall selection does greatly affect how your character works under the hood, they are still passive skills, most of which are just tiny percentage buffs and seriously underwhelming on their own.\n\nI'm not a fan of D3, but the active skills in PoE do not satisfy like D3's do. There aren't any active skills that really make me want to build a PoE character.\n\nIn PoE you tend to build a character around one attack and spam that single one until you're blue in the face. Other action RPGs typically offer combined use of more active skills.\n\nPoE is a thinking person's game, challenging, huge depth in its mechanics. It takes a long time and a lot of reading to learn how to create strong characters and it takes forever to get characters to a high level. The learning process is a joy, but respeccing isn't really doable.\n\nThe game changes a lot. If you leave the game and return after some months, you'll need to relearn wat makes a strong character, and all your character's passive skill trees will have been reset because the game's skill tree was likely updated. Your characters won't function until you reinvest those skillpoints. After returning to the game you likely won't know the current trade value of items.The game doesn't comfortably let you take a few months off and then come back.\n\nThey went too crazy with the socket colours and linked sockets. While fun at first, the impossibly low odds of getting the right sockets and links on your gear become an annoying limiting factor to how you build your character. Specifically, part of the problem is that the type of defence stat (armor, energy shield, or evasion) on a gear item determines what socket colour is most likely to show up on it. Active kills are gems that need to be socketed before you can use them, and they will only fit in sockets of the matching colour. This effectively forces you to focus on a specific defence type based on what active skills you want to use, severely restricting the endless freedom that the passive skill tree initially appears to provide.","July 5, 2015","true","623.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"Another ARPG. So what?"\n\nSo let me get this out from the start: I am not someone who usually likes ARPGs. I liked Diablo II quite a bit back when it was new. Torchlight was good. Torchlight II was good. Titan Quest was good. But I got bored of all of them before I hit the ten hour mark; some less than that. For the latter few games, I only lasted that long because I had friends to co-op with.\n\nI have played around 180 hours of Path of Exile. Half of that was solo. I find myself playing this over games I've actually paid for - all 200+ of them.\n\nTo me, this game has streamlined the process of playing an ARPG:\n\n- Clear desirable attributes for items and the ability to socket and unsocket gems at will eliminates the tedium of sorting out loot while you're in town, allowing you to quickly get back to the business of killing everything that moves or looks at you funny.\n\n- Unique currency-barter system\n\n- The community is helpful.\n\n- The devs are active.\n\n- The gameplay is challenging but not too difficult.\n\n- This game is free-to-play powered by microtransactions so unobtrusive you would be forgiven for forgetting they were there at all.\n\nI'm trying to think of some complaints here. Something to say "this could be improved by such and such" and honestly nothing immediately comes to mind. There are no major bugs that ruin the game. Each class is viable, though some are more effective than others.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking to find something to play without paying a cent, and the idea of being able to leave a trail of destruction behind you in the quest for more items and power sounds appealing, it's hard to do better.\n\n5/5","March 18, 2014","true","692.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're a fan of eerie & spine chilling, fantasy hack 'n' slash games where fighting huge mobs of ghastly creatures and ominous soldiers are the norm, Path of Exile is for you. As many have said already, this game has a very similar feel to the Diablo series and takes a large amount of influence from it (i.e. how the game is set into Acts and once you have completed them you can move onto harder difficulties), but also adds something of it's own into the mix such as having no currency in the game. Path of Exile is what Diablo 3 should have been and totally takes the cake between the two. The amount of content in the game is astounding and sometimes I can't believe that this game is free-to-play. Of course, you have your proverbial microtransactions but unlike other games, Path of Exile offers mostly non-competitive items for sale such as more character slots and guild options. Player vs. Player is another great element to the game and from what I have seen it contains 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 and 6 vs 6 arenas though the matchmaking is a bit buggy when joining a queue. So, if you are looking for an overly addicting, loot driven, online hack 'n' slash game with tons of gore and brutality, download this game now!

It has amazing complexity, and though it's not flawless, it's a great gameplay experience. If you want to use 2H axe as a ranger, go for it. If you want to shoot bows with a massive hulking marauder, do it. The game lets you play the way you want to play, but with some limitations that make the builds challenging and unique.\n\nThe economy is also done properly, with no gold, but with usable currency that are used for item modification. Keeps the economy in check and you don't end up with a stock pile of gold that has no real use other than Auction House and the like.\n\n5/5.

The passive tree and skill gems are such unique character building mechanics that they became my favorite part of the game. The currency system has been excellently designed too; each unit of value is not only  valuable because it is money but because currency itself is expendable for varying magical effects on your items, transportation etc. The graphics are beautiful and controls are easy to pick up/remappable.  Some monsters, especially dungeon bosses can be very challenging (not to mention on higher difficulties - Cruel, Merciless) and take multiple tries to beat. The game lets you spawn back into the dungeon with damage you've already dealt persisting on the bosses so eventually you can brute force it if that's what you want to do, unless you are on Hardcore, in which case - Permadeath. Home building is mainly a neat distraction and hub for the Masters you can use to more easily craft powerful gear. My only complaint is that progressing through the whole life of a character to the end game requires that you do the same quest/storyline several times in a sort of new game plus style. The storyline is not bad by any means, in fact the world lore and theme is pretty cool but it can start to get repetitive. One of the best things about it, I've never spent a single dime and I get the same gameplay that anyone else who spends money on it does, because the majority of purchases available, other than more stash room (not necessary they give you plenty) are cosmetic only.\n\nHighly highly recommend to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers, and to anyone who hasn't tried one before, why not give it a shot? Free-2-Play after all.","May 29, 2015","true","629.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The atmosphere is very dark and interesting. Players slowly uncover the secrets behind their exile and Wraeclast. The lore is scattered throughout the game world and really adds to the immersion.\n\nThe passive tree is absolutely massive and extremely diverse, allowing for almost any playstyle imaginable. Skills can be augmented with "Support Gems" to significantly modify what they do and to create some truly outrageous combinations. The amazing unique items in the game only add to the already overwhelming amount of character customization. The result is a theorycrafter's wet dream.\n\nAnother major feature is that there is no "gold" as a form of currency. Instead there are numerous items of varying rarity that modify almost every aspect of items you find. These currency items allow players to custom tailor their gear while simultaneously combating inflation of the economy since they are consumed on use.\n\nThe game also features "Races", which are timed competitve events ranging from a few minutes to a couple hours. Races can have many additional features and restrictions to make them more fun and challenging. Some races are designed to be almost an entire different game mode than the base game. Races are separated by Seasons, allowing players to earn points and win limited time alternate art unique items.\n\nOn top of all this, Grinding Gear Games is one of the most communicative developers I have ever experienced. They are very active in the community and take all suggestions and feedback seriously. Lastly, the game features a completely non pay to win microtransaction model. All game content is available right from the start. Real money will only buy you cosmetic effects to make your character look awesome and a few account features for convenience. I highly recommend trying out Path of Exile if you have even the slightest bit of interest in the genre.","October 30, 2013","true","788.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Thinking about how your passive stats and combination of attacks are all going to synergise with each other is all part of the fun.

You aren't uncompetitive if you don't pay, but you can get cool looking stuff if you do. It's based less on pressure and more on that you want to support Grinding Gear Games and give them money because they've made a fantastic game and asked nothing for it.\n\nThe league system is done really well, with a good economy and the updates and expansions add a lot of cool things, and more addicting loot to massacre armies over.\n\nAlso, lootsplosions FTW.","March 9, 2014","true","68.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's gritty and grimey and it feels like a slog through the legions of hell.\n\nWhere the game really shines is the character creation and theorycraft aspects. You can spend a good hour or so deciding what kind of build you want and what sort of weapons and attacks you're going to use before even clicking that create a new character button. Thinking about how your passive stats and combination of attacks are all going to synergise with each other is all part of the fun. And yet if you don't want to do that it's fairly obvious where to go and what to get to make a successful build anyway (after a bit of practice)\n\nHighly recommended if you're a fan of the Diablo games, and even with the whole PoE vs D3 e-war I'd still try both and see what suits you, they are inherently different games.

If you like it, it is worth supporting them as they have made an enjoyable game that never hounds you to spend money.  One playthrough will take around 20-25 hours, but you will likey want to go back and choose a new character to play with.\n\nThe biggest difference with this game as opposed to other action RPGS is that the skill you have are tied to gems that you pick up and then slot into armor/weapons.  These gems level up by you using them.  You can unslot them and then reslot other gems as you see fit (they maintain their levels).  This allows you to really experiment with builds while not being restricted to specific skills or armor.\n\nJust give it a go.

The difficulty curve is just steep enough to be challenging, without repeatedly reducing you to pounding the keys and screaming incoherently into your mic. The controls and gameplay take some getting used to, but if you've played similar games before you should have no trouble. One thing i found interesting is that there is no in-game currency. Instead, items are purchased using a barter system that uses items you can find while playing, and these items have their own uses as well. You start out with one of six classes, which each have their own strengths and weaknesses. However, the skills and abilities of these classes are infinitly customizable, giving you the freedom to play however you want.

The passive and skill gem system provide considerable customization and drive to improve your character, the visuals while not always AAA standards are fantastic and really help set the mood for the dark forsaken continent of Wraeclast.\n\nI dont listen to the music often as I am typically on mumble with my guild, but the sound design is also fantastic, particularly the Scion character's voice acting, you can truly feel her passion/heartache at the right moments, the game's sound effect often clearly illustrate finer details of the game such as a pile of loot dropping, a unique item dropping or a critical strike.\n\nWith the frequent free content patches and the microtransactions that at the very most increase convenience make you well aware that these developers have the hardcore gamer's best interests at heart while still making the game accessible to newer and more casual players by involving the community in such things as game/build guides as well as a few podcasts that help you keep updated on what new patches mean and how the game's meta is shifting. On top of that the game's streaming community are mostly very helpful and educational with each streamer giving you something to take away and apply to your own character, whether it be one of Ziggyd's beginner guides or Havoc616 and Mathil's  attempts to farm the endiest endgame content imaginable or even Willywonka/Helman/Raizqt for their unique content, there is always something to learn.\n\nIf I had one complaint it would be that a few engine issues keep it from being perfect. oh, and there isnt enough time to do all the builds that I think up.\n\nThank you Grinding Gear Games for giving me such an amazing experience to share with my friends all across the globe.","February 5, 2015","true","830.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First things first it is completely, 100% free to play. There are no lousy gimmicks to be seen here in PoE's microtransaction store, just pure cosmetic/fun items.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. Combat feels satisfying and varied between the different classes.  As of writing this I have tried the ranger, the templar, the shadow, and the witch. All of the game's classes share the same skill tree compromised of hundreds of different passive abilities; you have full freedom to make your unique class/build! Active abilities are in the form of socketable gems. They can be gained through quest rewards or can drop randomly off monsters. They also level up and become stronger as long as you have them equipped and continue to meet their requirements. The inventory system is much like Diablo 2's, and at first I was put off by this (being so limited and all). This actually makes the gameplay better in my opinion. Instead of hoarding loads of useless ♥♥♥♥, you only pick up what you need. Also, did I mention this game does not feature currency?  You won't be collecting gold from your slain monsters, but instead you will be picking up scrolls and orbs that do various things. These items can be used to barter with other players in-game, or to upgrade your own items.\n\nI haven't finished the campaign yet, my highest level character being my ranger (she is roughly halfway through the 2nd act I believe), so I am not sure how long it is.  I'm still learning plenty about the game myself. One thing I can tell you for sure is that I'm having more fun with this game than any other action RPG I've played, period.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Completely free, no pay to win items or advantages can be gained through the cash shop\n-Multiplayer or Solo, your choice\n-Deep skill tree allowing for some great custom builds\n-Interesting story with plenty of dialogue and lore\n-A very generous 25 character slots\n-Fun bartering system\n-Extremely well optimized (I am playing on a buget dell laptop with Intel HD graphics)\n\nCONS:\n\nNone!

Because of the lack of a "standard" currency system such a gold, or coin, players have to be a more evolved breed to approach this game. With a constantly evolving roster of events such as races, seasons and leagues, Path of Exile is the kind of game you can be a bit bored with and come back to months later and feel like you're in a completley new product!\n\nMost of the microtransactions by which the game survives are completely reasonably priced. A few extra bag pages for your stash, a couple cosmetic upgrades so you feel outside the norm, totally worth putting a bit into the company to say thanks for making a real hit.

The graphics are ok, and there is a huge variety of possiblilities about leveling your character. So many that you can experiment and replay the game many times with differents characters and differents skills. That was one of the reasons why I expent more than 230 hours playing. The other reason, a feature called "Hardcore leagues". When you create a new character you can select this league. Is a permanent death style and I love that. I played Diablo that way and I know that is just a matter of quit the game when you die, but I like much that this is included as a part of the game.\n\nSometimes the smallest details make a big difference, and the developers have done a really good job with this game. They are also active improving the game and there are no tricks or pay to win, the game is free. You can buy cosmetic things such a flame texture for your weapon, a new texture for a pice or armor, a pet, etc.\n\nIf you liked once Diablo, try this.

If you're a fan of eerie & spine chilling, fantasy hack 'n' slash games where fighting huge mobs of ghastly creatures and ominous soldiers are the norm, Path of Exile is for you. As many have said already, this game has a very similar feel to the Diablo series and takes a large amount of influence from it (i.e. how the game is set into Acts and once you have completed them you can move onto harder difficulties), but also adds something of it's own into the mix such as having no currency in the game. Path of Exile is what Diablo 3 should have been and totally takes the cake between the two. The amount of content in the game is astounding and sometimes I can't believe that this game is free-to-play. Of course, you have your proverbial microtransactions but unlike other games, Path of Exile offers mostly non-competitive items for sale such as more character slots and guild options. Player vs. Player is another great element to the game and from what I have seen it contains 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 and 6 vs 6 arenas though the matchmaking is a bit buggy when joining a queue. So, if you are looking for an overly addicting, loot driven, online hack 'n' slash game with tons of gore and brutality, download this game now!

Free helps as most of the flaws don’t seem quite so harsh at that price. You’ll click on wave after wave of bad guy as you roll the loot piñata dice in hopes that this time the Staff of Iwin drops. Path of Exile is a fun little game that you’ll find yourself loading up from time to time to kill a couple of waves of bad guys before your wrist starts to hurt. 7/10.\n\nThe Good—\nFree: Only costs bandwidth and time to download.\nCharacters: Lots of character classes.\nItems: Lots of stuffs with skills being placed on gem drops to make the game different.\nGrinding: Now with 10% less hamster wheel.\nOnline Community: Friends need only apply.\nLeagues: Lots of different events and contests for frequent players.\nUpdates: Fairly often with new expansions and drastic changes to gameplay to keep the game interesting.\n\nThe Bad—\nRepetitive: You better like killing snakes in the forest zone, because you’ll do lots of it.\nGraphics: Not bad, but worse than the competition. Much worse.\nOnline: People who are not your friend will annoy you. Greatly.\nIn Game Purchases: Currently, this isn’t bad but things could easily be changed to bad and make the game not worth running.\n","August 31, 2014","true","60.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The passive tree is like stars in the sky and you make constellations and ♥♥♥♥.  You then use these weird gem ♥♥♥♥ things to attack undead women that shoot period blood out of their breasts. You put these gems in your armour and weapons, this is like bedazzling but in a hardcore rpg sense.  I've always wanted to bedazzle a two handed axe and make it look pretty. You make these attacks n stuff with your new barbie axe and whack the living ♥♥♥♥ out of tentacle squid things and mutant crabs.  You regularly get fisted and ♥♥♥♥♥ and drink magical potions that refill from the blood of your enemies.  This is barbie hardcore.  If you liked Barbie Dreamhouse Party but are looking for something more exquisite, look no further.  Path of Exile is just the game for you.  In terms of customization it is 8/10.  The only reason being because there aren't any high heels or purses in the game so I don't get the feel of being a princess, but thats made up for because of the lack of pants I have on my old dude character.

The passive tree and skill gems are such unique character building mechanics that they became my favorite part of the game. The currency system has been excellently designed too; each unit of value is not only  valuable because it is money but because currency itself is expendable for varying magical effects on your items, transportation etc. The graphics are beautiful and controls are easy to pick up/remappable.  Some monsters, especially dungeon bosses can be very challenging (not to mention on higher difficulties - Cruel, Merciless) and take multiple tries to beat. The game lets you spawn back into the dungeon with damage you've already dealt persisting on the bosses so eventually you can brute force it if that's what you want to do, unless you are on Hardcore, in which case - Permadeath. Home building is mainly a neat distraction and hub for the Masters you can use to more easily craft powerful gear. My only complaint is that progressing through the whole life of a character to the end game requires that you do the same quest/storyline several times in a sort of new game plus style. The storyline is not bad by any means, in fact the world lore and theme is pretty cool but it can start to get repetitive. One of the best things about it, I've never spent a single dime and I get the same gameplay that anyone else who spends money on it does, because the majority of purchases available, other than more stash room (not necessary they give you plenty) are cosmetic only.\n\nHighly highly recommend to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers, and to anyone who hasn't tried one before, why not give it a shot?

The story is probably the best part however of the game because you can ignore it if you wish and not miss anything or you can go with it and love its style. Every different class tells their story differently and a few of them you ether feel for or fear. Although the name Diablo clone doesn't have the best reputation to it don't take it as a negative aspect.

If you want to shoot bows with a massive hulking marauder, do it. The game lets you play the way you want to play, but with some limitations that make the builds challenging and unique.\n\nThe economy is also done properly, with no gold, but with usable currency that are used for item modification. Keeps the economy in check and you don't end up with a stock pile of gold that has no real use other than Auction House and the like.\n\n5/5.

Free helps as most of the flaws don’t seem quite so harsh at that price. You’ll click on wave after wave of bad guy as you roll the loot piñata dice in hopes that this time the Staff of Iwin drops. Path of Exile is a fun little game that you’ll find yourself loading up from time to time to kill a couple of waves of bad guys before your wrist starts to hurt. 7/10.\n\nThe Good—\nFree: Only costs bandwidth and time to download.\nCharacters: Lots of character classes.\nItems: Lots of stuffs with skills being placed on gem drops to make the game different.\nGrinding: Now with 10% less hamster wheel.\nOnline Community: Friends need only apply.\nLeagues: Lots of different events and contests for frequent players.\nUpdates: Fairly often with new expansions and drastic changes to gameplay to keep the game interesting.\n\nThe Bad—\nRepetitive: You better like killing snakes in the forest zone, because you’ll do lots of it.\nGraphics: Not bad, but worse than the competition. Much worse.\nOnline: People who are not your friend will annoy you.

The passive tree and skill gems are such unique character building mechanics that they became my favorite part of the game. The currency system has been excellently designed too; each unit of value is not only  valuable because it is money but because currency itself is expendable for varying magical effects on your items, transportation etc. The graphics are beautiful and controls are easy to pick up/remappable.  Some monsters, especially dungeon bosses can be very challenging (not to mention on higher difficulties - Cruel, Merciless) and take multiple tries to beat. The game lets you spawn back into the dungeon with damage you've already dealt persisting on the bosses so eventually you can brute force it if that's what you want to do, unless you are on Hardcore, in which case - Permadeath. Home building is mainly a neat distraction and hub for the Masters you can use to more easily craft powerful gear. My only complaint is that progressing through the whole life of a character to the end game requires that you do the same quest/storyline several times in a sort of new game plus style. The storyline is not bad by any means, in fact the world lore and theme is pretty cool but it can start to get repetitive. One of the best things about it, I've never spent a single dime and I get the same gameplay that anyone else who spends money on it does, because the majority of purchases available, other than more stash room (not necessary they give you plenty) are cosmetic only.\n\nHighly highly recommend to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers, and to anyone who hasn't tried one before, why not give it a shot? Free-2-Play after all.","May 29, 2015","true","629.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The passive and skill gem system provide considerable customization and drive to improve your character, the visuals while not always AAA standards are fantastic and really help set the mood for the dark forsaken continent of Wraeclast.\n\nI dont listen to the music often as I am typically on mumble with my guild, but the sound design is also fantastic, particularly the Scion character's voice acting, you can truly feel her passion/heartache at the right moments, the game's sound effect often clearly illustrate finer details of the game such as a pile of loot dropping, a unique item dropping or a critical strike.\n\nWith the frequent free content patches and the microtransactions that at the very most increase convenience make you well aware that these developers have the hardcore gamer's best interests at heart while still making the game accessible to newer and more casual players by involving the community in such things as game/build guides as well as a few podcasts that help you keep updated on what new patches mean and how the game's meta is shifting. On top of that the game's streaming community are mostly very helpful and educational with each streamer giving you something to take away and apply to your own character, whether it be one of Ziggyd's beginner guides or Havoc616 and Mathil's  attempts to farm the endiest endgame content imaginable or even Willywonka/Helman/Raizqt for their unique content, there is always something to learn.\n\nIf I had one complaint it would be that a few engine issues keep it from being perfect. oh, and there isnt enough time to do all the builds that I think up.\n\nThank you Grinding Gear Games for giving me such an amazing experience to share with my friends all across the globe.","February 5, 2015","true","830.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Looks gorgeous, sounds pleasantly, runs smoothly, feels very good to play. There is certainly a cathartic "oomph" to the combat and the killing. Also, the F2P model is possibly the most honorable. The only items sold are cosmetics and stash storage space -- they're not cheap, but they don't impact the game.\n\nThere's a choice of 6 classes, which are presented to you much in the style of ol' Diablo 2: Templar, Shadow, Marauder, Ranger, Duelist and Witch. Unlike the old game, however, each class is very maleable and inter-changeable, in both passive skills and active abilities. The latter come in the form of gems, colour-code in regards to which attribute they adher to: green for Dexterity, red for Strength and blue for Intelligence.\nEach class has 2 initial direct paths of skills. A ranger, for instance, can choose to excel with bows, at range, or go the path of duel-wielding in melee combat. And at later stages, new, farther branches of passive skills are available to customize your character with, allowing you to mold your character's combat aptitude in detail.\nThis might seem complex at first, but do not be drawn away, it's really quite simple and easy to map out.\nLastly, I've noted nothing in the ways of bugs, glitches or significant imbalances.\n\nHeartily reccommended to any Diablo player!","March 10, 2014","true","217.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Looks gorgeous, sounds pleasantly, runs smoothly, feels very good to play. There is certainly a cathartic "oomph" to the combat and the killing. Also, the F2P model is possibly the most honorable. The only items sold are cosmetics and stash storage space -- they're not cheap, but they don't impact the game.\n\nThere's a choice of 6 classes, which are presented to you much in the style of ol' Diablo 2: Templar, Shadow, Marauder, Ranger, Duelist and Witch. Unlike the old game, however, each class is very maleable and inter-changeable, in both passive skills and active abilities. The latter come in the form of gems, colour-code in regards to which attribute they adher to: green for Dexterity, red for Strength and blue for Intelligence.\nEach class has 2 initial direct paths of skills. A ranger, for instance, can choose to excel with bows, at range, or go the path of duel-wielding in melee combat. And at later stages, new, farther branches of passive skills are available to customize your character with, allowing you to mold your character's combat aptitude in detail.\nThis might seem complex at first, but do not be drawn away, it's really quite simple and easy to map out.\nLastly, I've noted nothing in the ways of bugs, glitches or significant imbalances.\n\nHeartily reccommended to any Diablo player!","March 10, 2014","true","217.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The passive and skill gem system provide considerable customization and drive to improve your character, the visuals while not always AAA standards are fantastic and really help set the mood for the dark forsaken continent of Wraeclast.\n\nI dont listen to the music often as I am typically on mumble with my guild, but the sound design is also fantastic, particularly the Scion character's voice acting, you can truly feel her passion/heartache at the right moments, the game's sound effect often clearly illustrate finer details of the game such as a pile of loot dropping, a unique item dropping or a critical strike.\n\nWith the frequent free content patches and the microtransactions that at the very most increase convenience make you well aware that these developers have the hardcore gamer's best interests at heart while still making the game accessible to newer and more casual players by involving the community in such things as game/build guides as well as a few podcasts that help you keep updated on what new patches mean and how the game's meta is shifting. On top of that the game's streaming community are mostly very helpful and educational with each streamer giving you something to take away and apply to your own character, whether it be one of Ziggyd's beginner guides or Havoc616 and Mathil's  attempts to farm the endiest endgame content imaginable or even Willywonka/Helman/Raizqt for their unique content, there is always something to learn.\n\nIf I had one complaint it would be that a few engine issues keep it from being perfect. oh, and there isnt enough time to do all the builds that I think up.\n\nThank you Grinding Gear Games for giving me such an amazing experience to share with my friends all across the globe.","February 5, 2015","true","830.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because of the lack of a "standard" currency system such a gold, or coin, players have to be a more evolved breed to approach this game. With a constantly evolving roster of events such as races, seasons and leagues, Path of Exile is the kind of game you can be a bit bored with and come back to months later and feel like you're in a completley new product!\n\nMost of the microtransactions by which the game survives are completely reasonably priced. A few extra bag pages for your stash, a couple cosmetic upgrades so you feel outside the norm, totally worth putting a bit into the company to say thanks for making a real hit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theydonbois/recommended/238960/","theydonbois","Theydon Bois","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theydonbois/","364 products in account","I thought I would try and write up a few words about this game, as I really enjoy the ARPG games and played through most of them (Diablo I & II, Titan Quest & IT, Torchlight I & II, Van Helsing, and only don't have D3 due to cost - though this may change when the patch comes) and for me, the Daddy of them all has been Titan Quest. I probably sunk 200+ hrs in that and Immortal Throne (they don't show on my Steam games as I had them pre-steam and loved the game so much I rebought them on Steam) and played through the game on all three difficulty ratings.\n\nSo how does Path of Exile square up to these other great ARPG's? Bloody good actually. Really bloody good.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe effects on everything are superb, the gem levelling, the elemental attacks, the frozen or burning mob/player effects, the animations for mobs blinking, tunnelling, dissolving, ghosting, all of it. The backdrops for locations (towns, villages, caves, forests, battlegrounds) are lush with a huge amount of detail, the characters look excellent, with a large amount of clothing variants.\n\nMaps\n\nExcellent. How many ways can you actually put dead ends into a seemingly open ended area? You will be surprised, and they do it very well. With some much detail, the minimap adds yellow 'corridors' to show connecting areas in case the foliage or camera angle is in your way, and there are plenty of variations - cave textures are repeated more often than not, but I suppose its quite hard to come up with new ways to portray rocks, so I will let them off that.\n\nMobs\n\nA Huge amount of variation with the usual casters, fighters and ranged mobs, and then mixed abilities, casting, teleporting, swarms, etc. There is a nice mix of normal and yellow bosses, and then end of act bosses. I think I would have liked to see more 'bigger than yellow but less than end of act bosses' like in TQ, but other than that, jolly good indeed.\n\nSkill Tree & Classes\n\nAh, the bread and butter of all ARPG's, the skill tree. This is where PoE fails, as it has no skill tree at all! Instead, it has a freaking skill WEB. No mere tree for this game, but a spiders web that depending on class, your start point changes. You gain skill points per level and for completing some quests and you can customise your (one of 6) classes to a stupid amount of variations. I thought TQ ability to combine two classes and then pick and choose from their respective trees brilliantly varied, but this is something else.\n\nLoot\n\nAh, the loot. You want to pour of the minute of the items found, min/maxing to gain resists/hp/regen/dps? You will spend hours doing so. You want the ability to create and improve items? You will spend hours doing so. You want to take your item as you like the look of it, wipe it, and new stats, add sockets and reforge links? You will spend hours doing so.\n\nLike most other ARPGs, you never seem to find the right item for your class, but this only makes you want to farm and then replay the whole game again on the next difficulty. There are sockets to add spells and effects to your attacks, and gems to improve the quality of the items - so the combinations of items available is staggering.\n\nOverall\n\nSo add them all together and what have you got? A cracking game, and even diehard 'nothing will beat Titan Quest' ARPGers will admit that this is fantastic. The game itself is free, and you really do not need to spend a penny to enjoy it - I may drop some money on it to say thanks rather than any real need to want a shiny effect on my hat or glowing footprints (even though they do look smart) A fourth act or more locations per act may have tipped it over the edge, but this is right up there, surpassing both Torchlights and Van Helsing, and right on the tailcoats of TQ.\n\nThere is simply not an excuse to not download this on Steam right now.","January 10, 2014","true","32.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

Within the seven classes, there are at least a couple hundred builds that are fundamentally different.\n\nHowever, not only the playstyles of characters vary a lot, but the way enemies try to defeat you as well. The game progressively introduces concepts such as rogue exiles, enemies that use group skills, auras, shrines, ghosts haunting bosses, blood magic etc. that keep raising the difficulty while keeping it skill, and not gear-dependent.\n\nIn the endgame, players often find themselves making dozens of actions/decisions per second, dodging different projectiles, spells and charging monsters, using flasks, teleporting, modifying auras, applying curses in order to stay alive. Not only there are a lot of things to do once the main storyline is complete (after about 6 hours, plus another 10 for the next two difficulties), but simply fighting diverse endgame bosses is an exhilarating challenge in itself.","July 11, 2015","true","230.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

I'm not gonna go into too much specifics, but good-God, as my first time viewing the steam-store page, they really picked some deceptively scrolled-all-the-way-in and an obssession with lots of swirling and radially-ejecting spells. There is a bit of that in this game but I don't necessarily think the spell-groups displayed in the first screenshots really give an accurate feel for the game itself. Bite me.\n\nTLDR:: For those of you who wanna cut straight to the cheese:\n\n1] NOT pay-to-win (unless you count extra stash space... the only other form is cosmetics... not even exp boost)\n\n2] The level of content, customizeablity, utility and versatility (spell gems), and amount of spell-gem combinations is quite honestly, somewhat staggering.\n\n3] This is not the type of game you can play if you have kids. In other words it's really time consuming and you can screw-up really easy in Hardcore. So just be wary. Also be wary of some particularly toxic players who may try to rip you off or bully you, but 96% of people on here are okay people, friendly and are glad to help.\n\n4] Don't troll excessively (everyone hates that) but make jokes about Jews or Feminism (or gays, and now transgender who knows), and you can pretty much gaurantee a strike on your account, and you don't want that.\n\n5] Not going to really draw any conclusions based off my last point: but this is no pushover development company, and the certainly know what they're doing. PVP and loads of content, and an atom-bomb coming soon when they drop 2.0","June 22, 2015","true","204.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Sure, I played D3 through but rather forcing myself than with relish, and I absolutely agree with the opinion that PoE is a way better match for the Diablo franchise than D3 itself. At least, it features the right look & feel, proper dark atmoshere, tons of customizable loot, much more interesting character development, and last but not least - appropriate size and length. And on top of all that it's completely free! "Free to play" but not "pay to win", so you can enjoy it to the full without spending a single cent.\n\nThe downsides? Yeah, they exist too, but I'd describe them to be minor and inessential. Permanent connection to the server in a single-player game (but that's commonplace nowadays), somewhat bad placement of waypoints across locations which eventually forces you to replay certain (quite large) locations twice or even more times, rather sophisticated skill tree (not necessarily a bad thing). But the rich core gameplay pays it all off, I must say.\n\nIn any case, I strongly recommend this brilliant game to all RPG fans and to anyone who loves good games no matter what genre they are. Despite some minor flaws, it is fully capable to carry you off the reality for some considerable time and give you bright and memorable experiences.","June 22, 2014","true","50.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a steep learning curve and can be somewhat punishing, but that's also what makes winning feel so rewarding.\n\nThe devs have kept their promise of making the game truly free. Most microtransactions confer cosmetic changes. The only microtransaction that actually affects gameplay is unlocking additional stash tabs (bank storage space). I found that when I only had one character, it was pretty easy to stay within the limits of the default 4 tabs. After a hundred hours of gameplay, I felt like a small payment to be able to hoard more items was more than justifiable (and a bit more to make my new character look super cool!).\n\nThe game is also kept interesting by regular challenge leagues where you start a new character in a separate game world with a fresh economy and different gameplay rules.\n\nAt a low low price of free, it's definitely worth a go!","February 25","true","355.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's not intended as a diss of D3 - plenty of fun to be had there. But Path of Exile takes the ground laid by D2 and extends it with a skill-crafting system that stands as one of the great accomplishments of the genre. The level of customization that is potentially open to a long-term player of PoE borders on the absurd, and we're not talking about cosmetics here. You craft your *abilities*, and if that notion strikes a chord with you, then you should get started playing this thing ASAP.\n\nIt's far from perfect. PoE suffers from an unfriendly new-player experience, a looooong on-ramp to The Awesome, and constant trouble with lag spikes leading to player deaths (yes, the game is 100% server-driven).

That's not intended as a diss of D3 - plenty of fun to be had there. But Path of Exile takes the ground laid by D2 and extends it with a skill-crafting system that stands as one of the great accomplishments of the genre. The level of customization that is potentially open to a long-term player of PoE borders on the absurd, and we're not talking about cosmetics here. You craft your *abilities*, and if that notion strikes a chord with you, then you should get started playing this thing ASAP.\n\nIt's far from perfect. PoE suffers from an unfriendly new-player experience, a looooong on-ramp to The Awesome, and constant trouble with lag spikes leading to player deaths (yes, the game is 100% server-driven). But these annoyances will not interfere with the genre afficianado being entranced by how thoroughly this game has shown what a bit of creativity and hard work can do for a well-established genre.","March 5, 2014","true","105.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has a PvP and Co-op options which allows you to interact with others or your friends through your journey across Wraeclast. Let's talk about the free2play model, it is not Pay2Win.

This is the best thing that came out of NZ, since Peter Jackson.\n\nYes, the very famous description of Path of Exile is pretty accurate. This game IS what Diablo 3 should have been. Simply because Grinding Gear made some very brave decisions that Blizzard was too afraid to make.\n\nSkill runes was on the table for D3 for a long time but Blizzard didn't go through with it. GG did and it paid off. It works perfectly and brings another dimension to looting. It's rewarding enough to make you stick with a set of skills and flexible enough to get you to try different things. Concept of linking gems is almost perfect and I love experimenting with it.\n\nRemoval of gold and the barter system is a very bold decision. A big name studio wouldn't have considered this because it makes the game too complicated for noobs and people who would want to buy their way through obstacles. It breaks the cycle of loot/sell and forces you to think about what you're going to do with your loot. I mean you can trade your Orb of Chances for an item you like or you can use them to get something better. It's a quite exciting concept for a purist looter.\n\nAnother bold decision which makes this game a little complicated for a newbie is the colossal passive skill tree. I think this decision is a clear indication of who GG's target audience for PoE. To be succesful, you have to study the whole skill tree and plan your route. You can't just randomly allocate points and hope to survive. Not many games nowadays, encourages players to actually "think" and "plan". These words are considered "out of fashion" and "bad for business" in today's gaming world.\n\nYeah, these are pretty brave decisions but what is bolder than giving your precious game free and having only cosmetic microtransactions in it? As if the guys in Grinding Gear tried to do opposite of everything Blizzard did with D3. "Blizzard put a $70 price tag on the game and tried to suck even more money out of the games with their RMAH. Alright, let's make PoE free and have no way of buying success in this game." This is truly a noble strategy and because of this, first time I finished PoE during public beta, I felt that I owed these guys something. I bought cosmetic improvements for the first time in my gaming life and it felt bloody good. I will do it again as long as I keep playing the game.\n\nThe game is all round well polished and very skillfully executed. All the bold decisions I mentioned above made PoE truly a great game. But unfortunately, I wouldn't give it a 10/10.\n\nThere's one decision prevents me calling this game "perfect" and it's decision that doomed D3 from the start: Having to be online to play a single player campaign. You can give me the logical reasons behind this decision but none of them would be convincing enough to change my mind about this. I understand that it's a richer experience with a party and multiplayer is well integrated to the game, but, I simply do not want lag during a single player campaign session. It's not so much of an issue at the start but once you make it to 60+ maps, lag/loss turns into your biggest enemy. I mean, it doesn't make it unplayable but it's quite annoying when I lose 15 mins of experience because of 1 second of lag. I can't see why this game cannot have an offline single player campaign and my rating will stay at 9/10 until this becomes the reality.","January 6, 2014","true","179.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I am always keeping up with the changes that GGG are making to their game. It does have its faults, the crafting system is not rewarding to casual players and the LFG message board has turned into a trade board. GGG have stated they are wanting to address this in the near future and unlike many companies who say "the near future", I believe them.\n\nAfter everything is said and done, if you like personalization in all aspects of your ARPGS, nothing on the market comes close to Path of Exile.","December 21, 2013","true","405.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Through the variations of character selection and weapon/armor  types it is just absolutely superior to all other games.  Through my career of working for Riot games I have earned the opportunity to play and help design many variations of video games.  I truly believe that no other game compares to this one.  Path of exile is a game that you will not soon forget and will not easily get bored of. Path of exile leads you to many hours of action packed game play.  From the start of the game you are immediately thrown into action as you wash up on the shore and you find that everyone is dead around and you are surrounded by flesh eating zombies as well as many other creatures.  You have to fight your way through the unforgiving world as you collect new weapons, armor, stones, wands, and many other achievable items.  I believe that this is the best action RPG I have ever played.","March 3, 2014","true","073.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
