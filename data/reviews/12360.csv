Basically Flatout 2 with a DLC in it would be the best way to describe it. In truth it was a re-release of Flatout 2, not exactly sure why.\n\nI hate racing games. So for me to like a racing game it must be pretty damn fun. A garage where you can purchase and upgrade many vehicles. Your car takes lots of damage and so do the other cars. You can visibly see the damage of all the cars. You can totally wreck your car out of the race and you can also take out opponents by causing enough damage to the AI cars.\n\nSome of the best feeling cars in a simulation. It doesnt feel "arcadey" yet cars become very managable at high speeds. There is even a crash durby mode.\n\nWARNING - Don't even think about Flatout 3. Totally different company did that one and unless you want to see an example of the worst race game ever don't bother. Flatout 2 is the best in the series.\n\nSERIOUSLY - No idea if the forum is still up for Flatout 3 but at some point I was wondering if they were going to shut it down because of SOOO many complaints. Have you ever bought a game programming book with an example race game in it? Flatout 3 was worse than that.","October 29, 2013","true","11.7"," 69 of 74 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","69","74","0","0"

What is Flatout UC and what makes it tick?\nBasically, an upgraded Flatout 2 with some chievs and stuff. But saying that isn't helping much so lets just do a list of pros and cons. Cons first.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- uses GFWL\n- that glitch with rubbish on the road that normally should just bump from the car but that one critical time impales your car thru the middle and makes it vault into the air when you could have got that new lap record or won a hard race.\n- online races are either stomps or annoying\n- not the best graphics, but good enough\n- you might not like all the modes of the game. personally i think stunts are fun in between some normal races with friends. Not a fan of the derby mode, timerun or unbalanced online games.\n- way too much nitro as default\n\n\nPros:\n\n- you can overshoot the bowling lane to spell "BO...NG"\n- the commentator in stunts when he gets all excited\n- seeing a ragdoll AI driver overtaking your car briefly as you hear the car had crashed behind you\n- half a lap behind when only 2 laps remain? NOT a problem. You might still win.\n- getting that flatout (doubletap throttle and hold) turn in the curve going exactly as you wanted\n- playing close races with friends and then continuing racing online together against the world\n- old but still going strong. same applies to game.\n- more fun than many other racing games out there. the pioneer of derbylike racing games.\n- no cliché storyline, just start racing and have fun.\n- do you prefer to race on gravel, at racetracks or to demolish a shopping mall with your car? Look no further.\n- match options are ok and exist. typically put 100% upgrades, no bonus and half or less nitro + only half damage and it's pretty cool.\n\nIf you like arcadeish, not too serious derbyracing with some amount of destructive environment with a flair of stunts, sterotypical AI characters, non-copyrightinfringing carbrands and something slightly more than flatout 2 i'm not sure why you're reading this after watching the trailer, just put it in the cart already you scrub.\n\n8/10","June 13, 2015","true","222.3"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","38","39","2","0"

So I'll leave my review on that here to say that it's the worst driving game to ever exist.\n\nBut, FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is extremely fun! I remember a few years back, I was in year 10 at high school, and FlatOut 2 had done the rounds on people's USB sticks. So a lot of us were playing LAN (is that still a thing?) battles of FlatOut 2 demolition derbies, and I absolutely loved it.\n\nIf you've played that game and loved it, you'll love this... mainly because it's basically the exact same game, bar a few changes such as better graphics. AI players are the same, FlatOut mode is the same from what I remember. It's just updated a bit. Oh well, still a great game. Buy it! And don't buy FlatOut 3! Even ignore the ultimate FlatOut bundle. It's worth paying that little bit extra to say that you never owned that piece of garbage.\n\nOh, and also, I've had no loading issues or any crap with this game, even on Windows 10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/12360/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","To me, this is one of the best racing/crashing games there are. I can say with confidence this game is a lot better than Burnout.\n\nAlthough burnout paradise might seem like the best crash and do work games out there, Flatout Ultimate Carnage does give it a solid challenge. I like the unique approach that was taken towards the circuits. It is a little slow going at first as the cars do not have that much power, but over time when certain upgrades kick in and money starts flowing, so do the hits. I find the challenge to get to first place is fun. If your like me though and like smashing cars instead of racing, you still get your fair share of credits towards savings for a new car or improvements to a current one. At first (as I've said) when you play the crashing is slow, but upon purchasing your second car (venom for me) you'll get into some fun crash dynamics. If you go fast enough and hit a stationary object hard enough, your character will come flying out of the car. Yes, you lose time and maybe your place in the race, but you get turbo the more time you are air born! Unlike burnout, this game strives on continuous hits. In burnout, you hit a car once and you are able to send it flying.\n\nWith Flatout, you're going to need a better reason to send someone on their way. Hits are decent when racing throughout on straightaways, but coming up on a turn serves the best opportunity to deal a lot of damage. Nitro is available and refills every successful hit or jump that is performed. Nitro adds that sweet satisfaction when coming into contact with another car. The animation and feeling they have created when coming into a collision especially when holding the nitro button down, was done absolutely right. One player racing modes do not feel like a grind and the thought of boredom doesn't dare prod it's head.... until you complete the 3 racing classes and the last "open" class is available. By then, unless you are a hardcore fan, you may stop playing with such a dedication. A great addition to the game was the mini-games section which includes derby's, launch your guy out of your car into bowling pins, launching your guy into a soccer net... you know the regular stuff you see in the news paper saying that video games take it too far. The mini-games add a great depth to the game, and offer an alternative to racing. Absolutely nailed it here. The AI is also a dangerous threat at any time. I thought I was crazy, but some of these buggers will go off course then come flying back in off a jump. They all feel different and they all feel like they want to race. They do of course, want to hit you, but it doesn't seem one sided to the point where the player is becoming frustrated due to being targeted all the time.\n\nThe graphics are appropriate for a racing game, neither over the top or too cartoon-y. The fact that they made it possible to destroy the starting gate is amazing. There is a lot of breakable and explode-able objects found throughout each map. This alone makes it stand out from a lot of other racing games. Sounds are good overall while crash sounds are seem to be on the spot while engine sounds are satisfactory (and vary). Music seems to be really heavy into the pop rock.\n\nFOR FUTURE FLATOUT GAMES : The only way they could have made this game better is adding local co-op into the mix. There is a two player mode in the mini-games section, but no one likes passing over a controller to play. Having multiplayer online should be mentioned as it ran smooth for me when needed.\n\n\n\nRATING : rock-SOLID 8.0/10\n\n\n\nScreenShots :\nThe AI sometimes for fun likes to hitch a ride on someone else's car\n\nThe map designs are quite unique and have a lot of hidden paths within them\n\nI'm really not joking when I mean the AI like to get creative\n\nI just turned slightly and next thing I knew, I was getting smashed\n\nIf you hit something hard enough, your character goes flying from your windshield\n\nAt the start of every race, a flying camera takes you around the track to familiarize yourself\n\nWhat I like about the game the most is that the environment can be broken and manipulated\n\nAlternate route part 1\n\nAlternate route part 2. I've seen AI's try and successfully take this route while others biffed it","June 25, 2014","true","27.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Cars feel like they have real weight, to the point that my fingers hurt from steering after an intense session. I went from this to Burnout for a minute and it felt like going from driving hyper-fast tanks to toy cars.\n\nHere's my complaints:\n-The color pallette is straight out of Quake. Wish it was a little less muddy.\n-The music is awful. I wish there was an option to change it out. If you like radio hard rock you'll like this. I do not.\n-It's sometimes difficult to tell what piece of debris is going to turn into a major wreck vs act like flying scraps of paper. Nearly everything in this game is destructible and debris stays around, which is fun but sometimes the physics are unpredictable.\n-Games for Windows Live. If the service is dead, why does it still sign me out of my Xbox when I play this game?\n\nOther than those complaints, I really enjoy this game. I only tend to like arcade-y racers, like Burnout and Project Gotham. This fits nicely in there. I bought 15 games or so recently and this has gotten the most play.\n\n","July 5, 2015","true","460.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonicTWDKenny/recommended/12360/","SonicTWDKenny","TWD Kenny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonicTWDKenny/","205 products in account","So I recently bought the FlatOut: Complete Pack which came with every FlatOut game. I had already spent a good 1/3 (give a retake) of my childhood playing FlatOut 2 on my PS2. I played all of the other FlatOut games that I had just bought and it came down to this game.\n\nNow I have a fairly modern computer which can take most games fairly well on moderate settings with around 30-40 FPS easily and I was hoping to find a FlatOut game that was better than FlatOut 2. When I got into the game (after the setups) I was immediately lagging very badly. I went into the config and toned down the settings wondering why a FlatOut game was actually running bad on my computer because every other FlatOut game ran perfectly on extreme settings.\n\nSo I get it to a moderate frame rate and to my surprise I figured out that this was a totally kick-♥♥♥ HD remake of FlatOut 2. . This game looks absolutely gorgeous and it kept it's same physics and everything from the original game. Although I don't like the lack of cars, this game feels like it was made for a next gen console, it looks that stunning.\n\nThey made the models and textures so amazingly gorgeous, the cars actually look REAL! I absolutely love how they kept most of the original cars from the original game. One thing that I wish they would have done is upgraded the player model, it seems that the developers just used the same model as the one in FlatOut 2. I also wish that they could have stuck with the original soundtrack as I grew to love that soundtrack very much so.\n\nI would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone looking for an HD remake of FlatOut 2 or just a great racing/derby/ragdoll game. I will definitely be playing this game a bit more often and I will give this game a solid 9/10.","February 22, 2014","true","17.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It’s Mario Kart for almost grown up adults. It’s the racing game for people who find continually trying to drive the perfect lap in Forza or GT tedious yet kind of sort of actually secretly like it. I am a Forza/GT fan who typically despises games like Need for Speed, but I loved this.\nThere are some annoying things like Microsoft basically holding you hostage nearly forcing you to make an account in order to play the damn game. Or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port aspect – all menus have prompts like press ○A and the mouse curser isn’t even supported even when friggen annoying Microsoft menus pop up in which you really need a damn mouse. On the plus side it supports non-Xbox controllers.\nThat being said, it’s really a decent game. The racing aspect is super fun and it controls well although there’s obviously a bit of plasticity as it’s a smash up racing game. You’re encouraged to run into other players and take high risks in order to get more boost as opposed to just straight racing, so go ahead, have another one and drive sloppy. There’re plenty of upgrades for cars albeit not as in depth or complex as Forza or GT. There’s a good amount of cars as well so you won’t get bored; there’s always something to look forward to.\nAnd to top it all off there’s a ridiculous arcade and mini-game section where you’ve got to do silly things like make the biggest crash and fling your driver as far and high as possible. This section is particularly fun when you are too high/drunk to actually race.\nIn summary, despite it being poorly ported and having Microsoft’s greasy finger prints all over it, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun and ridiculous racer. Having not played any of the other ones in the series, it seems like Carnage is all you need. Apparently it has virtually all the features of 1 & 2 and more and it doesn’t blow barnyard animals like 3.

These special races are either a time trail, or something even more insane, like for instance a figure 8 track, which means you'll be slamming into opponents in the middle, and those are really fun.\n\nThe controls vary on what car you have(duh) some turn better than others, nothing you wouldn't expect. But as with all racing games, you'll want to play this gem with a controller. You'll need the precise steering a thumbstick gives you, as keyboards aren't too precise when it comes to movement. That, and you'll need the selective throttle. Slam the trigger all the way in, and you go FlatOut, halfway goes halfway etc. This is really very much needed, not only for throttle, but for braking.\n\nAnd jsut when you thought the game wasn't insane enough already, it gives you special events to play. High jumping, toss your driver out of the window as high as you can! Throw him through rings of fire!\n\nDid I mention the music? The music is AMAZING. It'll make you do headbangs as you race full speed down the track. It fits really really well with the game. There's not THAT many tracks though, but they are so good that it does not matter much.\n\nAll of these parts of excellence combined, I give this game a 10/10.\n\nPLAY. THIS. GAME.","January 31, 2014","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Locoweed/recommended/12360/","Locoweed","Locoweed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Locoweed/","2915 products in account","Probably the worst FlatOut of the series.\n\nIt feels like a fail Burnout clone without any of the things that make Burnout fun.\n\nThe music consists of maybe 10 tracks of completely bland, forgettable rock music.\n\nThe challenge mode was ok, but it consisted mainly of boring time trials with a couple of the ejection challenges. Unfortunately most of the best career cars were only unlocked from from getting first place in some of the challenges.\n\nIn the carreer mode, you can get boost from jumps, ramming into debris (sort of), or other cars, but strangely enough, not drifting or near misses.\n\nThe problem is that ramming into things obviously makes you slower, with the chance that you can randomly fly off the road for each thing you hit. The physics are pretty bad sometimes, and combined with the stunning no-steer effect from hitting items or other cars can make things really frustrating.\n\nWhen there's loose crap littered all over the road, do you drive through the large boulder, or the small cardboard box?\nIf you chose boulder, Congratulations! Boulders usually plink harmlessly off the car, while small cardboard boxes can cause you to fly up into the air and flip several times before landing you in a nearby field.\n\nBecause boost is only gained in so few ways, it can make it hard to catch up to first place when in second if there are few jumps on the map. If there are no cars to slam off, and all the loose junk has been knocked out of its initial position (and therefore gives no boost when you hit it agian) and there aren't any jumps, it becomes amazingly hard to catch up to the Designated Winner (the suspiciously fast AI car that rarely gets touched by other cars and can go through most debris without losing any speed)\n\nNow, I understand that stunning (hitting another car with yours and temporarily disabling their ability to steer) is pretty much a given on battle racing games that don't use weapon pickups. What I don't understand is why in this game, you get stunned as well when you hit them first. I can't count how many times I would tap another car, and we would effectively be stuck together, as we couldn't seperate unless either I hit the brakes (the AI never did) or we both flew off the road together. This happened with the AI as well, if they got to close to me, they would not try to turn or follow the track, they would just follow me off the edge of the road/into the wall/field/whatever. At one point I had 3 cars stuck to me, one to the left, one to the right and a car that was sideways in front of me that couldn't or wouldn't move until the whole mass just crashed.\n\nEven runs on maps I knew well and was winning would be ruined if I hit some random thing like a trashbag in the road the wrong way.\n\nAnother problem is that "Reset Car" only worked when it wanted to. Sometimes I could reset right after getting spun backwards or flying into a pole, other times I would have to sit and watch my car flip 20 times in the air for 10 seconds because I ran into a tiny bit of debris.\n\nDuring the final hours when I was truly getting bored, the game consisted of driving a bit, getting completely jacked by the AI cars or some random trash, and restarting the map. Over. And over. And Over.\n\nIt felt like the debris added lots of randomness without adding any fun.\n\nThe game is probably more fun with people, unfortunately, the MP is dead.\n\nCombine all that with the fact that the game is infected with GFWL, earns the game my final score of:\n\nSTAY AWAY!","April 5, 2014","false","23.2"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

As well as racing, you build nitro by crashing into the scenery and anything in your path. Including your opponents. It is easy to forget about the racing and just cause carnage for the sake of it. It won't win you many races mind. This game is a mix of styles. Similar to Burnout, handling is more rally style (quite a bit is off-road) and the power sliding and nitro not unlike Ridge Racer. Whilst this makes for a good fun racer, some of the racing can get a bit 'flat' after a while.\nThe AI in this game is mighty impressive, Each car has its own driver and personality and it often feels like you are racing against humans.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roisworldz/recommended/12360/","roisworldz","Dope Pope -Army (M.IA)-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roisworldz/","239 products in account","I was debating a long time wether to give this game a positive or a negative review. Decided to go for a negative after going through all the bad things, here are the pros and cons.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n** CONS **\n\n* Dumb AI - It will constantly ♥♥♥♥ itself over, and sometimes take your poor soul with it. It has basic "rammimg/disabling" tactics, it doesn't consider other AI's, so 2 or 3 AI's might try to block you from both sides by driving steering to your path, and create some sort of useless triangle of infuriating, frustrating blockage that will keep you all at 70KMPH or less. It's easily fooled in derby mode, you just drive around in circles and watch them destroy eachother, and then butt in for the win.\n\n* Heavy and wonky props - for some reason there are big @ss props on the map, if you're unlucky to hit one of them, you will probably stop to a halt/sub 20KMPH, and should probably press R to restart. It could happen any time, no matter first or last place, first or last lap, you will get ♥♥♥♥ed by it. If it's not big enough to stop you, it's small enough to bounce like a feather OR jam under your car and SEND YOU FLYING/SPIN YOU OUT OF CONTROL. These are way more common than the heavy props, and just as annoying.\n\n* Bad physics in general - Let's say you master the evasion of props. Congrats! now you probably want to slam people the hell out of your way. It will probably not end well for you. Steer clear of people. ( Ironically ) especially in derby mode.  If you try to steer people out of control by slamming to their back sides, they will rotate 90 degrees and you will stick to their T bone like a MAGNET. Don't try to slam people from behind in lower speeds - you will have no effect, and you will stick to their back side like a magnet until you slow down or pass them somehow.\n\n* A terrible difficulty curve - 1st level is easy. Picked the Mustang, left all my opponents in the dust, no upgrades, no nothing. 2nd level? ♥♥♥♥, I couldn't even catch up to them. Had to buy another car and heavily upgrade it to stand a chance, and get mostly 2nd/3rd places ( thanks to props, too ). I'm dominating the side challenges because all I have to do is drive in circles, if not, AI will gang up on you and will ♥♥♥♥ you up in a minute.\n\n* GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE - The world's most terrible, teeth grinding, usless sack of ♥♥♥♥ DRM makes an impressive comeback to this game. If you can't run the game at the first time, it's probably because you need to install Games For Windows Live. It's that terrible. The installation for it is in the game's library somewhere in your Steam library - common - steamapps - FlatOut : Ultimate Carnage. When you enter the game, just go as guest. I couldn't remember my ancient account. You probably wouldn't too.\n\n* Mediocre graphics - This is a 2008 game. 2008. Having played the 2009 hit Burnout Paradise, this looks like a bootleg from 2003-4. At lease it got impressive "destruction" mechanics? kinda. It just creates more crappy glitchy props. No thanks.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n**PROS**\n\n* Easy to get driving mechanic - Gotta give it to them, at least the driving is pretty fun. Drifting is easy to master, all is arcadey as it should be.\n\n* Great soundtrack - Classic "let's **** some ♥♥♥♥ up" rock music. Fits in great, some of the songs I will be listening to again outside of the game.\n\n* What looks like 12-13 hours campagin - It's kinda good for an old game. Yeah, you will spend most of the time trying to redo failed races thanks to stupid AI and terrible props, but it's arcadey and pretty fun.\n\n* Good maps and nice scenery - well, nice 2004 looking scenery, but you get the point. Maps are well designed ( better without the terrible props ).\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nRating - 4/10\n\nRecommended price - 4$ or below ( on deep sales ), usually 20$\n\nShoud you buy it? - If you're into arcade racers with ( potential ) derby elements, sure. I couldn't do any derbying because it's all bugged to hell. I wouldn't get it if it was above 5$.","May 11","false","14.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","5","10","3","2"

So I gave this game a second chance since my last review was negative and I wanted to see if I was wrong.\n\nI caught the game cheating so many times i have forgotten them all.\n\nFor example in one of the race tracks on the left side of the road is a ramp on a truck that you hit and the jump gives you a turbo boost. I'm in last place, i hit the ramp and get boost, none of the other cars hit the ramp but somehow they all stay ahead of me and im still in last place with a heavily modified car.\n\nI want fun not frustration. just deleted this from local content.\n","April 2, 2015","false","61.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Or "are these cars made out of velcro?!"... At this point you might have noticed that I'm writing this review after rage quitting a race so maybe take this with a pinch of salt.\n\nAnnoyingly I like this game, I do but there are so many things that ♥♥♥♥ me off about it. Little things that a lot of the time don't seem to get in the way, until it really matters that is. The traffic cones I mentioned above for example, hit one and that thing will stick to the front of your car for an entire lap. It's really quite distracting. Not too big a deal of you don't use the first persony camera. Trouble is, all the other camera angles suck because of the lack of camera controls. You can look directly behind you and that's it, the amount of times I've inexplicably spun out in an infinite number of directions only to find out that there's a battalion of cars ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my exhaust and man-handling my wing mirrors. On top of that I once lost a race in the final stretch because of a ♥♥♥♥ing umbrella top... seriously, an umbrella slowed me down a great deal and I had to fight so hard not to spin out but it was all in vain as I got gang ♥♥♥♥♥ by a horde of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Now I don't know a great deal about cars or physics but it pisses me off when a car can stop you from having almost any control just by being next to you. You can't pull away and you can use a full tank of nitrous but you won't go anywhere the other car doesn't wanna go, like a petty conjoined twin. Your only option is to brake or crash, both of which I'm too stubborn to accept as an option.\n\nThe problems might primarily stem form my inability to lose, I play racing games the same way I play stealth games; hit retry 87,986 times until I get it perfect. This is another example of Steams rating sytem being ♥♥♥♥, I wouldn't go as far as to not recommend it but as I have to choose and I cannot recommend this game to anyone if, like me (and women everywhere) you either come first or not at all.","September 25, 2015","false","10.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","2","5","3","0"

It has a lot of the right elements, done the right way, which result in a great racing experience, very playable.\n\nThen you get to the difficult end of the spectrum.\n\nIn the dictionary, under the term "nerfed" should be a picture of this game. Regardless of whether you manage to get the top cars, the level of AI, physics and performance changes that occur during the highest races drops the playability level down to all but unplayable. If you have learned the way to properly play and control your car through the various races and levels to get to the end races, you understand the elements around you and the other cars, how they behave. Unfortunately most of that information will do you no good, as the laws of physics suddenly stop applying.\n\nEnemy cars will go from wrecking as you pass them to rocketing past you at 200 mph+. Pieces of paper in the road transform into massive obstacles able to flip your car high into the air on impact. Your car begins to perform like a ford pinto missing a few cylinders: One moment, it handles fine, the next it has no throttle response, no turning control or no brakes, or slides radically sideways if you so much as look as the hand brake button. Step on the gas pedal....it might respond, it might not. If you are really lucky, the wind from a passing car will make yours veer into that oncoming building corner or tree, stopping you instantly.\n\nDon't worry, however, as things will revert just as quickly back to how you have come to understand them, once 3 or 4 of the opponent AI cars have passed you by, leaving you wondering just what the heck happened. You will have time to think about it after you lose the race again.\n\nIn playing this game, or any game, it is understandable that things get progressively harder. However, the "playability" of this game goes way down when the changes that make it harder are such that they are so readily apparent and unfair. You end up thinking "whoa, what the heck just happened?" a lot. Things happen which are beyond explanation and which are beyond you have any effect on whatsoever. There is no counter move you can do, no way to affect change in the situation at all. The outcome just changes, and the only thing you can do is keep the gas pedal down and watch the other cars pass you by.\n\nThe advantages given to the environment and AI cars in this make it a very different game at the end. I loved it up to that point, but there is no way to play against what you know about the game being useless to you when you are playing it. How do you race if gravity or the laws of matter change instantly for a few moments here and there, but never in your favor? There is no way to fight that. If you win, it will most likely be because of some freak bit of luck.\n\nI don't expect it to be easy, but making it seem impossible by yanking victory from your grasp unfairly, and very visibly so, earns it a bad review.

I am so glad I got it for $4.99 when I got the chance. It is incredibly well made and the game is still fun even when it gets frustrating. My only problem with it is that it can be inconsistent at times. I've hit a parked car on the side before and it threw my character out of my vehicle, but another time I hit an AI vehicle in the same place after it spun out and I hardly got dinged. I even got an achivement after that. That can be frustrating sometimes but it is not something that should keep you away from getting this game.

Also they changed the soundtrack. Speaking of soundtrack the Flatout UC songs are nowhere as good as the old ones: I just turn the audio down and hum Alkaline Trio's Oh, mercy me while barreling through the Flatout UC's many detailed tracks. There are single races, cups, demo derbys, online play and even challenges involving hurling the driver from the car for distance, In the end, this game offers a whole lot of races, tracks, upgrades and cars to tear around in.\n\nIf you have a top notch PC this is among the best racers the PC platform has to offer.

Racing. Game. Ever. Well, since Need For Speed: Porsche Unleashed anyway. The physics are incredible, from the weight and handling of the cars in general, to the way they drive on various terrain types. The audio is amazing, changing the sound from hard revving engine and squealing tires on asphalt to dirt and gravel hitting the undercarriage when off-road. The AI drivers are a nice mixture of fairly easy in the beginning to downright dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at the end. The 122 hours I have on record at the writing of this review are all actual play hours (vs. the game just sitting, open and ticking). If you like racing games at all, this game should not be missed. Make sure you have a game pad or wheel. Keyboard can be done with reasonable success at first, but unless you have a gaming keyboard that allows more than the average simultanious key presses, you're going to hit a wall (pun intended) about a third of the way into the game.","July 29, 2014","true","128.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a couple of new gameplay modes and some technical improvements, but that's about it.\n\nStill, the game is enjoyable. It looks a lot better and the physics have been beefed up, which leads to lots of big crashes. The FlatOut 2 campaign was fun, and it's still fun here. The minigames return intact, and they're more addictive than they should be.\n\nFlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is a Games For Windows Live title (you can't run the game without it), and there are over 40 achievements to try and get. Some of them are pretty difficult to obtain, so if you like achievements FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage has them.\n\nFlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is best-suited for people who never played FlatOut 2. However, if you don't have FlatOut 2 anymore and want to play it again, Ultimate Carnage will do the job.","September 17, 2011","true","58.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are very decent, fluid, and the game runs well overall. The tracks and extra events are great too. It requires GFWL to run, though, which sucks but isn't a deal breaker for me. Every race is a chaotic mess of debris and hazards and I absolutely love it.\n\nThat said, the one thing that has always bugged me about this game is its *awful* music. They really couldn't have picked a better lineup of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bands. The worst offering is by Manafest, a song so horrible that I always have to devote some focus while going as fast as I can to changing the song. Fred Durst would have been a tender mercy compared to the lead singer of Manafest, who has a voice that I will sum up thusly: nails on chalkboard.\n\nAnd I find myself spamming the change song button pretty much constantly, because too stubborn to bother with MP3s. However, you can turn the music volume down to zero, keeping all other game sound effects intact and allowing one to use the steam music player, which eliminates all bad in this game in one stroke.\n\nEasily one of the best racing games on offer from Steam.","February 26, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is so much smoother, the handling better, and the higher res graphics mean that you can better see what's coming up and act/avoid accordingly.

Here's why :\n\nI've played FlatOut 2 for ages. And I love it.\nI'm playing FOUC these days, because achievements, 11 opponents (yay more victims \o/ ), carnage mode, nice graphics.\nAnd it's good. It's really a good game.\n\nUnless you played enough FO2 to notice some details:\n\nLet's start with the elephant in the room : no mods. Though I can live without it, I like my AIs with a bunch of muscle cars from the FOJ packs. I don't feel like it's that necessary because of all the cars I've seen in the mod packs, my favourite remains the Bullet GT (ultimate car in the game).\n\nUntil I made my way to the Bullet GT, FOUC was simply FO2 with better graphics and more AIs.\nThen, I unlocked the Bullet GT and lifted an eyebrow. Bugbear, Strike One for changing the visual design of my favourite car. Oh well, I suppose I don't care, I use the bumper view anyway...\n\nThen I upgraded it to the max and noticed the top speed attribute is a mere ~6.5/10. Wait what ? oO\nYup, that's the worst point in the game for me.\n\nI loved playing FO2 because of this car.\nBecause it was stupidly fast.\n9.8 topspeed, 10 acceleration, 4.3 handling, 10 nitro\n0 to 342km/h in a ridiculous number of seconds with nitro.\nBasically a rocket with wheels. And so rewarding when you master it.\n\nSo I went for a test drive with my new FOUC Bullet GT. Obviously, I nitroed all the way to ... 280km/h and sighed.\n\nI'll also mention some tracks have been ... reworked (aka "made easier to race")\n\nBasically, I don't get my fix by playing the Street Grand Finals with my faithful Bullet GT as I did on FO2 on numerous occasions.\nHell, I can't even drive on walls anymore =(\n(fixed physics or simply lack of speed, I'm not sure)\n\nSo, I guess I'll recommend the game because it is good in its core and has more gamemodes than the original.\nBut I'll advise to also get FO2 (or only FO2 if you really have to choose)\n\nI'm kind of sad that I cannot get the best of these two in one game...","February 13, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controller support is full but takes intermediate level setup. Not as fun as the console versions. Leaderboards are maintained by GFWL. Probably not going to log a lot of time on these games. If you are a fan of the series this is the only version actually playable with a controller on PC. Good for nostalgia and an example of a game with full potential but no love for the end-user. It's like sitting in the seat of a concept car. Great idea but it never comes to fruition.","March 29, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andymisandry/recommended/12360/","andymisandry","AND•E•MO•TION","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andymisandry/","735 products in account","This crazy physics destruction derby arcade racing title provides more evidence that its developer, Bugbear, might hate cars almost as much as it loves making games about cars. The numerous ways the vehicles in this game can be dented, smashed, crashed, crumpled, and shredded may well make petrolheads weep tears of dismayed sadness, but then, that's the fun of it. The entertainingly visceral physics engine, that sees cars and environments alike torn apart violently at the slightest touch, provides a fascinating look into what the Burnout games might be like if cars were continued to allowed racing after the otherwise fatal takedowns.\n\nIt refines and expands on Bugbear's previous FlatOut game exponentially, which makes it slightly infuriating that there are unforgiveable surface blemishes on an otherwise impeccable arcade derby racer. The inclusion of Games for Windows Live has basically all but guaranteed that the online community for this game is dead as a doornail, but perhaps worse, in my opinion - and certainly more invasive - is an absolutely wretched soundtrack. Seriously, I don't think I've come across a worse use of licensed music in a videogame.

The numerous ways the vehicles in this game can be dented, smashed, crashed, crumpled, and shredded may well make petrolheads weep tears of dismayed sadness, but then, that's the fun of it. The entertainingly visceral physics engine, that sees cars and environments alike torn apart violently at the slightest touch, provides a fascinating look into what the Burnout games might be like if cars were continued to allowed racing after the otherwise fatal takedowns.\n\nIt refines and expands on Bugbear's previous FlatOut game exponentially, which makes it slightly infuriating that there are unforgiveable surface blemishes on an otherwise impeccable arcade derby racer. The inclusion of Games for Windows Live has basically all but guaranteed that the online community for this game is dead as a doornail, but perhaps worse, in my opinion - and certainly more invasive - is an absolutely wretched soundtrack. Seriously, I don't think I've come across a worse use of licensed music in a videogame. The cheap, faux-metal pop-rock that found its way into this game's soundscape is utterly painful, and I had it switched off almost immediately. I don't quite understand how these music choices were made, save that they were the only they could properly afford.

When the game starts, it logs into Windows and then the main menu appears without a hiccup. The achievements you receive are actually recorded through Windows Live. So again, there's no problem here, you can play with or without it.\n\nThe graphics are NICE, man!\nMUCH better, shinier and sharper than I would've imagined.\nI have it turned all the way up on every setting. It looks gorgeous; much like the hi-res screenshots you see up top (not that video or any YouTube video you come across). It'll leave tire marks on the road when you turn sharply or burn rubber. When the gas station gets ran over, the fireball blast is really sweet. The car models were done with care. I love the junkyard body and paint jobs. Excellent lighting and visuals that can compete with any ENB+SweetFX modded Grid game. The collision damage is NOT on par with Grid, let's make that perfectly clear; but it does get the job done.\n\nThe framerate is spectacular.\nThere are no FPS drops and the game runs smooth as butter. Even Grid has a problem with this from time to time on the best systems (google it). Not this Flatout version, though. Every race has been nothing short of fulfilling track drama at the highest of speeds. Only Gas Guzzlers races are faster...and more...insane!\n\nCustomizing your ride is awesome.\nEvery upgrade has its positives and negatives; but I didn't realize that at first. I tricked my first ride out with all the upgrades, thinking it would be able to just drift to victory with ease. Nope! It was too heavy and beefy to carry all the speed upgrades. So it turned out to be a general ride instead of the General Lee. It gets me 4th place with consistancy. Thank of it as an M1 Abrams in a muscle car frame...with speed enhancements.\n\nThe Tracks!\nHere is where the game comes alive. The tracks run more like Gas Guzzlers Extreme; so you have variances throughout the race. I don't think I've ever made the same lap twice in a single race yet. Almost everything is destructible like in GGE but even more so in this game. I also like the fact that they incorporated ramps to lauch off of. There are times when I really do feel like Beau & Luke Duke in the General Lee. My ride is flying 50 feet off the ground with my confederate flag license plate hanging on by a screw and mud spewing from my undercarriage. We race (and crash) through dirt, asphalt, water...highways, lumber yards, farms, back roads, suburbs, cities...with a combination of each at times. It's awesome, man.\n\nFlatout: UC is what racing should be. Just a few good ol' boys & gals racing cars meant to be raced!\nI still find glee in telling my buddies how I hit a wall, flew out of my front windshield, ragdolled on the cement, and got ran over by my own car moments later.\n\nI love this game.

It is not simple racing game, but destruction race as well, you do not need to finish 1st, it is enough to crash and destroy all opponents - therefore you are only one in the race and you win automatically. All the tracks are full of destructible objects and they look different in the start and in the end, when all the rails, trash and destroyed cars of opponents cover the track.

The biggest change was more drivers on tracks and greater graphical details. I would recommend Ultimate Carnage to everybody who loved the first two games and to people who just like to destroy stuff and enjoy one of the best PC racing games. It runs flawlessly even when it is, like I said, double port. Too bad it is the last FlatOut to this date.\nNO! Just forget that there was anything like Flatout 3.

This game is basicly a slight remake of FO2, but with more racers,  Difrent songs and some gameing modes like beat he bomb and carnage mode. Plays great.  their are only 2 problems i have, 1 is not really a problem but the sound track is kinda Meh to me but that is just my opinon, I created a custom sound track playlist on  youtube to give it a more Flatout feel. the 2nd gripe is the windows live thing. it was a gauntlet for me to get the save feature to work. and with windows live i cant merge my offline save with my Online save. so be aware of that when your playing.","May 24","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my opinion, it's underrated and not as popular as it should be. The game is fun, action-packed, and so addictive! It's is similar to FlatOut 2, however, this game has more game modes and updated graphics comparing to FlatOut 2. And surprisingly enough, the online servers in the game are still running in Ultimate Carnage! The thing is that you will need to download the Games for Windows Live client (remember GFWL back in the days?) because the online servers are run by it. All you need is a Microsoft account, and you can play online. There are a few people playing the game, but I've never come across a time where there was no one playing at all, so there's always a lobby to join. Any who, the game is tremendously fun! It's like Burnout, but different in a few aspects (more realistic, but it still maintains the massive mayhem that it contains) It's an action racing game, and the crashes and wrecks are what the game are great at delivering. There is also stunt mode, which is familiar to FlatOut fans as this mode has been around since the first instalment in the FlatOut series. You are in a huge and vivid stadium, and you are to send your driver flying through the stadium and hit bowling pins, dunk slam them into basketball baskets, hit them with a gigantic baseball bat, and so much more! The stunts are so fun and addictive, and absolutely hilarious because the way the characters move like ragdolls and fly around are funny! There is also a derby game mode, where the cars are parked on the edge of the arena, and they are going to drive and wreck each other, which is fun and addictive too. If you are a multiplayer type of person, then I'd still recommend this game to you, because it's so awesome when it comes to multiplayer (servers are still online). You can do demolition derbies, races, and even stunt modes in online. And the best part is doing stunt modes with other people, as you can see each other flying like ragdolls XD\nThe areas and tracks are also nice and interesting. You can drive on off-road tracks, or race on oval tracks... or even drive through trolleys in malls! The tracks are fun and entertaining!\nIf there was a bad thing about this game... it would be that the cars are too sensitive and slippery comparing to other racing games. They can be brought to a halt by simply hitting traffic cones and chairs.\nBut any who, it doesn't bother me at all, as there are simply too many pros. Brilliant game, brilliant franchise! I'm excited for their next game: FlatOut 4!!! :D :D :D","May 14","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
