And that isn't a complaint. Great game!\n\nTo the devs, defiantly needs a leader board, but also if possible some co-op modes would be interesting if that could be worked out. I know that would be quite a big change but I think it would be worth it, like multiple colors to solve the maze. or perhaps just a racing mode.","March 18","true","8.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

We need leaderboards.  This is such an ideal speedrunner.","March 19","true","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JOHNIV/recommended/428410/","JOHNIV","THE EXCALIBUR OF DILDOS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JOHNIV/","226 products in account","Endless mode is basically unplayable. Game mechanics such as spikes create unfair deaths because there is no way to avoid them (they are invisible until you change to a certain color, and in endless mode you are constantly changing colors just as you land on the next platform). Also if there is a single pixel of you on a block while you switch to it you will die, which serves no purpose. In the main "campaign" levels, turrets are extremely annoying as the game is a 2d platformer.","April 17","false","5.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
