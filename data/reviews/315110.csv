As a child, Dave had no friends due to his quirky behavior, and so videogames became his only company. They filled his imagination and made every day an adventure. The floor was lava. Adults were alien creatures.\n\nOne day, Dave's parents realized he was no longer pretending. Touching the floor resulted in shrieking anxiety attacks and catatonia shortly thereafter. His tendency to pelt adults with breakfast food went from cute to terrifying once he developed the strength to put a classmate in the hospital with a hard-boiled egg.\n\nDave was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mental illness proved unresponsive to standard medication. He had to be involuntarily committed.\n\nBut captivity did not suit Dave.\n\nVenture forth from the confines of the psych ward and take your vengeance on the aliens who seek to deprive you of your freedom and self-determination. But beware, getting too close allows them a chance to dose you with their sedatives. Three doses and you're once again at their mercy, your ears filled with the wailing siren of your oppressors.\n\nBut no jail can hold Dave forever.","November 28, 2014","true","1.9"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","81","26","32","12","2"

It is just Dave vs aliens. The game randomly drops one of two things from the top of the screen. Either an egg or a skull 'block.' You can pick up either one just by running into them and then throwing them with the throw button. There's a catch though. Both objects have timers. When the skull block flashes, that means it'll explode soon. When the egg flashes, that means it will hatch. Both mean death for Dave if he's holding either one.\n\nYou can throw the skull blocks into the eggs to smash them revealing a coin for you to collect. You can throw eggs into aliens to defeat them and leave a coin. While you're combating these aliens, the bottom platform is melting away with lava. Once the floor is gone, the lava slowly rises! If a green hatchling alien falls into the lava, it gets wooshed up to the top of the screen and turns red. Making it a fast alien. When the red aliens hit the lava they get thrown back to the top of the screen again. Then they are blue and can jump from platform to platform. If the blue aliens hit the lava again, they turn into Dave seeking eyeballs that can float through platforms. In a way it feels like Super Crate Box, without the guns, extra levels or extra characters.\n\nEvery once in a while a POW block will drop from the sky. When you smash it against anything but lava, it destroys everything, leaving a coin behind. What are these coins for? A high score of course! Its an arcade game! No points, just coins, which seems like a wasted opportunity. If you get $1.50 in coins, you unlock the bonkers difficulty level. Once you gather a certain amount of coins, the UFO will appear for you to defeat.\n\nThe controls are simple, jump and throw. The weird thing with this game is its gravity. It just feels like there is super gravity or something odd with how fast things fall back down. It doesn't play as well as other 80s arcade games.\n\nThere are no phases, its just one long level. You're in it until you use up all 3 of your lives. The real downside to the game is once you've played it for three lives, you've seen all there is to see. Except maybe the UFO. The level changes color, but there's nothing to unlock like new classic arcade games. It feels one dimensional. Mario Bros had bonus levels and a variety of different enemies instead of an evolution of one enemy.\n\nIf you can keep killing eggs as they spawn from the sky, it makes for a slow, tedious game. If you have a lot of enemies on screen, then it can make for some frantic fun. Then cap it off with a POW block to clear them out and go back to spawn killing them. There is only one song in Woah Dave, and its a great new wave sort of 80s clappy sort of beat.\n\nThere is a local two player mode where two of you on a single screen fight for to collect the most coins before time runs out. There are online leader boards showing the top 10 globally and your friends. For such fierce competition, the scores are far apart. Not just that, but some people have the 10,000 coin achievement, but no one on the global leader board to back it up.\n\nI grew up in the arcade days where every three lives cost you a quarter, so the $5 seems about right. I can't imagine this fitting in shoulder to shoulder with the old classics or even the new ones. It feels like a hastily made cash in that needs some depth and extras. Also, for a game that tries so hard to pattern itself after arcade cabinet games, why do they recommend a 360 or PS controller and not an arcade style joystick?","December 18, 2014","false","1.6"," 34 of 52 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","34","52","0","0"

Eggs, bombs, and whoa blocks fall out of the sky. Every time you destroy and egg or kill a hatched enemy, it will drop a coin. UFOs and motherships are also involved in each stage as it progresses. It's really just that simple.\n\nThe game is fast-paced, twitchy, and very satisfying. The graphics and sound are perfectly and culturally on par with the theme of the game.\n\nI'd say it's probably worth 5 dollars if you really like this type of game, but even if you're not a hardcore fan, picking it up in a bundle or in a sale is a must.","August 2, 2015","true","17.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I’ve been a longtime fan of Choice’s BIT.TRIP series, and seeing how this is their first non-BIT.TRIP game since lilt line back on WiiWare, I was really interested in checking it out.\n\nThe gameplay is super-simple: eggs and skulls fall from the sky. The eggs eventually hatch into aliens, and the skulls eventually explode. Throw skulls and eggs at aliens to collect coins. Don’t touch aliens or explosions. Collect as many coins as possible.\n\nWith really simple, elegant gameplay like that, it’s perfect to play just for a few minutes. I tend to find myself playing for a lot longer, though… I dig it a lot.\n\nDon't go in expecting a ton of modes--there's only one mode and then a harder version of it called “Bonkers Mode.” That might not sound like much, but what's there is really, really fun. Bonkers is the perfect word to describe the game. Managing everything going on all at once is really challenging and rewarding to pull off.\n\nThis being a one-screen indie arcade game, it’s pretty natural to want to compare it to Super Crate Box, but aside from the level layout, the two games play very differently. Woah Dave! is more like a crazy-fast version of Mario Bros. than anything—and any of you who have played the later stages in Mario Bros. know how much fun a faster version would be.\n\nSo yeah, very simple, very elegant, very crazy game—definitely worth checking out if you’re into the genre. Think of it like you're paying five bucks upfront to play the best arcade game ever for as long as you want instead opposed to putting in a quarter each time.","November 19, 2014","true","11.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Back in the days of the arcade and early home console, this type of game was one of the supreme rulers,  including classics like Bubble Bobble, Balloon Fight, TumblePop, Joust, and Mario Bros., just to name a few.\n\nHowever, when you think about all those classic games, they always had “waves” or “levels”, but Woah Dave! Just throws you into one long level that progressively gets harder. Eggs and Skulls drop randomly from the sky, and you can throw skulls at eggs to produce coins, or you can let the eggs hatch into monsters. If you leave the monsters alive, they will turn into three progressively harder enemies the longer they are left alive, each which yields more coins when killed. Sometimes a UFO will appear to mess with platforms if it’s not killed fast enough, and sometimes a “Woah block” will appear that can clear the screen of all enemies. And that’s all there is to the game. No special items, no multipliers, no different levels with different platform structures, no surprising new bosses or enemies. Just survive for as long as possible and collect coins for a high score. I feel like a lot of people are going to play this for ten minutes and then forget about it.\n\nTo the game’s credit, the gameplay is surprisingly deep and skill-based. There’s a mindblow moment when you begin to realize all the trick shots you can make just by throwing things at different moments in your jump or bouncing them off the walls to hit stuff on lower platforms. And if you find the game too slow and monotonous, unlock the Bonkers difficulty and you should be quite satisfied.\n\nIt’s a solid and awesomely frantic arcade game with great physics, but it just screams for more variety, enemies, levels, and game mechanics. I would have downvoted this game if it wasn’t for the upcoming DLC that seems to be adding some.\n\nBut even then, despite its simplicity, I can’t stop playing it.","February 20, 2015","true","16.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So I'll try again, more concisely and more cleanly.\n\nThe gameplay feels -extremely- shallow, to the point of it feeling like an incomplete game.  Thing is, the game is centered around only that - throwing one of three things at other things.  It doesn't feel dynamic, engaging,  or interesting in the slightest.\n\nThe retro aesthetic doesn't come off as charming at all.  It feels forced rather than stylized, almost as if they couldn't be bothered to make real art for the game.  To me it seems nothing but lazy, cheeky, and tacky.  The music is a single looping track across the entire game (that I know of) and there's like a total of 8 sound effects.  All muffled and retro of course.\n\nI associate this game to Joust in the closest possible ways.  It feels outdated, simple to the point of being shallow, and rather unappealing by many modern standards.  I stopped playing at 11 minutes of game time and idled for cards, what with how non-engaging my experience was.

Although the developers did add a couple more levels (effectively tripling the content), there is still very little gameplay overall. The two new levels have only minor differences from the original. And all the "new characters" they added are nothing more than pixel-swaps - they all move and play in exactly the same way.\n\nBasically, I would say that if you have a strong fondness for early-to-mid-80s arcade games but wish they were a lot more difficult, you might like Woah Dave. Even then though, I think $5 is too much for what you are getting here.\n\nThe music is still the best part of the game, by a wide margin.\n\nMy original review is below, though it's mostly obsolete now:\n\n\nEven at $5, this is one of the biggest ripoffs on Steam. There is only one stage and one game mode. After 5 minutes of playtime, you have seen virtually everything the game has to offer. I paid $1 for it on sale, and I still feel like it was a waste of money. I can't remember the last time I played a freeware game that was so limited in scope.\n\nPeople say it's an arcade game, so it's supposed to be simple, but even arcade games have multiple stages, particularly games like Joust or Mario Bros., which are Woah Dave's closest relatives, gameplay-wise. Those two games are 30-plus years old now, and they both have far greater ambition and longevity than this one. I would be seriously astonished if the total development time was more than 4 hours, including art and music.\n\n(Incidentally, the music is the best aspect by far. I wish they had included a full-length mix that we could listen to outside of the game.)\n\nEven a basic level editor would've helped a lot, or some other kind of customization options, but there's nothing.","December 19, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

I grew up playing Atari 2600 and everything about this game is a throwback to that era of gaming. If this game came out back in the 80s and was in arcades it would have eaten a ton of quarters.\n\nEssentially the object of the game is to pick up and destroy the eggs before they hatch. Skulls, eggs, and woah blocks all fall randomly throughout the level as you play. Eggs can be thrown at hatched monsters to kill them but can also hatch while you're holding them and hurt you. Skulls can be thrown at eggs and monsters to kill them, or used as a timed bomb since they blow up after a few seconds. Woah blocks destroy everything in the level. The object is to collect coins and get as high of a score as possible.\n\nI picked it up on sale for 99¢ and it's definitely worth it for that price. It's one level that goes as long as you can stay alive. It's a genuine arcade style game. There is also another more difficult mode that is unlocked after you reach a score of $1.50. I did this within my first hour playing although it was not easy to obtain. I recommend using a controller to play the game. Overall it's a great time and I really enjoy it, as simple as it is.","December 22, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Insteed of score, the game counts how much "coins" you collected, which is pretty hard as longer you play.\n\nThe game is easy placed, it self says you chould best play it with a PSone or Xbox controller but if it should be a "classic arcade game" i was about to use my old joySTICK which sadly didnt work...\n\nAlso, the game feels anyhow as whould it try to be a bunch of old REAL classic games mixed\nTo the game play self: You play Dave (so i guess) who pic up skull bombs or eggs to smash the alien(eggs). You collect the coins they drops and sometimes a "WOAH!" block appiers and you can use it to smash all on screen.\nAlso it gives only ONE screen, nothing more - it maybe changes collors but thats it.\n\nHaving that all in mind i thought about follow games:\nEggs destroying = Joust\nCoins and WOAH block (which looks a lot like the POW block) = Mario Bros.\nLevel Style = feels like Super Creat Box\n\nBut anyhow, Woah Dave feels really boring after time, there is nothing new, just throwing and thats done. The most thing i hate is that you just need to touch the things and dave picks them up, mostly the things you dont want to pick up. there should be a button to take things and throw them. I often died coz i picked up a bomb i dont want.\n\nAlso, "only" for hunting coins, the game gets pretty quick boring and there is not much to play for, ones you played over or reach "1.50$" you can play in a kind of "hard" mode which doesnt makes more "fun" than the normal mode.\n\nHonestly, its not worth the 5$ and looks more like a poor rip-off from the real good classic games like Mario Bros or like.

I know this is a retro style game, but it was made in 2014...we have the technology. EDIT: One of the Developers commented and said that if you use ALT+F you will go full screen, but they have yet to create an easy button in game for those of us that use Big Picture Mode on Steam and a controller.\n\nThe guy who said this game has "tight controls" in their review that sold me on this game owes me a few bucks. Using a Wireless XBox 360 controller the characters more often than not run too far (which means death most of the time). The keyboard is fine, but you don't get buy a local multiplayer game for keyboard controls.\nEDIT: I did some additional testing on controller problems in this game and discovered that a wired controller seems to work OK, but it needs heavy adjustment for wireless controllers. (This is the only game that had latency/responsiveness issues for a wireless controller, and I own a lot of games.)\n\nHowever, the game seems like it would be reasonably fun to play a couple of games with friends (if the controller response was fixed). If you don't have any friends to play with or use a Xbox 360 Wireless controller, you should get it at 60% off or more, or for no more than a dollar or two. (I'll be playing it a little with the keyboard, so I don't feel as though I totally wasted my money...and of course to get those Steam trading cards.)\n\nThe controller issue will likely not be fixed since there are bug reports in the forums, and people noting the same bugs are on iOS, but no developer response or acknowledgement. EDIT: Three different developers for this game suddenly jumped into the forums, so there may be some hope of the controller issue being fixed, but they stated that there is no support for the "XBox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows" and that some of the bugs in the game are bugs, but they left left them in game because it makes it more fun...that sounds more like laziness or lack of programming knowledge how to fix the bugs...but you make up your own mind.\n\n\nTLDR:\nNo easy full screen option in game (requires keyboard use - ALT+F), some bugs are now called "features" by the devs since they never fixed them, and there is no 100% controller support (advertised as full controller support) since they don't support some XBox 360 controllers and require keyboard shortcuts to go full screen.","November 5, 2014","false","2.0"," 16 of 40 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","16","40","0","6"

I've found it especially fun with other people. While also entertaining as a time waster alone, having others around to compete for highscores is extremely fun. It's simple mechanics but exciting, fast paced game play make it perfect. 10/10 would recommend. (especially with it on sale right now!)","December 26, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main character is Dave Donuts.  I mean Dave Lonuts, who is not a duck despite what you may think.  I definetly reccomend this game.  The music is great in my opinion.","May 14","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
