Honestly, I blame EA more for it but still. The original Crysis had complex sandbox missions with multiple approaches and secondary objectives and plenty of bad ♥♥♥ suit powers. Crysis had an enjoyable cast of characters that I actually cared about. Crysis had varied vehicles, all of which were drive/flyable, Crysis had BLUE aliens that froze things. Crysis had a unique blend of strategic, tactical, intense, fun combat. Crysis had an original and interesting multiplayer.\n\nThis is not Crysis. This is Call of Halofield 7: Future Warfare. They traded in EVERY SINGLE THING that made the first game great. Whether it's the linear as all hell story missions, the characters that were one-dimensional, cliche and predictable to the end, the dumbed-down nanosuit that somehow manages to feel less powerful than the marines you fight with, the HORRENDOUS checkpoint system, the aliens that are the exact opposite of the first game's, the lack of Psycho's presence, the removal of the ability to carry two primary weapons AND pistols AND use your fists (in fact, fists are completely gone), you can only use humvees/APCs instead of, oh, I don't know, TANKS and VTOLS and HELICOPTERS and other awesome ♥♥♥♥, the bland/generic EVERYTHING, the multiplayer that is a complete rip-off of Call of Duty (and is now full of hackers that nobody does anything about), the list goes on.\n\nAnyways, the point is DON'T BUY THIS GAME. It is an insult to the original and in fact an insult to games in general.","January 23, 2014","false","20.2"," 425 of 534 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","425","534","0","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamminmurken/recommended/108800/","jamminmurken","Korben Dallas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamminmurken/","29 products in account","The main strength of the campaigns of Crysis is their sandbox, unrestricted nature, and Crysis 2 is a step back from Crysis 1 and Warhead in this regard, as you run through cities with closed-in walls instead of trek through jungles. However, each specific battle (and there were many times I felt like I was facing "boss" enemies) takes place in a pretty large area, so I never felt particularly restricted.\n\nThe guns and combat are as crisp and satisfying as they were in the first two Crysis games.\n\nThe suit's powers are now accessed with keyboard shortcuts, which makes their use feel more isolated, like sprinting in other games, and power jumps are accessed with a single button (holding down space), instead of requiring an activation of strength mode, making me feel less like I was operating a special suit, and more like I was just a superhero - it's less mechanical-feeling, for better or for worse, I guess.\n\nTowards the end of the campaign, I became extremely dependent on cloaking, which is overpowered. It's much faster to sneak around the enemy strongholds, going straight for the objectives, than it is to run roughshod over every enemy one-by-one. Maybe I became so objective-oriented because I was enthralled with the campaign (wishing to finish it as soon as possible), because, in other games, I generally take the time to kill every enemy I see.\n\nMy most significant complaint about Crysis 2 is that, with the closed-in areas, specific, restricted routes are required to arrive at objectives within each mission, but there is no guide system (line on the ground) to show you where to go, which would have been appreciated at several points in the campaign, as I found myself trapped in rooms, going in circles trying to open doors that wouldn't budge. If you get stuck and resort to searching online for a level guide, you'll find many other people commenting that they were stuck at the same point as you.\n\nDying can set you back annoyingly far. Don't die.\n\nThe suit's upgradability is neat, but generally not integral, and unlikely to scope an individual's tactics.\n\nThere aren't a lot of people playing Crysis 2's multiplayer, although there are more than enough to have a few big games going at all times. Still, this is a game to be bought for its campaign, and I highly doubt you will be left disappointed after completing it. It's exciting, engaging, and challenging, and ranks among my favorite 10-11 hour spans of gaming.","November 25, 2013","true","11.7"," 160 of 185 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","160","185","0","4"

The game was released in early 2011. It also follows on from the plot of Crysis 1 as well. Although you don't really need to have played the original in order to follow the story. Crysis 2 was also the first game to use the CryEngine 3.\n\nThe game play has all of the regular FPS style features. You play the role of a Recon Marine, called Alcatraz. You are able to customize your weapons to match the situations you are in, as well as customizing your suite to the same too. Crysis 2 is set in New York City, which is often referred to by many as an urban jungle. This does however offer various different tactical options when it comes to planning attacks; allowing players to navigate between floors and buildings, and ruined buildings.\n\nWe also see a few changes in the Nanosuit used by our character too; this time you are able to use more than one suit power at a time, the strength and power modes have been combined into the same mode, and the stealth suit has been improved slightly.\n\nCrysis 2 has AMAZING graphics; this could easily pass as a game being released recently. If you put all of your settings up to full, you are going to be in amazement at how good this game looks. You will need a beefy rig to keep a steady 60 fps, but my oh my it is worth it.\n\nI sadly see no replay-ability in Crysis 2, there are the addition of a couple of difficulty modes, but to be honest; once you have played it the once, there is no reason to play it again. The single-player campaign is a decent length though - we are looking at a 18 hour long story mode which is very good for an FPS.\n\nThankfully I had no technical issues with Crysis 2 (unlike I did have with the original), I was able to play with every graphical setting on ultra and still had 60 frames the whole time. The only thing I will mention is there is no longer any multiplayer support since GameSpy shut it's servers down in May 2014.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first Crysis game, you will basically enjoy Crysis 2, it's the same just with even better graphics, more compelling story, and stellar FPS action and did I mention the amazing graphics? People may think £20 is a bit steep for a game of this age, however I am completely happy with this price as it almost fits into the £1/hour ratio.\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Machine Guns, alien swarms, sniper rifles, grenades, headshots, shotguns, etc. Shoot a red barrel and it'll explode...yeah, it's all there. Personally, I would describe myself as quite "over" the FPS genre as a whole. However, that being said Crysis 2 manages to do all the typical FPS shooter mechanics extremely well... and throws in a couple of unique (although still not exactly not mind-blowing) little tweaks which is what makes this a really great game, and subsequently worth your time and money.\n\nFirst off the single player campaign is both lengthy and well paced. The story (I have not played the original) is solid for the archetypical "Stop The Alien Scourge" type of deal. Coupled with really tight controls and a good swatch of weapons - it makes for a rewarding experience. The whole differentiator for the Crysis series is the suit that you are in control of. You can enter two modes which change the way you face each challenge. Being able to go "Stealth" (vis 'a vis the Predator effect) means that you can approach enemies unseen. Upgrades to your suit eventually allow you to perform more stealth kills and even walk through crowds of enemies unseen.\n\nThe second mode is an Armored mode. This basically allows you to go whole hog for a time and survive for a couple of hits longer then you normally would in a firefight. Doesn't make you invincible but it gives you a definite edge in both taking hits and dealing them out as well.\n\nYou can also run and jump which is considered "Power" mode, but honestly it's just another thing to drain your energy so that you can't zip around and be super armored at the same time.\n\nCombining these two modes with a variety of customizable weapons, suit up-grades and tactical approaches provides a really interesting and robust way to tackle each encounter. You can literally approach the same scenario differently each time. I found the AI in this game both challenging and interesting at the same time. Enemies actually react to getting shot, hide well and as frustrating as a stealth kill that doesn't go unseen (although you think it should be) is - it's good that game doesn't mess around. There will be times when the AI just stands there or runs around sporadically but pound-4-pound it's more of an aberration than an annoying norm. And as someone who is generally kind of over this kind of game in particular that's high praise.\n\nIf you're a fan of the FPS genre then this should definitely be something you play. If you've never played a Crysis game and are burnt out on the FPS shooter genre (like myself) - this is still a great way to pass a Sunday afternoon. The graphics are indeed great, the gameplay is really tight and overall it's a really fun game.","December 21, 2013","true","10.7"," 114 of 139 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","114","139","0","4"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Crysis 2 is a first-person shooter developed by Crytek using the Cry Engine 3.  It serves as a sequel to the critically acclaimed 2007 game Crysis and is the first game on the franchise to be released on the consoles as opposed to the first game that was PC exclusive.\n\nThe game puts the player in the shoes of a U.S. Marine named Alcatraz whose team was sent to Manhattan to assist in rescuing civilians after an epidemic has infected the city.  Shortly after arrival, an unknown enemy attacked their Submarine, thus forcing the team to swim to the surface only to be gunned down by an Alien gunship.  Luckily, Laurence "Prophet" Barnes, former team leader of Raptor Team (Crysis 1) and known Nano-suit user, finds Alcatraz and bestows upon him his mission (along with the Nano-suit), before shooting himself in the head.  Alcatraz now faces a city at the brink of collapse due to the on-going battle between the US Military, Cell Paramilitary Forces and the Alien race called the Ceph.\n\nPROS:+ Beautiful graphics and User Interface\n+ Excellent sound quality, voice acting and music\n+ New mechanics like cover and quick activation keys (to access Nano-suit abilities for a more dynamic gameplay)\n+ Good story line that delves into the true nature of the Nano-suit and the Alien Invasion\n+ New customization options for the Nano-suit but...(See CON #1)\n+ Expanded weapon selection and upgrades\n+ Challenging but fair difficulties which highlights the use of each Nano-suit functions and upgrades\n+ Collectibles that expands the story\n+ Multiple ways to complete an objective despite the more linear maps\n\nCONS:- Nano-suit upgrades are limited with some of them being outright better than the others\n- AI glitches at some areas, especially after reloading from the last checkpoint\n- Gun models take up a quarter of the screen (as if the gun was being held directly near Alcatraz's face)\n- Horrible FOV (Field of View)\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME.  Crysis 2, like its predecessor, has some of the most amazing graphical fidelity of its time which still holds up even today as it can be seen in its high-resolution textures, dynamic lighting, and beautifully crafted levels and sceneries.  The game introduces new mechanics such as a new cover system, Nano-suit upgrade system, expanded weapon selection, and a revamped Nano-suit ability activation mechanic. Despite the occasionally glitchy but challenging AI, you'll have an intense and action packed experience.\n\nThe game could last you at least 8 hours of game time with your average difficulty setting and around 10 hours with the harder ones in single player.  Do you buy this at full price?  Sure but I highly RECOMMEND you buy this as a BUNDLE (Crysis Collection) which would include Crysis 1 and Warhead.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/108800/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The following covers only the single player portion of Crysis 2.\n\nFor many, the graphical powerhouse Crysis is more notorious for its tendency to bring even cutting edge PCs to their knees, than for its gameplay. While it offered tons of eye candy for those that could run it, the fact remained that most were forced to watch from the sidelines as it was simply impossible to play on anything but the best hardware. But all that changes with Crysis 2, a ruthlessly optimized machine that finally lets all those wondering about the series a chance to see what it’s all about. Unfortunately, it never lives up to its reputation in any way than being a pretty face, and once you look past the visuals quickly evaporates into a game I couldn’t wait to leave.\n\nEverything in Crysis 2 revolves around the Nanosuit, a secret military project which grants the user superhuman powers and provides both tactical and medical support. Armor, invisibility, super strength, and Nanovision (a combination of solar and night vision) round out the list of your abilities, and for the most part you are given free range over how you use them on the battlefield.\n\nThis is what sets Crysis apart from other shooters. While still linear in progression, there is a lot more freedom in how you tackle situations than you are typically allowed in a modern FPS. Maybe you’ll choose to go in guns blazing, armor at its max as bullets ricochet off like water drops, or perhaps opt for a stealthier solution and sneak through the water ducks behind enemy lines. Experimentation is encouraged by way of a helpful visor reminiscent of Metroid Prime, which highlights enemies, weapons, and different points to begin your assault. When everything is working right Crysis 2 can be an incredibly rewarding and exhilarating experience where each fight becomes its own puzzle for you to unravel. The real problem though is that these moments are few and far between.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this is every feature of the suit is tied into an energy gauge. When you use one, the meter depletes leaving you completely exposed and unable to cloak or use armor. While clearly designed to keep the game from becoming too easy, it also does a fantastic job of taking away from the feeling of being a super soldier developer Crytek tries so hard to create. Getting stuck in a firefight without the suit’s abilities is a common occurrence that almost always results in a near instant death, and even passive abilities such as meleeing enemies and sprinting are tied into the bar, which leaves you essentially helpless once it runs out. Using the energy bar to regulate abilities isn’t a bad idea in theory, but the execution is constantly working against the player to create a frustrating experience constantly stifling its own potential.\n\nThe other big issue are the enormous amount of bugs, most of which revolve around the comically bad enemy AI. Cloaking highlights this most, as enemies are entirely oblivious to you when you are cloaked, going so far as to ignore you taking out their comrades mere inches away (I can only assume they are used to seeing their partners suddenly fall to the ground for impromptu naps). Fall into an enemy’s line of sight however and all of a sudden every living being knows where you are. Cloaking then acts as something of an on/off switch for enemy fire which comes grinding to a halt the second you cloke, a useful if entirely unrealistic way to exit a firefight that is equally unsatisfying.\n\nFinally you have the moments when the enemy AI simply breaks, getting stuck on geometry, running in endless circles, and all around being complete fools that are almost more fun to watch than to shoot, because truth be told shooting them just isn’t very fun. When everyone acts like a broken robot it’s hard to feel as if you’ve accomplished anything when you outsmart them, and for as intelligent as Crysis 2’s mechanics may be, every enemy you come up against seems to have drawn the short straw for brains.\n\nThe narrative also left me wanting, hitting every cliche in the book and topping things off with some of the most abysmal writing and voice acting I’ve had to endure in a very long time. The interesting premise and opening scene where you, a soldier on his deathbed, are given the nanosuit and along with it the memories of its previous owner, is quickly swept aside in an endless stream of betrayals, convoluted twists, and an inability to ever explain what is really going on. I lost count of the number of times you lose consciousness, only to awake with your allies once again swapped and your motives changed. The writing is overly simplistic and juvenile, turning a lackluster plot into a cringe worthy affair. Rounding out the package is the flat voice acting that never could hit the right emotional tone nor bring any life to the script, but I suppose you can only do so much when given so little.\n\nBut if there is one thing everyone is wanting and expecting from Crysis 2 it’s another benchmark graphical showcase, and in that regard it does not disappoint. The level of detail in each scene is astounding, with the lighting effects in particular standing even higher above the rest. Seeing the sun breaking through the dilapidated buildings of New York is awe inspiring, and although I won’t spoil them, the later half of the game is filled with some of the most impressive set pieces I have ever seen. Few games can match the visuals found in Crysis 2 even years after its release, and the amount of optimization wizardry done to ensure it runs well even on lower end machines is nothing short of impressive. Sound design is equally well done, with deafening explosions and gunfire which threaten to blow your subs and does more than anything else to provide a much needed wow-factor to the proceedings. The great score grabbed me right from the opening menu, setting the tone for the game and adding to the overall epic feel of the game.\n\nUndeniably beautiful, Crysis 2 has a lot of good ideas but does a poor job bringing them together. The bevy of bugs and glitches, most notably the terrible enemy AI, took almost all possible enjoyment out of firefights, and the few instances where the game actually worked as intended only further displayed just how much wasted potential was left on the table. What we are left with is a below average shooter wrapped in an extremely pretty package, but one that can’t hide the dull and lifeless game underneath. It’s hard to dislike something that throws so much eye candy at you, but in this case beauty is only skin deep.\n\nDisclaimer: If you are curious why my gametime is so low, it's for the fact I originally played Crysis 2 on the Xbox 360. However my time with the PC version has confirmed that it is very much the same game, aside from the obvious graphical upgrade. If you find anything I said to be inaccurate, let me know and I will look into it and update my review accordingly.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","May 18, 2014","false","0.4"," 457 of 654 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","457","654","0","29"

But no one really talks about the gameplay too much. That could have something to do with the fact that in order to experience the wonder of said graphics and not just look on in awe as demo reels were shoved down your gullet, you needed the world's fanciest PC gaming rig. Still, there were plenty of people who did have a good enough computer to run Crysis and even more who wanted it to be available on the home consoles as well.\n\nCrysis 2 made that nanosuit-boosted leap through the air to the console market in a brilliant and impressive manner.For part two, the fight has moved from the imaginary island of Lingshan to the very real New York City; the only difference being that in this version of The Big Apple, there's a virus going around that melts people into a pile of goo and an invasion from some very squid-like alien beings. It's now up to you as the man in the fancy nanosuit to give these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s a run for their money. This time around, though, instead of just wandering around an open world and blowing all the pretty bits up, you're guided through a level-based experience that keeps the plot fluid and creates a more streamlined gaming experience.\n\nSomehow the team over at Crytek has found a way to make their sequel just as visually remarkable as the original and without the need to spend a fortune on a fancy new video card and extra RAM.The desolated streets of Manhattan have an eerie presence about them. The once bustling metropolis has a sense of recent and sudden abandon written all over it, like everyone just stopped what they were doing and disappeared. It's the most "living" dead city I've ever seen in a game. Anyone that's ever been to the five burroughs of NYC will probably agree with me that the essence of the city has been captured in the graphics.From a visual standpoint, the whole vibe of the game is Planet of the Apes meets Escape from New York while the gameplay itself is more Halo meets Metal Gear Solid.\n\nYou can choose to go balls-out guns-a-blazing through every level like a suicidal badass, all the while utilizing the suit's armor mode much in the same way a Master Chief would, or you can use the suit's stealth mod e to sneak by the enemy undetected, creep behind him, and stab him in the head like a sneaky Snake might. It's up to you how you want to carry out missions and you're given a variety of ways to deal with situations. You could even skip combat all together and just sneak around everything if you're good enough or just bored with fighting. Obviously, there will be points where fights are unavoidable, along with some moments where you're forced to drive vehicles and run over stuff while blowing other stuff up, but overall Crysis 2 does a good job of letting you choose how to handle everything in your own way.\n\nAs you progress, you can customize your nanosuit to better fit your playing style whether it be for longer lasting stealth mode, quieter footsteps, or a flying stomp attack to get the drop on enemies.For the most part, the AI does a good job of not letting you walk all over them, but there are a few times where I found myself blindly punching the crap out of my opponents with the armor mode engaged to get out of situations.\n\nThe plot is also a bit boiler-plate and most of the shocks or twists are pretty easy to see coming. But even though you'll figure out that Darth Vader is Luke's father long before you should, there are still some very surprising things in store for fans of the series, though most of them seem to occur earlier rather than later in the plot.\n\nCrysis 2 has done an amazing thing here. It's a sequel that while borrowing heavily from the first Crysis, plays out absolutely nothing like it and creates its own standalone experience.This is one of the few games that dramatically enhances its previous installment.","March 20, 2015","true","16.8"," 62 of 77 people (81%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","81","62","77","11","0"

But let's go a bit further!\n\n\nThe good, the bad and the ugly--, I mean the derp.\nThe good :It's gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is what makes this game so fun to play. I'm not a huge fps fan of brainless killing and I prefer my fps to be intelligent and have a good and long interesting story. This one compensate the story part by it's very entertaining gameplay and huge variety of weapons (WICH IS GOOD FOR A FPS AM I RIGHT?). I expected this game to be more like a derp shooter where you kill everything, but I actually quite enjoyed the stealth part. But of course, the gunplay is also great.\n\nThe stealth part is absolutely not forced nor necessary, but I found it the most interesting part for me. Hearing the soldiers screaming and being all scared is a sadist joy that I don't hide. It just feels really good to sneak around all stealthy with our superior armor and killing them in style.\nSpeaking of the soldiers, there are 2 main enemies in this game. Human soldiers, and Aliens. The gameplay is quite different when facing them. When you fight soldiers, you feel like... a hunter, a predator hunting his prey. And every kills is really rewarding as you feel powerful. Op even. And feeling powerful is a good feeling (because the game is not that easy on hardest difficulty!).\nWhen facing the aliens, it's quite the opposite. They are numerous, strong and almost scary. This time I often choose to hide. Not because I enjoy stabbing them in the back, but because I'm genuinely scared to face them and their superiority. In this case, I feel like the hunted. Aliens also have some huge boss and they are pretty challenging.\n\n\nBut all this talk about the weapons would not be enough if we don't talk about the ARMOR! Because yes, the armor has such a big role in this game. It's actually it's core mechanism. Other than having the most badass voice you ever heard for an armor, it is also packed with lot of skills and uppgrades. Stealth, superior armor, thermal vision, scanning abilities, superior jump... There are a lot of differents functions. The game is made so that you will need them at least once during the course of the game at some key parts. For instance, I often find thermal vision to be more of a gadget in most games, but here it feels really good to be able to see in heavy smoke or being able to see stealth opponents... But of course, they are usefull for the whole duration of the playthrough. Never made useless.\nHow do you uppgrade your armor by the way...? Well, here is an interesting way of working. You get more energy by killing aliens! Seems easy right? But aren't they the kind of enemies you would rather avoid? Yes! That's the trick. It's easier to avoid them, but more rewarding to actually kill them!\n\n\nThe graphics :\nCrysis 2 has always be known for being a very demanding game when it was out in 2011. And... well, even after 4 years the game is still insanely beautiful. It's not just that it is plainly  "looking good"  but, the scenery and the actions are absolutely brillants, unique and gorgeous. You will see some scenes in this game that you never saw before in any other games. New York having a tsunami? Huge tentacle robot coming through the ground and destroying the city? Flying island? Absolutely epic collapsing of buildings and huge explosions? Yes, this game has them all and it looks astonishing.\n\nMiscs :\nYou can also customize your weapons a little bit. Always nice to have. The game lenght is pretty good if you play a bit more stealth wise and play on hardest difficulty. I would say around 17hours for me since steam misses a few hours.\nThe bad :It's story.\n\nOh boy... oh boy. Well, where to start? The basic story is that Aliens are attacking earth and you are a marine in New York that is going to fight them back.\nAnd well, that's it! Enjoy!\nNo, actualy there is a bit more. But it's just extremely cliché and uninteresting, and mostly poorly excecuted. They tried to put some "conspiracy" and "betrayals", but the characters are so stereotyped, blank and annoying that you just can't care about what is happening to them and the story. Your own character has absolutely 0 charisma and personnality. The only "interesting character" is actually... your armor. Yup!\nThe game also have a kind of repeating scenario for the whole game. Something like I'm alone >>> I found my crew! >>>  I lost them and I'm almost dead D:  >>>  REPEAT! >>>  I'm alone >>>  Another crew found me!\n\nThe Ai :\nThe ai has in my opinion only one and major flaw. They kind of always know where you are even if they don't see you. This is extremely annoying and is a stupid way to try to artificialy increase the difficulty. How does this stupid functionality works? It's simple, even if they never see you or hear you, the ai will tend to move where you are and either, search, pattrol, or stand there like nothing. It makes them finding you unfunny and not "deserved". This almost always happens with the humans ai. Rarely with the aliens though.\n\nThe design :\nEven though the aliens are looking great, they have a major flaw. Most of them looks very close to each other so it's very hard to know if it's a "basic grunt", or one very advanced type of aliens. Only a few ones have really unique look.\n\nThe army feels :\nHere is a personal opinion. It's simple, if you love american army stuff, you will like the general feeling of the interraction with your character. If you don't, it's pretty annoying. This game has a "oh wow army is awesome we are heroes" feels and people seems proud to call you "marine", or "soldier" at each possiblities and you know it's done because they think it's "awesome to hear it", and it keep showing the american flags very often and other details like this. Also you're pretty much the most cliché "super soldier hero" character you can think of.\nThe derp :Some stuff in this game are neither impressive nor bad. Like the music. It's not bad, but there are not many and seem to repeat themselves. If you are interested in the multiplayer, know that it's not working anymore. I didn't have any glitches, expect a few enemies falling from where they were (like next to a cliff or on a window). It was more funny that annoying. I heard there are modding with this game, but I didn't try it.\nConclusion :If you're a huge fps fan, just take it. I think it's a good game, but being now an old game with such heavy competitors.., I only reccomend it on sale for everyone else. However the game is very fun to play... and actually, isn't that the most important?","August 14, 2015","true","13.2"," 79 of 104 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","79","104","5","15"

I have not played much of Crysis 1. So, playing C2 was an amazing experience.\n\nWhat I liked :\n1) The graphics & details that make up the environment.\n2) Nanosuit modes.\n3) Storyline ( although it's short ).\n4) Gameplay.\n5) Nanosuit upgradation with catalysts.\n6) Excellent alien bodies with great warships.\n\nWhat I disliked :\n1) Short story. I finished the story in under 6 hrs of play time.\n2) Not many weapons.\n3) No boss alien in the end ( It's just a whole lot of casual aliens spawning in the end, no boss ).\n4) Cannot use alien weapons ( I think C3 has this feature ).\n5) Multiplayer. It's kinda weird to me. Not much of a 'variation' in multiplayer.\n6) You can carry only 2 weapons at a time ( excluding heavy weapons like JAW etc ). And so there is nothing like "side-arm" in secondary weapons. So, two primary guns and you cannot carry any pistol with it.\n\nSo, given the things "I" liked the game is really worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/108800/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","To be honest, I never liked Crysis. I always looked at it as a techdemo. It was one of those games that had numerous glitches - BSODs and audio glitches were frequent and I do not remember any other games with which I was having similar issues at the time. Also, my rig surpassed the system requirements for the game so I never understood what could have caused these issues. But the various websites and forums on the internet confirmed the same.\n\nIn any case, the jungle environment was already familiar following Crytek's Far Cry. So, when the news came that the sequel to Crysis would take place in New York (now an "urban jungle"), I looked forward to seeing and playing it. The game delivered: the destroyed cityscape of Manhattan looks superb thanks to CryEngine 3. We are to navigate between the floors of destroyed buildings and combat on the city streets is common. Finally, the aliens appear in the form of regular soldiers, too - it's not just the big monsters that you need to fight like in the first part.\n\nAs for gameplay, the protagonist's nano suit has been streamlined. Strength and speed modes are now combined. We can now perform silent takedowns so following a stealthy playing mode is more rewarding. Upgrading the suit's features is a possibility based on the alien kills we perform - this is an unnecessary role playing section of the game but it does not represent any issues.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with the sequel. Single player campaign lasts for 12-13 hours which is quite long these days. Cutscenes are frequent and Hans Zimmer's excellent score helps us with the immersion into the world of Crysis. Too bad that starting from June multiplayer mode will be unavailable for good (following the announcement of GameSpy), so, should it be discounted, it should be purchased with only the single player experience in mind.","May 29, 2014","true","14.1"," 53 of 70 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","53","70","0","0"

Too soon? Anyways..\n\nLet me explain first by telling you why Crysis 1 was far more than a tech demo.  It was what marketing teams now popularly refer to as yielding something know as “emergent gameplay” Sure, I'll grant it you it was a technical showpiece when real time shadows on foliage was ground breaking not only for technical achievement but also for your wallet regarding the new GPU you'll need to run it properly.\n\nThere was real strategy to be had while playing Crysis. From cloaking yourself, sneaking behind someone and grabbing them by the throat, switching to strength mode and throwing them off a cliff. To tanking and switching in between maximum armor, strength and speed to jump over a fence and blasting unsuspecting fools with an automatic shotgun or on the fly switching between different scopes, applying a silencer, crouching, taking aim (maximum strength, to steady fire) and sniping on the fringe of a base. These are just a small percentage of what the game allowed you to do. All this was combined with a huge open terrain of varying topography.\n\nAll of this is exchanged for a easy to grasp corridor shooter in Crysis 2. Now, don't get me wrong I love a good corridor shooter but the freedom of play granted in 1 turns the “freedom” into clearly labeled things within your visor such as get up high and snipe or stealth through the sewers, leaving any guesswork or self discovery out of the picture.\n\nI won't harp on the story of either as I don't think either are truly interesting however nor are they offensive. They are just or sort of latent. Regardless I still prefer the original narratively speaking because I believe the pacing to be a lot better as well as the mystery of what exactly is going on on the island. This is feels more like where else can we take this idea we started with.\n\nAfter all this reasoning as to why I like Crysis 1 better. Crysis 2 is still worth playing. I haven't played the multiplayer but I don't play much multiplayer anything so that info is better commented on by someone else. What I can say is the gunplay feels great, combined with the exo suits abilities. I'm sure the multiplayer is as fun and competent as the campaign and certainly will extend the life if that sort of thing floats your boat.","September 21, 2015","true","5.6"," 46 of 61 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","46","61","11","0"

Its a decent shooter, with nice graphics, and some great moments.\n\nHowever, personally, I didn't like it very much, and theres a lot of reasons for that. Comparing to its predecessor it has improved story, multiplayer, and alien design, but overall, original was a far better game (but still far from my favourite game). Original Crysis was obviously a game designed with PC in mind, and you could see that in every aspect of it - graphics, huge levels, level of destruction, and other stuff. It was ported to consoles years later, but in Crysis 2 version of engine, and with no surprise.\n\nInstead in the jungle on islands Crysis moved to the jungle on concrete, how they call New York, and very popular thing to say during this game's advertisement period. Levels are now far more stiff. Here and there you may stumble upon some more open area, but rarely, soon after you will return to your usual corridor roam. No matter how wide its corridors are, corridor shooter is still a corridor shooter. Initially, it came with only dx9 assets. It got dx11 facelift later, but even after that you can still see a lot of hidious textures, especially on the walls. Here and there you may break some glass, TV screen or a vase, but generally environment is indistructible. You can use carboard boxes as a solid cover or even hide behind cellophane wall. Which is just ridiculous comparing to the original, where you could level down structures, or even cut down the trees with shooting. But this is just a nitpicking, mostly. Despite all of that, even without highres textures, its a pretty looking game, theres no doubt about it.\n\nAI in this game is brain-dead, and I'm not even exaggerating. You may not notice it initially, because of the sheer numbers of opponents you'll be facing most of the time. But sooner or later you have to see how they love that cover... They love it so much that they won't move from it even if you stand right before them, or even after putting a bullet in their body. It happens that they forget about you after you run past them, you or they hide behind the cover, or ignoring the fight which happened just couple of metters behind them. Sometimes they won't acknowledge your presence until you shoot them, even if you are in the open in front of them, in their sight range. Other hilarious stuff includes your marine ally getting killed because he accidentally stopped where scripted event occured and jeep runned over him, killing their colleagues (or even themselves) with their own grenades, blowing themselves up after accidentally shooting the red barrel behind which they were hidding...\n\nBut what I hate the most is that camera movement. PC designed original had nice and smooth aiming, unlike Crysis 2. Its not that bad, but no matter how much I'm tweaking mouse sensitivity, I just can't get rid of that feeling like I'm moving controller thumbstick, and not a mouse. Like something drags me down. Lowering settings to get some extra frames doesn't help either (game runs smooth on highest settings anyways). In SP with laughtable AI its tolerable, but in MP its a killer. Yet another sign of its console design. Similar problem I had with Halo 2 PC port, or Bioshock Infinite, yet another console-infested game.\n\nAs I said, story is better this time, but again - nothing for an Oscar. You are some US Marine grunt, infiltrating New York via sub with your team. But soon hell breaks loose after alien incursion, your whole team gets killed, and you are saved by Prophet, character from the first game. You will see him just  briefly at the beginning, he is infected by the alien virus, and can't last much longer. He gives you his nano-suit, and puts a bullet in his own head to break the link with the suit. But before that gives you the order to find certain scientist, that guy who your team supposed to find anyways. For some reason, your character doesn't say a single word for the whole durration of the game, not even "I'm not Prophet, God damnit!" to all those people trying to murder him screaming "Its Prophet!", but eh.\n\nNano-suit went through some changes. You still have the option of modding weapons with various attachements, and armor and cloak modes are working as you used to. There's an additional option: by eliminating filthy xenos you can collect nano-catalyst points from their dead bodies (aliens are coming in several types, and how much you get depends from the type), and you can use them to upgrade your suit. Abilities are divided into 4 classes, with 3 potential upgrades for each, and only one upgrade at the time can be chosen per class, (such as improved health and energy regeneration, improvements for cloaking, bullet tracing, etc), and in that way it gives you certain amount of customisation. If you have enough patience you can easily farm catalysts on certain locations, where  you can just run around and melee alien grunts, since they are no challenge anyways.\n\nStrenght and speed modes are now combined into one "Power" mode and its active all the time. High jumping, grabbing and kicking your opponents/items, and running is using your suit energy. While for strenght mode it makes some sense, why someone decided that simple sprinting is using your suit energy - I really have no idea. Not to mention that running in this game is on par with walking in majority of other games, and walking is painfully slow, plus when we combine that with console treated aiming... Since levels are smaller and far more linear now, designers probably thought there wasn't any need for that super-dash, or normal walking. Maybe its more realistic that way, and I'm nitpicking again, but I'm playing games for fun mostly, not for their realism (as much as the game with setting like this can relly on realism).\n\nMP is fairly basic, and fun for a while, but nothing that kept me for too long. Btw, you are required to create a 3rd party account, since this game doesn't use Steamworks. Since MP in this game is almost dead, ranked matching is not an option if you plan to play at all, so you are stuck with the custom server browser, which often results in playing with far more leveled players than you, with far better unlocks and perks (besides regular aim-bot users). You can play either in nano-suits, or as regular troopers. Playing with nano-suits is not particulary fun, its just a bunch of ghosts shooting each other, because cloaking is far too often used, and no wonder - you are literally invisible. But even without it its hard to spot someone most of the time, because design of uniforms easily blends with the envronment. Besides several pre-determined classes, with your unlocks you can create your own custom loadout, only one is available at the beginning, and if you bother to play enough you can unlock more by leveling. EDIT: With Gamespy service shutting down Crysis 1 and 2 are losing their MP support on the PC, so you are only stuck with the SP from now on.\n\nAnd lastly, I have to mention great sound assets, and fantastic soundtrack. You can unlock it completelly in extras by finishing campaign levels, so nothing costs you to give it a try. I recommend tracks "SOS New York", "Chase", "Rampage" and "One Way In".","March 18, 2014","false","9.2"," 149 of 234 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","149","234","0","7"

A review from New York.\n\nThere is this morbid fascination with seeing New York destroyed in movies. This game does just that and does it really well.\n\nThe graphics.\n\nNothing to say here. Cry Engine 3 is going to dominate the graphics department until Frostbite 2 comes out I guess. It's going to be an interesting stand off. I did however notice some inconsistencies with water. Most water still looks great. However, some parts of the water are just outright consolish looking. As I was playing the game, I found myself constantly being distracted by the graphics whilst I was getting shot at which was annoying. However, when you are invisible, you still cast a shadow and your floating gun is also visible to the enemy. Now the game gives you the option to run around in third-person view.\n\nThe story:\n\nWell, you still play as a mute character named 'Alcatraz'. Nomad actually had a voice. And they do attempt to tie in the story with the first game, somewhat. But hey, on the positive note, you can actually cast a shadow and you have legs this time around.\n\nThe locations:\n\nThere are 19 missions. You start off at Battery park and then you advance towards the downtown area of the city through the East side. You will visit many historic locations and some of them are going to be blown up. The scale of the buildings in the game and reality is almost 1:1. One thing is that the skyscrapers in the background are randomly picked. Apparently the devs did not wish to go through more trouble of placing the real skyscrapers in the corresponding locations. Let's get one thing straight. This is not a sandbox game. At the end of the day, you are given an area that you have to navigate through to get to the next check point. So even though that makes the game linear, the fact that there are several approaches to your destination kind of makes the city your playground. I loved seeing the old closed off Brooklyn Bridge 6 train subway stop. They have only recently re-opened it by the way.\nThe NYC subway maps that are in the game are wrong though, not to mention some geographical errors. The devs also put the train tracks on the streets, and NYC does not have those except for the old abandoned old track that was delivering coal to a plant a hundred years ago; now it is a museum.\nBut at least the intersecting streets and historical locations are correct.\nThe game does give you a significant area to run around when you approach the Grand Central terminal, otherwise the entire game consists of isolated carefully constrained few blocks that you have to go through.\nThe bottom line is that, it is not really New York as I hoped to see it, but it is New York enough.\nTimes Square has been pulled off very well, but of course, most of its blocked up by the mysterious US Army cement blocks, seriously? The US army can barricade NYC in the matter of hours of alien attack with thousands of these blocks?\nHint, when you find the head of the Statue of Liberty, go inside of it.\n\nThe sound:\n\nThe sound is great. Distant shots, shouts, explosions, alien growls, your gun shots - it's all there. Can't comment on the music however, since it ruins the immersion for me, no music necessary.\n\nThe gameplay:\n\nExtremely smooth. Quick load times as usual, responsive keyboard and mouse. The recoil is extremely realistic, unlike other FPS games. Even throwing a grenade is bound to give your screen a shake. They slightly augmented the role of the nano suit here. This time, the energy regenerates much faster. Not only that, the energy regenerates no matter what. So even if you are swimming, your energy will eventually recharge even if you do not surface. Needless to say, that makes the game easier than the first one in that department. There is also a cover system even though I didn't use it a lot. It is reminiscent of the Killzone franchise, wherein you remain in cover and you are able to peek out and see what's going on ahead, instead of being able to see everything if you were playing a third person shooter.\nYou can still grab the aliens by their throat and choose to either knife them, throw them or use them for cover. But you can't just take any alien by its throat. You have to either soften the alien and pump it full of lead first or punch it a few times, then you have the option to grab the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nSliding. Not really that useful but it's nice to have the ability.\nThe ability to climb up if you just can't reach that ledge. I found myself jumping from building to building just to grab onto the ledge and pull myself up.\nThe strong kick. Useful in kicking large things around.\nYou can upgrade your suit and your weapons based on your progress in the game and how many enemies you killed.\nIntroducing the nano vision. No more night vision. This time, you can see traces of water vapor or traces of heat or enemies while everything else on the screen remains black and white.\nThe game gives you the option to bypass your enemies completely, and most of the time you can pull that off.\nThere is some driving, but it only last a few seconds at a time.\n\nThe ammo caches are scattered throughout the city. So even though you cannot carry as much ammo at a time, you will easily find ammo elsewhere.\nThere are a few types of aliens, but most of them are infantry. You will find some big fat ones and a tripod. You will also see a couple of cloaking aliens.\n\nAlso, there really aren't that many enemies to fight in the game. In total, you will perhaps only kill around 150 foes. On one side, it will never get frustrating of getting swarmed by aliens and dying constantly. There is always plenty of room to maneuver. On the other side, it does not really feel like there's a lot of fighting going on. There's a couple of companies of the Army and the Marines roaming the city and there is only a handful of aliens.\n\nThe weapons:\n\nThe weapons are plenty, probably as many as in Crysis:Warhead. The ones are also introduced. I am only happy to once again comment on the realistic recoil of all weapons.\n\n\nThe negatives:\n\n1. The aliens aren't really that menacing, but they do look like the aliens from Battle:Los Angeles.\n2. The invasion does not really feel like a real invasion, but a series of isolated skirmishes.\n3. Fighting aliens is a lot like fighting humans, not that I know what it would feel like fighting aliens. But regardless, they do take cover, they do retreat and they don't really have any special abilities.\n4. There is a slight re-spawn of enemies but not anything like in Call of Duty series.\n5. The game is not an exact replica of New York City. Maybe only 50%-60%.\n6. There are some bugs there and there especially with the AI. The AI is good for the most part. But this one time I was laughing my ♥♥♥ off when I saw an enemy soldier jump over obstacles when he actually tripped over the obstacle and fell head down and then got up. I don't know if that was just a crazy physics' engine bug or actually part of the AI algorithm that has a % 0.00001 chance of this happening.\n\n\n\nFinally, the production values are off the charts and there really is no good reason why you shouldn't buy this game. And I haven't even played the multiplayer yet.","November 27, 2013","true","3.2"," 74 of 115 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","74","115","0","2"

It's a basic story where aliens from the first game and arrive in New York. You play as a Marine, Alcatraz, who wears the Nanosuit and goes on a mission to defeat the aliens, evacuate New York with your fellow Marines, all while fighting off a PMC called C.E.L.L.\n\nSo gameplay wise, it's good. You have the armor abilities that are really cool, but remind me a bit of Halo. They are Cloak and armor. Also, before you enter a combat section. Your computer tells you "Tactical Options Availble", where you seek the different ways to approach it. You acn go in guns blazing or sneak around the enemies.\n\nThe sound design in this game is excellent. The noise, explosions and music all fit the game. But the way the character models move looks clunky sometimes, and the voice acting of Nathan Gould is a bit funny to me. Especially when his character model looks like a nut-case.\n\nSo overall, I give this game a 7/10.

The levels were also scaled down from the huge open world levels from Crysis to corridor levels which allow only one approach to the objective most of the time. The multiplayer also change to fit the traditional "Call of Duty formula".\n\nOverall, Crytek really dissapointed me by changing the pace of the game, but if you are looking for a multiplayer shooter with a nice story, it's worth a visit.","March 23, 2013","false","15.2"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","39","57","0","2"

I just finished Crysis 2 for the second time on the PC.\n\nThis is one of the best games I have ever played. Conceptually it is a masterpeice. Alien invaders, hostile humans, friendly humans, a terrific and engaging plot with high standards in terms of the script and voice acting. The level design is fantastic with an openess which allows many paths through areas and a game mechanic that permits stealth or force as an approach. The cutscenes do nothing to break the immersion and the scale of events around the player create a feeling of being caught up in something Earth shaking. Literally.\n\nIf there was one game that I would hold up as an example to developers of How to Make Computer Games, Crysis 2 would be it. This would be in my top five games of all time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/108800/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nCrysis 2 is an Action FPS with various degrees of stealth and environmental combat. Crysis 2 Maximum Edition was developed by Crytek Studios and Published by EA, Crysis 2 was released in 2011.\nDisclaimer: Multiplayer is gone, so that whole aspect of the “Maximum Edition” just went down the drain.\nReference: http://www.pcgamer.com/crysis-and-crysis-2-pc-multiplayer-will-shutdown-with-gamespy/\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You are the Marine “Alcatraz”, Alcatraz inherits the Nanosuit 2.0 from it's previous owner whom calls himself “Prophet”, and now everyone in the game will call you prophet for half of the game.\n(This greatly annoyed me... to the degree that after an NPC exclaimed, “It's Prophet! Kill him!” I would promptly turn around and pummel him to death with my rifle stock.)\n\nThe story itself is a little bit tough to follow if you've not played the first game (like I haven't), but having a large repertoire of sci-fi media background I easily caught on to what was being discussed within the game. The story is about as interesting as you can expect from a FPS from 2011 (in my personal opinion that's nothing to be proud of).\n\nI've also felt that architectural cues are being lost on me, you play through the destroyed streets of New York City. I have been to NYC once, but I felt like a lot of the geometry in the game was referencing the city, but was ultimately lost on me since I'm not very familiar with NYC.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=521987017\n\nGameplay: The gameplay was the most enjoyable feature to Crysis 2; the Nanosuit 2.0 has a variety of upgrades which can be purchased after you kill and collect samples from the extraterrestrial aliens.\nThere are several ability enhancing traits the Nanosuit 2.0 offers: Sprint, Jump, Armor, Stealth, and Nano-vison. All of these abilities require suit energy, so there is a limited amount of time you can use these abilities, using multiple abilities drains energy even faster.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=521987110\n\nAchievements: There are no Steam achievements for Crysis 2. There were achievements for the Xbox version of the game, so someday there might be an update with achievements, but at this time there are none.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=521987145\n\nPrice: Crysis 2 – Maximum Edition is priced at $29.99. Unfortunately “Maximum Edition” is a fancy way of saying “here, download extra junk you can't use, because there isn't multiplayer anymore”.\nBuy the game when it's on sale, the game itself should be priced lower for the content and the amount of time it will take to play through the game. One play through will take approximately 6-9 hours, depending on the difficulty and how “completionist” you are.\n\nConclusion: All in all, Crysis 2 was a good game. Mediocre sci-fi story. Entertaining and rather flexible gameplay. No steam achievements at this time. Over priced, wait for a steam sale or bundle deal.\nI recommend this game to people who enjoy FPS, but unfortunately this fall into my “play and forget” game categories, so ultimately it doesn't have any niche that sets it apart from other generic story-driven FPS's out there.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update September 26, 2015:\nSpellchecking, thank you Angfucious.","September 26, 2015","true","9.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/108800/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Crysis 2 is a first-person post-apocalyptic shooter developed by Crytek Studios and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released in March 2011. The story continues from Crysis 1 where the Ceph invaded the Lingshan Islands into them invading New York, USA. The player plays as Alcatraz, a member of Force Recon One, whose mission to infiltrate and capture Dr. Nathan Gould goes terribly wrong. This review will discuss the campaign and the dialogue, the gameplay and the features, performance and graphics, and the issues with the game. I did not test the multiplayer component as the online portion went offline in 2015. In addition, the Maximum Edition aspect of the game is irrelevant as all of the contents were related to multiplayer.\n\nCrysis 2 encompassed a good and logical storytelling campaign. The story expands on the Ceph invasion into America from the Lingshan Islands and the inevitable counter-attack by the Americans. Furthermore, the game provides great insight into the background of characters that carried before and through both games, notably Prophet and Jacob Hargreave. For instance, Prophet reveals that following Crysis 1, he found out it was not the last of the Ceph, rather the beginning of a new war. The story in the game made sense by the end of the campaign so I commend Crytek for elegantly telling the story. However, I do not like the massive logic gap from Crysis 1 to 2 because the sequel does not mention the aftermath of the cliff-hanger in Crysis 1 as the aftermath is explained through the Crysis comics series, which irritated me and I feel is an unwise business move. But, the dialogue in the campaign was excellent in telling the story. I completed the campaign in 10 hours and my favourite component was the team-based missions alongside the US Marines because many post-apocalyptic games result in a lonely protagonist. My second issue within the campaign was the lack of real excitement in cut scenes that clarified a major part of the overall story. For instance, when Jacob Hargreave reveals his knowledge about the Ceph, which I will not spoil, it comes across as another cut scene, not as a great storytelling moment, even if it was. Lastly, this game features some collecting aspects such as collecting dog tags on missions, collecting flashbacks, and so forth. It's not overly filler but it's not overly interesting to invest the extra time into finding the extras. Overall, the campaign is good because the story within the game, not the overall story is told with depth and precision and has minimal loopholes. The main issue of having to follow the comic series to determine what happened in the cliff-hanger from Crysis 1 does hurt my overall experience of the campaign.\n\nCrysis 2 possesses a variety of gameplay features to mostly improve the game. First, the game features a levelling system in which Alcatraz can kill the Ceph and garner Nano Catalyst points to upgrade his nanosuit. There are four different tiers with three upgrades in each, which is separated into tactical, armour, power, and stealth module tiers. This is a decent system because it allows you to improve Alcatraz's overall combat effectiveness and it has a nice balance to not overpower him but improve him because as the campaign progresses so does the difficulty of the Ceph. My major annoyance with this system was the lack of clarification if an ability is active or not once you purchase it. For instance, if I buy threat tracker, the game does not mention whether its active. The second gameplay feature is the layout of missions in the campaign. I really like the layout of the missions because despite the game being linear, you can approach a mission in a variety of ways. For instance, when Alcatraz opens his visor, he can see his tactical options for the mission, which may be going 100 metres to the right through stealth to complete the mission or going forward 30 metres and grenade the enemy. Furthermore, the weapon customisation system expands on the variety of approaches in a mission because Alcatraz can alter his gun depending on what approach he wants to take, ie. Stealth approach and a silencer. This freshens the gameplay and missions because Alcatraz has various options in completing a mission and can suit his equipment towards that approach. Lastly, the weapon combat, melee system, and vehicle movement and combat are all smooth, fluid and enjoyable. Vehicular combat does spice up the game, particularly on long distance missions. Overall, I commend the gameplay and the variety of features because it all does enhance the game experience.\n\nCrysis 2 has very consistent performance and beautiful graphics. This game reinforces why Crytek were the leaders in gorgeous games because this 2011 game is truly a stunning game. The graphics are superb, from the destruction that affects the landscape to the realism of characters to the overall tone of the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Furthermore, I like the simplicity of the UI, which is the main menu. The performance as mentioned, is very consistent. On my mid-tier system, which specs are highlighted on my profile page, I played on very high settings and drew a constant 35-50 fps. When there were FPS drops throughout a mission, there was no stuttering, making performance steady throughout a mission. However, at the beginning of the majority of missions there would be a major freeze probably due to a massive fps drop for some unknown reason. Loading times varied in the game. Some missions took longer to load than others, which was annoying on some levels but not a major nuisance. Overall, the only hitch in performance was the start of the mission stuttering, but for the most part this was a smooth game. Likewise, the graphics was top-notch.\n\nDespite most of the review containing positives and some containing negatives, this game had a ton of bugs and glitches. I encountered six bugs and/or glitches that occurred frequently throughout the campaign. For instance, the worst was the sound engine dying, resulting in me restarting my computer. The second worst annoying bug was dialogue showing up on the screen as I had subtitles enabled and the characters that were meant to say those lines went silent, pointing to more issues likely with the sound engine. And the other bugs and glitches was mainly relating to dialogue, event sequences and gameplay. All in all, the issues did hurt the game for me.\n\nOverall, Crysis 2 is a good game that features a logical and competent campaign, great gameplay and features, a beautiful atmosphere and environment and consistent performance for the most part. This game had a deep and logical story that explained the specifics and the broader picture. It provided fluid combat and various approaches to tackling missions, freshening the linear aspect of the game. The main issues was the logic gap from Crysis 1 to Crysis 2 due to the business idea that the story should be advanced through Crysis Comic series and the amount of bugs and glitches infested into it. This game is $29.99 and you can get up to 18 hours in my opinion on the game fitting in the campaign and the extras. At $29.99, I recommend getting this on sale. However, if you are completely new to the series, I recommend getting the Crysis Collection at full price of $44.99 because there is three different games that tell a massive story and all of which have been well received.\n\nRatings:\nI calculate the point system by rating each component I discuss and then averaging the total and deducting marks depending on the amount and severity of issues within the game.\n\nCampaign: 8/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics and Performance: 9.5/10\nOverall: 7.75/10\n\nThanks for reading my review!

It is however still a decent entertainment with a few perks, despite a lot of downsides.\n\nPro:\n- alien invasion gets some nice magnitude near the end of the game\n- the combat suit & its powers are relatively nice to play with\n- a few enemies are really hard and it gives a few intense fights, especially when they pair near the end of the game !\n- solo campaign is not too short, something like 10-15 hours if you don't speed-run all the way\n\nCons:\n- rhythm is very scattered because we have to pause to regain health & power every 30 seconds\n- stealth is OP & too easy\n- spam-hitting enemies with our rifle butt is OP\n- often alien enemies could easily kill us from a distance, but they always feel the urge to rush to us without firing to get spam-hit in the face with our rifle butt (and it's OP ;-) )\n- where is the final boss ? The final battle ? Hello ? Anything ? Anyone there ?\n- globally too easy, with only a few hard passes\n- no munition management : there are just munition boxes everywhere ; there are at least 2 or 3 times more munitions than an average player needs to kill all the enemies\n- you have to rush to get essence out of the killed aliens before it disappears ; in normal combat, it's already painful, but if you want to be a snipper, it means you'll never get the essence, and thus you won't be able to get the enhancements based on them\n- story isn't even worth a B-Movie (oh, 1 of the guy giving us orders by radio will actually betray us, what a surprise ! ;-) )\n- you can't shoot ill "zombied" people, even not gib them if they're already dead ; this gives an awful Disney World ride feeling... >_<\n- nearly game breaking bug : a bit after half of the game, you're supposed to take down a big alien ship ; except it doesn't spawn ; the soldiers firing around don't spawn either, so there are guns firing with no one holding them, which is rather funny. Fortunately, if the boss doesn't spawn, you can just power jump up on the side and walk a bit till you reach a tunnel which is the end of the level, and it'll load the next one","November 28, 2015","true","16.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","12","17","4","0"

With that said the stealth system is broken, where you can destealth behind a cement divider and a guy 100 meters away will just start shooting at you.\n\nHowever the game eventually turns into a horribly paced non-stop action filled shooter (that's not a compliment) where the only thing you can do is just shoot enemies and run to the next check point. Now this wouldn't be so bad but the gun play is awkward and the suit powers are pointless besides using stealth and armor if you are dumb enough to stand in direct fire.\n\nThere is so much happening every second that you just stop caring about a building falling down or another alien ship crashing or defending your comrades from attack for the effing 100th time.\n\nThe story is paced poorly as well and incredibly predictable. A large poriton of the campaign feels like pure filler. About 3/4 through the game the entire plot is frozen and you spend what seems like an enternity assisting the remaining marines in evacuating a dozen civilians and performing frustrating missions.\n\nI do not recommend as a Crysis fan I did not want a COD experience.

For the most part it is, but that doesn’t stop it from being better than almost all those games. It’s very different from the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead, but Crysis 2’s level design still has a certain quality that’s rare these days.\n\nIf you can find my user reviews of Crysis and Warhead, I described those games as possibly the last examples of sandbox-style mission design where you’re free to tackle objectives how you want in absolutely massive maps. Crysis 2 chucks that whole approach for something more similar to Call of Duty or better yet Halo. Crysis 2 has obvious chest-high walls for cover everywhere, quick-time events, a storyline about aliens and mercenaries that’s generic despite having been written by a published sci-fi author, upgrades bought with experience points, and generally gives players fewer options than its predecessors. It doesn’t however shove you down straight corridors, but maintains some semblance of the franchise’s open-ended nature.\n\nWhere in the original Crysis players would get a full map of an area and multiple objectives at a time, Crysis 2 will display a single waypoint at a time at the other end of a medium-sized area with maybe three or four routes through it. You might see a sky bridge flanking around some enemies, a hole in a barricade, or a small tunnel underneath the area. And the game will directly tell you all this by highlighting weapons and routes on your tactical visor, assuming you’re used to more linear shooters.\n\nFor what they’re worth Crysis 2’s levels are pretty well-designed. It’s still possible to sneak through most areas of the game and play the whole thing stealthily. When firefights do break out, instead of just popping in and out of cover you have a lot of room with which to employ some positional strategy on enemies. Effectively it’s like fighting in a Halo game’s combat arenas but with fewer vehicles.\n\nThe nanosuit’s powers have been adjusted a bit from the earlier games but the same general strategies apply: use cloak to sneak by or flank enemies (prone is gone by the way), throw objects and leap around with strength, etc. The main change is that armor mode is no longer the default but must now be switched on manually, so you have to factor it in when managing the suit’s energy. Speed mode is pretty much just the sprint which automatically consumes suit energy. Strength is actually just a super jump and a melee attack.\n\nThe aliens in Crysis 2 are simultaneously a bit more interesting to fight and more boring in how they work. In the earlier game Crytek tried to make them feel more “alien” by having them float around in the air with vague shield abilities, which could often make combat with them feel odd. In Crysis 2 they behave a lot more like humans as they walk on land, use what look like guns, and generally behave like your human enemies. Because they have different weak points and can sometimes disable your suit energy though, you still have to approach them differently. There’s one interesting new boss-type enemy that appears a few times throughout the game, and Crysis 2’s final combat sequence manages to be an unusually interesting and challenging fight.\n\nOne area in which Crysis 2 is unquestionably an improvement over the original is its visuals and its strain on your hardware. The sequel both looks and runs better than the first game, especially in DirectX 11. I guess being released on consoles meant Crytek had to actually optimize the game this time. Crysis 2’s use of lighting, post-processing, bokeh depth of field, and tessellation put it above all but a handful of games released since 2011 in terms of tech. It’s probably one of the earliest games to reach the threshold we’re seeing on PS4 and Xbox One now.\n\nOn my i5 and GTX 760, on maximum DX11 settings in 1080p the game runs at 60 frames per second almost all the time, occasionally dipping down to 50, and never going below 40. However, like its predecessors Crysis 2 does suffer the problem of locking to 24Hz when played in fullscreen on a TV. Forcing a borderless windowed mode with external software can fix this.\n\nTo compare, in my earlier reviews I called Crysis and Warhead simulations of 80’s action movie tropes where you can manipulate the mechanics of Predator and First Blood Part II however you want. Instead of a simulation, Crysis 2 feels like a game -- everything about its levels and mechanics has been transformed into a smaller set of rules Crytek wants you to follow, but within those rules it’s still one of the better games on the market.","January 10, 2014","true","12.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The whole map and scenery is completely soul-less, plain, boring, without any art at all. If in the first crysis it was wonderful to go around the enemies, surprise them, explore the forest and take a sea route, here you are confined to some urban streets, very few open small buildings (where you can even notice the copy-paste of the props), even the horizon looks closer than it should and everything feels confined, while in the original Crysis it was amazing to feel the first island (and the other levels) and the possibilities that it offered.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/108800/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","A visual treat of a follow-up to Crysis, the sequel completely changes direction and almost suffers from it, if not for its otherwise excellent game-play.\n\nWhilst Crysis and Warhead did very little truly interesting in the narrative department (with Warhead at least trying to do something about addressing that) the sequel quickly puts you into an entirely new environment and situation with very little explanation into a world that is a mess. Being ferried from one set-piece to the next on a strictly linear and far narrower path, I quickly realised that I was losing focus on what was going on with a conflict that seemed to spring out of nowhere and whilst there are obviously connections to the original, they seem tenuous at best. Crysis 2's narrative is a mess and whilst Crysis got away with its minimalist approach as it didn't shove it right up your face, it's hard to ignore the silliness going on in 2 as it, unfortunately, does shove it in your face.\n\nThe plus of all of this is that the core game is still very fun, if not severely reduced in scope and potential variation. Replacing open objectives are checkpoints along a trail that mostly replaces the how you approach an encounter with where you approach it from; the game does at least provide different routes for you to approach fights from that can give eager travellers an upper hand. This is particularly important given that the nature of your enemies have changed and whilst you're still fighting a lot of humans, you also have various alien enemies to take out, from foot soldier equivalents to large walking annoying bosses.\n\nThe removal of island openness does at least make way for some truly fun set-pieces though as the further you get into the game, the more interesting they become culminating in an extremely fun final level. As memorable as some of them may be though, there is an inherent reduction in the replayability in the game; you can only approach encounters in so many ways, set-pieces are only unique the first time and weapon variation (both in what's available and how many you can carry) limit the empowering craziness of the original and Warhead.\n\nUltimately, 2 feels very much like an extension of the ideas in Warhead, but at double the length and losing what made Warhead a fun in-between point of Crysis' openness and general FPS linearity. By the end of this game though, whilst I had felt satisfied, I was in no rush to play it again, nor even consider how I would attempt to go back to that particular set-piece and try completing it in a different manner. Essentially, there's one good run here before the game feels like it has expired.\n\nWhilst Crysis 2 does look fantastic and has a great sound-track to boot, it lacks much of the uniqueness that its predecessors had whilst only providing minor boosts to the things that already made it a great shooter. Fun overall, but a greatly reduced experience overall.\n\nMultiplayer: There's a greater push for the MP component in 2, but it essentially plays out like many small map-based shooters. A few interesting quirks here and there, particularly in your suit-enabled movement, but otherwise an extended feeling from the main game, that of competency and not much else.","June 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

This game is a great example of corperate greed. Yeah, that sounds about right.\n\nFirst off, the storyline is mediocre. I wish I could understand it, I really do, but to me this is like an epilogue to a poorly written spin-off of crysis. That isn't even the beginning.\n\nGameplay...Basically, it's Call of Duty with a nanosuit. Gun play and other mechanics mostly found in multiplayer are extremely close to CoD style, Crysis was it's own game and didn't rely too much on other games for ideas. That has come to a close with Crysis 2. Oh, and I almost forgot that everything is much more linear in the campaign than the original one was aswell.\n\nMultiplayer, yet again it's CoD with a nanosuit. In Crysis 1 you had tanks, vtols, and helicopters, and you had a CS styled buy menu, everything was bought with points you earned. Now, it's default weapons with class loadouts and unlocking new weapons requires leveling up, sound familiar? Oh, not to mention killstreaks such as Radars and Radar jammers, air strikes, and a ton of other things. Oh, and Mesa, the biggest MP map in the original crysis, is probably bigger than all of the MP maps in this game combined.\n\n"But if it's so bad, why did you get it?" It was part of the EA Humble Bundle, I didn't have to touch the keys for it but here I am, wanting to try and play SP again to see if I can make more sense out of it than I did when I first played and beat it.\n\nTL;DR: Don't get it if you're a huge fan of the first game in the series. If you love Cawadoody but you're looking for a little bit of change in your life, this will take the cake and your wallet.","August 17, 2013","false","9.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Yeah, the suit and weapon customization is there, but it's basically COD with crysis paint over it. This is one of those games where "consolization" can ruin a once beloved game (same thing happened with Deus Ex Invisible War, except that game was terrible) into a casual-friendly, graphics blazing, linear focused game.\n\nHow much equipment you can carry?\nIn the original crysis, you can select fists, dual wield pistols, carry 2 two-handed weapons, an RPG, different types of grenades (Flash, Frag and Smoke) and C4 charges.\nHere, you can't select fists, you can carry only 2 weapons (includes pistols, which is CODesque), an RPG, Frag grenades and C4. Nothing else.\n\nWeapon customization\nIn the original, rifles, shotgun, sniper rifle, smg, minigun and alien minigun can be equipped with laser sights which prove useful for the hardest difficulty, where there is no crosshair.\nHere, laser sight completely overrides how you handle the weapon. Worse, it's almost impossible to aim properly with it and did I mention it takes the scope/sights slot?\n\nWhat about sights and scopes? In the original, any two-handed weapon (minus the minigun and alien minigun) can be attached with any scope or leaving them scopless.\nHere, you can't attach a sniper scope onto a SCARAB, SCAR or an LMG (later in crysis 3, they added that functionality again from the original, but it's too late).\n\nWhat about fire modes? In the original, if you had a tactical attachment or a grenade launcher on your rifle, you can select any fire mode you want - from Full auto to Semi-auto to tactical attachment or grenade launcher.\nHere, any attachment you attach is going to replace the Semi-auto fire mode. How does that make sense? It's designed for consoles to qucikly switch between modes.\n\nFinally, the last part.\n\nThe engine - CryEngine 3\nIt's designed for both PC and Consoles, but you can clearly see that it's optimized for consoles. Not only that, but the engine itself is really buggy. You will see sometimes dumb A.I. enemies and partners that aid you in battle by simply standing and doing nothing, shooting at walls and sometimes they go in a t-pose or simply freeze. There is also a glitch where you can carry multiple weapons (i. e. a pistol, scarab, shotgun, sniper rifle etc. instead of 2 weapons), and also there are occasions where you have to reload the checkpoint or a level, because some levels can halt your progress if you don't play in a specific way.\n\nOverall\nOverall, the game is not good, but not bad either. It shows how the "consolization" process can ruin games by removing features, making the game sometimes linear focused so that the game works good on consoles and also simultaneously disappointing PC fans of the original. Sure, you can have fun with this game, but if you loved the original, keep in mind these things I mentioned, if these disappoint you, skip this game. But if you don't care about these problems, then I'd say give it a shot, but expect bugs and glitches. Most of them are patched, but the rest are still relevant.\nAs for my personal recommendation, I say skip it.","September 3, 2015","false","21.5"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

The single player campaign offers hours of game time and a very good story. The graphics are amazing and so is the sound. Crysis 2 provided a good mix of stealth, full-on action, vehicular combat and differing environments. As I played Crysis 1, Crysis Warhead and Crysis 2 one after eachother, I found Crysis 1 to have the better gameplay due to the more open environment. Crysis 2 offers the best storyline and fun. The 'tactical options' do add some choice, but seems only a thin layer above the heavily scripted game progress.\nI also tried multiplayer for a dozen matches. Should always be some servers around to have some fun. The multiplayer uses a reward system to progress your capabilities which means you will take alot of beating when starting. Nothing too frustrating though, as I found the mp matches fun and fast paced.\nOverall, a highly recommended FPS!\n\nScore: 8/10\n\nPro:\n+ excellent graphics\n+ immersive story\n+ nanosuit capabilities\n+ decent multi-player\n\nContra:\n- console-ish control system sometimes suffers\n- 'tactical options' only suggests open game world","April 4, 2014","true","16.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Years after release, it remains the king of the genre.\n\nIf you like halo, call of duty, and so on, this game should be a must play for you.

If you're a die-hard crysis OG fan, your blood is boiling reading this positive review by someone with Prophet as his steam avatar.\n\nWhich is fair. Everybody's allowed to have their opinion. But I implore that you recognize crysis 2's mastery of corridor shooting, to the point where it's hard to notice that you're in a corridor.\n\nAs of late 2014, multiplayer no longer works, but the singleplayer is excellent, and the soundtrack is excellent.

Mind you Crysis storyline might seem generic and cliche as they come and there's a definitely an element of truth to that.\n\nHaving played this game in 2016, almost 5 years after its release, I can certainly say that if you told me this was a 2016 game I've would have believed you. Sure the player models might seem a little stiff and dated, especially in a gaming era where facial animations are scrutinized constantly and Crysis 2 is worthy of complaints in that matter, the textures and the environment however still look as beautiful as ever. The times of old memes (WILL IT RUN CRYSIS) are perhaps gone, but this game is certainly worthy. Still looks good, especially in the maximum edition where it features the High Res textures.\n\nCrysis 2 gameplay is also pretty damn good. There's smooth movement, decent aiming, the action flows greatly and constantly at your own pace; you can take a stealth route to eliminating your enemies or you can go guns blazing. Naturally in higher difficulites a proper combination of both strategies will net you a quite satisfying and intense experience. The gunplay is great, there's a variety of different weapons to use, each one with their own stats and modifications. Don't worry, it's super simple to customize your weapon and you can do it on the spot too! No need to go back to a bench/whatever to modify your gun.\n\nYou want to stealth this part of the mission? Add a silencer and a scope. You want to fire more bullets? Add extended clip. You want a secondary function to your primary weapon? Add a grenade launcher! It is important to note that not all weapons have the same modifications and some unique and powerful weapons might not have any at all, but still this is a great feature which has unfortunately been completely ignored in the modern FPS.\n\nLast but not least, your nanosuit is essentially what makes you an unstoppable soldier. There's armor mode to reduce damage taken and stealth mode which makes you invisible and allows for a more stealthy approach. The modes are mutually exclusive which makes sense and use energy. Furthermore you can upgrade your suit as well with different enhancements which can also be done on the spot as well! Improve your armor absorb, make you stealthier, decrease the energy drain etc. Admittedly there around 15 to choose from but they are there and they can define the way you play through missions.\n\nFor completionists, there are several collectibles scattered around the different levels which include: emails to expand on the lore, collectible dog tags, collectible car keys and souvenirs from New York.\n\nThe level design is magnificent. The city of New York looks wonderful,   even after the Ceph invasion and destruction, the map progress allows for a semi-linear if you will completion of objectives. Don't think that this is not a linear game. It totally is, however there's a degree of freedom in which you can complete some of these objectives. You can avoid enemies if you will, flank them, use vehicles, detach turrets from barricades etc. The gameplay is absolutely great, never a dull moment and it keeps you on your toes constantly.\n\nNow for me of course, since I'm a sucker for 90s/early2000s blockbusters (The Rock, Independence Day, Armaggedon, Crimson Tide, Black Hawk Down) the story is pop-corn entertaining fun. The dialogue is as good as it gets, you get your epic speeches, your betrayals, your arrogant villains, basically all the tropes you'd expect in a movie. And you know what? It ♥♥♥♥ing works. It works so well in the concept of the game and it fits perfectly. And I cannot stress enough that all of this would otherwise seem silly if it wasn't for the exquisite soundtrack by no other that the master himself, Hans Zimmer. Hanz Zimmer is one of my favourite music composers and he's also the primary reason why I fell in love with the Single Player campaign of Modern Warfare 2. The soundtrack is epic and it intertwines with the gameplay, superb dialogue and the game itself in such a way that I think that any other soundtrack would have seriously affected the way I felt after I finished Crysis 2.\n\nNow the negatives which definitely exist but by no means take away the joy of the game. The enemy is AI is a little bit weird, don't expect smart enemies who will try to do everything in their power to kill you. Even at max difficulty, they behave is a rudimentary way. They hide behind cover, they fire, sometimes they might throw a grenade or two and they will try and move towards you. Nothing fancy and a bit on the silly side at occasions especially whenever stealth is involved. The models look a bit dated as I mentioned above and lip-syncing might be non-existant at moments. Notable example is the soldier talking to you while wearing a surgical mask, really shows that the developers didn't want to bother with lip-syncing and facial animations with the exception of some key characters. Most of the dialogue is transmitted to you via voiceover in the suitcomms however said dialogue I believe is vey well written  for the context that the game is based on.\nI'm not saying that this is the best dialogue in the history of gaming, but for the cheesy action packed game Crysis 2 is, the voice acting and the dialogue is brilliant.\n\nLastly the game is a bit short, not as short as such of the 4-6 hours of modern FPS single player campaigns (I estimate around 8-10 hours if you also want to get all collectibles), there's very few Quick Time Events but there are there, cutscenes while great tend to border on the unnessecary at times but overall Crysis 2 is a one of the greater games of genre and you should have the pleasure of playing it. I got this at less than 5 euros during a sale and I think it was a steal compared with the entertainment I got out of it.\n\ntl;dr: Crysis 2 is a brilliant FPS and you should definitely have the pleasure of enjoying it yourself, strongly recommended, a true classic.","June 1","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These parts are like the game is throwing you some unrelated maps, where you either choose a stealth aproach or go for a direct assault. Hence you feel like you are playing some challenge maps rather than playing a campaign. Combining with the poor AI, technical issues like crashes to desktop many times and falling out of map, you are highly disappointed.\n\nLuckily, with the mission that you met a crew of soldiers, the game starts to rise, both in atmosphere, gameplay and story. From this moment on, it is kind of that you step into a complete different game, and that game has its moments. It is a shame that the developers force you to play a good portion of the game in a dull manner, after you see the second part.\n\nAs a conclusion, I recommend the game. Besides it's great visuals and sound effects, Crysis 2 has the essence. It is sad that this essence is not fully used, if so, we would have another Half Life 2 at hand.\n\n7/10","December 29, 2013","true","12.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Being ferried from one set-piece to the next on a strictly linear and far narrower path, I quickly realised that I was losing focus on what was going on with a conflict that seemed to spring out of nowhere and whilst there are obviously connections to the original, they seem tenuous at best. Crysis 2's narrative is a mess and whilst Crysis got away with its minimalist approach as it didn't shove it right up your face, it's hard to ignore the silliness going on in 2 as it, unfortunately, does shove it in your face.\n\nThe plus of all of this is that the core game is still very fun, if not severely reduced in scope and potential variation. Replacing open objectives are checkpoints along a trail that mostly replaces the how you approach an encounter with where you approach it from; the game does at least provide different routes for you to approach fights from that can give eager travellers an upper hand. This is particularly important given that the nature of your enemies have changed and whilst you're still fighting a lot of humans, you also have various alien enemies to take out, from foot soldier equivalents to large walking annoying bosses.\n\nThe removal of island openness does at least make way for some truly fun set-pieces though as the further you get into the game, the more interesting they become culminating in an extremely fun final level. As memorable as some of them may be though, there is an inherent reduction in the replayability in the game; you can only approach encounters in so many ways, set-pieces are only unique the first time and weapon variation (both in what's available and how many you can carry) limit the empowering craziness of the original and Warhead.\n\nUltimately, 2 feels very much like an extension of the ideas in Warhead, but at double the length and losing what made Warhead a fun in-between point of Crysis' openness and general FPS linearity. By the end of this game though, whilst I had felt satisfied, I was in no rush to play it again, nor even consider how I would attempt to go back to that particular set-piece and try completing it in a different manner. Essentially, there's one good run here before the game feels like it has expired.\n\nWhilst Crysis 2 does look fantastic and has a great sound-track to boot, it lacks much of the uniqueness that its predecessors had whilst only providing minor boosts to the things that already made it a great shooter. Fun overall, but a greatly reduced experience overall.\n\nMultiplayer: There's a greater push for the MP component in 2, but it essentially plays out like many small map-based shooters. A few interesting quirks here and there, particularly in your suit-enabled movement, but otherwise an extended feeling from the main game, that of competency and not much else.","February 11, 2014","true","14.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So the first Crysis was more like Far Cry, this one ain't. Maybe "not to mix up the franchise", but this one is entirely different from the first.\n\nStory\nThe overall story would make any Hollywood B-movie writer jealous: Alien infest NY, save it and just imagine Dolph Lundgren or Jean-Claude van Damme as protagonists. The worst is the old Hollywood narrative of the war-mongering soldier and the moderate civilians - more the other way round in real life, as we have seen with Rumsfeld and his generals (Hail to General Shinseki, btw!). Think of playing Half-Life 1 in modern graphics and combine that with Alien vs. Predator and you have got some sources of inspiration for the game. CELL remind me a lot of the soldiers in HL, even the sniper design is a reference to the Female Assassins in HL - which is not a bad thing by itself.\nThe characters are forgettable and one-dimensional. Besides, are stupid names like Alcatraz or CELL supposed to give a "tough" background or what? I know that Crytek bears the initials of the brothers who founded this developing studio, but does everything have to start with C as in Ceph, CELL, etc. ?\n\nGameplay\nYou play basically a single player campaign on multi player maps.\nGameplay is more like Call of Duty than HL: Utterly repetitive and w/o much imagination. Like in CoD most narrative elements are transported by cut scenes.\nA highlight of the game are the extremely well balanced weapons. Unlike I have seen on any other shooter before. It is really hard to pick a number 1 weapon with just 2 primary weapon's slots. All got their pros and cons and are very levelled by being able (or not) to carry certain weapon upgrades.\nThe enemy AI does react poorly in some occasions, as others also mentioned: The enemies seem to look thru objects once uncloaked (or even cloaked and "tagging"). Also, you can lure a whole map's worth of enemies out into a bottleneck situation, there you can kill them easily - as done in the final battle, even on Veteran difficulty a piece of cake.\n\nGraphics, etc.\nPlayed it on Win7 64bit and encountered some bugs as in not being able to pick up certain weapons and ammo as well as one critical bug which crashed the game. Replaying the mission on different difficulty solved this issue, but nonetheless not a nice thing.\nThe game shines on light and particle effects as well as on scenic views and all kinds of explosions: They are done amazingly, as well as the sound effects.\n\n"Maximum Edition"\nAll bonuses seem to be for Multiplayer only - which I haven't tried out.\n\nNeutral\nThe alien design didn't turn me on too much and in general the whole game lacked "decency". A bit too much bling-bling for my liking. This also includes the musical score, which is just slightly ott and too bombastic but matches the rest.\nAre there German tourists or ice-cream makers in NY or why (besides the origin of the developers) are German Eis-cream paper bags on the ground? ;)\n\nWhat games like this one and CoD lack in comparison with the Half-Life franchise, is basically the "intelligent gameplay". It is being taught a pattern, just to play mind games with the gamer and reverse the pattern, once adopted. It's those little moments of horror combined with a story and puzzles which are integrated in the game and not just a side quest. - This is all missing in this modern, tightly budget controlled games. Basically, sad, because it has its moments. I give it a thumps up, but do not recommend it.","June 17, 2014","true","75.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Games like The Hunter and Battlefield 3 that were designed with the PC in mind, blow this game out of the water in the graphics department. Truly a shame, as that was one of Crysis' most redeeming features.\n\nYou can see the influence in other areas as well. Smaller maps, less players in multi player, cut prone feature. A lot of options ended up getting cut or just tossed due to balancing around the console versions. It isn't that this is a really terrible game, it’s just if you were expecting a sequel that took FPS to a level like the original did, you will be disappoint.","May 18, 2014","true","13.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Typically, the shooting occurs in arena like settings with either waves of enemies to take out as they arrive, or with a large number present, but still in need of taking out. But how you choose to do so is up to you. Stealth kills work due to the suit's invisibility and weapon silencers (weapon custimization is a breeze), sniping is also an option, but the real fun is just going Rambo; sneaking up on an enemy, killing it, grabing its partner, throwing it into and explosive barrel, leaping over the flames, landing with a stunning stomp and unloading a clip, or two, or three. Sprinting for cover, cloaking and flanking, putting shields up and wading into the fray with a shotgun vomitting shells.\n\nThe downside is that it can get a little repatative. Yeah, ok, I killed the last few guys with the sniper, the gusy before that with running and gunning, the guys before that with a stealth kill.....after a while the fights do just become a slog. My remedy to that has been to simply play the game in 1-hour bursts to keep it a bit fresh.\n\nI would recommend picking up this game to anyone who enjoys Crysis or FPS games, although I would suggest waiting for a sale.","March 21, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So much drama...So many intrigues... All that due to EA's independence lust. Anyways, to TEH REVIEW! I think that Crysis 2 is a great followup to Crysis 1, which was quite...revolutionary in such type of Shooter games. One thing you'll notice first is: Almost all the abilities are gone from the ability ring. Now we have only our known Visor, Shield and Stealth there. The new ones would be the modifications for the body and the weapons -- I'll get to that in a second. I think that they did it greatly by integrating trivial things as super-jump and sprint into the good ol' buttons of SHIFT, and SPACEBAR. Now, I think that the ability to modify your weapons and body from that ring is GREAT, and I am mostly interested about body modifying. The ways to modify your nanosuit are great, sometimes even overpowered. I think that Crysis 2, for it's age is doing GREAT on graphics (Which can be seen by having the lowest options for graphics in the menu being "High", haha). I have a few problems with the AI as I am playing this on the Veteran difficulty (And I am in NO WAY an FPS player.), however, it's just the occassional (Really, doesn't happen that often) stupidness of the soldiers. The mutliplayer, man. It's amazing! As in almost every FPS multiplayer though... You have to unlock weapons and abilities. I think that the matchmaking is very good, however, I did stumble upon an instance where our team was literally getting destroyed, because the players had very good equipment and skills with this game.\nSo, from the 2013 perspective, I give it a:\n\n7.8\nHOWEVER, from a 2011 perspective:\n\n8.4\nJust due to the little graphical improvements and the AI I had to give a lesser one from 2013.","September 11, 2013","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly no, AI was a disaster. Cloak mode and armor mode of your nanosuit are your biggest helpers in the game, and with them, "Post-Human Warrio" difficulty was no match. Enemies and allies, all comporting strange... Crysis 3 will be an improvement on this I hope.\n\nScenario: Well, the story was good honestly, being compared to most FPS. Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Arnold Schwarzannager's Predator are big inspirations for the writers of this game, definitely. The story takes place after 3 years of the Crysis 1 and Crysis Warhead. To be able to understand it completely, you have to pay full attention to the in-game dialogues and watch entire of the Prophet's Visions videos, which are available in unlockable section in main menu. Otherswise you'll be confused with big gaps on the fiction, therefore you may not like the story. It's like a puzzle. My only criticism here to Crytek might be the bad presentation of it. And if you don't like the science-fiction/aliens genre, this is not your game.\n\nCrytek also appointed a science-fiction writer to write a novel, thay may help studying the story in a wider perspective. Lastly, Crysis Wikia will be enough to "veneer" your knowledge of Crysis universe, especially the page of Jacob Hargreave.\n\nAnd even though the game imposes the usual alien invasion theme, Nanotechnology is an important research are in 21st century, so I kinda like it how they built the story of the nanosuit and its capabilities on it. A huge potential area to tell a story, via a game.\n\nGameplay: My biggest concern on the gameplay was "spawning enemies". Yeah, when you're beating the game on the hardest difficulty, spend your 30 minutes to clear a part of the map with huge effort, and after all seeing spawning enemies out of nowhere is not a nice experiment.\n\nSo FFS Crytek, drop spawning enemies from your future games.\n\nThere's no savegame function, but that's okay. My only complaint about it is the long time periods between the checkpoints. Dying after a large progression can take you back to a so early portion, which can ruin your gaming and enthusiasm.\n\nLastly, abouth the "Nanosuit Improvement" part... You can access this part by pressing H in-game. You're granted catalyst point by killing Cephs throughout the game, the with enough accumulation, you can buy some cools improvements. But some of these improvements are so pointless. For example, de-cloaking your invicible enemies... There were only 4 invicible enemies in the game, all of them were in the last mission, at the last part of it. Which took 1 minute for me to kill them all. Unlocking this feature took 16000 catalyst points, which was also the most expensive feature of all.\n\nWhat were you thinking Crytek? Have you released the game without being finished?  With the distributor being Electronic Arts, that's a high possibility. EA is known for putting stress on the developers to release unfinished products in a pushed calendar.\n\nMusics composed by Hans Zimmer, who's known for his works in movies like Batman Trilogy, Rain Man, Gladiator, vice versa. The Main Theme was perfect.\n\nGraphics are alreadly critically acclaimed.\n\nSo 10 points for visuals, 10 points for sound effects and musical score.\n\nAnd my overall score for Crysis 2 is 8/10 with all pros and cons summed up.\n\nPost Script: I haven't tried the multiplayer experience, I'll give it a shot when Crysis 3 hits.\n\nCheers, Can","February 1, 2013","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is absolutely beautiful. Even on mid end laptops like mine, it looks incredible. The color and lighting makes this game look so realistic, and the intro video to the game is the most epic intro I have ever seen in a game. The graphic quality is on par with the best games TODAY (Despite being almost 2 years old), and easily wins over most FPS. The score is by Hans Zimmer (who also composed the Dark Knight), and is very well done. The gameplay is special - it kind of reminds me of a combo of Battlefield, Blacklight: Retribution, and Halo. Elements from each game polishes this one, and the campaign is a lot of fun. Got it from the Humble Bundle, and very happy that I donated and got this game:)\n\nOverall:\n\nGraphics: 10 out of 10. This game challenges big ones like Planetside 2 and Battlefield 3 in terms of graphics. CryEngine 3 for the win!\n\nGameplay: 9.5 out of 10. In this game, you are more than just a character... you are a WEAPON. Stealth and strength are your main tools; you can either choose to use stealth elements and make the combat feel like an FPS Metal Gear Solid game, or use "Maximum" elements and go bananas on the enemies using brute force.\n\nCampaign: 9.5 out of 10. Has good replay value, and long story line.\n\nMultiplayer: 8.5 out of 10. The multiplayer is awesome, but you may need to be very patient. My first few matches online were miserable... I was confused on how to set up my classes, and the people online are very competitive. There are lobbies dedicated for "Recruits", but those are always filled up, so good luck on "Standard" or  "Pro" lobbies. Doesn't take long to adapt, however.\n\nOverall score: 9.5 out of 10. All I could say is... I regret not buying this game any sooner. I will buy the entire series (Crysis Maximum Edition and then Crysis 3) very soon.

However, unlike it's predecessor, Crysis 2 doesn't quite manage to get quite as much right, and not even ridiculously beautiful visuals can patch that up.\n\nUnlike the first Crysis, Crysis 2 sets it's scene in a post-invasion New York City that has been partially infested by the alien Ceph. Players take the role of US Marine, Alcatraz, the only believed survivor of his team. Upon arriving in the city, you soon discover that an alien invasion is upon the planet, and meeting 'Prophet' you quickly set off to put a halt to the invasion equipped with all the wondrous capabilities of the Nanosuit.\n\nSporting an updated engine, Crysis 2 is a simply beautiful game. While some may disagree, it's quite plain that Crysis 2 is in fact better to look at than the first game, with improved lighting effects, tessellation and rendered models. Light slithers through leaves casting majestic rays to the ground, bricks jut from the walls and shatter on impact while dust kicks up at the vibrations of your firearm. Crytek's second iteration is a spectacular action ride with a phenomenal soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer himself, and vertigo inducing cityscapes that would put a movie to shame. I don't usually get quite so worked up over something quite so trivial as visuals in a game, but in this instance, you just can't take an achievement such as this lightly. On a different note, the game play has been streamlined from the first game, with the Nanosuit ability interface from Crysis replaced with one that combines strength and speed into a single mode, and binocular and identification vision implemented into the suit, instead of as external tools. Furthermore, a climb and parkour system helps to speed the flow, overall creating a far more slimmed down experience that actually does improve the game in some respects. While some may disagree, I do feel that this far better fits Crysis as whole.\n\nThanks to the improved engine, Crysis 2 was able to run on last generation's consoles, but because of this the game doesn't quite look as good as it could have been, and does suffer from some limitations that could possibly have been avoided had the game been designed as a PC exclusive like the first game. Environments, while aesthetically pleasing and atmospherically different, are far more linear than in the previous game, which does cause the game to become boring after a while, as we are constantly spoon-fed the next section with little room to breathe. While the sound effects are still of top notch tier, the actual selection of weapons available is in fact far smaller than in the first game, meaning that you feel like less of an overly-equipped bad ♥♥♥, something I'm sure we can agree isn't exactly a selling factor. In addition, while the story does well to justify your marine/ alien kill spree, it simply isn't quite as gripping as the first game, with explosions and falling buildings seeming to happen *just-cus*, eventually numbing you to the action.\n\nThe multiplayer is still present, moving from an open Battle-Field-like approach and to one that more resembles Call of Duty. Again, the excellent graphics do wonders to patch up some of the game's more minor flaws, but unlike the previous game, they don't do enough to hide some of the more jarring facts. It would appear that Crytek substituted innovation for convenience in the production of the game play mechanics themselves, and because of that we have received a game that feels like it could have been so much more had the team not been hindered by limitations of the console scene...\n\n+ Yet again phenomenal graphical fidelity\n+ Streamlined game engine\n- Linear world\n- Numbing plot that doesn't quite match Crysis'\n\n7.5/10 ~ Good\n\nEpicSouls (Sam)","December 8, 2013","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Running the game on ultra settings it looks absolutely AMAZING, heck even on low settings (which they call "high") the game looks damn good. The story of the game kind of dragged on for a while, but I enjoyed it and the few plot twists that were included, overall a fairly strong narrative. Gameplay wise it is one of the most fun FPS's I have ever played. It is not your typical CoD FPS, and if you play it like one you will die. A lot. It requires strategy and timing, especially on the higher dificulties. If you enjoy single player story driven games with good combat and a good story, then this is a must have, especially since I've played the game for roughly 14 hours in the story mode lifetime and still havent finished (although I did have to start over once and spent a while tinkering in the settings). However most of the good parts of the game end here. The multiplayer partition of the game is nowhere near as poished as the campaign. The multiplayer tries to do what CoD does, and like I said before, this game is not like CoD and shouldn't be played like it. The powers seen in campaign remain here, but are drastically nerfed with quicker draining energy, weaker shields, and easier to spot cloaking. This may be so to balance the game, but this didn't work because I found this multiplayer to be very unbalanced. I would always die from someone I would never see, or even I would get the jump on them and they would still kill me. I would accredit this to the fact that I was awful at the game, but after 2-3 hours of gametime nothing changed, and looking at other reviews it's safe to say that the multiplayer is highly flawed. However even so it is still fun to play. Overall: great single player experience, tacked-on multiplayer, and generally a good game, especially with a powerful PC.","December 20, 2013","true","20.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You were alone, no hand holding you, just go in, do your ♥♥♥♥. You're the Rambo-Predator hybrid.  The dude in the suit was a faceless numbnuts, you were playing as the suit, and the gameplay was about playing as the suit.\n\nCrysis 2 you're special forces. You're fighting constantly, it's a close struggle, but you're vulnerable and somehow taking on waves of enemies. Your suit is a utility rather than a necessity, and that plus the lack of HUGE nonlinear levels in the sequel are the key differences between the two.\n\nCrysis 2 can be positively looked at only in its shooting mechanics, which feel very nice and are responsive, with guns that have unique behaviors and customization.\nBut hey, Crysis 1 and warhead had that as well.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn Crysis 1, I could approach objectives anyway I wanted to.\n\nI could stealth into the enemy camp, grab men by the throat and toss them through a wall to create a breach. I could cut down pieces of palm trees, attach C4 to them, and toss them a hundred yards downrange with maximum strength. The only limit was my own creativity.\n\nCompared to that, Crysis 2 was an utter waste of time.\n","August 17, 2013","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So much drama...So many intrigues... All that due to EA's independence lust. Anyways, to TEH REVIEW! I think that Crysis 2 is a great followup to Crysis 1, which was quite...revolutionary in such type of Shooter games. One thing you'll notice first is: Almost all the abilities are gone from the ability ring. Now we have only our known Visor, Shield and Stealth there. The new ones would be the modifications for the body and the weapons -- I'll get to that in a second. I think that they did it greatly by integrating trivial things as super-jump and sprint into the good ol' buttons of SHIFT, and SPACEBAR. Now, I think that the ability to modify your weapons and body from that ring is GREAT, and I am mostly interested about body modifying. The ways to modify your nanosuit are great, sometimes even overpowered. I think that Crysis 2, for it's age is doing GREAT on graphics (Which can be seen by having the lowest options for graphics in the menu being "High", haha). I have a few problems with the AI as I am playing this on the Veteran difficulty (And I am in NO WAY an FPS player.), however, it's just the occassional (Really, doesn't happen that often) stupidness of the soldiers. The mutliplayer, man. It's amazing! As in almost every FPS multiplayer though... You have to unlock weapons and abilities. I think that the matchmaking is very good, however, I did stumble upon an instance where our team was literally getting destroyed, because the players had very good equipment and skills with this game.\nSo, from the 2013 perspective, I give it a:\n\n7.8\nHOWEVER, from a 2011 perspective:\n\n8.4\nJust due to the little graphical improvements and the AI I had to give a lesser one from 2013.","September 11, 2013","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Levels, althrough of the corridor-shooter variety, are varied and do allow for some variations in tactical approach. Typically, the shooting occurs in arena like settings with either waves of enemies to take out as they arrive, or with a large number present, but still in need of taking out. But how you choose to do so is up to you. Stealth kills work due to the suit's invisibility and weapon silencers (weapon custimization is a breeze), sniping is also an option, but the real fun is just going Rambo; sneaking up on an enemy, killing it, grabing its partner, throwing it into and explosive barrel, leaping over the flames, landing with a stunning stomp and unloading a clip, or two, or three. Sprinting for cover, cloaking and flanking, putting shields up and wading into the fray with a shotgun vomitting shells.\n\nThe downside is that it can get a little repatative. Yeah, ok, I killed the last few guys with the sniper, the gusy before that with running and gunning, the guys before that with a stealth kill.....after a while the fights do just become a slog. My remedy to that has been to simply play the game in 1-hour bursts to keep it a bit fresh.\n\nI would recommend picking up this game to anyone who enjoys Crysis or FPS games, although I would suggest waiting for a sale.","March 21, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is easy to get lost amongst the sheer scale of the seph-torn cityscapes of Manhattan, a city breathing with life due to the technically impressive CryEngine 2. That's right, the graphics are spectacular, with a great attention to detail, and cater to a range of builds. Other than the jaw-dropping, mouth-watering visuals, the combat in this game is excellently paced, challenging and genuinely fun. There is a large variety to weapons and suit upgrades, accommodating for a great many number of playstyles. The soundtrack does very well to harmonise with the constant action, in particular the main theme, composed with grandeur by Hans Zimmer. The story is fairly straightforward, with a foreseeable arc, although it does have its fair share of surprises.\n\nTl;dr Crysis 2 (Maximum Edition) is an excellent first-person action game, with beautiful visuals, varied gameplay and a really enjoyable campaign.\n\n9/10","September 24, 2012","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are given the illusion of being able to finish missions in stealth, but that is utterly not true. I was hoping I choose my own way of playing this advanced game, but looks like it has to be a mess from start to end if you really want to finish it.\nI only recommend it for its graphics and maybe, MAYBE, story line. Otherwise, I only have 4 hours in record and I cannot see myself playing it again.\n\nUpdate Jul. 2015: I decided to play the game since it was sitting and staring at me in the library. I learned how to go through it in "stealth", but it is still extremely difficult not to go about shooting everybody. Cloak is useful, but it's just not enough.

Well it pretty much is, and even though the game throws a few twists at you, it never feels like it is hard to grasp.\n\nYou are entrusted with saving New York from an alien threat, and it becomes apparent how important you really are when you come face to face with the Ceph, who pose a pretty large threat if you try taking them down with normal means. They put up quite a fight, even for a fully suited super tech equipted Marine. Through video instructions you are able to see just how quickly the Ceph are taking over and pose a threat to the entire country if you do not act quickly.\n\nGameplay ~Remember all of those Ors at the top of the review? Those options are what make Crysis 2 such a wonderful game to play.\n\nThe game loads sections of the map at a time, unlike the first game, and tasks you with taking-out enemies (Or sneaking past them if you can) to complete objectives. When given these options and the ability to scan the area for weapons and threats, you have all the options in the world to beat each section however you see fit!\n\nThe Nano Suit boasts 3 main powers that can activated or deactivated at will:\n-Sleath Mode          (Sneaky)\n-Armor Mode           (Tanky)\n-Power Mode          (Stabalize/Jump/Sprint)\n-and Tactical Mode  (...Tactical)\n\nPick one, or pick them all, and enjoy ripping enemies to shreds by means you chose!\n\nPresentation\nThe game is beautiful.\nLook at screen shots.\nI dont even need to write anything here.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nCrysis does so much right, I am a huge sucker for choice in games, and an even BIGGER sucker for stealth in games done right.\n\nEach mode you can activate feels balanced and you have to adapt yourself to each one. Stealth is of course my favorite, and I would always do my best to get assassination kills with silenced weapons because when you expose yourself, some enemies will call for backup.\n\n\n+Great Musical Score that hit all the right notes when it needed to\n+Wonderful Pacing: You always felt like you were accomplishing something\n+Superb Gameplay complimented by unique weapons and gadgets\n+Tactics encouraged!\n\n+/- Graphical glitches on Ceph were farely common when executing.\n\n\n-Character dialogue was cheesy...very very cheesy\n\n9/10\nLoved it","June 23, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, it's generic though so you can piece it together yourself after a few minutes. Actually, I suppose that means they did the job effectively. Later in the game the plot, continuing from Crysis 1, actually thickens but I just never became invested in it or the person I was playing as. Although the first game was admittedly linear, this game felt even more so. Actually, I have the perfect way to convey what I mean. The single player campaign for Crysis 2 was basically a Call of Duty style campaign. If that doesn't help then I'll speak plainly: The whole game is just a sequence of set-pieces separated by auto-checkpoints. e.g. You pop up on a bridge and have to sneak past a patrol and through a gate. You can activate Tactical Vision and it will point out all the methods/routes you may take to get to the next checkpoint. Then you try one. If you die you can reload and try again. And again.\n\nGameplay is identical to the first but some of the controls have become more intuitive. No more Strength mode, you only get super strength when you throw something or jump over a tall obstacle. (To steady your sniper scope you can now hold your breath.) No more Speed mode either, you get speed when you sprint. Cloaking and Armor mode remain. I found this new system much, much more efficient than the original. Nobody walked around in either of those modes anyway.","January 19, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Multiplayer master servers have been taken down so nobody plays online anymore.  Not a lot to it, you can beat it in less than 15 hours if you're good at fps, or don't feel the need to slaughter everything that walks across your path.\n\nPluses:\nThis game is pretty.  It's Cryengine's showcase game so that's to be expected.  Still pretty by today's standards.\nThis game has a lot of variety.  You have objectives, and obstacles that get in the way off those objectives.  Fortunately there's a lot of ways around those obstacles.  You can snipe them, cloak and then come up behind them and knife them, charge head on with an assault rifle, throw grenades, ignore them completely and run past them, find a tank and run them over, etc.  So that's fun.  Note: It is really hard to kill the armored brute aliens by punching them to death, I advice Jaw rockets from a safe distance.\n\nModding available and encouraged by devs.\n\nThe AI is fairly clever and is fun to play against, though sometimes it feels like they're cheating when they aim at you when you're cloaked.  The story is...well really cliche'd, but mostly engaging.  You nearly die a lot, it kind of gets a bit old.  I got this game as a gift, so I'm not sure if I would pay full price for it or not - but if it's on sale go for it!\n\nHaving never played Crysis before, I had no idea what was going on with the story or why there are aliens in downtown New York, but that's not really important I suppose.  I'm a nano-suit wearing badass, I'm there to shoot them in the head not ask questions.  Also I couldn't flirt with the cute girl which was disappointing (couldn't shoot her either, also disappointing), but at least she doesn't die.  That would be very disappointing.\n\nI kind of like the soundtrack.  Also Lockheart hates me.  :(  What did I ever do to him!?\n\n","June 21, 2015","true","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

While I beat the game in the hardest difficulty "Post Human Warrior", the game is all about tactics; either you want to take everyone out the old fashion way or sneak in and take one-by-one, but keep in mind, is not as simple as it sounds because the AI change their tactics and is not as predictible as you may think. Once you get used to how the nano suit works, it will become easier and easier, to the point you will be able to think faster and given the situation act accordingly. I wont say anything about the plot of the game, because if better if you experience it by yourself; all I can say is I liked it. Multiplayer is crazy and I've still some practice to do.

Excellent game 9/10.\n\nIf you’ve played Crysis and/or Crysis 2, you’ll know that millions of years ago, an alien race placed a huge amount of war machines deep underground with tunnels leading all over the world. After an elite team of nanosuited soldiers explored the alien presence on an remote island, the only character to return is Prophet, the team leader who kind of went crazy at the end. Now you find out that Prophet wasn’t actually crazy, but had a secret mission to gather as much info as possible about the aliens now known as the Ceph. Unfortunately for Prophet, his extreme exposure to the Ceph has contaminated him with the Spore, a kind of bio weapon that the Ceph have unleashed on New York to wipe out all the humans.  You take on the role of Alcatraz, a Force Recon marine sent into the quarantined New York City to help Prophet, and you end up taking on Prophet’s nanosuit when he falls.\n\nUnlike the first couple Crysis games, the nanosuit isn’t just a tool; it’s a major plot point. The suit’s super advanced computer software is working on a way to combat the spore and save the world, not just kick alien ♥♥♥. Your main nanosuit powers have been streamlined since the previous games and now have 2 main “modes” (armor and stealth). Instead of having Speed and Strength modes, those powers are now integrated into your actions. For example, you can pick up a large object and toss it without switching to strength, or you can use stealth (cloak) and speed at the same time. By the way, the stealth mode is probably overpowered in the single player campaign. You can turn invisible and sneak past about 90% of the enemies in the game if you want (no reason not to sneak past the human enemies unless you like gunning people down).\n\nHowever, when it comes to alien enemies, the best solution is peace through overwhelming firepower. There are more than a dozen different weapons to choose from, and you can carry 2 of them at once (5 if you count the “disposable” weapons). Like in the previous Crysis games, you can customize nearly all of the main weapons with attachments such as silencers, scopes, and extended magazines. If you want to do things quietly though, just sneak up behind the enemy and do an instant stealth kill with your melee. It’s not only silent, it’s also a good way to pick up the nano catalyst that aliens leave when they die. The nano catalyst is like money that you can use at any time to buy upgrades for the suit. There aren’t many upgrades to choose from, but they can be quite a boost (and they carry over to your next playthroughs, so future campaigns are a lot easier).\n\nPros:\n+Excellent graphics, and the game is actually less demanding than the previous Crysis games in terms of hardware requirements. The game is taking place in the city, so there’s no waving grass and tree foliage to stress your graphics card.\n+The story is decent though I know a bunch of people didn’t like it. You get a nice variety of enemies and a large variety of ways to dispose of them. Crysis 2 isn’t open world, so the story and gameplay is pretty linear. You don’t need to drive all over an island like in Crysis 1.\n\nCons:\n-Like I mentioned earlier, the stealth mode is probably too good. You can stay invisible for about 20 seconds and just run past all the enemies. This is especially true after you’ve beaten the game at least once because you won’t need to fight aliens for nano catalyst (you’ll already have bought all the upgrades).\n-It’s a hefty installation size (about 14 gb) for a game that I beat in about 7 hours.\n\nOverall, the game is great fun and you can replay it a few times before you really get bored of it. Online multiplayer requires an additional sign up (it’s not through Steam).\n","April 13, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Morgan, who wrote one of my favorites, Altered Carbon.\n\nSet five years after the first game where you first witness the Ceph in all their terror on Langshan, the Ceph have made their way to NYC, an urban jungle (as described by Crytek devs). I think the most remarkable thing about Crysis 2 might be the attention to detail with the recognizable buildings and showing their true height, just looking up at them in a video game shows how massive NYC can really feel from a virtual perspective. Obviously, it helps that the CryEngine is perhaps the best engine out there in terms of graphical prowess.\n\nI really liked the story, mainly because I'm a sucker for sci-fi games. So the various twists and military factions you encounter while trying to survive from the Ceph was nice. Granted, it's rather easy to survive from the Ceph is you use cover appropriately and kind of strategize your plan of attack. Or you can stealth your way around them, I did that a few times just to see what would happen; can't do that the whole game though as really, most of the Ceph you'll have to kill just to move forward.\n\nI didn't check out the multiplayer, but I bet it's pretty cool. And the way the game ended definitely set it up for Crysis 3, gonna play that soon.\n\n9.3/10","June 29, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So this review is only of the singleplayer campaign.\nIn my opinion, this game is not worth the full price. Story took about 7 hours at a normal pace, and really wasn't all too engaging. As far as gameplay, I am 99% certain it is locked at 30 fps which was a downer, but I suppose you don't notice it too much in the middle of a fight. There is a good mix of environments and enemies, although towards the end it does get somewhat repetitive. Luckily you have a few different options for going about combat with your suit ablities (invisibility, armor ect.). There are a few bigger alien "bosses" that will be thrown in here and there, and really aren't too hard to get past. Visually the game looks awesome, and there is a good pace of changing environments.\nSo with the rather short campaign, somewhat cliche story and locked fps, I woudn't reccomend getting this game at full price. But if you can pick it up at a good discount, it is a very entertaing game for what it is and a very nice challenge. Watch some gameplay and see if the mechanics appeal to you, they really can get quite fun.","December 23, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Challenging battles and very beautifully crafted warzone environment.  Often you need to stop and look around the giant battle arena and see how awesome a place the developers crafted.

It very often leaves you fighting for your life, without any clear idea as to what you are actually supposed to be doing. This is a fault that plagues the game at a number of different points.\nThe game doesn't give that sense of freedom that was in 1, feeling much more constrained and scripted; much most like a console game, which of course it is.\nOne thing I really dislike is the inability to save whenever you like. All you get is checkpoint saves. This means that a particularly tough section you may have to play and listen to all the commentary again and again and again...!\nHaving said all that, it's still a very enjoyable game. It gathers pace as you play it, so stick at it for a while. It's a definite "must have" even though I still prefer Crysis 1.","September 17, 2012","true","14.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

While dissapoining to some, Crysis 2 still remains to be one of the most beautiful games out there. Although, it doesn't provide the same "sandboxed" feeling as the first two, the maps do still offer a variety of approaches from full head-on assaults to stealth kills. Crysis 2 does excel in a more streamlined approach to using the nano suit so the gameplay remains fast, intense and versatile.

The weakest point about the game is the writting, but all crysis games suffer from it, the most effort was put into Graphical fidelity and Game mechanics so personally I don't mind about the plot.\n\nA lot of Critics say that Crysis 2 is a mundane First Person Shooter, I disagree and I say eat a bag of bricks. Crysis 2 despite for not having a fascinating plot and some content removed it's still a underrated gem with futureproof game engine. I higly recommend on playing the hardest difficulty for more enjoyment. Because of you getting instantly killed with few shots your only option will be to engage in tactics.\n\nAlso the performance is surpizingly amazing, I'm an overclocker myself and on my low-end gear it runs fantastic.\nI get 55-61 FPS on Max Settings, vsync off.\n\nGTX 650 Ti 1GB GDDR5 (OC @ 1085Mhz Core 3.300Mhz Memory)\nIntel core 2 Quad 2.4GHz (OC @ 3.6Ghz)\nMuskin Silverline 8GB.\n\n\nThis is rarely a very good EA Game, you don't get that often.","February 10","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I think it's worth a good 15$. I give it a 7/10, the campaign is the strongpoint of this game. Let me explain,\n\nThe campaign is outstanding. It's definately a step up from the last game, the opening of the story was just perfect. There are a few flaws in the campaign, such as once you're in a vehicle you're almost invincible. You are also very overpowered, and unless there are a lot of soldier or aliens fighting you, you're most likely going to go trhough the fight unscathed. The graphics are very good. One problem I have with this game, is there are only a few choices for weapons, and the starter weapons are some of the best. The maps are pretty small, and the invisible walls will get on your nerves. I give the campaign a 8.3/10\nThe multiplayer isn't that great. The weapons are very unbalanced, and it taked about 2 hits with the auto shotgun from medium distance to kill you. Also once you've played about 2 round, stealth (invisibility) is useless because you can still see them. The community is pretty bad, most are hardcore gamers who play this game all of the time, and the maps are very small. Sniper are always an instakill and sniping is also very hard. I give the multiplayer a 5.7/10\nIf it wasn't for the campaign, this game would have been a disapointment.","December 7, 2013","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I know the tech is older, but guess what, C1 and WH are better than C2 in some ways.\nNow, while C2 starts out pretty awesome, because were I ever dying, that would be the only cool way to be saved, and it continues to build into the story and unknown environment with some nice suspense, as you proceed you will start to be dragged around a bit. This means you start by working your way into yourself, building prowess and skills, and get to making some friends. But then, your new pals start to tell you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, etc. Which is fine for a bit, "Sure I'll help you out, grab that latte, make a copy of that document...", but drags on in such a manor for a length of time that starts to get agggrevating. Am I not practically a superhuman? Can I not kick a car into your face from 20 yards? If you give the marine grunt spec-ops mentality a leeway, you can at least cover your lack of independence there. No worries though. Towards the end, you will still be told some things you need to do, but you will have more of a freelance, superhero feel gathered with your actions. And the only issue is the realization that someone has been able to know the dirty things you were thinking about that CIA vixen.\n\n*Notes:\nThe custom 1912x1076 resolution some players needed for C1 and WH does not seem to be necessary for C2.\nIf you have experience with C1 and WH, you likely had performance issues. This is the old poorly optimised engines. Crysis 2, even though a heavier engine, with better graphics, ran much better on my system. Which is exactly the same as it was when I completed C1 and WH.*\n\nPros.\nNice environments/Better graphics than C1 and WH\nGreat audio/Soundtrack\nLots of pointless collectibles\nExcept for a point at the beginning in the city, ran much better than C1 and some better than WH\nMore viable/easy to work with Nanosuit, let's hope they didn't fubar NS 3.0 eh?\nDecent arsenal and modifications/easier to work with and access\nDecent storyline\nCompletely different alien enemies\n\nCons.\nMore linear gameplay than C1 and WH\nSome suit upgrades are pointless, others ar used for less than 1 minute\nWeapons dont seem quite as moddable as in C1 and WH\nPretty much no vehicle utility or availablility, a staple for C1 and WH\nMuch of the game you play a mindless drone, I mean a marine....\nLots of pointless collectibles\nNew suit setup requires more attention so you don't get ROFLStomped\nAt first the human enemies make sense, but as time passes, you begin to wonder why they are such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to you, and you never really find out why. So you are required to assume its Epeen envy\nLess fun and challenging aliens, literally a pushover, if you get my meaning....\n\nOverall.\nA graphically enhanced, tighter gameplay, non-story-bridging game that provided me 21 hours of what I feel is time decently spent. After all, what else is there to do when you have the flu.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAMD Phenom II X6 1100T 3.3Ghz\n20GB DDR3 1333\nAMD 990FX Chipset\n128GB SSD SATA III\n1TB 7200RPM, 32MB, SATA II\n16MB/s Cable/N600 Dual-Band Wifi\nXFX 4GB Radeon R9 290\nVizio 60" 1080P 240Hz 3D LED\nVizio 47" 1080P 120Hz\nWindows 7 Pro 64bit","February 22, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is the sequel to CRYSIS aka CRYSIS 1.\n\nSet during the Great Depression of 2023, CRYSIS 2 MAXIMUM EDITION focuses on Prophet, a nanosuit-wearing mute soldier from a poor family of tenant farmers driven from their Oklahoma home by drought, economic hardship, agricultural industry changes, and bank foreclosures forcing tenant farmers out of work. Due to his nearly hopeless situation, and in part because he was trapped in the alien invasion apocalypse, Prophet sets out for New York. Along with thousands of other generic gun-fodder soldiers, he sought jobs, land, dignity, big guns that can murder ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and a future.\n\nCRYSIS 2 MAXIMUM EDITION is infrequently played in American high school and college literature classes due to its lack of historical context and nonexistent legacy, plus the fact it is a video game, not a book. A sequel, CRYSIS 3 MAXIMUMEST EDITION was released in 2013 to general lack of interest, but it's only on Origin, and who would want to use Origin? Nobody, that's who.\n\nAnyway, CRYSIS 2 MAXIMUM EDITION is not very good.","April 24, 2014","false","3.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

Or picks off a squad one-by-one, unseen, as the shrinking pool of survivors panic.\n\nIt's not so hot when it's trying to be Call of Duty, sheparding you from cutscene to cutscene with a bunch of squaddies you care nothing about hovering around. Forget the plot. It's utter dreck, and perhaps telling that by the latter part of the game I'd actually forgotten which of the two names the protagonist gets called was his real one.\n\nBut most of the time, you are in a survey/ambush/evade/reposition loop, and that is fun times. And this appears to be the only Crysis title without third-party DRM in singleplayer (multiplayer still needs an online account and is probably long dead anyway). Get it in a sale, learn to filter out the word "nano", and stab some invaders in their fleshy squidparts.","August 14, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I know the tech is older, but guess what, C1 and WH are better than C2 in some ways.\nNow, while C2 starts out pretty awesome, because were I ever dying, that would be the only cool way to be saved, and it continues to build into the story and unknown environment with some nice suspense, as you proceed you will start to be dragged around a bit. This means you start by working your way into yourself, building prowess and skills, and get to making some friends. But then, your new pals start to tell you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, etc. Which is fine for a bit, "Sure I'll help you out, grab that latte, make a copy of that document...", but drags on in such a manor for a length of time that starts to get agggrevating. Am I not practically a superhuman? Can I not kick a car into your face from 20 yards? If you give the marine grunt spec-ops mentality a leeway, you can at least cover your lack of independence there. No worries though. Towards the end, you will still be told some things you need to do, but you will have more of a freelance, superhero feel gathered with your actions. And the only issue is the realization that someone has been able to know the dirty things you were thinking about that CIA vixen.\n\n*Notes:\nThe custom 1912x1076 resolution some players needed for C1 and WH does not seem to be necessary for C2.\nIf you have experience with C1 and WH, you likely had performance issues.

However, fans of the two previous installments probably be disappointed when they see how much the saga has been reduced, technologically speaking.\n\nMy Score: 8/10\nNote: Played it on Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate - 64 bits","July 23, 2015","true","43.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a very average shooter. Yes, you have a nanosuit, but it doesn't give you many advantages in the fight against enemies. You can become invisible or more resistant and use a thermal vision and that's all. But all of these mods work for limited time only, so if the time expires then you gonna fight like in every each shooter. The story is very stupid and the main hero - you, is even worse. He doesn't even speak, so you can't identify with him. The plot is simply about that - you are the only one, who can save the world before the invasion of aliens, blah blah blah. Only good thing is the graphic whicht is very solid for the year 2011.","June 29, 2014","false","11.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

So don't buy this expecting a multiplayer, and knowing EA they probably won't do anything to resolve it any time soon.\n\nAt the Full price of $30 usd at the moment I don't feel it's worth it. If you find it at half price or less I'd say it's worth picking up.\n\nSingle Player:\nThe story is well developed and sticks to the storyline of the crysis and warhead and evolves it quite well, which is apreciated these days. The customizable nanosuit was a nice addition in making the game fit your playing style a bit better. On another note the story is very linear, basically there's not really much replay value. It's also a pretty short campaign which sadly I've come to expect anymore.\n\nGraphically:\nCrysis 2 does feel a little watered down compared to it's predecessor, probably due to trying to break into the console market at the time. Don't get me wrong it is a gorgeous game texture and lighting effect wise, it just feels like all of the small deails built into crysis and crysis warhead were lost with this release.","April 3, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I wasn't able to play it though becauise all I had was a crappy Inspiron laptop. But now that I have a computer that can run it at max settings (Or in this case going from not at all to being able to at all) this game is absolutely beautiful. THe gameplay is great, the graphics are beautiful so much that it even puts most games from this year (2015) to shame. The story is great too, at the beginning it's confused and you're thinking "Wait is it aliens, DNA, or a virus?" but as you progress through the story you figure it out, and the end really throws you for a loop too. BOY did that ending throw me for a loop. It's just a shame that the multiplayer was long gone by the time I got to this gem (Gamespy we miss you! #NeverForget). The controls have a mildly weird layout but you get used to it fairly quickly, and it becomes second nature. Gun and powerup customization, great scenes, smooth gameplay, and more all make this game an instant classic, and a gem of a game. 10"10 There is no way in hell I'm going more than 3 months without getting Crysis 3.","August 8, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

You're forced to learn little tricks and make certain tradeoffs, you're made to choose precisely from which angle you want to initiate an attack.  It's really very well done, and much more refined than the original Crysis, which I believe to be overhyped on account of its eye candy.\n\nThere are certainly cons though, so I'll list everything out here in bullets:\n\nPROS\n----------\nBeautiful graphics (if a little “smoky” at times)\nAdjustable FOV (thank god for that cause it's awful)\nReally smart, approachable, tactical gameplay (love)\nOptimised suit controls over the first game\nReally optimised performance-wise over the first game\nSmarter weapon customisation system\nSuit upgrade system adds much-needed depth\nNewGame+  (more or less)\n\nCONS\n---------\n*Really* generic, boring, military characters\n*Really* generic, boring, military dialogue\n*Really* generic, boring, military soundtrack\n*Really* generic, boring, military cutscenes\nLots of weapons but still only two at a time (hate)\n16 suit upgrades but only 4 at a time (haaate)\nNo useful unlocks of any kind from any difficulty completion\n\nCONCLUSION\n-----------------\nIf you're into standard military shooters, you'll find something extra here, and doubtless have a good time.\nIf not, you'll have to take time to understand the game's mechanics fully before you can really appreciate it, and have to sit through a *lot* of dumb, tough-guy talk, but it's still very possible to have a great time if you focus on the fantastic stealth gameplay.\n\nCrysis 1 - 8/10\nCrysis 2 - 8/10\nCrysis 3 - 7/10","September 3, 2015","true","56.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

More like maximum bugged port.\n\nI don't know what happened during development of this game. My best guess is they wanted to focus on a console market, and that's what all PC gamers got: A terrible port which has been downgraded in all departments compared to the first game. This is how Crytek wants to deal with high amount of piracy from their first Crysis: "You're interested in our IP? Have a bag of ♥♥♥♥ with Crysis 2 tagged onto it, since you're just going to pirate it anyway."\n\nI feel like the PC audience has been alienated here.\n\nThere's just so many things that went wrong with developing this game. The game doesn't even want me to beat it cause like I wrote in my first paragraph, you will encounter both in-game bugs and technical bugs that  can result in crash to desktop. This edition of the game somehow manages to have more bugs than the leaked beta test. It controls like the first Crysis, however, your nano suit has been casualized only to carry OP mode, stealth, binoculars which are only used as a waypoint system to find ammo, and nightvision, which is only viable to use in like freaking 3 parts of the whole game. Gotta have something to support that console controller! The checkpoint system WILL drive you nuts. It rarely logs down your progress on your map and just seem to live breathe its own life. If you get a CTD during a map, enjoy being thrown all the way back to the beginning of the map.\n\nAvoid this, even if you liked the first game. It's not a PC game, it's a quick money grab to make up for all the cash they didn't earn with their first game. I hope you got this through the cheap EA bundle like me.

Unforgetable experience. The champain was amazing. It blew my mind. I liked the armor upgrades and the customizable weapons in it too. The fact that i found no glitches was amazing as well. All was running smooth even on my laptop wich isnt that good. If youre looking for a game with a mind blowing singleplayer this is the game for you! I rate the singleplayer a pure 10/10!\n\nThe multiplayer wasn't the best. It has a minor setback than the first crysis (i didnt play it but saw some videos of it) first of all maps. Alot smaller. Second the multiplayer got way too fast paced. I like fast pace. And a big fan of slow pace. But this was a little too fast for me now this is personal opinion some might love it like this. But the fact is that multiplayer runs 20 frames per second while singleplayer runs 60. Now i do like the xp system and the dog tags and all. And the pure multiplayer mechanics so i give the multiplayer a 7.5/10\n\nMy conclusion is that this game is definetly worth it for the singleplayer and if you like fast pace the multiplayer as well. This game must be the best game i played in the past couple of months. So go ahead and buy it!","December 30, 2013","true","17.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Frankly, the buildings of NYC in this game look like they've been transplanted from a rushed-out-the-door licensed Spiderman game from the mid-00s, and how am I supposed to feel like a badass when the - let's admit it - utterly cheesball design of my character is the best looking part of a game that was spawned from a ground breakingly, heart achingly beautiful game?\n\nIt goes beyond the graphical achievements of the game, though. I understand that all of this downscaling was done as a result of the move to consoles, and I understand that by now I'm looking at a game that was scaled for the xbox 360 - there's no way it'll look anything like Metro 2033 Redux, for example - but I just cannot deny that the game is just less fun than the original was. In this game you basically move down linear coridoors - albiet city-street-sized coridoors - with the megerest of alternate routes threaded around them, whereas in the original (If you haven't guessed it now then I am indeed saying that Crysis should be bought immediately without delay if you haven't played it yet, certainly in preference to this game) one had what truly felt like a wide open island environment to cloak, drive, or blast your way around.\n\nOkay, so the game is uglier and more constricted than the game it was supposed to be a sequel to. So why have I recommended that you get it? Because it's a good shooter on it's own, and when sales time comes around it is going to be worth picking up. Put it on your wishlist and bide your time, you will get a good looking, tight shooter with tactical combat and a lot of fun additional gameplay tweaks, with a bit more character building (not story development, character building) than the original thrown in. Get it. If it's on sale.\n\nIf you haven't played Crysis, do so immediately.","February 12","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/108800/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","I remember years 2010 and 2011, when I finally changed my hardware from P4 to something with more cores... I've played ALOT of FPS shooters then, collecting all I previously was not able to run properly. And it comes that way, that I've played the first Crysis game just before I've started the second volume.\n\nThe difference was staggering. Mind-blowing. And disastrous.\n\nI've tried to give it the second chance lately, but alas, all that was new and good in 2011, now looks so plain and common, no juice left in that volume. Get me right: I've finished it, all the way through, on the highest difficulty. I just don't like the way I was treated all time through.\n\nLet's speak of good things: for one, Crysis 2 has a better temper for hardware. The first Crysis caused me several BSOD during the last boss fight, but there everything was running smooth. Well, not exactly smooth, really. I'd rather use the word "Kosher", even not being a Judah's descendent myself.\nI mean, everything people usually expecting from AAA shooter (like the line of CoD): variety of guns, facinating visuals, a lot of bad guys and recovering chest-high walls - all was set alright, and even more. The sound, for example, was a bull's eye shot. Hans Zimmer made a very great job, vocalizing the once-a-great-city-rumbles-into-the-abyss.\n\nAlso, to compare with the Infinity Ward products, there was much more freedom of movement and choices on the way. Quite often, there was not need to shoot at all! And new features of the trademark Nanosuit were great, without any doubts.\n\nBut there we go again to comparison with the first Crysis... and there all goes sour. Some new tricks of biosuit totally Not Worth the absence of freedom of the first game. Crysis 2 is so loosing the scales view, that it should really get another name. Totally different feeling, to the point of disgust for the "inheritor", which is not fit in dad's shoes.\n\nAnd I'm not yet started with the scenario! I really felt Cevat Yerli heed too much the Breaking Bad serial. All of the scenario moves and twists leaving you with the hard uneasyness. You know, that moment in your life, where you staring at the blank wall and ask yourself "Why? oh, Why?!" I'll reveal major spoiler there: nothing is settled in the end. Nausea won't leave you after finishing the game. So it is probably the better not to start it at all.\n\nSo, let me set all said more clear:\n\n1) The game is fine to the standards of AAA FPS - and even more, it sets some new patterns, which will be later used by many other developers. Technically all is fine, except it is a multiplatformer, so there you'll not see the real edge of technology. Just a decent picture.\n\n2) The sights of destroyed New York... well, some people can't get enough of that, but I'm not the one of them.\n\n3) The most notable feature of the whole game - overpowered nanosuit, is really a nice thing to use, making yourself a superbeing. Nothing comes without price, though.\n\n4) The personality of the main character is so bleak, that nanosuit absorbs it totally. It is rancid thing. Well, the same rancid stuff goes with all scenario game pushes you through. If you care about such things, it will be an unpleasant experience.\n\n5) Stealth feature in that game is far from I'd like to play for honing skill. Total imbalance of one-button-overall-invisibility. Nothing can see you, hear you, react to your doings while you're in "stealth" mode, which is better called "God mode". Good thing it wears off quickly, but still, total imbalance.\n\n6) Shooting part is common. The "insurgents", I like that term there, operating quite typically: they can see and shoot you from the places where you not see them yet, they aim for the head alright, yet you mow them again and again, thanks to chest-high walls, quick regeneration, and other power armor tweaks. Overall, from the point of AI behavior and gunplay, not satysfying enough.\n\nWith all said, I set my mark as 6.95/10. There are good points in that game, even in the scenario, but they are not worth the price, in thorough look. It is a product to grab cash, after all, and not a visionary stuff, like Bioshock. If you've not bought it already, don't bother. And about "Maximum Edition"... multiplayer is dead, forget about it. Even when it worked, CoD was better there, and now we have much more variety of good multiplayer shooters, than in 2011-2012.

Game developers assume everyone plays for the blood and gore and not for anything else.\n\nI play for the story and the idea, that stuff they make all the cut scenes for, and I know I am not alone, but people know you can't get a game company to do anything but what's cheapest for them to do.  Stories require more work, more expense and are seen to be less profitable -- a short term view.  But, alas, I digress, for why should any gaming company be different than any other, right?  They should all be the same, have the same policy toward players, swap out PR people from one company to another, all use the same group of elitist beta and alpha testers, and, usually end up with them running the very forums they direct us to for support (Kinda explains why so many games are so identical in so many ways, and boring right?).  Yeah, game after game putting down "corporate interests" and "greed" done by company after company.... or more accurately "corporation after corporation," whose entire interest IS greed.  Game companies are one of, if not generally, the highest profit margin available, 20% or more due to most of what they're selling being automated integrations, and those figures have only gone up since the company doesn't have to even produce a box, disc, or pay for shipping to some box store and is now a downloaded, entirely electronic product.\n\nSo, yeah, recruit mode in Crysis 2 is too difficult for me.  I want to see the game world, to enjoy, and not be frustrated by, getting there.  I find little enjoyment in not being able to save the game when I want to save it, instead of relying on checkpoints that assure when I die to have to go through again what I was already sweating to go through the first time with 3 meleeing aliens on me at once, only to die to another one later due to their extended melee range compared to mine (to keep that blood and gore challenge assumption thing going).\n\nSo I dedicate this review to all the silent gamers who spend money on games they uninstall a couple days later (as I am going to do with Crysis 2) and have resigned themselves to not being able to change the gaming industry and its assumptions about players that defines "fun" as one type of game play to the exclusion of all others.\n\nThe solution for me with Crysis 2 is to be able to have a slider to adjust the aliens, both in hp and damage. from 150, or even 200% down to 20%, that are available to me through the options menu and irrespective of each category of player level I picked from recruit to veteran (sure I can set it at the beginning of the campaign and these are locked values for everything above recruit).  This way I can play the game with the level of challenge that keeps it fun for me, the player, the person who paid for the game, the person the game is supposed to be designed for, instead of resenting every penny I spent on this due to the frustration of trying to reach the next area and failling over and over.  If this happened by my own error, that's fine, but instead it's by a legitimized form of bullying, where game designers cater to that aspect of the game and its players but no other.\n\nAs I am sure Crysis 2, nor any iteration above it, will ever have what I've suggested so we who want to pay to buy a story (like buying a book) can enjoy the game, I urge anyone else who loves the graphics, loves the stories of games, and wants to give those who went to the trouble to design them, to code them, to produce them, their due, not to buy Crysis 2.\n\nI'm hoping to get Crysis 1 working and that maybe its balance is different, however, I can see that in Crysis 2 I won't be getting passed the part where I have to escort the Marines.  Too many enemy aliens that take 5 shots each to take down (and often more than one head shot with a sniper rifle).  Too much shaking ground when using a sniper rifle.  Too much "they know when you put the crosshairs on em" when my suit doesn't have that innate feature and the aliens didn't have to kill me to earn being able to do that.  Though it is good to see that if I kill a boatload of them, and get to their bodies while fresh kills, I can enable that feature on my suit.  Yet my suit with its entirely inferior armor barely gets me through the first volley of 3 meleeing aliens.  Again, I am playing for the story, not harassment and to become intimately familiar with what it is like to be the scrawny new guy in the prison shower who dropped the soap.\n\nI've played computer games a long time (since the first mainfame text based Star Trek game that was coded in Fortran on punch cards), and have since picked games for the story not the elitism of epeenhood that appears to be the only thing game developers care about today (and mostly because it's cheap).\n\nTo be sure Crysis 2 has great graphics, human AI could be better, story isn't too bad as far along as I am in it, but I'll never get to know the rest of the story due to being unable to go any further in the game.","July 8, 2014","false","15.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

At first when you have no upgrades and such, it's more of a cover-based shooter. However, as the game moves on, mele combat becomes more of the way forward. A few missions later when you have more upgrades, you become more of a tank, and can just mow over a lot of the people (of course they are kind enough to give you a gigantic boss at that point). Moving to the end it turns in to a more stealth shooter. All of this keeps you interested, and it's really enjoyable all the way through.

Graphics, sounds, action, and story are superb. I wish there was a little less action in places. It does get rather intense with full on action all the time. Not really a fully fledged grumble though coz I took breaks, and if you want to press on it's OK.\n\nThere isn't much I can say that reviews haven't covered about the game, like it's in the city. I can add that it doesn't suffer for not being set in a lush tropical paradise. The graphics are handled superbly. I pondered about lots looking around and taking in scenery, often crouching to look at even the ground. I loved all the different coloured rocks and pebbles they put in streams, that exist in real life. It's still a real vacation experience.\n\nI have seen the odd complaint that it's possible to get through with little combat, and using stealth. Really though, why buy a shooter if you not going to fire your guns. The shooting action is epic too. You can go toe to toe with one standard enemy ground troop as you have better armour and better firepower.\n\nI read criticism of the new nano-suit, and I think this is unfounded. It's much smoother to access. Maximum armour actually does something. With upgrades you add on during the game, it gets better.\n\nAll in all, a blockbuster from start to finish. Just maybe it could do with a little rest of easier gameplay once in a while.","August 5, 2014","true","42.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While I'm not all that heavily invested in the franchise I still somewhow find myself buying and playing the games and continuing to do so despite coming away from each one with an overwhelming "meh" experience.\n\nCrysis 2 is a lot of fun, I'll give it that, but its story-line and universe is one that feels more tired and generic rather than unique. Much like the Call of Duty series post-Modern Warfare, "epic" setpieces and scripted events just can't breathe any kind of actual life into the game or its story and so at the end of the day Crysis 2 is simply a great looking alien-killing frag-fest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060979916/recommended/108800/","76561198060979916","Senoinya Aumeriyal'e","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060979916/","209 products in account","Let me start off by saying this is an epic first person shooter game, possibly one of the best I ever played.\n\nWeapons are very well balanced and each have their own uses depending on your style. It also, like the original, has a great variety in the ways you can fight, either by stealth with cloak or by tanking through enemies with armor mode, the campaign is also a decent length, so you won't be beating it inside a couple of hours, though I could hardly see spending a total of 24 hours trying to beat the campaign. Regardless, the game excells in both gameplay and visuals, so even if you're one of those people who absolutely has to have that detail, this has it.\n\nNow for the question, "does this game continue directly off of the first?". No, it does not, at least not at first. Near the end the events that occurred between 1 and 2 are explained pretty well, so while you'll be left in the dark at first, you will get much more information later in the game. Which may feel like a drawback to some players, but I saw little issue with it, it did, if nothing else, make it feel more interesting to find out what happened.\n\nAs for the story. While the game has a pretty thought-out story, it doesn't really have the kind of story that makes you wish it were a movie or novel out in the store for you to read or watch, nor does it really pull you in too much, it's interesting, and definitely action-packed, but if the game's strongest point were it's story, this game would very easily be near the bottom of the charts.\n\nFor graphics. The visuals of the game are incredibly well done, you'll definitely need some good hardware to run this, but nonetheless it's quite nice looking. Maybe not to the level of games such as Bioshock Infinite, or the latest addition to the series, Crysis 3, but thats understandable as both of those games are newer, while this is a couple of years old.\n\nNow, back to the weapons, throughout the game you will find an Assault Rifle, Pistol, Submachine Gun, Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, and multiple other, more powerful weapons that I won't spoil for anyone reading my little review/recommendation. None of them overpowers the other, unlike the original where the assault rifle was vastly more powerful and useful than any of the other guns.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, this game has an incredibly fun multiplayer that is definitely worth playing. Sadly, and surprisingly in my opinion, there are very few players online, so finding a room will be tough, finding a room that doesn't have latency is also difficult. Not worth buying if you're only in it for the multiplayer, but only due to a lack of players.\n\nNow, finally, a last question; "is the game better than the original?". Yes, this game, in my opinion, is by FAR superior to the original, despite the lack of being able to roam through a massive island, everything else is vastly improved upon, with many new things to enjoy.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 9/10, on gameplay, a 10/10, on story, a 6/10, on multiplayer, a 3/10, on graphics, a 9/10, and finally, on entertainment and replay value, definitely a 10/10.","April 21, 2013","true","19.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

FPS is still smooth running in window mode.\nAlso the game just crashed on me. I'm done with this kind of PC gaming. Hopefully my next game will be a Zelda on a Wii.

Crytek went to the pretty store, bought everything in it, sprinkled extra pretty on top, then put it on sale. The best word in the arsenal of the english language to discribe the graphics is\n\nstunning.\n\nEven with my admitedly aging PC rig, I managed to have a very consistent, and enjoyable single player experience at 1080p resolution.  If I had a kidney to spare, I'd sell it for a PC that can run this game in all of its visual splendor, yet with my also admitedly meager funds and some careful configuring, found the PC version more satisfying than the xbox 360's.\nThe story and the in-game dialogue are a vast improvement over the first one, and the game itself sticks to tried and true FPS gameplay mechanics, without becoming tiresome. I was thoughly entertained from start to finish, and for the price of admission, hard to beat.\n\nI reccomend this game with a 3/5,and 3.5/5 on sale.","December 30, 2013","true","39.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Any game, particularly on PC should allow you to save at any moment in your progress. Crysis 2, however, takes you back to your last check point. This increasing trend is extremely frustrating at times, and in Crysis 2 - where you can spend a significant amount of time getting past enemies - it is even moreso. Perhaps when I'm done clearing my massive backlog, I'll come back to it. But at this point in my life I'm more interested in quality time and a good story, than a game that intends on penalizing me with time loss thanks to the lack of a simple save function.\n\nThe story, is however, solid, and the graphics are beautiful. I'm somewhat disappointed by the lack of open world features, at least in comparison to the first Crysis, but it's understandable. Before it came out, I pictured being able to go into any building, or at least most buildings around you and exploring every location I could get into. That was a little unrealistic, I'll admit. Particularly when it was also a game designed with consoles in mind.\n\nI recommend it, if you're looking for a good time waster.","January 1, 2014","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a lot of work put into this new story, videos before every mission, information about characters and enemies, in-game cutscenes etc., most of the work is of good quality and there are some surprises throught the story, but not many. I liked how the aliens have been changed but at the same time I would have prefered to see a mix of old aliens and new ones, so that there's a logic why they changed aspect (they upgraded some of their units, etc.) otherwise you'll have the impression that there aren't the same as those from Crysis I, even though the story tries to tell you that they are. There are many captivating moments throught the story and I like the fact that it isn't too predictable, meaning that you won't know what will happen exactly. The end leaves room for many sequels to come, so be ready to continue buying Crysis.\n\nGraphics: 10 out of 10\nCrysis 2 continues it's legacy of excellent graphics that it started in 2007, improving on every aspect. The lights, weapon effects, character design, environments are all top notch, the only thing I'm dissapointed is the fact that they removed vehicule interiors, which were not only great in the first Crysis but gave more realism to the game. There are some bad graphics on certain objects, but you'll ignore them easily  when you evaluate the whole game. Crysis 2 graphics still manage to impress me and I'm playing this game in 2015, so that's why I gave it the maximum score.\n\nGameplay: 8 out of 10\nGameplay is great, many features added (ledge grab, power kick, combined nano powers etc.) but other were removed (vehicule interiors - which would have been great on the streets of New York, no flight vehicules, no boats, no tanks, no freezing effect etc.). Some removed features, I can understand, others not, since they would have made the gameplay better. Also, I've mentioned earlier the bug with some spawn locations, which can remove some realism from the game.  The good thing is that some of the features added work very well, in the ruined New York environment. Many players complained for the fact that the game became too linear, you don't have the freedom to roam around on huge map like in Crysis 1, but I understand the producers for making the game more linear, since many of the cool effects (buildings, bridges falling etc.) wouldn't have been possible on a  free-roam map, also the level of details wouldn't have been the same. Overall the gameplay is quite cool when combined with the great story.\n\nAudio: 10 out of 10\nThe music in Crysis 2 is just awesome, especially the music in the menu, the other sound effects are also of high quality. How can I give it less than 10 when sometimes I was starting the game just to listen the music, I wasn't even playing.\n\nAI Behavior: 8.5 out of 10\nThe AI is quite good, not awesome, but it handles itself pretty well. I've played the game on the max difficulty (Post-Human Warrior) and I didn't find the game too hard, the AI shoots very well but if you use corectly the nanosuit powers, you'll manage to finish each mission after just a few tries (you'll need a few, since the enemies are unpredictable).  The Human AI soldiers will try to flank you and use grenades, while the Aliens AI will jump on you, deactivate your suit and even cloak (at end of the game). The bad part is that sometimes the AI acts stupid, for example you kill an enemy AI on cloak right in front of his friends and they don't react at all, like nothing happened. Also sometimes the AI gets stucked behind certain boxes or in certain areas. Over 75 % of my kills were stealth kills (mostly with the knife), actually if you play on the max difficulty, most of your kills will be stealth also, since the enemy can kill you easily even with armor mode on. Still even after those bugs, the AI is quite good and dynamic, for which it deserves a good score.\n\nMultiplayer: not tested\nI've played this game during a month that I had no internet at all, so I couldn't actually test anything that involved multiplayer. But I've red that the suits powers are diminished considerably, in order to be able to kill other players faster, and not wander around in a stalemate. I'm not a multiplayer gamer, so I mostly prefer single-player campaigns, but I think that Crysis 2 would have deserved at least an 8 or a 9 for the multiplayer (mostly because of many removed features).\n\nOverall: 9.2 out 10\nThe new Crysis 2, really improves on everything that the last one did except gameplay. I didn't gave the maximum score because I didn't liked the fact that they removed a lot of cool stuff from the previous Crysis, like a lot of vehicules and boats and other things. But even after this Crysis 2 definitely is worth the money, the story is very well done for a shooter, you'll spend many hours of good gameplay, the environments are awesome, the aliens are great, the audio is cool, what more can I say. I bought the game on a sale for less than 4 EUR, but if you don't want to wait for a sale, go and buy it right away cause it deserves full price.\n\nPS:\nEnemies in Crysis do have the same amount of health and deal the same amount of damage regardless of difficulty. Difficulty only affects their A.I.; i.e. reaction time, awareness, accuracy, and duration of burst fire.\nOn the highest difficulty setting(Post-Human Warrior there's no split-second invincibility after you're hit, allowing you to be damaged by each consecutive bullet in a spray of automatic fire. As a result, you die a LOT faster against automatic fire when not in Armor Mode. In Armor Mode, however, your durability seems pretty much the same. Source: gamefaqs.com/Crysis 2 Weapons-Enemies Guide\n\nImportant: After finishing the game I only got 12 out 13 weapons attachments, which gave me a 99.76 % completion. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get 100 % completion and started to look online for tips. I found out that you actually cannot get the 13 weapons attachments because of a bug (they decided that ironsights isn't an attachment, but then they forget to update the list to contain 12 not 13) that the producers forgot to remove, so at least try to get at least 12 if you want to have the game completed 100 %.\n\n\nObs: The only thing I dislike about the new Crysis 2 is the enemy predefined spawn locations, which are really annoying at first and predictable after that. Example: I have to destroy a fuel supply, after the fuel supply explodes, enemies start to spawn in predefined locations (some spawns are good, those when the enemy comes from outside the map, others are just awfull, like when the enemy spawn right in front of you, this removes some part of realism from the game). By the way, the AI is great, not very smart but dynamic, which makes every encounter different.\n","February 27, 2015","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a lot of work put into this new story, videos before every mission, information about characters and enemies, in-game cutscenes etc., most of the work is of good quality and there are some surprises throught the story, but not many. I liked how the aliens have been changed but at the same time I would have prefered to see a mix of old aliens and new ones, so that there's a logic why they changed aspect (they upgraded some of their units, etc.) otherwise you'll have the impression that there aren't the same as those from Crysis I, even though the story tries to tell you that they are. There are many captivating moments throught the story and I like the fact that it isn't too predictable, meaning that you won't know what will happen exactly. The end leaves room for many sequels to come, so be ready to continue buying Crysis.\n\nGraphics: 10 out of 10\nCrysis 2 continues it's legacy of excellent graphics that it started in 2007, improving on every aspect. The lights, weapon effects, character design, environments are all top notch, the only thing I'm dissapointed is the fact that they removed vehicule interiors, which were not only great in the first Crysis but gave more realism to the game. There are some bad graphics on certain objects, but you'll ignore them easily  when you evaluate the whole game. Crysis 2 graphics still manage to impress me and I'm playing this game in 2015, so that's why I gave it the maximum score.\n\nGameplay: 8 out of 10\nGameplay is great, many features added (ledge grab, power kick, combined nano powers etc.) but other were removed (vehicule interiors - which would have been great on the streets of New York, no flight vehicules, no boats, no tanks, no freezing effect etc.). Some removed features, I can understand, others not, since they would have made the gameplay better. Also, I've mentioned earlier the bug with some spawn locations, which can remove some realism from the game.  The good thing is that some of the features added work very well, in the ruined New York environment. Many players complained for the fact that the game became too linear, you don't have the freedom to roam around on huge map like in Crysis 1, but I understand the producers for making the game more linear, since many of the cool effects (buildings, bridges falling etc.) wouldn't have been possible on a  free-roam map, also the level of details wouldn't have been the same. Overall the gameplay is quite cool when combined with the great story.\n\nAudio: 10 out of 10\nThe music in Crysis 2 is just awesome, especially the music in the menu, the other sound effects are also of high quality. How can I give it less than 10 when sometimes I was starting the game just to listen the music, I wasn't even playing.\n\nAI Behavior: 8.5 out of 10\nThe AI is quite good, not awesome, but it handles itself pretty well. I've played the game on the max difficulty (Post-Human Warrior) and I didn't find the game too hard, the AI shoots very well but if you use corectly the nanosuit powers, you'll manage to finish each mission after just a few tries (you'll need a few, since the enemies are unpredictable).  The Human AI soldiers will try to flank you and use grenades, while the Aliens AI will jump on you, deactivate your suit and even cloak (at end of the game). The bad part is that sometimes the AI acts stupid, for example you kill an enemy AI on cloak right in front of his friends and they don't react at all, like nothing happened. Also sometimes the AI gets stucked behind certain boxes or in certain areas. Over 75 % of my kills were stealth kills (mostly with the knife), actually if you play on the max difficulty, most of your kills will be stealth also, since the enemy can kill you easily even with armor mode on. Still even after those bugs, the AI is quite good and dynamic, for which it deserves a good score.\n\nMultiplayer: not tested\nI've played this game during a month that I had no internet at all, so I couldn't actually test anything that involved multiplayer. But I've red that the suits powers are diminished considerably, in order to be able to kill other players faster, and not wander around in a stalemate. I'm not a multiplayer gamer, so I mostly prefer single-player campaigns, but I think that Crysis 2 would have deserved at least an 8 or a 9 for the multiplayer (mostly because of many removed features).\n\nOverall: 9.2 out 10\nThe new Crysis 2, really improves on everything that the last one did except gameplay. I didn't gave the maximum score because I didn't liked the fact that they removed a lot of cool stuff from the previous Crysis, like a lot of vehicules and boats and other things. But even after this Crysis 2 definitely is worth the money, the story is very well done for a shooter, you'll spend many hours of good gameplay, the environments are awesome, the aliens are great, the audio is cool, what more can I say. I bought the game on a sale for less than 4 EUR, but if you don't want to wait for a sale, go and buy it right away cause it deserves full price.\n\nPS:\nEnemies in Crysis do have the same amount of health and deal the same amount of damage regardless of difficulty. Difficulty only affects their A.I.; i.e. reaction time, awareness, accuracy, and duration of burst fire.\nOn the highest difficulty setting(Post-Human Warrior there's no split-second invincibility after you're hit, allowing you to be damaged by each consecutive bullet in a spray of automatic fire. As a result, you die a LOT faster against automatic fire when not in Armor Mode. In Armor Mode, however, your durability seems pretty much the same. Source: gamefaqs.com/Crysis 2 Weapons-Enemies Guide\n\nImportant: After finishing the game I only got 12 out 13 weapons attachments, which gave me a 99.76 % completion. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get 100 % completion and started to look online for tips. I found out that you actually cannot get the 13 weapons attachments because of a bug (they decided that ironsights isn't an attachment, but then they forget to update the list to contain 12 not 13) that the producers forgot to remove, so at least try to get at least 12 if you want to have the game completed 100 %.\n\n\nObs: The only thing I dislike about the new Crysis 2 is the enemy predefined spawn locations, which are really annoying at first and predictable after that. Example: I have to destroy a fuel supply, after the fuel supply explodes, enemies start to spawn in predefined locations (some spawns are good, those when the enemy comes from outside the map, others are just awfull, like when the enemy spawn right in front of you, this removes some part of realism from the game). By the way, the AI is great, not very smart but dynamic, which makes every encounter different.\n","February 27, 2015","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But still the plot compels  the player to stick to the game and hear out the different chatters between the NPCs. The link up with the 1st installment of this series is very smooth and "now it all make sense". Still I would have loved to have at-least a couple of side missions / sub-plots in the game (specially when these days when FPS leverage some of the RPG elements).\n\nGameplay: Very smooth indeed; the keyboard configuration is very nice and also be dragged to the multiplayer games without changing much -  in fact I played the multiplayer with default keyboard and mouse config. The movements are very nice and the transitions between nano suit modes are seamless. You could just put on some strength just before shooting your sniper rifle and then just after the shot switch to cloak without any difficulty. Cut Scenes are very nicely played and well placed\n\nGraphics : well when you are talking about a game that uses Cry Engine 3 "Graphics" is the most spectacular feature that you wish to review. in words - STUNNING!! I have made a few in game snaps that I wish to keep forever. the horizon and the urban landscapes are too good and the NY city is realistically portrayed here. Since I used a bit older GTX 570 to play the game- I had to reduce a bit of the quality in order to get an optimum performance. Still, boy oh boy , you will feel that a new world is coming alive in front of your eyes.\n\nMultiplay - well the MP is really really good (once you get used to the pace and skills) and I earned a few badges there. Unfortunately I had to stop the MP cause it was interfering with my CS 1.6 skills (whatever I have left of it) cause their game mechanics are completely different..\n\nSo in shorter words - I really liked that game - so much, that I played the campaign in 2 different difficulty modes. If you are looking for some FPS with gripping story and stunning graphics with smooth gameplay then be sure that you have this game in your library.\n\nAnd thanks to steam that I got it in much cheaper rate.\n\n- Maximum Game -","May 15, 2014","true","45.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I loved Crysis and Crysis Warhead, but this was like biting into a piece of poop.\n\nCrysis and Crysis Warhead put you into deceptively open environments.  It was linear, but allowed you freedom.  This was done fantastically.  You could run and jump around, and come at tasks from different angles and accomplish them in different ways.  You were changing armor modes and doing fun stuff the entire game.  Sneaking in, sneaking out.  Running in, grabbing a guy, running out, then throwing him off a cliff.  Sneaking in, taking over a machine gun, then switching to armor mode and using the gun.  There was flanking, stealth, open environments, vehicles, etc etc etc.  It was a truely great FPS.\n\nCrysis 2 is Crysis 1 with dumbed down graphics, dumbed down armor (you just use armor mode the entire game), infinite ammunition, no free roam environments, never an enemy 50 yards away, full body hitboxes (no headshots), stupid-as-♥♥♥♥ story line, and was clearly just a money grab.  It's like they took Crysis and said "Hey, how can we make the sequel the same as Call of Duty, but with the hitboxes of an RPG?"\n\nThere are no decisions to be made.  You just trudge forward, blazing your gun the entire time in armor mode.  Enemies spawn like a Gauntlet game.  You kill one, and another identical one just pops out from the same location.  Each area has 5-20 guys that you kill like this.  The enemies aren't human, they're robots.  Because they explain that the aliens are all wearing suits like yours now.  So every fight is blasting into the enemy 50 or so times until it dies and is immediately replaced by its clone.\n\nAlso, the AI got worse.  The enemy never works as a team.  I find it strange that they did this.  Maybe XBOX's processor couldn't handle the old AI?  I don't know.","January 24, 2014","false","13.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

But still the plot compels  the player to stick to the game and hear out the different chatters between the NPCs. The link up with the 1st installment of this series is very smooth and "now it all make sense". Still I would have loved to have at-least a couple of side missions / sub-plots in the game (specially when these days when FPS leverage some of the RPG elements).\n\nGameplay: Very smooth indeed; the keyboard configuration is very nice and also be dragged to the multiplayer games without changing much -  in fact I played the multiplayer with default keyboard and mouse config. The movements are very nice and the transitions between nano suit modes are seamless. You could just put on some strength just before shooting your sniper rifle and then just after the shot switch to cloak without any difficulty. Cut Scenes are very nicely played and well placed\n\nGraphics : well when you are talking about a game that uses Cry Engine 3 "Graphics" is the most spectacular feature that you wish to review. in words - STUNNING!! I have made a few in game snaps that I wish to keep forever. the horizon and the urban landscapes are too good and the NY city is realistically portrayed here. Since I used a bit older GTX 570 to play the game- I had to reduce a bit of the quality in order to get an optimum performance. Still, boy oh boy , you will feel that a new world is coming alive in front of your eyes.\n\nMultiplay - well the MP is really really good (once you get used to the pace and skills) and I earned a few badges there. Unfortunately I had to stop the MP cause it was interfering with my CS 1.6 skills (whatever I have left of it) cause their game mechanics are completely different..\n\nSo in shorter words - I really liked that game - so much, that I played the campaign in 2 different difficulty modes. If you are looking for some FPS with gripping story and stunning graphics with smooth gameplay then be sure that you have this game in your library.\n\nAnd thanks to steam that I got it in much cheaper rate.\n\n- Maximum Game -","May 15, 2014","true","45.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SOOTHINGACTION/recommended/108800/","SOOTHINGACTION","SOOTHING ACTION","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SOOTHINGACTION/","234 products in account","Everything feels like it should be right with this game. You have stealth capabilities, armor, you can quickly change weapon mods on the fly, you can scan your surroundings and look for helpful things. You're a badass black ops nano super soldier dude, and it should be great. But it isn't.\n\nNothing comes together right. I've played a lot of stealth games, and the stealth encounters in this game rarely work out right. People notice you from far away and then all hell breaks loose and all you really have to do is activate your armor, shoot at the bad guys for a few seconds and then hide to recharge your armor. You can go stealth again but it's all going to go back to chaos in the next minute anyway.\n\nAnd that's what the gun fights are like: chaos. It doesn't feel tactical or fun, enemies just seem to spawn out of nowhere, and you mow them down until the game decides to not spawn enemies for a while. Your choice of weapons are limited and there really isn't that big of a difference between them for the most part. You've got shooty rifle, fast shooty rifle, and far away shooty rifle. Also there's a shotgun and maybe a couple handguns. Who cares? They all feel equally unsatisfying to use.\n\nThen there's the tiny frustrations. The game showing an objective on the roof, and so you walk to the stairwell door and you press F to open. It doesn't. OK I'll melee it open. Doesn't budge. Maybe it's locked I'll power kick it because I'm in a ♥♥♥♥ing super suit. Nope, the door's content to just stay closed. Apparently in this game you don't use doors. Doors just really aren't a thing. Turns out I was actually supposed to jump out the window. Which is fitting because that's what I felt like doing anyway.\n\nThen at the very beginning after a ten minute intro you finally get to play. So I'm walking around and I see it let's me activate a laptop, so I do and a recording starts playing. It's a discussion that reveals some backstory, so I go on my way and walk up the steps, but the sound of the recording fades. What? In the first minute of gameplay you're going to tether me to a single room where I can do nothing but listen to a recording that I don't know how long it is? And if I leave, I miss the backstory. Stupid stupid stupid stupid.\n\nAnd then there's was a, not a cutscene because it didn't cut, but a live scene I guess? Where you can walk around while another character is talking? One of those, and during this scene the other character is like "here look on this screen at all this exposition about the story" but I couldn't walk past his couch to look at the screen directly. There was just an arbitrary invisible wall keeping me from going over there. And then the bad guys attack the apartment and my gun pops up like I should be able to use it, and there's a objective telling me to kill the bad guys, but it won't let me shoot out the window at the like five snipers across the way! I'm mashing the fire button but nothing's happening! No, the game doesn't want me to fight there. It wants me to go out into the hallway and fight through the building. Nothing about this is good.\n\nI'm sick and tired of games sticking me in a room where all I can do is listen to a guy who's showing me ♥♥♥♥ on another screen telling me the story. This is the opposite of the one of the fundamentals of storytelling which is "show don't tell."\n\nIf you buy this game, you're in for disappointment, because it looks like it's going to be so fun, but it just fails at every turn. Don't waste your time.\n\n","May 17","false","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Crysis 2 is the equivalent of the loud, obnoxious blockbuster movie dazzling the audience with its fancy effects. Hell, they even got Hans Zimmer to do the soundtrack.\n\nThat being said, despite cutting down a lot on the open world aspect, Crysis 2 is probably a better game than the original. At least this one has something resembling proper pacing. The game does a far better job alternating between quiet moments, full-on shootouts and everything in-between. It also throws the player into a couple of memorable scenarios instead of making him infiltrate the same military base over and over again. The gunplay is also improved as it finally has some weight to it and the recoil doesn't seem that random anymore.\n\nHowever, not all areas have been improved upon. The enemy design, for instance, is actually a step back since you're mostly fighting aliens who look like oversized (human) grunts with squishy heads - the predecessor's design definitely looked and felt more 'alien'.\n\nThe story is still completely irrelevant and only serves as an excuse to drag the player through different setpieces. And yet, the game feels the need pester you with radio chatter and cutscenes regularly even though it neither cares about the characters it introduces nor the story it was supposed to tell.\n\nDespite some improvements, Crysis 2 is still lackluster. Although I did enjoy some parts of the game and the scenery of a war-torn New York does have a certain draw to it, a first person shooter that features subpar gunplay is simply not that enjoyable. It doesn't help that the opportunities to use various suit powers have been drastically reduced.\n\nEven if it fails at everything else, the game is a competent benchmark to torture your GPU with.","December 18, 2014","false","7.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Let's keep this to the points. Crysis 2 is a bad game. Crysis 1 and Warhead are better and worth spending on. Why is Crysis 1 / Warhead better? Well, because it has the following:\n\nA semi-large open sandbox environment.\nBeing able to go Prone (snake belly on the floor shuffle).\nBetter control over Nanosuit abilities (able to activate strength mode, speed mode at will rather having it on by default)\nMore ability to be stealthy and favour a silent approach.\nA whooole newww worllllld... a fantaaastic poiiiint of viiiiewwww. It was a new experience.\n\nCrysis 2 shoves you down a corridoor shooter under the pretense of being an open world sandbox environment. You are tricked into thinking it is, but it's not. It's a lie. The game features stupid setpieces, fixed cutscenes that no one cares about, a storyline as farfetched and uninteresting as it can be and a linear progression which renders you bored and tired.\n\nYes, the visuals are amazing but the whole game experience is such a farce that I don't think it's worth you sitting through the whole title. Go play Crysis 1 and Warhead (expansion). Those are brilliant games. Very enjoyable. VERY.\n\nAvoid Crysis 2. Please. Crysis 3 is even worse than Crysis 2. Crytek don't know how to make games. Just expensive tech demos and benchmark tools which take up 20GB of your HDD / SDD and give you nothing in return but railroad boredom.","October 10, 2014","false","4.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Irritating game controls that dose not play much like the Original(mostly the crappy Lean left and right and no prone that pisses me off).The quick suit menu is in a diffrent order and going right from crysis to this I'm use to that and keep picking the wrong option.Not a big deal but come on keep it consistant so when people move right from the last game to this it feels familiar.\n\nI do like the dedacated buttons for suit options though, just hit a key for cloak or armor.\n\nLean left and right are worthless, you use your mouse to lean when you aim down sight by a wall, What the hell MORE CONSOLE LEFTOVER CRAP.\n\n(after play for a bit of time I'm a little use to this and at times it has its merits. You can peak over stuff with more precision then just going from crouching to standing but for leaning left and right it's still not as good as the original game).\n\nNo quick save just check points. More leftover CONSOLE CRAP (I can deal with this but sometimes I need to go do other things and then I have to leave the game going or lose my progression).\n\nThis next thing bugs me the most.\n\nAt times you can't even look where you want to, the game forces you to look at what they want you too see or the suit goes into tactical override and tells you how to turn on the cloak or armor mode like your some fool. This kind of crap ruins replay value for me,eveytime I play the game it going to tell me how to play the game, I DON'T LIKE THAT. And the prompts that tell you what key you need to use to do stuff clutter the screen as I'm trying to play.(and theres no option to turn that off)\n\nI want to feel like I'm there, not watching through someone else's eyes or being babysat and told what to do.I could understand it maybe telling you how to use the suit if your playing on the easiest difficulty but I went right for the hardest and don't need any damn help.I Have been playing FPS games since I was ten.\n\nI dont usually make reviews but this games lack of a good lean and prone and handholding sucks so I had to rant about it somewhere.Even the video settings lack options like anti aliasing, something you expect in any modern game.\n\nThe game looks good, that's the only nice thing I have to say about it, It is what Diablo 3 is to Diablo 2.A let down.Not the worst sequal but not what I wanted or was expecting.\n\nI may be a bit over critical because I absolutely hate how consoles are dumbing down gaming, And there is no reason for it.JUST MAKE THE GAMES FOR PC AND PORT THEM TO CONSOLE AND EVERYONE WILL BE HAPPY.They might lose stuff, but they are not likely to complan about it because thats how it has to be to work on there console systems, but it dosent need to be that way on PC.\n\nAfter getting use to all the CONSOLE CRAP this game has, I Am having fun. But cannot recommend this game becaus it would be promoting the degradation of good PC gaming.\n\nEdit:Now that I have completed the game I can say It was fun and the story was not bad.\n\nThough the aliens are nothing like the first game and the ones from the first game do not make a appearance(thay are the same aliens but the squid like exoskeletons from the first are not in this one).\n\nIf you gave the game another name and renamed the few people that are taken form the first game you would have another game just with the same nanosuit not really a sequel.Not really a bad thing per se, just seems odd to me.\n\nStill I feel it was a degradation of what could have been a better PC game. I got it for free when my brother got me the humble bundle. Having played it now I would not want to have payed more then $5 for it.","March 30, 2015","false","5.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

WTF happenned?\n\nThe nanosuit options are limited, the customization options are locked until you unlock them? Why? Why the hell are they locked? I already have the suit... poor game design to appeal to 12 year olds playing on peasant boxes.\n\nAnd why do I get nanotech from killing aliens? Another stupid design decisions.\n\nThe levels are on rails. Instead of playing the game and figuring out a way to overcome challenges, you end up thinking "What does the developer want me to do for this part?" ♥♥♥♥ your crappy consoles that can't handle open levels. If you bought a 360 or ps3, the ♥♥♥♥♥iness of this game is your fault.\n\nThe AI is also a lot worse. Enemies are too stupid to engage you from >50m away, and rarely come to flank you. If I end up with an enemy behind me, it's probably because the game spawned more behind me... just because 12 year old ♥♥♥♥tards.\n\nThe game is also a lot easier than Crysis and Warhead, even on the highest difficulties.\n\nAlso, wtf is up with the cheesy nano suit voice? It feels like they put it in just to have a terminator sounding voice to impress little kids.

Crysis 2 is a game that is a worthy successor to the massively acclaimed Crysis. With masterful graphics, and revamped gameplay, Crysis 2 is a work of art all on its own. With the included threat of the Ceph, the pesky Koreans from the last Crysis seem like baby toys, with high tech weaponry and deadly technology, you feel like you are a god among men when you are mowing these aliens down. But one of the largest changes that impressed me is how the nanosuit interface has changed. Crysis 2 has made the usage of the nanosuit a lot more user friendly, so instead of having to use your mouse wheel to select certain armor abilities in Crysis, you press key binds to use them, and in some cases they are used on their own without having to activate it. Like instead of selecting sprint to run super-fast, now regular sprint does that automatically for you, and to use your enhanced jumping, you just hold space instead of switching to strength then jumping. It makes the suit a lot more functional and easier to use. With an excellent story to continue the originally Crysis. I don’t feel it is worth the $30 price tag, but if you can find it on sale, this game is a wonderful game. Just make sure to play the original Crysis first, because a lot of the background story in the first in necessary to understand the story in Crysis 2.","November 2, 2014","true","22.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you were or currently are, a fan of the first crysis with its open level design and AI then DO NOT buy Crysis 2 unless its on sale for 7 bucks.\n\nThis is a nearly a completely linear corridor shooter from the beginning to where I am now.  The graphics are very nice, but you can tell that crytek built this with consoles in mind.  The levels are short and contained.  Nothing open at all.  The scripted segments are cliche and overused.  Large exploding scenes are coupled with overacted dialogue and tired performances.  Its your basic run of the mil fps with pretty graphics.  The multiplayer I have not touched, nor will I ever touch since EA is bringing down the servers pretty soon.\n\nAll i can say in the end is, if you're a fan of the COD single player expeirence then buy Crysis 2.  The campaign isn't terrible, it's just been done before.  If you're a fan of open world shooters like farcry and the first Crysis then prepare to be dissapointed.","July 7, 2014","false","2.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's a decent game, but it's not what should have followed the first game. The graphics are toned down, the destructible environments have been done away with, the story is tangential to what was presented in Crysis, and the power system felt hampered compared to the original even though it's presented as an upgrade. The player-character feels like he's lumbering around, and it's nothing like the swift, silent, deadly special-forces feel you get from the original. In short, it's just not as good and this game has taken a direction towards becoming just another generic "Big Budget Shooter".","February 8, 2014","false","1.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you really want to pick it up, for whatever reason, I strongly suggest waiting for a sale, you will regret buying this for its full price.\nPositive - -\n\nIt's a crisis game, the gunplay is tight and responsive, when it works, and the nanosuit is still a lot of fun to play with, I appreciate the simpler control mechanics, and merging maximum speed and strength into the core functions, making combat more fluid. Instead of the old modes you are given a cloak and maximum armor toggles.\n\nWhile more linear than the original, the map layouts have various routes the player can take to flank, ambush or just bypass certain enemies, giving you enough options to suit most playstyles.\n\nWeapon choices are varied and fun, giving you something for any engagement and some fun variations like the K-volt "Taser" SMG, a suppressed pump action shotgun and plenty of customization for each.\n\nThe story is engaging, and kept me interested throughout the sections I have played through, roughly halfway into the game. Would you like to know more? I do!\n\nNegative - -\n\nHaving reached the half point of the game, I can tell you the story is just about all that keeps me going at this stage. Crysis 2 is horribly broken, the fun is getting hard to find, and the following explains why.\n\nThe AI is for the most part brain-dead, with occasional instances of brilliance, they will often completely fail to perform the simplest things, like throwing grenades and walking through doorways, sometimes letting you shoot them without a hint of reaction or even completely ignoring you.\n\nAdd to that several other mechanic breaking bugs like being unable to switch weapons / reload / aim down sights / pick up ammo at random, which got me killed more times than I care to remember. cloaking and the cover system only work partially and some enemies always manage to see you after cloaking or hiding behind cover to recharge, which makes taking the stealth route very tedious and frustrating.\n\nFurthermore immersion is broken on a regular basis by malfunctioning AI constantly spamming their voice dialogues, sounds will also cut out for no apparent reason.\n\nBIG disappointment, Crytek. The original game was hard on the computer, but at least it worked properly for the most part.","April 14, 2014","false","12.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It starts with an absurdly long cutscene that doesn't bring any useful information to the player except that the developers believe that big explosions and shiny graphics will make you interested in this turd of a game. It's broken up by masked cutscenes in the actual engine where you are able to look around, as if they think you're stupid enough that this miniscule form of interactivity would make you feel less like you're watching a dumb action movie about big explosions. And it just keeps dragging on to the point where I started feeling like the purpose was to bore you to death.\n\nWhat follows is probably the worst case of constricting hand-holding I've ever seen. They constantly take the control away from the player in order to ensure you don't miss their "super cool and awesome scripted events". As with the interactive cutscenes they make you unable to move, you cannot continue playing until you do what the game prompts you to.\n\nBy the time I was about to start in on the actual gameplay I was so frustrated at the game that I could not bare to continue. It took some 20 minutes to get that far, 20 minutes which were so poor on actual useful information that it could easily have been cut down to about two minutes, with some time left for filler explosions to make you realise how cool of a game the developers think they've created. Poor game design all over. Absolute garbage. The end.","December 20, 2013","false","0.3"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

It's vibrant with tons of effects and well textured throughout even if certain assets are reused over and over again (some of it can be immersion breaking but I thought think you're here for the roleplaying aspect anyway).\n\nIt's a solid FPS experience with hours of content unlike the modern day shooters you see with a few hours, the campaign definitely felt lengthy and the storyline present.  The plot isn't something to write to your mother about but it's passable for the genre and even had a few memorable characters (though lots of blank ones too).\n\nThe gameplay itself offers lots of variance in tackling objectives while spoonfeeding you certain ones using the "Objective scanner" by pushing B.  While helpful at times so it's clear what you have to do, some of this definitely took a lot of the challenge away and feelings of accomplishment on completing any objective or entire mission.\n\nSome of Prophet's abilities are a bit too strong as well such as Stealthing (which seems to be a common complaint among players) that it takes too much of the challenge away from the game but with the Ceph enemies using EMP pulses and the like - I found just enough variance and challenge to enjoy the experience.  It 'will' get repetitive to an extent but it overall was a pleasant experience with a large enough variance in weapons and secondaries.\n\nThe A.I. is one of the few complaitns I have with the game - sometimes the enemies were buggy and multiple times during the playthrough - I found them clipped or stuck on terrain (especially the Heavy Ceph).  While this meant they were exploitable in a game that already felt a bit too easy.  Other times the enemies (especially Ceph) would just randomly patrol/pace back and forth while you were shooting at them - as if they were trying to decide if they should fight back or run away.\n\nOverall I wouldn't say it's a must-play game release but it didn't have enough shortcomings for me to warn people away from the experience if they are a fan of futuristic-tech FPS campaigns.","December 14, 2014","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can be more agile and plan your tatics faster. The maps are small, but the emotion is great.\nWhat I liked the most is tha AI. The AI in Crysis 2 is more intelligent than the previous AIs.\n\nI am not saying that Crysis and Crysis Warhead sucks, actually they are great. However, for me, Crysis 2 is greater.\n\nI don't know what kind of magic did they use in this game but, the graphics are awesome. The game is better optimized than the others.\n\nHistory\nAbout the history, you will assume the control of a Marine named Alcatraz, who gains ownership of the nanosuit from Prophet. CryNet Systems has been hunting Prophet to take the suit back, but they don't know that actually Prophet has given the suit to Alcatraz.\n\nI recommend you to finish Crysis and Crysis Warhead before getting into Crysis 2, so you can understand better the history.\n\n1O/1O","December 15, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having played the first game intensively I was excited about the second game and I was not left disappointed.\n\nGraphics\nVery realistic\nVery detailed textures\nGreat lightingSound\nEpic soundtrack\nWeapons sound very good\nVery good voice actingBalance\nDifficulties all extremely well balanced\nPlay as fast as you want to - if you want to finish a level fast, you can\nGame helps you with tactics if you  needAtmosphere\nReal places\nAmazing cut scenes in player view instead of loading a video\nMost areas have no humans in them whatsoever, they're simply empty and yet you are told at one point that the city is full with people, really?UI\nNano-suit extremely easy to use and get  used to\nNot able to save whenever you wantContent\nPretty long single-player for a FPS\nYou can replay the game since there are different ways of solving missions\nCollectablesLevel design\nDetailed levels\nThe levels are very diverse, sometimes you're underground, in sewers, in buildings or streets\nSome levels are longAI\nTake cover\nCall for assistance\nNot many different types of enemies, soldiers or aliens and there's only 2-3 types of aliensWeapons\nExtremely interesting nano suit concept\nWeapons can be modified\nAble to upgrade nanosuit\nSome of the upgrades don't make sense in the single playerStory\nGreat start\nAllies keep changing\nSadly no real final but rather a cliff-hanger for the next game\nConclusionCrysis was an amazing game and so is Crysis 2. Unfortunately it is not as good as the first game and yet it still is a game that really anyone needs to play. If you can lower your expectations from the first game you will see that this is an epic game with great game play but also story and even addicting soundtrack.\n\nI would recommend this game to literally anyone even if they don't actually enjoy FPS games. Crysis 2 is very different and excels at so many things that it is difficult to even compare it to the average FPS. The  nano suit is an experience in itself while the story will make anyone curious. It does not matter whether you have experience with FPS or not as the easiest difficulty literally allows you to sprint through levels while barely shooting anyone. I have finished this game within around 7 hours but admit ignoring a lot of enemies or using stealth to avoid lengthy fights. If you are a fan of Crysis then you can safely purchase this game.\n\nThis game was played at maximum settings on this system:\nMonitor: BenQ XL2420T[www.amazon.co.uk]\nGPU: Sapphire Tri-X R9 290[www.scan.co.uk]\nCPU: Intel Core i5-4670[www.amazon.co.uk]\nRAM: Kingston HyperX Blu 4x4[www.amazon.co.uk]\nMotherboard: MSI Z87-G45\nSSD: Samsung SSD 830[www.amazon.co.uk]\n\nIf you have any further questions or are still unsure if you should buy it feel free to ask.","December 2, 2014","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you're invisible, the enemies naturally can't see you; that's fine. However, your shadow is clearly still there and you would make noise when you move, the enemies don't seem to pick up on that. One more point, the throat slashing stealth kill I'm a little sceptical about. Unless with that stab you managed to cut through their spinal cord, they wouldn't die instantly. Simply cutting arteries isn't enough to ensure instant death, they'd be bleeding for a lot longer than the time that was allowed.\n\nFun, buy it if you want.","November 22, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
