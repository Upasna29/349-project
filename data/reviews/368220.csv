Read this review.\n\n\nClose Combat series was my favorite strategy/tactical games series from 90's.\nThats right, first game was made in '96, and last one from main 5 game series was done in 2000.\nThen there were others, remakes and etc.. But main game series was from 96-2000.\n\nIt was remade at least once from what I remember after that. But no major changes were made, just basic bug fixes and tiny other improvments that time.\n\nNow we have 2015, and Matrix games..who cant make proper game by themselves, made this game. Which was actually made in 2012 and its currently on sale. 2015 - 27 euro. o_O\n\nIs it new game comparing to old ones from series? Yes and no. Mostly NO.\nIt uses new campaing/scenario thats true. But it uses same graphics engine (apparently improved to 32 bit) same gameplay engine with slight changes.\n\nYou have new campaign map here, where you can move your units from sector/region to sector according to your strategy. Which was done in 2 games from old series too 4 and 5th. So nothing original here either.\nAfter which it comes to deployment and fight on tactical level.\nStill fun after 15 years..\n\nAnd after 15 years there is nothing much new in here.\nThey added cool features  , they added some nice units. And that's it.\nBut I would call it small fixes rather than creating new game.\nIf you played CC 15 -20 years ago like me you would be surprised how little has changed!\n\n\nRemember Matrix games didnt had to create engine or gameplay.\nThey didnt had to start from scratch.\nIts not their idea.\nThey just bough rights for this Close Combat series and they improved it tiny bit.\n\nNow my question to you, fellow gamer: Is it fair to charge 36 euro for "game" like this?\n15 year old game, which should be 4,99 -9.99 at most. Cause its not new game its not even from this year, its 2012 game, it should be called standalone DLC.\nNew game offers you everything new . Not slightly changed old game with new campaign.\n\nThis "game" came out in 2012, and whole this time it was for 36 euro.. . How greedy matrix/slitherine are is nothing new to me. Go to their websites and see what sort of games they sell for 30-40 euro prices. Mostly turn based games that look like ♥♥♥♥ straight from 90's. So thats not first time they did it. This is their normal practice.. Go check their website for yourself.\n\n\nI loved close combat series, i played from game  1 to 5 in 90's and early 2000.\nBut after 15 years they could do more, add bigger campaign map or couple, change it so it would actually be new game, do something to justify their price!\nFor now its just poor cash grab attempt by using Classic game title.\n\n\nNOT recomending for 36 euro.\nNOT recomending for 27 euro.\n14.99 euro is really pushing it.\n4.99 its about right price for 3 year old game that is remake of 15 year old game.\n\nTO compare this price .. Wargame Red Dragon which is year old game, have 3d engine, have more units , countries and everything.. costs 39 euro.. and this was released in 2012 , and now is for 36euro/27euro? If you even forget about other games from CC series. Then its 3 year old game for 27 euro!!! REALLLY? REALLY?\n\nOther CC title, that is "year old" Close Combat - Gateway to Caen is still for full price 36 euro. LOL.\n\nWhy I bought it then? Sentiment.. And to warn others.\nDONT FEED GREEDY SCAM DEVELOPERS.\nHelp me to teach them respect for players!\nDONT BUY IT THIS DLC FOR PRICE OF FULL GAME!\n\nREMEMBER This game is from 2012 using game engine from 2000!\nAnd  it still costs more than many games relased TODAY !

I cut my teeth on the game with Close Combat 5: Invasion Normandy, went back and bought all of the previous ones, and even bought a few of the later entries into the series. For a while the series fell off of my radar, but I recently noticed this game on Steam and decided to purchase it.\n\nI can safely say that Close Combat is still amazing. Panthers in the Fog feels like the better installments of the game, yet is upgraded, with more realistic reinforcement pools and better graphics. The game is still very detailed, with each soldier's mental state, health and supplies tracked, but never in a way that requires micromanagement of any kind. One of the things I always loved about Close Combat, thanks to these features, is how an unintentional narrative can unfold around squads of men under your command. The ability to rename squads allows you to give them nicknames based on this unintentional narrative.\n\nThe maps are not 3D, which may turn some newer gamers off, but really, they're beautifully painted maps with a ton of detail (remember that holding the right mouse button allows you to see the elevation and type of cover under the moused-over area, which is important for keeping squads alive).\n\nThe game is much slower-paced than more recent WWII wargames. I just did a battle that lasted a good 45 minutes because the AI and I were trying to outmaneuver one-another's tanks without really firing any shots. But that is part of the appeal of this game and other Close Combat games: the level of tactical depth is hard to find these days. Strategy will make or break your victory chances.\n\nThere are some things I wish they would move into 2015 though: why are tanks still silent? We should be hearing them echoing across the battlefield. And where are my weather effects? Still, these are all such minor details compared to the things that make Panthers In The Fog and other Close Combat games so good. This game is a worthy entry into the franchise.\n\n10/10.","May 15, 2015","true","5.1"," 107 of 150 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","107","150","5","9"

I paid £22 (with a 29% discount) for a game that is 20 years old.\nSomeone has thoughtfully reworked explosion and smoke graphics a little bit since Battle of the Bulge and Invasion: Normandy but its nice to see they have retained the inexplicable crash to windows for which windows will seek a solution, but never find one. Is that part of the retro feel?\nNobody can drive in this game and will turn any part of a vehicle, except the most armored bit, to an aggressor. AI has generally improved over the years but I didn't find I had to change my tactics picking up where I left off 15 years ago.\n\nLike I said £22 is a lot for a game that was on PC Worlds shelves as a white label for £1.99 10 years ago. For this price I kind of expected a significant reworking, but didn't get one.\nDisappointed with the game, disappointed with steam.\n","May 23, 2015","false","121.2"," 54 of 70 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","54","70","7","0"

Me, I paid the full price because I was excited. I know there's a few people on here that had purchased the game and were disappointed. There's a few points I want to hit on:\n\n1. The Price\n\nThere's two sides to this coin. It really comes down to whether or nor you'd want to spend the money on the game. If you're a fan of the franchise, then yes you should buy it (especially if you're a die hard like me). If you don't want to spend that money, then don't. Who cares about the price - it's your money, dude.\n\n2. The Engine\n\nThis is where I get kinda irritated about some of the existing reviews. Honestly, man, it's a 2D top-down tactical game. How good can the engine actually get? Yes, Gateway to Caen was graphically better, but they're using the exact same engine as Panthers in the Fog. They added 32-bit into the engine because it allowed for better graphical animations and transluscency. It's really not that big of a deal, guys. It's Close Combat, and anybody that's been playing the series for a long time will tell you the graphics have pretty much always been the same. I re-iterate: IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. Close Combat has always looked like this. The upgraded engine has slightly better AI and better stability, as well. As far as I'm concerned, this is not a game-breaking issue. Hell, when I play it I don't even think about that. Close Combat was never about the engine - it was about the gameplay.\n\n3. Less Content\n\nLet's take a look back into the majority of the series. Each game, with the exception being the re-releases like the Longest Day, have all been unique in their setting. In this case, it's the German counter-attack known as Operation Luttich. Me, I dont gripe about the content when it comes to Close Combat. Historically, those are combat elements that took place in the battle. That's the way it is, so you really don't have a position to complain about it. Personally, I wouldn't place that among the ranks for a review. Yes, it has less diverse unit selections, and yes, it has slightly fewer maps. Unless you're expecting them to cover ther entire war's range of the unit types and the majority of the Bocage, this isn't an issue.\n\nSo, that's the rant of this review. Now to core of it:\n\nIt's the classic simple interface I've come to know and love about Close Combat. It's 2D bird's eye view, and I think that's awesome. There's alot of depth they've put into this particular perspective, and all it would take is a time or two through the tutorial and you're ready to rock. Also, there is a level of depth in tactical decisions in this game that I think a good majority of the existing reviews have overlooked, from elevation all the way to effective ranges of period weapons and the fact that a mortar team has to zero in on a series of coordinates rather than the round magically landing where it needs to be. If you make a mistake in a battle, you pay for it. That's strategy, and unless you learn tactics you're going to get your ♥♥♥ kicked. 'Nuff said. The graphics and gameplay is simple enough to master pretty quickly, yet with enough depth to become a good simulation, simulating morale, cover, etc.\n\nMy conclusion is that if you're a big fan of strategic, tactical gameplay and you're a history buff about world war 2, this is definately a game you should consider.","July 9, 2015","true","26.4"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","32","41","2","1"

Not only did Close Combat look good, but it was real time and easy to play.\n\nWith an emphasis on men and their morale you experienced the thrill of getting your men through the fight in one piece.\n\nIn short you really cared and were excited about what happened on the battlefield.\n\nThat was back in the mid nineties.\n\nClose Combat Panthers in the Fog (2012) does a reasonable job in extending the original experience, but doing so with the original engine, even when it is tweaked to include 32bit hires graphics and an improved strategic layer, does limit its appeal to gamers that can look beyond the age and structural limitations it has inherited.\n\nHere's when I'd like something more than a simple yes or no recommendation.\nThis game can easily be recommended to war gamers who enjoy the Close Combat-series.\n\nBut I would never recommend this to someone who's into more dynamic game play and up to date visual experience.\n\nOf course the developers are equally aware of the situation, so work continues on Close Combat Bloody First with its new 3d Unity based engine. This will finally allow the basic Close Combat game to progress beyond the limitations of a 20 year old game engine.\n\nI'd describe Close Combat as a light company level war game. Fun for a quick round, but without becoming too casual or a RTS click fest.\n\nThe good thing about Close Combat in general is that it is easy to play, but with enough depth and a good sense of history to draw in the more advanced war gamer.\n\nThe continued (niche) success of the Close Combat series is probably caused by a lack of alternatives: RT, WW2, top down, easy to manage and historical.\n\nClose Combat still stands alone in its particular niche.\n\nTo sum it up.\n\nPlus:\n- It is Close Combat\n- Easy to get into\n- WW2\n\nMinus:\n- It is still the old (albeit improved) Close Combat engine\n- AI pathfinding can (still) be terrible - btw not unique to CC\n- price\n\nThe old engine combined with the high price are imho the most limiting factors in recommending this game to anyone but fans of the series.\n\nAs an old fan though I am enjoying my "relapse" into the series and I will certainly buy Bloody First and any spin off for some time to come!","May 24, 2015","true","8.9"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","24","29","3","0"

There is no denying however that the real beauty in these games are in the MP experience and having played through perhaps 10 battles in the first MP Campaign I've tried in Panthers in the Fog, I can only say that the netcode leaves some things to wish for. It is playable, but tends to lose connection easily.\n\nAs has already been pointed out by others, if you are new to the series it might not be your cup of tea. If you are already a Close Combat fan it will not disappoint. However if you are looking for a good CC Multiplayer experience I have to recommend Gateway to Caen before this title. Let's hope PitF gets the updates it needs and deserves in a future patch.","December 27, 2015","true","47.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

The units, the maps, the battle order, the unit composition, everything is historical accurate so you are not only playing but also learning WWII military history.\n\nIt's like opening an Interactive Osprey book, and one Osprey book cost around £12, so as one enjoying Osprey books is not a problem to pay the price and support this series.\n\nObviously not a game for all, if you think to play this in a superficial way, without paying attention to the details put in to the game and you don't care about real history, then for you it may be just an old school overpriced 2D RTS.\n\n\ncheers","May 16, 2015","true","63.7"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","35","60","2","11"
