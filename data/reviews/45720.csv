I'll elaborate on that:\n\nIt crashes constantly for no apparent reason, uses GFWL and caused my PC to BSOD several times in the process of trying to get it to work. On top of that, it successfully ruined a good portion of my weekend.\n\nThe game itself is actually quite decent so do yourself a fovor and grab the extreme condition edition that does not include GFWL painful buttsex and avoid colonies like the plague.\n\n0/10: the perfect gift for your worst enemy. Otherwise, should not be on sale.\n\nEdit: I digress...tried the DX9 launcher and it worked fine.

The game is actually rather difficult even on normal. When you're under fire from rockets and lasers, and they just keep coming, don't expect to heroically get up and fight the good fight. Expect to die.\n\nThat's basically what the boss fights are like, or casual fights where there are multiple men in VS suits and people with rockets in your way. It's a real pain the the buttocks. I will say that the combat, while some of it has merit, the VS fighting at least; the on foot third person gun fighting can be annoying as you're basically running and gunning while trying not to get shot from the hundreds of enemies, human and alien, or akrid as they're called in this game. Basically, the combat is not the best aspect. I mean, the VS fighting is cool, you know, when you're not dying.\n\nThe game's greatest asset are the graphics and, for the most part, the story. While most reviews criticize the story for being generic, because it is (sci-fi shooter set on another planet where evil corporation plans to eradicate all life in order to colonize it), the real story lies in the mystery of who the snow pirates are and what their purpose is. They're unkowingly defending the planet from complete eradication while also causing the genocide of the akrid. The game also has a sense of trust and friendship that probably wasn't mentioned in professional reviews. These character build a sense of trust to Wayne, the protagonist that is mysteriously unearthed and found frozen after the opening mission. You find out your father died and there's this whole conspiracy. It gets interesting while playing it cool and easy. The plot doesn't really get too complex nor does it make you think. You just run and gun and watch the cut scenes in between.\n\nThe main characters are interesting but also very obviously written by Capcom because of the funny dialog by some side characters that probably wasn't meant to be funny (I'm looking at you Rick and Luka.) And the game also has the Japanese art with the characters except for Joe for some reason who looks like he was modeled by a dude from Burbank. I mean, the character designs weren't that bad, they just could have made them look more human and Luka probably could have used a different voice actress. Whoever voiced her probably usually works on animes as it was that usual soft female voice you hear in animes. I mean, she's supposed to be a bloody snow pirate, not some....I don't know, whatever.\n\nThe environments are fantastic though. Great design and effects with the snow. The final gets kind of weird though. Suddenly you're thousands of feet in the air fighting some ♥♥♥♥♥♥. God, I hated Isenberg.\n\nThe rest of the reviews I'm seeing on Steam are mostly negative because of complaints of crashing to desktop and GFWL. Look, the multiplayers dead and I don't think anyone reading this was even going to bother with the multiplayer. GFWL will work fine if you have an account already made, shouldn't be a big deal just to log in and play the singleplayer. I have experience zero crashes to desktop. But that's just me.\n\n7.5/10","August 2, 2014","true","9.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

I sincerely put about 8 to 10 hours JUST trying to get to finish the second mission due to sound issues and crashes... and then, somehow, someway, I hit upon the mix that allowed me to actually PLAY the darn game beyond prior crashpoints of mission 2. For me, it seemed to be running it windowed, altering my system's sound settings, and blood sacrifice (sorry poor mosquito) but I finally made it ALL the way through mission 2. Now I am up to mission 4, running in full screen and all bells and whistles on. and I am loving it. These are LONG missions. no save points. Just complete the mission or start the mission again. But damn they are fun. So far, through the 4 missions, the story has been entertaining and the gameplay, past mission 2, is just wonderful.\nI'm not sure if running windowed would make a difference for others, but if you faced the many hours of agonizing frustration that I endured because I could see that there is a good game buried herein, then I hope you succeed.\nand hopefully you can be spared the blood sacrifice part.","February 29","true","13.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I can't explain why it works for me because I didn't have to do anything to get it to work.  Here's my rig which, I hope, might explain a few things:\n\nCPU:  AMD FX 8350 @ 4.3ghz\nGPU:  Radeon R9 290 @ 947mhz / no overclocking\nRAM:  32GB Transcend @ 1066mhz\nMotherboard:  Sabretooth 990FX R2.0\nHard drive:  Seagate SSHD 2TB\nAMD Driver:  Crimson 15.11\nOS:  Windows 10 64bit with automatic updates\nMonitor:  BenQ 1080p @ 60hz\n\nNotes:\nNvidia PhysX is also installed (ver. 9.15.0428 - not the latest, I know)\nGames For Windows Live is installed and I have an active account with no paid subscription.\n\nThe game runs very smooth at max settings @ 1080p with vsync.  With the latest driver I even have the option to run the game at a virtual resolution of 3200 x 1800.  The frame rates are very good (60fps with my monitor) at that resolution too but they take some dips during intense moments.  Good news for 4k users.\n\nThe game itself is a classic and the graphics hold up very well despite it's age.  It has a good mix of old and new school elements, gameplay wise.  I found the game challenging on normal when I first played it on the Xbox 360 but there are various difficulty settings to suit your needs.  If you enjoy challenging intense shooters with aliens, mechs, explosions, and special effects, this is for you.","November 25, 2015","true","1.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

As a single-player game, Lost Planet provides a thrilling action-adventure that really feels like a fun adventure. You go places, and despite the game taking place on a snow-bound E.D.N III, there's a lot of different vistas to visit in the game which host a wide variety of enemies, ranging from armed dudes to giant robots to even larger giant bugs. What's even cooler is that if you can get your hands on a mech, you can ride that mech! A lot of them have unique features making them useful for various situations, on top of that they can be equiped with the various mech weapons you'll no doubt find throughout the levels.\n\nWhen you're not in a mech, you have the same kind of mobility. You can equip two of the various no-frills weapons that are available in the game as well as a single type of grenade. What weapons you decide to take with you make a significant impact on your playstyle. Rockets are handy to keep on you should a giant bug come at you (Which happens often,) but ammunition is few and far between, forcing you to stick with a different weapon until the situation calls for explosives. If you happen to come across any large mech-weapons but there are no mechs to be seen, you can still pick them up and use em, but you can't switch weapons without dropping them. On top of that, you have a grappling hook that you can use to get to higher levels and for (slightly) speedier travel. The only problem that I had is that getting hit can lock you down for a moment longer than you might want to be, Monster Hunter fans will know what I'm talking about.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest gameplay feature is the thermal energy sysytem. While you do have a typical health bar, your health will regenerate as long as you have energy, which is dropped by enemies and can be found from destroying some of the game's destructable environments. The thing is, that energy drains over time, even moreso when you're doing various activities such as jumping, or being in a mech. This, in my opinion, gives the game a sense of urgency. You'll be making decisions for yourself, "Should I keep moving forward or take the time to look for spare energy?"\n\nThe boss fights in the game are big, monstrous and provide a good amount of challenge, a lot of the time I found myself in various do-or-die situations where I was down to my last rocket and was running dangerously low on energy. These are the kinds of bosses that I love to fight, ones with big, high damaging attacks, health bars the length of the screen, and a lot of variety to make them stand out from the other enemies you'll find yourself facing. And defeating them feels oh so satisfying.\n\nAll in all, Lost Planet feels like a proper game. This game is a textbook example of how a good action-adventure game should play and a reminder that while Capcom tends to make some really dumb decisions, they still know how to create a memorable experience that stands out amongst the crowd.","December 27, 2013","true","5.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The boss fights are complete ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, especially as difficulty increases. The game even resorts to cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like having the time between boss defeat and mission end increasing on higher difficulty levels in an effort to ♥♥♥♥ you over by running you out of T-ENG. This is an obnoxious design choice. Not only that, but the vertical pitch is limited to about 75°. Bosses that fly love to hover on top of you and your character doesn't go transparent to allow accurate shooting.\n\nAnnoying as this ♥♥♥♥ing is, the game is still damn good. Visually astounding, but not cutting edge. It's just a clean and well polished world that looks and plays great. The gameplay is frantic and fun and the story is reminiscent of '80s anime. This is a game that loves to be a game and I ♥♥♥♥ing adore it because of all this. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t boss fighting and limited aim are about the only real downsides, though I anticipate for some it'll get repetitive. Highly recommended despite it's frustration factor. The only way it could've been better is if it had co-op.

Running the app would do nothing. After looking around, apparently that is caused by Konami giving the wrong version of Games For Windows Live (GFWL). Great, after all these years, they didn't update this. That's disgusting, and against the whole idea behind steam, automatic updating and allowing PC gaming to be intuitive without having to trawl the internet for patches and fixes.\n\nSo I download GFWL and the game loads. YAY!\nClick start. they screen greys out and reloads the title screen. Click start again, screen greys out and reloads the... yeah you get the picture.\n\nSo i hunt around for ages finding out what it may be. Find some guides out there, and completely clean out GFWL and everything related to it, and reload the XBOXONE version.\n\nI'm sorry, but that is disgusting. Most people on forums seemed like they gave up trying to get this game to run. Steam should take this game OFF the store until it is patched, as it was never fit to run.\n\nOk, but after loading everything is good right? WRONG!!!\n\nEverything is mapped to the xbox controller. Press A to continue? Press B to go back? My xbox controller isn't even plugged in. It's a shooter so I want to use keyboard and mouse. But no, Konami litteraly ported this from the xbox and didn't even change to XBOX controller graphics and input.\n\nOk, but you can set your own controls right? Yeah...\n\nBut then when playing the game it tells you, press RB to do this... ok, what is RB again, or what key have I assigned that to... oh.... that's right... YOU CAN'T CHECK THE CONTROLS WHEN PLAYING THE GAME!!!!\n\nso exit game, back to start screen, look at the controls in the options... OMG...\n\nWhen people say Console gaming is better than PC gaming, they are obviously using this complete turd as the example to prove their case. Do not buy this on PC. Do not support Konami. If you absolutely must play this game, get it on the console where it was actually designed for.\n\nShame, as although the game is good enough, it's destroyed by both Konami and the steaming pile that is GFWL.","January 15","false","9.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","30","3","10","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/recommended/45720/","endchronicle","Rekyua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/","675 products in account","+Summary at End+\n\nSo, the game I never played. Originally my first showing of the original Lost Planet was a demo I'd gotten from a magazine back on consoles. I was impressed by the levels, visuals, and the enemies available to fight but I never did buy the game, not until I saw it for sale on Steam. Before I begin I'd like to mention the order I've played the series, 2 -> 3 -> 1.\n\nNote: No multiplayer review.\n\nNow, the visuals are still nice to look at and it has this unique visual appearance that I can really only compare to a diorama. It's like playing a game make out of a diorama, not sure how much sense that makes but to put it bluntly they still look good and the style has stood its test of time. The sounds however, are forgettable, I just finished the game yesterday and honestly I can't recall any of the music in the game so audio is forgettable.\n\nCombat gets repetitive, by default a aim assist is enabled that makes shooting anything specific a huge pain, in one example I was trying to shoot a bad guy that was standing on a container, aim assist targeted his ally hiding behind the container. Horrible. The mechs you can drive are fun and being able to load out a weapon you want is great however a mechanic of the game keeps you constantly moving through the level, your thermal energy, and using a mech drains it faster, jumping and dashing in the mech drains it even more and eventually you have no choice but to use a mech to make it through a level so there's a lot of moments where you can't stop for long and have to just put your head down and charge through a stage.\n\nThe boss fights are fun though, barring a couple of them, they all have a trick to them that you'll have to figure out before you can take them out though some of them are just brutally unfair that part of getting past them is based heavily on luck.\n\nNow that the gameplay and art is taken care of, lets get to the toted points of the game back in its day, the story:\nAfter having played 2 and 3 before it, I can tell you that the story in this game is horrible. The character have absolutely no depth to them at all and seeing what supposedly happens to Gale after playing 3 (a prequel) it's just cringe worthy. It really goes all over the place as well and during some scenes I really had no idea what was going on to be honest. Every one is about as stereotypical as it can get and their actions are just so... stupid that I'm surprised I didn't get nauseated from all the eye rolling I'd done during the cinematics. Speaking of the cinematics, they're everywhere. The levels themselves (only 11) are already long, taking over 20+ minutes to complete if you just run through the level and even longer if you take your time and not counting repeating checkpoints.. So having a 15 minute cinematic at the start then a 5 minute cinematic in the middle of a level then another near the end then one more for good measure... Good god there's just too many interruptions. And its not even INTERESTING!\n\nSo, summary.\nGraphics - Good\nSound - Forgettable\nGameplay - Fun\nStory - Is this fanfiction? (Bad)\n\nDon't even bother with this one in my opinion, 2 & 3 are much better.","January 9, 2014","false","6.0"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

Now THAT redeems what this game didn't scored :D","May 18, 2014","false","14.2"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","0"

The bigger weapons feel powerful and do a lot of damage which was lost in the second game likely to balance multiplayer.The game is enjoyable however when you reach the final boss turn it off a throw it in the bin. Final boss is typical grade A japanese bull$#!?. He has shields and weapons which werent in the rest of the game. Only moves that work on him are melee everything else hits his infinite shield. He then spawns turrets which cannot be hit. Very frustrating and for that I would not recommended buying this game instead have a go of a friends.","December 1, 2013","false","9.8"," 2 of 23 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","2","23","0","0"

They must have been talking aobut some other "Lost Planet" because this game is terrible in more or less every possible way. Terrible animation, voice acting, plot, gameplay, level design... I think it's only redeeming feature is that it has a grappling hook, and even that isn't enough to save it. I REALLY don't reccomend this game, it's so bad that I couldn't even bring myself to beat the last boss, I just said close enough and looked up the ending cinematic on youtube (which as big a waste of bandwidth as I expected it to be).","November 25, 2013","false","7.9"," 8 of 40 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","8","40","0","0"

Still it could be worse; at least there is no oppressive government regime who wants to crush….. oh wait.\n\nSo this game is alright, it has not aged all that well, the controls are frustrating and clunky and the graphics are really showing their age but I did enjoy my time with this game, at least in single player, multiplayer was DOA I’m afraid. The enemies were pretty good too, I liked the way you had to go for the glowing weakspots and collect the goo that comes out. Simple pleasures I guess.\n\nFor new gamers I would probably skip this title but if you have fond memories of the game when it first came out, like anime or love mechs then yeah it might be worth picking up on sale.\n\nHave Fun ːMMForFunː","March 3","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
