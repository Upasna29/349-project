Not just "not very pretty", not "outdated", but positively hideous. The kitschy 2D art is sort of acceptable if you close one eye; the poor 3D models and inexplicably terrible animations, however, are not. Either the artists are aliens who never saw a real human being, or they are simply people stuck doing a job they have absolutely no talent for. The ugliness permeating the game is unbearable.\n\nBut okay, looks aren't everything; let's be mature and look past that. How does it play? Well, badly. Everything is stilted, unresponsive and seems to be plodding through a thick layer of mud; even the simplest actions take half an eternity punctuated by random pauses. And speaking of actions, let's discuss puzzles. By and large, they are oversimplified to a point that's almost insulting, and yet still manage to make little to no sense:\n1. There is an object lying in the corner of a dark alley. Malachi will happily come right next to it, but won't pick it up, because it's too dark, and you need to fix a streetlamp first. It's a brick.\n2. A cut lanyard is fixed with superglue. Lanyard. Superglue. Seriously.\nA bizarre addition to the traditional formula is that Malachi won’t pick up objects until he knows where he’d like to use them, with precisely one result: backtracking guaranteed, which really doesn’t play nice with the lumbering pace of it all. And dear lord, the whole thing ends with an honest to goodness maze. In an adventure game. I thought the nineties taught us never to do that again, but apparently I was mistaken. So. Dull.\n\nBut alright, alright, who cares about puzzles. Characters and story, that's what adventure games are all about! – Well, that is the worst thing. When I first learned what the overreaching plot was, I burst out laughing. Not because it is particularly funny, but because it is absolutely ludicrous. Sure, Gabriel Knight 3 and Gray Matter got sort of silly towards the end, but Moebius gets to that point about one third in and never stops going until it dissolves in a raging torrent of crazy (and painfully sexist to boot). And as far as characters are concerned, while I sort of want to appreciate the romance angle that’s going on in here, everyone in the game is so very wooden, whether it’s talking about the models, voice acting or writing, that it’s like watching two robots trying to learn what this “emotions” thing was all about. And failing, just like everything else in Moebius is wont to do.\n\nOh, well. I backed this on Kickstarter; clearly, nobody's perfect.","April 24, 2014","false","7.9"," 115 of 160 people (72%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","72","115","160","12","4"

It’s a real disappointment considering this is Jane Jensen’s newest game. Jensen’s previous games, the Gabriel Knight series and the more recent Gray Matter, were quality written games with likable characters that got you immersed in the games and their stories and are some of the best adventure games around. Moebius is not this, while the basic plot is interesting enough at first the main characters are really bland and the side characters are all horrible people but not in an interesting way. The puzzles are alright for the most part, but the last section of the game is a terrible slog of padding and occasional trial and error puzzles. The graphics aren’t good, but they were on a budget so I can easily forgive it. I didn’t run into any glitches so it’s solidly designed in that regard.\n\nUltimately I don’t really regret buying it, but I wouldn’t recommend it. There are more than enough  recent adventure games that are far better that you could play instead. (Broken Age, the Blackwell Series, Kentucky Route Zero, Gone Home, Walking Dead, and Wolf Among Us just to name a few) Not to mention that you’re also better off playing the Gabriel Knights and Gray Matter, the former you can buy on GOG, the latter on both GOG and Steam. You can do a lot worse when it comes to adventure games so I would only suggest getting this game if you’re really hurting for adventure games and it’s on sale for cheap. Overall though Moebius is just really mediocre and easily forgettable; for the average person I’d say skip it.","April 16, 2014","false","9.6"," 95 of 135 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","95","135","0","0"

If you've played Jensen's previous games (e.g. Gabriel Knight, Gray Matter), then you might have certain (high) expectations.\n\nIf you are a Jane Jensen fan, you probably won't be (too) disappointed. Her signature strengths are mostly here. The game has many flaws, but they will likely be tolerated by most.\n\nAdditionally, if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan, you are even more likely to appreciate this, as there are numerous similarities (e.g. likable antisocial lead with high intelligence and observational prowess, awkward bromance with sidekick).\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Jane Jensen but like adventure games, then (assuming you even exist) this might not be the best place to start unless you can get it cheap. Also, you should be aware that this, like other Jensen stories, are, uh, somewhat "metaphysical" in nature.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dekonega/recommended/264520/","Dekonega","Dekonega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dekonega/","508 products in account","Moebius is an entertaining and decently good point n' click game that lacks a lot of polish. Jane Jensen's story is bit silly but interesting. Robert Holme's music is fantastic but bit repeatitive. The gameplay is little bit disappointing because of the narrow amount of choises you can make. Moebius feels like a simplified and slightly modernized version of those 90s point n' click adventure games that we all grew up with. The length of the game is around 10 to 15 hours for an average player.\n\nI liked the characters in the game and I liked the story. Althought I do have to write that Jane Jensen in past has written better material than this. There're issues with the narrative that feel stupid after you've played the game though. And even during the game you occasionally wonder why certain things had to be done in a particular way.\n\nMoebius is a fairly basic point n' click game that doesn't do anything particularly well or bad. It's like it was made following a googled tutorial on how to make a point n' click adventure game. It doesn't add anything new or even try to challenge the existing concepts.\n\nMost of the puzzles in Moebius are fairly easy to figure out. There's usually only one route to take to a puzzle and only one solution for that puzzle exists. Sometimes the solution is rather unrealistic. To avoid making Moebius a "hidden object" game and to add some realism into it the game doesn't allow you to pick up items or go to some places until the need to do so arises. That leads to an issue where you need to remember place of certain items you previously couldn't pick up. Occasionally there are more challenging puzzles that are well written. The main character also has infinite pockets to stuff things to which I thought was amusing.\n\nTowards the ending of the Moebius started to fell apart. For example (without spoiling anything) the player needs to fly from Washington to New York to pick alcohol from a bar the main character has contantly refused to enter into any given point of time during the game. There's nothing indicating you need to do so. I don't even understand why there couldn't be alcohol store at Washington player could enter. This is done so because main character thought that the antique item in his shop he saw earlier would still be there and that he needed to pick that up for a certain character. This is done based upon observation of that character's tastes. And so upon exiting antique store main character thought that he would also need to bring alcohol seeing the bar on other side of the street. That is some truly horrible game writing and game design in my opinion.\n\nGraphics in Moebius are decent and I like the art style. But this is probably a good point to start talking about the bugs. Moebius has lots of bugs. None of those bugs break the game and they're mostly just visual annoyances. Such as main character is able to stand on certain places he isn't supposed to be able to stand. Or certain water effects are places on surfaces where they shouldn't be. Occasionally the animations have timing problems. Sometimes there are texture related issues such as really low resolution textures. None of the visual issues are dramatically bad. It's just a sign of a lack of polish in Moebius.\n\nMusic and audio is good and there are lots of nice music. However sometimes the main theme just repeats itself so much that it's the only thing you'll remember after you've played the game. This is due the fact that the main theme is also present in various tracks in a suttle ways. So even if I do like the main theme quite a bit, it became an annoyance to hear so often during the game. Sometimes there were audio tracks where the mixing had failed. Voice acting in this game is decently played out.\n\nUser Interface of the Moebius is weird but it works. There are no "verbs" which makes the game easier to play since the game always offers only the actions you can do with various points of interest. Moebius is designed towards people who have little or no experience with point n' click adventure games. The way UI has been designed and the strong hint system in this game reflects that. I also thought it was weird that the game didn't have end results screen despite counting points in a similar manner to the classic Sierra adventure games all which have the end results screen.\n\nTechnically the game works fine most of the time. But being based on top of Unity Engine has all the good things and all the issues that come with the Unity Engine. For example the game has freezing issues on certain hardware. But those can be corrected with a launch parameter. And sometimes the rendering quality is pretty bad.\n\nTo sum things up, Moebius is entertaining game which is fun to play. The story is interesting but sometimes badly written. I liked the main characters and would like to see more of their adventures in the future. Moebius as a game also severely lacks polish and fine tuning. It's worth the cost but it's not outstanding game like Gabriel Knight or Gray Matter.","April 16, 2014","true","16.7"," 43 of 63 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","43","63","0","0"

Then this game is not for you. Do you like demented puzzles and being annoyed out of your pants? Then this game IS for you. Ironically, though, I have no doubt whether to recommend it or not - I enjoyed it, a lot. Guess it's a question of what you're looking for.\n\nIf you're looking for Cesar Bittar, by jove you've found him. It is obviously a game developed solely by him without any involvement of that pesky Jane Jensen whatsoever. Or at least by Phoenix Online, and not by Pinkerton Road at all. Pay attention.\n\nIf you're looking for, say, cool characters, then you should marry it - Malachi and David are amazing, and everything that concerns them is done brilliantly. From the beginning of their friendship through all the shunning of Gretchen to the pointed indifference to Amble it's downright adorable, sincere and applauds-inducing. And man, I love these straight to the point dialogues where characters are saying the most logical things that suit the situation. I can't say enough just how perfectly it is done. It was  a pure enjoyment and a crate of marbles in a world of pervasive bureaucracy and Leisure Suit Larry remakes.\nUnlike everything else in the game.\n\nThe story? Have you heard of the world's silliness contest of '72? Where Helen Slapps was standing on one leg on a frozen turkey with a thrashing fish in her mouth and an open urn of ashes on her head, and playing a triangle? It was waaay less silly than the plot of Moebius.\n\nThe puzzles? Oh, don't even start about the puzzles. When I was flying back to Chicago from New Orleans because I forgot to pack my toothbrush, that was painful. And this game made me relieve the experience. Honestly, the only good thing about them is that they're easier than the ones in The Walking Dead.\n\nThe graphics? You know you have issues when you visit New York, Venice and Zurich, and the only pretty place is still a bar in New York.\n\nThe music? Well, there were some niceish pieces, but nothing comparable to Gray Matter.\n\nThe technical issues? I thought it's good pairing when characters are walking through one another on a regular basis.\n\nI must say, it IS a Jane Jensen's game, mainly meaning that it's amazingly written and tries to tackle metaphysical issues with a healthy dose of excitement and a pinch of old fashioned naivety. It is worth your playthrough. It's good like that. It's just you'll have to put up with its ♥♥♥♥, and there're surprisingly big amounts for a game you can complete in ten hours.\nSo there. Scratch what I said, don't marry it. It will ruin your life.","August 6, 2014","true","15.9"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","28","41","7","0"

Giving succinct but a lot of valuable information in various ways as to never be boring and, if you are like me, learn a lot while having a heap of fun at the same time.\n\nThe storyline background was art history and the unfolding plot was about Moebius Theory (there are the same patterns throughout history, everything repeats itself)\n\nYour character is an antiques dealer who becomes involved with an organisation that wants his insight into a few people.  You investigate each character which have information points, once you collect all the points you solve a puzzle by comparing these character's facts with historical figures.  Along the way, we see how the Moebius Theory unfolds through him personally and the people he is investigating.\n\nEach chapter is usually in a different country, but with only about 2-3 places to visit in each country, you don't get lost and it is very easy to go back and forth via a map if you miss something, thus minimising or eliminating the need for hints (which this game does have) or a walkthrough.  There are a few puzzles but even with the  obligatory maze at the end  there are logical clues.\n\nGlitches in the achievements have been fixed, they all now work.\n\nNow to the not so great:\n-  Artwork - sometimes is in the just OK range\n- The multi-step inventory, I could have done without the 'envelope' icon and just use the interactive icon when I wanted to use an item.\n- Main character is plain 'I want to bonk him in the head' annoying.\n\nHe does improve a bit as gameplay progresses but not quickly enough to care about what happens to him till near the end, where there is a redeemable characteristic.  In Gabriel Knight the main character was a sexist pig at times but he also was a lovable rogue.  Sherlock Holmes was very loyal and really nice to people he found interesting.  House M.D over time, was very loyal and cared in his own way to people in his life.  This game isn't long enough to develop a "House" type character.\n\nOverall I loved it, preferring the storyline and plot over GK and Grey Matter.  Maybe if Jensen had more unlimited funding it would have been a longer more involved game in every way than GK and even Contradiction.   But, it's still a really good game, good puzzles, great plot, dialogue and well worth playing.  I really recommend it.","February 7","true","11.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","4"

It rehashes all the  adventure game tropes and clichés (not in a good way) and much of the puzzle design is flawed or illogical. Most crucially, though,I found myself getting bored with the plot and couldn't care enough to keep playing. I never got to finish the game as much as I wanted to because it felt like a waste of time. It simply wasn't fun or engaging enough. In a genre of games that specializes in storytelling, I'd say that's a big minus. The characters (especially the main character Malachi Rector) are unlikeable, the dialogues are uninspired, and the animation is stilted. For the longest time, I seriously wondered to myself if the main character was supposed to be a hunchback by design because of his very unnatrual-looking posture. It turned out it was just bad character modeling. You'd think they would invest some time and effort in designing him to at least NOT look like a disabled person. He's only the protagonist of the game. That you have to stare at for the ENTIRE duration of the game.\nIn the meantime, I will be eagerly awaiting the arrival of GK 20th Anniversary Edition.\n\nMy verdict: 2/5","August 13, 2014","false","3.7"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","30","47","0","0"

With that being said though, the horrible animation (walking animations, climbing, talking etc.) really takes away from what is quite a decent game to play. I think some of the smaller bugs will be fixed over time (eg: cursor disappearing, skipping dialog causing the characters to move in fast forward etc) but overall the game was enjoyable.\n\nMalachi is not very likeable, the voice actor is really good at what he does in other roles (Omid from Walking Dead Season 1/2) and a few characters from LoL for example but he seemed really flat in this particular role which was disappointing.\n\nIt's not a groundbreaking story to tell but it's definitely a decent one for the genre :)","April 16, 2014","true","6.9"," 38 of 62 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","38","62","0","0"

It’s mature and somewhat relevant to real global events and pulls you right in the mood for a grand mystery.\n* Malachi is a TERRIFIC main character! He’s well-written, multi-dimensional and evolving through the story… (I was hunting for all the hotspots just to hear what he had to say about them!)\n* Another thing about Malachi… His VA (Owen Thomas) hit the role out of the ballpark! His was the best performance in the game by far. He MADE the character, not unlike Tim Curry made Gabriel Knight.\n* David is also a great sidekick to Kye, and there’s a great chemistry between the two.\n* Robert Holmes, again, paired the game seamlessly with a terrific Soundtrack, ranging from mysterious ambient themes to action-packed thrilling rock pieces.\n* The multiple locals are diverse and beautifully rendered and colorful on most chapters.\n* The game is pretty long and will take an average player from 9 to 12 hours to complete, depending on how long you’ll get stuck.\n\nNow to the cons:\n* Some characters’ body proportions and / or postures are way off, too bad one of those characters is the main one.\n* Animations are ranging from mediocre to bad.\n* They are also unbearably slow, esp. when there are multiple animations performed in a row.\n* The music is sometimes too loud and you have to rely on the subtitles. (The prison scene and some movies towards the end come to mind).\n* The subtitles going up from the bottom of the screen and flying out again is annoying and straining on the eyes, especially during short sentences.\n* Some puzzles felt too simple and the game “held your hand” while solving them.

It’s not as bad as many of the reviewers make it sound.\nI want to address a few point I’ve seen in some reviews:\n-This is not as good as Gabriel Knight.\nYes, we all love the GK series, but let’s not forget you had to put tape on a fence to get cat hairs to make into a moustache. Moebius is not GK, it’s different. Both have good and bad points, but it’s unfair to compare a current game with your memory of how good another game was.\n-Malachi is not likeable.\nHe’s human. If you stopped to consider his character and what he has been through and seen, it’s easy to see how he became “not likeable.” I didn’t find this a hindrance to the game at all. More importantly, his character evolves over the course of the game, which is lacking in many games.\n-Animations/graphics/character models suck.\nThey aren’t Final Fantasy graphics, but they serve their purpose. They’re obviously much better than GK3 graphics, and everyone loved that game. Yes, smoother graphics would’ve been nice, but it’s not game-breaking.\n-The game is buggy.\nThere were some bugs. They recently released a patch which was supposed to fix many of them. The bugs I encountered weren’t game breaking; just skipped animations. But personally, I feel that bugs in an adventure game are less forgiving than other genres. You don’t want to feel like “maybe I can’t solve this puzzle because there’s a bug.” So minus points on this lack of polish.\nNow on to the positives:\n+ The story was interesting, and I liked how you had to make connections with historical people. The game (like all of Jensen’s) was well researched and I felt that I came out of the game with new ideas or thoughts, which is more than can be said of many games.\n+ The puzzles were a bit on the easy side, and some were illogical (or just time wasters) but for the most part, they made sense.\nI know I spent more time addressing negatives than adding positives, but overall, I thought the game was good. Not superb, but not half as bad as a lot of the reviews made it sound. There was nothing really ground-breaking with the game, but the story was strong enough to make it worth playing.\n","February 3, 2015","true","8.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

If you aren’t familiar with the name Jane Jensen, she is one of the big names in adventure games from back when adventure games were the showcase genre of the PC who are still working primarily in that  genre.  I don’t want to go all auteur theory, but Jensen’s is important because Moebius is recognizably the kind of game she’s been making for the last couple decades. There’s a pulpy, melodramatic concept and story. There are some continually repeated minigames that are too simplistic but seem like they could be great with a little more work. There’s an annoying maze area that should have been cut entirely from the game. Basically, fans of Gray Matter will probably like this. For those who haven’t played Gray Matter, some more explanation is probably needed.\n\nMoebius is traditional in design, to the point of being predictable.  You pick up objects, and use them on other objects in a, hopefully, logical way to advance the plot. The only change to the standard gameplay is that Moebius only lets you pick things up when the puzzle requiring them has been reached. So you can’t just pick up a boat pole and carry it around for no reason, unlike the kleptomaniacs who starred in the adventure games of old. Occasionally you need to guess passwords, but this is usually done by selecting the password from a drop-down menu, there is one that you enter manually, so the passwords aren’t fundamentally different from finding and using items. The passwords also provided the best example of how the game is too eager to keep thing moving for the puzzles to be really engaging, Late in the game there is a password that involves using cryptography to decode the password hint. You’re provided with various keys and three methods of encryption and decryption to figure out the password.  It could have been an interesting exercise in figuring out how to use the different methods. Instead you’re brought to an interface that applies the encryption for you. All that the player is left to do is apply the cipher and copying down the decrypted message. A shorter way to put it, this is one of maybe three that I’ve managed to complete without a walkthrough.\n\nThe game isn’t all item puzzles and passwords, though. There are two minigames intended to emulate the classic “Sherlock scan” and the comparison of modern and historical people respectively. In the Sherlock Holmes minigame you’re given different qualities of a person, like “shifty eyes,” and then select one of three options for what it tells you about that person. This isn’t inherently a bad idea, but these options always break down the same way. One is an obvious joke option, one is relevant but doesn’t actually relate to a character trait, and one just flat-out tells you some character trait of the person you’re analyzing. Comparing people to historical figures is probably the biggest disappointment of the game. You are given a list of traits and next to each of these traits are the historical figures who had those traits, then you need to figure out which of the historical figures shares the most traits. So if someone has seven traits in common with Eli Whitney and one in common with Chuang Zi, you need to sigh deeply and imagine what could have been. It really should have been an exercise in comparing and contrasting information is instead a test of whether you can count.\n\nThe story is very much in line with the goofy-but-sincere gothic melodrama that Jane Jensen usually does. Malachi Rector (keep in mind that Jensen’s Gray Matter featured a character who wore a literal Phantom of the Opera mask without a trace of irony) is asked by a mysterious quasi-governmental organization named FITA (which was sadly changed from the far more appropriate FIST) to determine if the life of a recently murdered woman resembles any historical figures. After carrying out his mission, he is attacked by ninjas, who photograph his passport, and finds out that he is the center of various conspiracies and so it goes. I don’t want to expand on the plot too much, because people hate spoilers. I will say that if you’re a fan of Jorge Louis-Borges, you might be disappointed, as it’s nothing as clever as that. It is a very entertaining pulp sci-fi story that has a lot of genuinely well done moments, and runs with its central conceit fairly well. I really thought the story was a strong point of the game, except for one problem.\n\nThe problem with the story is Malachi Rector. He is a whiny, entitled, self-righteous, narcissistic, judgmental prick. They were obviously trying to emulate the BBC Sherlock, with Malachi as the insufferable genius who everyone needs despite his grating personality. They even tried to emulate the look of the BBC Sherlock in many of the cutscenes, with floating text to represent Malachi’s analysis of the situation. The BBC Sherlock has a couple of advantages, however. First, that has Watson around to look at the camera and sympathize with the viewer, and, second, Sherlock is not the viewpoint character and you get an occasional break from him. The Watson in Moebius is so bland I’ve entirely forgotten his name and Malachi is the viewpoint character for most of the game, which means almost everything the game tells you is passed along by him; this is a problem when most people will want to punch Malachi in the face every time he speaks. I don’t think it kills the story completely. If you keep in mind that he’s supposed to be unlikeable, it’s actually hilarious what a ♥♥♥♥♥ he is.\n\nGraphically, it’s exactly what you see on the screenshots and video above. It’s got a nice stylized design intended to conceal the low quality of the models, the animation is a little off at times. Overall, I think it works well, when it works. The engine for Moebius, like Cognition, the previous game from this Phoenix Online, has a tendency to suddenly pitch a fit every so often and the character models starts flopping around, an absent character remains a hot spot in the level, or the game just locks up. I don’t want to exaggerate this too much, I had four or five noticeable issues in the nine hours I spent playing the game. Three were cosmetic and only one, when the game locked up, required me to restart the game from an earlier save. I’d advise you to save often, though, in case the game does suddenly freeze on you.\n\nTo sum up, I may have accentuated the negative a little too much here. Moebius is a nicely traditional, if overly easy, point and click adventure game with an interesting plot that is partly kneecapped by unlikeable characters, oversimplified puzzles, and the occasional bugs. That sounds bad when you put them all together like that, but I really do recommend it if you like the genre. If you’re not a fan of point and click adventure games, this probably isn’t the best place to start. Maybe try the Blackwell games or Gemini Rue or something first.\n","August 27, 2014","true","9.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

She made very interesting puzzles at the time, and some terrible ones, but the end result always won.\nNow, she comes back with a kickstarter project that begun in 2012 and came up in 2014, this time working independent, with little money of course, and a new small team of game devs called Phoenix online.\n\nThe truth be told, when i first tried the game, the first impression was pretty shocking, and not in a good way... Of course this is a small team working, with a tiny budget, but still there are some things that can't be justified just because having little money. What i mean is, the first impression was bad, and yes, i am talking about the graphics first, because that's one of the first things that you take from a game, but its not the only thing, also the game was bad (aparently) meaning the puzzles, and even the main character was bad, alltough this could be atributed to his akward way of walking (little joke there).\n\nThe thing is, the game starts to make some sense some time around the end of the third chapter (almost half of the whole game). The story starts to come around, there's this theory of moebius, of the pattern and these special persons (no spoilers here) and then the main character starts to develop, he becomes more interesting, he's having weird dreams and visions and it somehow relates to what is hapenning in the main story. The great music of Robert Holmes (creator of the gabriel knight soundtrack) comes in full force here, like in old times having some great moments, specially during the revelation moments. The puzzles, about analizing patterns and people starts to emerge  and it's something interesting to try and adds to the game. The graphics, still ugly, get somehow much more better, in terms of finishing and polish. It's like the game almost changes around the second half, and then you arrive at the last part of the game and all that diminishes somehow and you encounter the same problems, and the samethings from the first half.\n\nAnd that's the problem, right there, a double problem. First, you have no consistency. Because , i liked this game (in parts) , meaning at first i didn't like it, then yes, and then no. So, it's like i've been playing two different games in one. So you have great elements, interesting story, great music, some interesting puzzles, but not at first, and not at the end, so when the game starts you don't really want to play it that much, then if you have patience you reach the good part, and then...in the end, you are left with a bad impression, again.\n\nThe second problem with this game is that, ive played it because i like (and knew) about past jane jensen's adventures, and i know what she is able to do in a game, and that's why i even continued playing this one after the start (and i did get my reward, i like this game) but if i didn't knew jane jensen was behind it i've probably wouldn't have tried it, and i don't see how people who are new to her would get interested in an adventure like this.\n\nIt's a shame because i love adventure games, and i want to see the genre succeed (and it is coming back in these last years) but not with games like this. The genre has to move forward, have great production values have great game mechanics, be modern, be fun to everybody, played by everybody, not only hardcore adventure gamers (without stop being and adventure game), like for example the Sherlock Holmes games by frogwares.\n\nI liked Moebius, but i don't think it will appeal to people outside those who played old adventures games  (you can try fellow newcomer, but , you are warned)\n\nIt's a shame also, because to be honest, this game's story has great potential, and i see why jane jensen would like to continue it. In fact, her previous adventure game from 2010, Gray matter, didn't have as good a story as this , and funnily enough, that game had better graphics than this one. But Moebius has in fact a greater a story, one that it has certain moments that are more close in spirit to the 90s era with gabriel knight. Even the music is more close to the Gabriel knight series.\nI have to say, in the end i liked moebius better than Gray matter. Moebius is a better game because it has heart in it, and it is more a jane jensen game than gray matter will ever be.\n\nI can't recommend this game to everybody, but i like it, and that's why the positive thumbs up calification.\nI would say that, from 2014, this was possibly the best story for and adventure game. but not the best game by far.\n(see my other reviews for the best adventure from 2014)","March 23","true","21.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The result?\n\nContrived writing and formulaic characters (not exactly surprising if you've read that Jensen interview on Gamasutra...), mostly vapid ideas, some daft puzzles, but clearly the most eminent problem lies with the Holmes deduction process analogue mechanic: it probably sounded a great idea on paper, in practice the solution is either a) blatantly obvious, akin to compiling a simple form b) total guesswork: "what did they have in mind when putting together this trope-y character?"\n\nThe execution looks budget, with the usual issues stemming from the use of 3D characters; it's not intolerable, more like excusable, what with the KS campaign having raised slightly more than 400 grand, but definitely noticeable. At some point the game was updated to Unity 5, and it appears the job was likely done hurriedly, leaving behind very obvious bugs. There's also some blurry textures here and there.\n\nNoteworthy: while the game is under most respects almost exactly what you would expect from a modern adventure in terms of general experience, it does bring back some old fashioned design decisions nobody really missed in the first place; in one instance, it combines them like inventory items to unleash maximum mayhem on the unsuspecting player: the Rubber Tree lesson went out of the window here in favor of a throwback to the heyday of Sierra, and there's no manner of autosaving or checkpointing, so it's definitely possible to be forced into replaying a whole chapter (or two). If you hated Resonance for not saving close enough to the ending, this one may elicit long strings of insults.\n\nNevertheless, I couldn't muster a real dislike for the game; it shares elements with Cognition, and indeed many Phoenix people have worked on this one as well; but past the opening and on to the second episode, that one already seemed a better game than Moebius.\n\nI would only recommend this game to specific types of players: the indie adventure game renaissance train may have made a short stop at this station, however, it has also long left the platform.","March 30","false","18.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

(David's joke? Ha-Ha-Not-So-Much)\n\n3) The BGM is definitely a good part of the game. The music for opening credits was stunning.\n\n(-)And wut's lacking in this game.\n\n1) Character Modelling. Can it be more obvious? The way ppl walk and stand is ultra stiffy and awkward.\n\n2) Item Interactions. The problem is that when u find something that might come in handy, Malachi will tell u he doesn't need it right now, and u have to perform certain moves to set off the "flag" then take the item to solve a miny puzzle, this way is quite absurd, since Malachi can take plenty of things with him, y can't he just take it when he sees it? (And don't get me started on he actually put a LANTERN into his suit's pocket...\n\n\n(?)And in-between, let's talk about some controversial parts.\n\n1) The Concept. To me, the concept is unique, and not unique at all. Sure, the Moebius Theory is quite intriguing, but the execution lacks novelty, just find someone with historical importance and create a modern doppleganger, wut's creative about that?\n\n2) The characters. I like the two starring roles, I can literally cut the tension between Malachi and David, sometimes i'm even yelling to the screen "Just get over your UST you two".\nStill many ppl thinks the characters are too shallow, I think the issue is that the characters are not meant for us to immerse to. If i recall corectly, there was a place that Malachi directly address to the PLAYER saying something similar to "I can lift my leg that high, but I'd kill YOU" Who's that YOU? The PLAYER is. Seems that the writer are telling us we are just playing the role of puppet masters and controlling the two characters. It's more like an interactive book than a role-play game. I'm fine with it, but a lot of ppl would/will not.\n\n3) The game-play. I have to say it is not satisfying. It's too mediocre.\nFor Hardcore fans, this game is seriously lacking level of difficulty. Nothing in the game is challenging or brain-wrecking.\nAnd for casual players, the story is not that great either. So wut,  [i'll spare the spoilers here] blah blah blah so the two start competing against each other and played a game called "Let's See Who Can Find A Historical Doppleganger First - Wanna-bes Don't Count Edition"? Yeah, funny. And let aside the fact they used chinese as a disguise, and I'm Chinese. Do i feel offended? Meh... and do I find the idea fascinating? You gotta be kidding me.\nBut nevertheless, the turning in plots is somewut impressive, but doesn't stand out either.\n\nFor a price of 30 bucks, i'm really looking forward for more. Perhaps a free sequel?

Short anwser: Yes, and I wouldn't recommend it. Long answer, see below.\n\nThere will be spoilers below.\n\nThe game starts out fine, if a bit odd that Malachi would go investigate a murder victim when his specialty by all accounts is evaluating artifacts and antiques, but I'll go with it. The puzzles are fine for the most part (if we ignore the end of the game, more on that below), the only real gripe being a safe code that is the date a newspaper article was written about a character's parents' divorce. Let's assume it makes sense to have some attachment to the day your parents announced publicly they were getting divorced, why would you then use the date from a newspaper story about the announcemen, which was presumably written at least a day later? Did the character get really attached to the newspaper article?\n\nBut that's relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. The real problem with this game is the story and characters. The story has the potential to be interesting, but is executed terribly. Character motivations are never really apparent, because you don't really know anything about them. No real attempt is made to make anyone likable, even Malachi. Some might say this was intentional with Malachi, but that's just silly. If you can't like the character you're supposed to be, then you have no real emotional stake in what he or she is trying to do. Even anti-heroes are made to be likeable or at least developed to invoke some amount of empathy. Not here.\n\nThe point when I went from finding this game mediocre to bad came fairly late in chapter 6, though. At one point you are required to seduce and then hold a knife to a woman's throat to get information from her. That was just vile. If the point was to make me loathe Malachi and Moebius, it was succesful. This is all followed up by a fairly simple but boring, boring, boring maze. The maze is broken up by an even more boring puzzle where you click on pictures that might be related to the location you are in. Then you are "treated" to a rather anti-climactic cutscene that ends on somewhat of a cliffhanger.\n\nThe character models and animations are bad, but that's not something that really concerned me. If there was a good game underneath I would easily look past that. Sadly, there isn't.\n\nI don't really think I'll be paying Moebius 2 and I would recommend you don't bother with Moebius 1.","April 30, 2014","false","12.6"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

The 'strained' relationship between the two main characters can easily be explained with a bit of human insight.\n\nThis game really starts off on the wrong foot. Everything, but the characters, looks nice and it takes quite awhile to get used to the poor lip syncing, wandering eyes, animations and pauses, but once you are past that it's quite entertaining and chuckle worthy on occassion. The puzzles are generally pretty straightforward and even though you can't pick up anything before you actually need it, which is a really bad design choice imo, it isn't really that interruptive to gameplay, which can also be alleviated by using the location travel from the toolbar and movement in areas by the double-clicking teleportation.\n\nI had to turn off music (volume down) after 10 minutes, because it was giving me a headache. I recommend using space a lot to highlight points of interest - I didn't do that in the beginning and I missed an item and was stuck for an hour. The hint system is pretty useless, completely unlike the spectacularly userfriendly one from Broken Sword: The Serpents Curse. I only got one analysis wrong (Caroline Aflfonse) and had to check online for mismatches, because I was dead sure about some mismatches, which wasn't shared by game logic.\n\nI spend around 25 hours on this game due to some mistakes, that "interrupted the pattern" followed by clicking on the wrong button (I clicked on Load and realized that the game had made no autosaves, no progress saves and that I generally had forgotten to save any games beyond the intermissions) and the game also crashed on me once. "Retry" is the key to use and saving in general is a good idea, unless you like repetitious gaming.\n\nI would rate this game 7/10, because of bad design choices, poor lip syncing, wandering eyes, weird movements, annoying pauses, jittery animations and a general lack of polish. Had those things been fixed I would have rated it about 8.5/10, because despite the glaring faults it's actually a pretty good game with some interesting new points of Adventure and story-telling.","June 22, 2014","true","26.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

(Not to be confused with reincarnation where it is the actual person that is born again not just his/her story). Example: Mozart's bio goes something like this; wrote his first piece before the age of ten, marries at age twenty, has two children, lives the life of a pauper, and dies in his mid thirties unexpectedly of an acute infection. Now in the present time Malachi Rector (the main character) will attempt through his extensive knowledge of history and observation skills to find the one person that could fit that profile. He is hired by a top secret organization to do just that.( It isn't Mozart but the bios are of people you as the player would recognize).\n\nSome of the characters might not be likable but all are interesting especially Malachi. I am reminded of a certain late nineteenth century character a flawed but brilliant private detective. It is David his bodyguard that gives Malachi a touch of humanity or should I say a bit of compassion for David is everything Malachi is not,\n\nThere were times when I got frustrated because some of the solutions  to the puzzles didn't follow a logical and  intuitive conclusion.

(MAY HAVE SPOILERS)\n\nthe good:\n- fun gameplay\n- nice art\n- detailed settings and characters\n- nice dialogue\n- decent gameplay pacing\n- fun story to unravel\n- user-friendly\n- parts of the gameplay can be pretty comical, like how obviously stupid the NPC's can be :P\n- original "analysis" game mechanic is pretty cool\n\nthe bad:\n- buggy at times (maybe they'll do some patches?)\n- the 3D animation and meshes are a bit wonky\n- to me, this game doesn't top Jane Jensen's best older games\n- I don't know about the Chekhov's Gun game mechanic -- to me that just means more time taken wandering around just to get items you could have taken earlier\n\nHere's my "essay" version of my review.\n\nI really enjoyed playing through this game. It's hard enough for me to want to look at an online walkthrough here and there, but easy enough for me to figure out how to move further into the game without a walkthrough, most of the time. I really like the analysis mechanic. It's a different way of learning about people, objects and the story.\n\nI have some complaints though. Game design-wise, I wouldn't readily praise the "Chekhov's Gun" take on collecting items. In the end, it just means "oh there's an item I need, but I can't take it now but I will later and take a jumbo jet to come back for it..." it seems arbitrary to me. Is this to save space in your inventory? *shrug*\n\nStory-telling-wise, this game was alright. I really liked the mystery. I never gave a second thought to the meaning of the title for the past two years, long after I'd helped fund the kickstarter for it. But I'm glad I didn't give it a second thought, because it helped in creating a positive gameplay experience. The text appearing as a way of telling us Malachi's thought processes? I've seen very few other pieces of entertainment that use this method of telling us what the character's thinking... and the only other place I've seen it is in the TV series Sherlock. I get pretty bothered when a creative piece is being this blatantly obvoius about borrowing, if in fact this is what happened.\nThere isn't nearly as much shock and twists in this story as I would have liked. There's way more intensity in Gabriel Knight, for example... and wasn't that how Jane Jensen was advertising Moebius? So that we'd have another game that's like Gabriel Knight? (I'm thinking of Sins of the Fathers).\n\nAs for the art, the 2D art is pretty nice. But there's a lot of inconsistency and distracting wonkiness to the way the 3D models react to their animations, as well as the animations themselves. The first time I saw Malachi's walk cycle from the front, for example, I complained about it out loud.\n\nI'm not asking for every creative piece to have "top notch" graphics, whatever that means. Someone decided to have this game use 3D characters and objects... so it's going to bother me if Gretchen's upper arm bends completely the wrong way as she's drinking her martini, unless it was completely intentional. My only expectation is *consistency,* no matter what style of graphics is chosen. This is one of the reasons why I sorely miss the old game graphics from Jane Jensen games... like that of Gabriel Knight or King's Quest VI.","April 20, 2014","true","11.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

In true Jane Jensen fashion (famous for the Gabriel Knight series and Gray Matter), this is a game that holds true to her style. Intrigue, danger, a mystery that spans centuries, and even the occasional bit of lighthearted humour make themselves known throughout this seven chapter epic. There are even some romantic undertones for the observant to pick up. The music and voice acting are top notch, the backgrounds are beautiful, and the story and dialogue gripping. The only real negative point that I can make here is that the animations could use a bit of touch-up.

But not too short. The ending kind of fizzled though. It wasn't a cliff hanger exactly but to me was suggestive of the possibilty of a sequel (which I think is uncertain to even happen). Or perhaps they just ran out of money and that's why it ended so suddenly.\n\nThe plot and world building are excellent. The idea of archetypal characters recurring through history and the main character being able to deduce this and solve related mysteries is a really cool and could potentially yield countless adventures. The interface for deucing things is fine. At first it seems great but eventually it can be rather frustrating. Or infuriating for some, as I have come to learn. Those parts were hilarious to me though. It's a really funny game.\n\nThe main character is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But a well developed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think he was intentionally constructed as an antithesis of Gabriel Knight. Not to say Gabriel Knight isn't an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he is, they're just opposite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Perhaps I'm drawing conclusions though since I played through that game right before this one.\n\nThe game is kind of buggy. An item, the cryptology book, would not appear in game. That did not hinder progression though. I did get stuck in a rather hilarious endless death cycle though. Unfortunately that resulted in having to replay a good 15-20 minutes, so I advise you to save going into each new scene.\n\nSo yeah, it's good.

It wasn't a terrible way to spend my time, but I wouldn't describe it as a good game and I wouldn't recommend it unless you really have nothing else you'd like to be playing. The feel of the game overall was very unpolished, and while I could forgive the aesthetics not being perfect, things like the animations were not only stiff and unrealistic, but they were very slow and you'd have to just sit watching the characters slowly and awkwardly move around while waiting for them to do what you told them too. In the instances when it was unclear exactly what you were supposed to be doing and I was having to repeat certain actions multiple times trying to get things right it got very frustrating.\n\nThey did try to do some interesting things with the point-and-click genre, for example, you couldn't just pick up everything you'd eventually need right when you first encountered it if there was no reason for you to be carrying that thing around, so you'd often have to remember where you saw something useful and go back for it, and it seemed to work out pretty well most of the time. There was also the analyzing of people to learn more about them, which mimicked the BBC TV show, Sherlock. That was clever at first, but it mostly ended up with things either being obvious or else needing to guess randomly. They also relied a lot on stereotypes, and it got kind of insulting at times, especially towards women as it seemed like half the women were vain and out to get a man, often the protagonist, Malachi Rector. Malachi thinks pretty lowly of most people, but his generally insulting attitude combined with the use of negative stereotypes about beautiful women, various tropes like women getting fridged or damseled, and the women in the game almost all being puzzles or tools to use to solve a puzzle, including sometimes in a sexualized manner, was pretty disappointing. Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers wasn't exactly great in its treatment of women, but there were more interesting and diverse female characters around, even if Gabriel himself was a bit of a womanizer, and I had hoped that Jane Jenson was capable of writing protagonists who didn't objectify women so much and that this game would have been able to show better gender representation than a game from the 90s. And while I'm on representation, Malachi and David's relationship borders dangerously on queer baiting.\n\nOverall, there were some good moments in this game, and I didn't hate it, but mostly I felt that it fell short and that there were elements that could use quite a bit of improvement in every aspect of the game. If a sequel were made I definitely wouldn't get it right away, but I would see what people have to say about it and find out if they've made enough improvements to make it worthwhile.","September 21, 2014","false","11.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mKrogh/recommended/264520/","mKrogh","NevaKee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mKrogh/","332 products in account","TL;DR the story has potential, but suffers from mediocre dialog, and flat characters. The animations and character graphics are bad. The puzzles are varied with some interesting mechanics, but not necessarily hard. It has a solid length.\n\nRecommended to people who really like adventures and people who can get past some bad dialog.\n\nWell backed the game on kickstarter, played through it.. The graphics are rather bad (or the characters are), and the animations are awful.\n\nThat would be ok if the story was solid, but it really isn't. The idea is good, the premise is ok, but the execution and dialog is medicore. Well the dialog is at times really bad, corny and too predictable.\n\nThe characters are awkward but not in a good way, and they are rather two dimensional and uninteresting. I'm reminded of the scientist Joshua from the Runaway series, though perhaps not that irritating (really felt that it hurt runaway 2 that he had a more prominent role).\n\nThe protagonist Malachi is not very likable, but that is intentional. He suffer from bland/poorly executed character development. It is a bit like the classic windows progress bar, it comes in weird chunks and it is not entirely sure how far it has to go. The character development is a classic "Taming of the Shrew", but then again what isn't.\n\nThe interaction between characters are bland and lack depth. There is a weird chemistry between the main characters, which "left unexplained" but with rather heavy suggestions. I would have prefered if the story either had aimed at Watson/Holmes buddies relation,  or a more serious approach with deeper meaning.\n\nThe FITA and the baddie seems like they have been slapped together in a hurry, as they do not offer much other than trying to frame the story.\n\nThe story is rather predictable once the scene is set, with a few twists here and there. The last chapter feels both rushed and drawn out, especially the last puzzle since the highlight feature is turned off and it suffers from the slow transitions between scenes.\n\nI found the puzzles in general to be quite nice, with good variations. I did get stuck a couple of times which is nice enough, but for the most part they were pretty straight forward. Some of the puzzles does suffer a bit from "no that is not the right order" syndrome. Such as why do I need to climb an object in order to get to the object i'm interested in, especially as Malachi says "I need to climb box first", please just do it. It is however just minor inconveniences.\n\nI really like the compare/analyze historical people mechanic, that is the guess who this person is puzzles, not the overly negative, shallow and nonsensical "look at that tramp" analysis of the characters in order to get the obvious clue for conversations.\n\nThe historical comparison is a nice mechanic, and there are a lot of interesting historical facts in them , well also some mythical "facts".  It worked for me all the way up until the last part of the game, where the historical characters began to be too modern, and not enough "space" to support the idea behind the moebius pattern.\n\nSome reviews on the net talks about game breaking glitches, I did not run into any, but the slow and glitchy animations were a nuisance at times.\n\nThe music is quite good and provide a nice ambiance.\n\nAll in all Moebius has a lot of interesting ideas and mechanics, but suffer from poor execution, shallow characters and not enough polish. As a point and click adventure game there are two areas you should focus on, the story, the characters and the puzzles, and both characters and story feel rough.\n\nI do not regret having backed the game, but do hope that Pinkerton Road will listen to the critique and do better with their next game(s) because the potential is there.  I know it was created on a tight budget, and for that I can forgive a lot of things and i would probably score it at 5/10 leaning at 6/10 due to the analysis puzzles.","April 25, 2014","false","10.8"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

I will copy and paste my posted review and link to the actual post, because I am not doing this for our site traffic but rather to review this title.\n\nToday, Phoenix Online Publishing has released their highly-anticipated mystery adventure game Moebius: Empire Rising for both the PC and Mac.  The mind behind this title is Jane Jensen who launched a very successful Kickstarter campaign to back this project and deliver a very entertaining title to her fans.  Jane is a veteran of the gaming industry and mastermind behind amazing adventure-based plots.  Her company, Pinkerton Road, teamed up with the indie team at Phoenix Online Studios on this project.  Moebius: Empire Rising is available through their online store for purchase or via Steam.  Later this year, the game will release for Android, iOS and Linux platforms as well.  The game is also available for Demo if you just want to check it out before buying it.  For an “official” description, here is part of the press release from Phoenix Online Publishing:\n\nA sophisticated, story-driven interactive thriller, Moebius: Empire Rising is the first in an original\nseries of titles from renowned game designer and novelist Jane Jensen. Her award-winning\nGabriel Knight adventures have been ranked among the best games of all-time, and her 2003\nsci-fi novel Dante’s Equation was nominated for the Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ award. After nearly a decade\ndesigning casual games based on franchises such as Agatha Christie and James Patterson’s\nWomen’s Murder Club, Jensen appealed to her fans on Kickstarter and crowdfunded more than\n$435k to make Moebius: Empire Rising. These funds were used to develop the game in\npartnership with indie team Phoenix Online Studios, which is publishing the title under its new\npublishing label.\n\nMoebius is the story of Malachi Rector, a brilliant antiques dealer and historian whose\nphotographic memory and eye for deduction transforms locations and clues into interactive\npuzzle pieces and historical patterns.A secretive government agency has tapped Malachi for an\nunusual assignment: fly to Venice and assess whether a recently murdered woman resembles a\nparticular historical figure. As Malachi soon learns, this seemingly innocuous request is linked to\na powerful paranormal theory the U.S. government will protect at any cost—and the more he\ndiscovers, the greater danger he faces.\n\nEnter David Walker, a former Special Forces operative Malachi randomly encounters in his\ntravels. David’s exactly the wingman Malachi needs: calm under pressure, an experienced\nbodyguard, and good with a gun. In fact, the typically distrustful Malachi can’t shake the feeling\n\nOk, now that all of the official stuff is out of the way…you want to know what I thought of the game, right?  I was generously granted a review copy of the game, via Steam, and spent in excess of 15 hours playing it.  It’s a single-player title that supports both Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards.  I was able to work my way through the entire game during that time and really only found myself “stuck” in a couple areas.  My first impressions of the game were that the cut scenes were very well done and while they can be skipped, I would recommend sitting through them to really get a feel for the story.  If you’ve read the prologue comic (if not, go read the damn prologue comic) it will also help set the table a little for the game.  One thing I enjoyed about the cut scenes along with the story line is it made the game feel very much like an interactive comic book.  That is not to say it’s graphically set that way, it isn’t.  The story line however was very well done and engaging.  The other major thing that I noticed straight off was the soundtrack.  I am serious when I say, it may be one of the better soundtracks that I have experienced in any game I have ever played.  The music was spot on with the story and really added to the overall feel.  It was clear from the beginning that there was a lot of thought put into this.  I found myself feeling like I was not only playing some sort of interactive comic book but rather watching a novel develop before my eyes.\n\nYou play the majority of the game as Malachi, who will come off as a brash and pompous pretty boy for the most part.  Malachi possesses several talents, some of which I will not spoil for you but the main talent being that he has an amazing ability to analyze situations and details.  This serves him well as part of the antique business that he owns and where he makes his money.  I will admit, this is typically not my genre of gaming.  I am normally an FPS or RPG type guy, but I also enjoy games involving puzzles.  This is what intrigued me so much about this title, solving puzzles.  I found that throughout the course of this game, up until the ending cut scenes, I was really learning to shape the way I was thinking in-game.  Once I started looking for those minor details that would eventually get me past an area, I was hooked.  It’s a game where attention to detail is key and decision making is crucial.\n\nAs Malachi makes his way through the story, I found myself liking him more than I did when the game began.  I am sure this was by design.  The other main character is David Walker, a former Special Forces operator who Malachi eventually teams up with.  The two character’s couldn’t be more dissimilar and I thought David was a great addition to the story and game.  As a matter of fact, once David was introduced to the game, I found myself laughing a lot more throughout the story and conversations they would have.  I won’t spoil anything, but do yourself a favor and listen to David’s corny jokes.  By solving puzzles, analyzing people with detailed dossiers and web searches as well as choosing the right topics and questions to present to other characters you progress through the game and often affect certain paths.  That is not to say it’s a “choose your own adventure” style game (my God I just dated myself) but there are situations that can go one way or another based on actions/dialogue.  Some of the puzzles may seem a little mundane but I will say that some really made me think, and a couple of them had me simply stumped.  The game also offers the ability to turn hints on or off, and there is an achievement for completing the game without them on at all.\n\nOverall, I started the game admittedly skeptical because it just wasn’t my typical genre.  What I was left with was a very great appreciation for the time put into the game and just how engaging it ended up being.  For someone that likes a solid story combined with thought-provoking puzzles and situations, this game is fantastic.  Add in extremely well put together cut scenes and an incredible soundtrack and I would say that for $29.99, you’d have a winner on your hands.  Honestly, aside from some moderately corny dialogue and wonky walking animations, I couldn’t find any significant flaws with the game.  There is no current DLC plan for Moebius: Empire Rising but I will be surely keeping an eye out for some or any new titles from this publisher and studio.\n\nIn the end, I would give Moebius: Empire Rising 4.5 out of 5 Pink Cows.\n\nSource: http://tailgate365.com/2014/04/moebius-empire-rising-review/","April 15, 2014","true","15.4"," 27 of 53 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","27","53","0","0"

Yes, the animation leaves a lot to be desired, there are noticeably long pauses waiting for an action sometimes, and the lip syncing makes the characters look somewhat scary at times...\n\nHowever, despite all that, I don't just recommend this game for adventure fans, I wholeheartedly recommend it!\n\nIt's strange to me that so many reviews on here have panned the story and the puzzles in this game. The puzzles weren't overly difficult, but I didn't feel they were bland either. They matched the tone of the game, never felt forced or shoehorned in, and were quite fun.\n\nPerhaps, as a fan of the fantastic, I have less problems with the primary conceit of the story (the Moebius idea), and as a history buff I found the idea far more intriguing than a lot of people might. What I can say is that it's the first adventure game in a long time that has held me glued to the screen until I finished the entire thing.\n\nThe mystery is intriguing, the main character is surpringly likeable given his personality, and he comes across very much like a modern day sherlock holmes. In fact, the little analysis puzzles that pop up through the game attached to people or objects give the game the best "sherlockian" feel of any game i've played - including the sherlock holmes games themselves.\n\nOverall, highly recommended.","May 18, 2014","true","10.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You will soon find out that your abilities are far more specialized with a secret organization calls on you to find someone, but here's the twist, it is the reincarnation of a famous historical figure. Will you be able to take on the challenges presented in front of you, how deep does the conspiracy that you have unearth go, and will you be able to trust anyone who crosses your path?\n\nGraphically this game looked decent, there were definitely some animation issues which made a character appear to be limping around the screen, and there were also issues of colision with the background which was really just a picture and not geometry. I did like the different character models, they definitely gave life to the characters, but the facial movements left much to be desired. There were several times where characters were talking through their teeth, and there were times where the movements looked over dramatic to try to add additional effect.\n\nI did really like the music that went with the game, there was always a slightly different flavor when you went to different places, as well as a main theme that you could find either in the main menu or between chapters.\n\nThe controls are pretty straightforward you are going to be point and clicking with your mouse. Now I highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the arrow and target icon that can be found in the menu system that you can pull up from the top left of the screen, clicking on this icon will allow you to see all possible objects you can interact with. Oddly though there are a couple of places where when you are just trying to find the exit, and there's nothing else to interact with you can't find the exit.\n\nSo you are playing a Malachi a pill popping, overly dramatic, character who is a brainiac. One could say that he is a Sherlock Holmes type of character that does not give a lick about crime, and what is going on in the world as long as it does not interfere with his day. There was definitely a little bit of a soap opera feel to some of the parts, and there were some stereotypical characters that were thrusted into the story. You are going to go on many different adventures, but at the end of the day this game is STRICTLY an origins story. You don't really get your feet wet with what this franchise can do, which is unfortunate because I felt that the story had finally picked up to where I not only needed to play the next chapter, but had to. The thing that basically puts a nail in this game's coffin is the fact that the title never makes sense by the end of the game.\n\nSo at the end of the day, this game falls a little bit flat with a couple of faults sprinkled throughout the game. If you like a good mystery point and click adventure, this would be a good starting point but it will not satisfy the hunger you are looking to feed. I will say this though, I CANNOT wait to see the next chapter of this game, and I hope it comes sooner than later. This game gets a 6.7 out of 10.","June 1, 2014","true","11.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Δεν είναι επ' ουδενί κάλπικο,, αλλά δεν ανταποκρίνεται σ' όσα αρχικά υπόσχονταν η εικόνα και η φήμη του…\n\nMoebius: Empire Rising bears a resemblance to an expensive item, like the ones its protagonist values. While initially it seems extremely valuable, even though it comes in a not so beautiful package, in the end it appears to be of not so high value.

The writing is sometimes a bit cheesy, and every character is unlikeable, with far too little done to bring you around by the end. Some of the puzzle solutions are laughably ridiculous, and both recurring puzzle mechanics are irritating at best, semi-random at worst. The tech really needs a lot of polishing: Character animation is almost universally terrible, the interface is buggy, inconsistent, or simply non-intuitively designed, and character models don't even begin to look human, much less realistic or evocative. (Seriously, have you ever met anybody with fingers that long? There's not a single person in this entire game whose fingers are less than eight inches long.) Also, it's shortish (around 10-15 hours) with a lot of loose plot ends at the end, which makes it feel more like an "episode" (or a few episodes) of a seasonal game than like a full game.\n\nHowever, the game mostly succeeds despite itself, and I played it pretty much exclusively through from beginning to end. The puzzles for the most part are followable with very little "just try everything together" (with the exception of the observing-a-person puzzle mechanic, which often does devolve into just trying every combination). The story is interesting, and as much as the characters may not necessarily be likeable, you do get caught up in wanting to know what happens to them, to at least some degree.\n\nI think I hoped for a lot more when I backed and when I bought this game, but what I got was still enjoyable, and I think that if you're interested in this type of game (point and click graphical adventures), it's definitely worth playing. Jensen is also clearly setting this up as the first in a series, so it would behoove you to get in on the ground floor.\n\nOne last note is that if anything one of the largest disappointments came, oddly, during the end credits, where you get to see artists' mock-ups of the various characters. They universally fit the characters much better than the clunky mess that the implemented character models wound up being. It made me long to have played *that* game, with those characters.\n\nI feel like Pinkerton Road's standards did bring this game up above the standard Phoenix Online fare, but I really think that if the two continue to partner together and work together, they have to strive for better.","April 22, 2014","true","14.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

As I backed this game on Kickstarter, I obviously really wanted to like it. Sadly… I didn’t.\n\nIn Moebius, you play Malachi Rector, a brilliant antiques appraiser whose social skills are lacking. Malachi is hired by a mysterious organization to do a mysterious job which takes him all over the world. As you get deeper into the story (minor spoilers alert) you find out what you’re actually doing. The group Malachi is working for believes in a “Moebius pattern” where the lives of people in history are being repeated in the present. They hire Malachi to find key historical figures who could bring about an era of stability and prosperity. Basically. Summarizing the plot to this game in a coherent manner was harder than expected.\n\nThe game does have some good things going for it. I did find the game occasionally enjoyable, especially at the beginning. The dialogue was decent, as was most of the voice acting. The background images were pretty and the music was good – very evocative of Gabriel Knight. There were also some unique kinds of puzzles. As your main objective in the game was to relate people to historical figures, one of the main puzzle types was matching up their characteristics. This was both interesting and educational, though once I had done it a couple of times, I figured out that just guessing was often quicker than reading though all the information.\n\nMy favourite feature of the game was a button that highlights all objects on the screen that could be interacted with. While using this could be considered easy-mode, I found it incredibly useful. Pixel-hunting for objects is not something I’m interested in doing, and this was totally prevented.\n\nThere were a few things that started out as positives, but turned into negatives. Adventure games are often far out there in terms of reality and physics. Adventurers often walk around with shovels, coffee tables and iron statues in their overcoats. Where do they put them? In this game, the protagonist often refused to pick things up until he saw a need for them. At first, I applauded that. Why would you walk around with a can of motor oil? But after a while, it got very frustrating. For example, at one point I needed to get into the VIP tent at a political rally. In order to lift a pass off someone I needed to go back to my apartment to pick up an mp3 player I hadn’t been able to pick up earlier. Once I used that to bribe someone to be a distraction I needed to go back to the apartment again to pick up some scissors. When I successfully stole the pass and had to go back to my office to get some superglue that I also was unable to pick up before. Then back to the rally to get into the tent. That’s a lot of back and forth that could have been avoided. Not picking up every single item in sight makes sense, but as it turns out, that kind of realism in video games is not a great idea. “How irritating” Malachi remarks. Tell me about it.\n\nItems and inventory use wasn’t all bad though. I enjoyed that you were never overloaded with items and there weren’t any nonsensical item combination puzzles. No cat fur mustaches in this game.\n\nSome of the puzzles fell flat. Malachi was able to analyze people to learn more about them, similar to the recent Sherlock Holmes games. Sounds like a neat idea, but in practice it mostly involved guesswork and the process of eliminating the most ridiculous options.\n\nThe most unforgivable part of the game was an excruciating 50+ screen underground maze at the end. There’s only something to do/interact with on maybe 5 of the screens. The rest is just running through dark tunnels. Considering how the rest of the locations in the game (like France, Egypt, New York) have only a handful of screens, dedicating so many to this awful, dismal, repetitive place is almost insulting. Who could have possibly thought this was a good idea?\n\nMoebius runs about 8 hours long. Though there were parts of the game I enjoyed and I’m glad I finished it (other than that awful maze), it was disappointing overall.\n\nRating: 4/10 – The story was so-so, the characters were a bit flat and some of the animation work was downright bad. The game lacked the charm and historical detail of Gabriel Knight and really did nothing to advance the point-and-click adventure genre, or even replicate it at its height.","November 27, 2015","false","10.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's too bad the game suffered for it.\n\nMy reasons for the "thumbs down" review are below:\n\nCharacter Models: The characters look gangly, with unusually thin arms and legs. They have high armpits and long, thin fingers. They also move awkwardly and their faces contort in odd ways when speaking. One character in particular looks like she's snarling when she speaks.\n\nAnimation: The characters move like stiff dolls at best. While I didn't expect motion capturing or super high budget work, I'd have liked to see animation beyond what would be normal in the early 2000s.\n\nTextures: I know some AAA games have poor textures at times, but virtually every texture in this game is sub-par. Honestly, it looks like a game made in 2005 (and even that's being generous). Skin looks flat, hair doesn't move, clothing is blotchy, and cars look like plastic toys. In addition, background characters look like low-res VGA placeholders.\n\nEnvironments: At first glance the environments don't look too bad. They're 2.5D and quite decent. When you look closer, however, you see the low-res work, jagged contours of objects, poorly placed light sourcing, and ridiculously inept shadows.\n\nSeriously, the shadows under Malachi and Gretchen in the antique shop make them look like they're floating. Plus, the shadows are blocky and tend to shimmer. It's like looking at a PS2 launch title.\n\nAudio: The music is quite good (I actually left it on, whereas I usually turn music off in games) and the general sound effects used work fine. It's when the characters speak that it all falls apart. The voice actors deliver their lines in a flat, awkward fashion, as if the voices were created by a synthesizer. The only voice actor who was good at all was Malachi's, which is good I suppose considering he's the main character.\n\nOptions: Not much to speak of, but it's a Point-and-Click Adventure game. It's not like FOV or SSAO would really matter much. That said, there is an option to choose up to 8x antialiasing, but it doesn't work. Jaggies are ever-present in the game.\n\nWhen you start the game, a launcher appears and you can set the resolution and graphics quality (although your options only range from "fantastic" to "fastest"). You can also decide if you want to play the game in a window or full screen.\n\nOne thing that's odd is there's a tab for input on the launcher, only it's meaningless. It doesn't affect a damn thing in the game and gives the impression that a gamepad could be used. It can't, and I have an Xbox 360 controller hooked up, so it's not like I need Xpadder or any other piece of software to "trick the game."\n\nInterface: It's all mouse-driven, with the exception of a few hotkeys. You can also press F5 and F7 to bring up the save/load menus. Like classic PC games, these are real manual saves (not quicksaves or autosaves or checkpoint saves!) and you can even name them.\n\nStory: It's a Jane Jensen game, so it'll have an interesting storyline. I haven't finished the game, but if I had, I wouldn't go into detail here. Doing so might accidentally post a spoiler.\n\nI will, however, say that the characters aren't that likable, especially Malachi, the protagonist. He's a jerk and not a charasmatic jerk like Gabriel Knight.\n\nEnd Thoughts: If you play this game, do it for the story. Try to ignore the mess that makes up the rest of the game. I'd also strongly urge anyone interested to wait for a sale, preferablly one that's at least 75% off the normal price.","April 19, 2014","false","13.5"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","0"

Despite of these two bad points I really, really enjojed Moebius. It's a good adventure itself, but the investigation and storic-matching mechanic make it unique and absolutely worth playing.\n\nAnd on top of that there's Jane Jensen. If she's involved, even as supervisor, there's a good story behind it.\n\nIf you like Moebius, you should take a look at Gray Matter and Cognition: an Erica Red thriller too.","March 21","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot is very silly, but quite consistent in its stupidity, and the cutscenes are very low budget. But the pacing is very good, the story is b-grade fun, and the puzzles are very logic, even if a bit easy.\n\nIgnore the reviews (except this one of course). Play it.","June 4","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
