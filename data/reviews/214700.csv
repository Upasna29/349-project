"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murrayl/recommended/214700/","murrayl","MurrayL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murrayl/","502 products in account","Thirty Flights of Loving is an indie art game which I found short, obtuse and largely uninteresting.\n\nSpeaking as someone who loved Dear Esther, and even Thirty Flights' developer's previous game ('Gravity Bone', which is included here as a free extra), I found myself thoroughly bewildered by Thirty Flights of Loving.\n\nI was bewildered by the sloppy non-linear storytelling. The game hops, skips, and leaps, with all the grace of a big rig in a tutu. I've played through the whole game and read several summaries to make sure I wasn't missing anything, but even once I made sense of the story being told (a by-the-books tale of a criminal caper gone wrong), it didn't connect with me at all.\n\nI was bewildered by the lack of flow within the gameplay. For such a short game, I was astonished to find myself stuck on at least two occasions. Normally I'd be the last person to call for such handholding tactics as blatant signposting or railroading of the player, but in this case the current state is completely at odds with the intended purpose. The developer obviously wants to tell a story, but I found it a trial just to get to the next part. This is not to mention the pointless interactions in the game which sometimes seem to serve no purpose whatsoever.\n\nI was bewildered by the end. It came out of nowhere, and left me with the strongest feeling of 'is that it?' I think I've ever encountered with a game. I spent more time in the options menu than I did with the game itself. I wouldn't mind if it was some kind of masterpiece of storytelling, but it just wasn't.\n\nMost of all, I was and am bewildered by the praise this game has garnered. 88% (at the time of writing) on Metacritic. Critical acclaim. Fans on the forums defending it to the hilt. I saw similar reactions to Dear Esther (which, as I said earlier, I felt deserved every bit of its praise), but I genuinely cannot understand it in this case.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something huge here, but Thirty Flights of Loving was not an enjoyable, enlightening, or otherwise entertaining experience for me. I respect any developer who attempts to tell stories through games, but this feels like one of the more unfinished, unfocused efforts that I have played. Not recommended.","December 21, 2013","false","0.4"," 207 of 294 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","207","294","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedwarrior/recommended/214700/","icedwarrior","icedwarrior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedwarrior/","607 products in account","Thirty Flights of Loving: 3/10\n\nPerhaps it was because I had gone into the game with high expectations (friends saying it was great, Extra Credits recommending it, and it having an overall 88/100 Metacritic score), but I expected a great game. A good game. At least a decent game… when I beat the game, I had a sour taste in my mouth, exclaiming “what the ♥♥♥♥? That’s it?!? …”. It’s difficult to say that I feel “burned” in my purchase due to the fact that I paid about $1.50 and the fact that I didn’t do any research other than “other people generally like it” (something I would chastise someone else doing)…but I feel incredibly disappointed in the game.\n\nThe first thing that I simply must state is the fact that it is short. I was “warned” of this beforehand, and I was cool with it. I’m fine with short games, so long as they “last” a bit (my view is one hour, thirty minutes and on is acceptable in most circumstances)…but this game lasted exactly 12 minutes. Yeah…12 minutes, from when I started it, to when I was done with the entire game. The ♥♥♥♥? I confused about the plot and game in general (I’ll discuss that shortly), so immediately after the game was over, I decided I was going to play it again to see what I was missing. Surely I missed something in regards to the plot or something. Thankfully, I thought, there’s a developer commentary, and so I selected that. Now, normally, this does a lot for me; as someone who’s obtained a degree in the field I find these things fascinating… but I was immensely disappointed in the commentary. Most of it was describing things that frankly wasn’t interesting (“Normally, ninety-degree angled hallways aren’t great, but after adding a bevel…”, “…I don’t approve of littering.”, etc.) and even after stopping to listen to the commentary, not only did it not shed any more light on the plot, but it lasted 15 minutes (with me taking my time and exploring, too). That adds up to 27 minutes. For beating the game twice. That’s not acceptable.\n\nI was interested in reading some of the critic’s comments on why they enjoyed the game, and a reoccurring theme was that they enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the story, and the frequent use jump-cuts. I didn’t. Let me explain what happens in the story (spoilers, obviously): you start in a hallway, letting you learn the controls of the game (WASD for movement, mouse for camera, tough stuff). You then enter a bar, unable to interact with any of the characters, who oddly stare into your soul. All you can do is consume alcohol (which does nothing, I add, other than disappearing and making a sound), and interact with a fake painting (which is among numerous paintings), opening up a secret passage, leading to the introduction of two characters (which is, admittedly, my favorite part of the game, although that’s not saying much). After this, you board a plane, and, after you leave, you’re immediately thrown into an unknown situation: your romantic interest is pointing a gun at you, in a strange location, and bloody. This is just a short summary of what you’ll encounter. And, sadly, this is about a third of the game. There’s so many random cuts to different parts of the story that you never really learn enough about the characters to care about them (and, I’m not sure if I’ve emphasized this already, but the game is short). Perhaps, in a strange way, peeling oranges with your loved one might be an intimate moment between two characters and the player, but when you’ve known the character for about two minutes, it didn’t mean anything to me. Also, I simply have to pose the question: why the hell were there three rooms dedicated to “Bernolli’s Principle” (something to do about high and low air pressure)?\n\nSo…yeah…I tried to be objective about this game and find redeeming qualities, but I just don’t see any. I mean, it’s a functional game, I guess…?\n\nTL;DR:[/b] Literally twelve minutes long, extremely brief and ambiguous plot, commentary about 90 degree hallways. Don’t waste your time with this game, no matter the price. Had I known what I know now, I wouldn’t have played the game even if it was free.","February 17, 2014","false","0.1"," 48 of 73 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","48","73","0","2"

The game consists of about 10 different rooms, each taking about a minute to get through and suddenly out of nowhere you're hit with a The End sign and a bunch of walkthrough credits with comments about the great decisions they made and how they decided on them. These great decisions are along the lines of weird random jump cuts  that change the entire scenario for no reason. There's also a room with displays of a bunch the game models and animated GIF video timelapses of screenshots of their creation. How impressive is that?\n\nAlso, there's a scene at a wedding where the characters randomly start rising up towards the ceiling. The developer notes say this was a bug, that they left in because it was so much better. Um, excuse me. This just proves how little effort they put into the game. Find a bug? Fix it? Nah. Let's just say it makes the game better. The game is practically on rails. I played it twice and nothing I did changed anything in the game beyond the room I was in.\n\nI recommend buying it if you want to see possibly the worst game ever. It cost £4 and for some reason has a very high metascore of 88. I have also heard real game reviewers saying it's a brilliant game. I'm not really sure what's going there, but it's clearly something shifty that needs to be looked at.

I found the characters to be somewhat memorable, if only in role rather than name. The story is interesting once it's broken down for you or played through multiple times. It's the Momento style of story-telling, not just a random series of events that some are making it out to be. There is a fleshed out tale here that is admittedly poignant, and in a very interesting setting.\n\nCONS: My overall time played was accrued through more than one playthrough. It is VERY short. For having such an interesting story, it's poorly told. The artsy factor actually detracts from the experience in this aspect. It would have been much better if the story to have been expanded upon, but I feel that's not what they were going for, for the sake of brevity. Unfortunately, a lack of any consequence makes it little more than a walking simulator that blows right by over the course of ten minutes or so.\n\nOVERALL: This game is not worth five USD, simple as that. Is it a travesty upon gaming? A sin that cannot be redeemed? Is it the worst thing that has ever stolen the money of players everywhere? No. It's just an overpriced art game, so calm down and stop giving it so much hate for the sake of cheap comedy.

It isn't even an appropriate score if you try to call this "game" artwork--it's poorly made no matter how you look at it.\n\nYou can literally beat this in 20 minutes and there is no replayability. There are two "games" inside here, in reality both are more like mini-games. Gameplay is entirely linear, there are no secrets to find, no character development, plus unoriginal and boring gameplay elements. There is no redeeming factor to this game; it's not even priced fairly.\n\nI am genuinely sad that I bought this for more than 50¢. This developer and publisher have yet to release a quality title on Steam and they offer no further support or updates after release. The game will stay in this bad condition, with no new content or updates.\n\nThirty Flights of Loving uses a modified and extremely dated Quake2 engine. If you try to quit or load/save at the wrong spot, press esc at the wrong time, or don't do precisely the right thing at the right time, you will easily trigger the "Quake2Engine has crashed" message--fittingly, they didn't even bother to insert the game name in place of the engine name!

It's a really interesting narrative, but I almost think it would have been better suited as a short film than an interactive experience as it's completely linear and you aren't really adding anything by being in control of the character because there are very few things to interact with.\n\nBut that being said, the presentation is great. The art direction is compelling, Chris Remo provides another great soundtrack, and the scene right after the open credits got to me more than any AAA game I can think of. I wish it was a little bit longer (about 15 minutes) and include a bit more interaction, but it's still an absolutely worthwhile experience.

Even if the price tag is sometimes a little over.\n\nYear Walk, To the Moon, Brothers: A tale of two sons, Limbo, Deadlight, Thomas was alone, Spec Ops: The Line.\n\nThe list goes on. All short games. All have great stories. All I would recommend.\n\nI would not recommend this game.\n\nI don't want to sound like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it feels like this game was made by some hipster who wanted to make an art piece out of a game.

That's great, but this "game" really isn't.\n\nAs I said before, length isn't usually an issue for me. However, I've played 20 minutes of this game and I've completed it three times. That's ridiculous. It could have the best story ever told ever by anyone ever and it would still be ridiculous that I can complete it three times in just over 20 minutes.\n\nAnd that's what's worse.

Its actually a really cheesy, sub-par romantic story. I won't spoil it, just in case you refuse to listen to me. I'm not that much of a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnd above everything else, it is BORING. You'd be surprised at how bored you can get in a game that takes less than 10 minutes to complete. The story is boring and the gameplay is boring. At least in Dear Esther and Gone Home, the story was good and it lasted longer than 10 minutes.\n\nWalk around for 10 minutes.

I’ve heard a lot of people say it isn’t and say it made no sense, but I personally thought it was fun.\nIn fairness, at the time I had no idea what I was doing or playing or what the hell was was going on at any point of time, I finished it and to be honest was a little impressed. But more so confused.\nI like the way it was done, it had a very fast paced kind of 'movie action scene' feel going on, and I even went and played through it again with the developer commentary. It explained some elements of it, and I actually found some of the things that he took into account quite clever. He even mentioned that the "WTF is going on" kind of "amnesia" feel, was one he found hard to pull off. But I think that this game (and the developer even wrote it in one of the commentary segments) is very much for a certain kind of audience. I get where people are coming from when they say they seen the trailer and expected something completely different, it wasn’t anything like I tried to imagine either. But in my own way, I kind of preferred what I found instead. I think it’s a great short (very short) game, with a lot of thought behind it.\nI’m glad I got this on sale when it was 75% off. Although I enjoyed it, I doubt I would pay full price for something this short. If it was longer... then yeh, sure.\nAll in all, I think it’s a nice, little, short, interactive story, which relies more on environment rather than dialogue.

I understand on some level why it got such high reviews, but from the standpoint of someone coming into it expecting to play a game, I was disappointed.  As the player, I did not have any real sense of agency as the game hurried me through series of strange, loosely connected events toward the all too fast approaching end.  At least in the prequel, Gravity Bone, there was some exposition and I had items I was able to use to interact with the environment.  It was sparse, but there were game mechanics there.  This is less of a game to be played, and more of a very short expressionist film to be watched.  If you come expecting an interactive story, you will be disappointed.  Thirty Flights of Loving is more akin to the experience of visiting a particularly short house of illusions at a carnival.  You can only go one linear direction, it's confusing, disorienting, and by the time you get out you feel slightly cheated for having spent as much money as you did on such a mediocre experience.","July 11, 2014","false","0.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It's just a load of kiss ♥♥♥ crap.\n\nIt's shorter than a midget's as$hole.If you blow it through it's less than 10 minutes.I had to play this twice just to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong or avoiding anything crucial.And then I played once more with additional commentary - it made me even more of a unsatisfied towards the entire game from how carelessly thrown together it seems to be based on how the comments were written. I literally kept thinking in my head 'This has to be a f*cking joke' once I saw "The End" and game related credits in the muesem full of generated people in bundles of three that only consist of three different character models spammed throughout the entire location and some things regarding airplanes. Because yeah- gotta add some flying related thing for the sake of adding depth to the title "Thirty Flights of Loving" other than you having a romance for some b*tch that almost killed your best man.\n\nBasically the game is literally contsructed based on mistake after mistake, yes sometimes imperfections add charm, but in this case it just seems like they were simply too lazy to bother fixing the issue and they decided to cover it up thoughtlessly. It was just like "Oh ..sh!t the crowd generator is causing peope to float in the wedding scene!?! That's alright! Let's just add some blurry effects while the player drink off the bottles while everyone else is dancing- and make the player assume they're so drunk that they can no longer correlate reality from alcoholic delusions!Why?Because it's ARTSY and adds a NARRATIVE touch in the game!!!"\n\nThe gameplay itself feels like you're on a grid, you get tossed from one scene to the next.Its also rather disorientating and disrupts the entire flow of the 'story' it is trying to convey. I really don't see how it's artistic.I see it as lazy,choppy,painfully short,and dull. It's not even very aesthetically pleasing for the simplicity of the graphics.It would be able to get away with it IF (and I emphasize if) it was a deep and enriched story telling game. But sadly- it fails miserably on that aspect.So yeah, not only it's FUGLY- but it's stupid.\n\nThe game also includes its prequel called "Gravity Bones" and I found it to be a bit more interesting, and innovative than it's sequel.Its even to my surprise a tad longer..But it still doesn't help the game as its own indvidual piece. It just felt like I ate a stale and bland cupcake with just a bit more sprinkles and frosting than the last one.\n\nTL:DR It ain't worth it at all.\nI'm surprised they even had the guts to call itself a 'game' the only thing you really do is walk around , sometimes press 'e' and get slammed with ♥♥♥♥ty sequences the second you step on a area that triggers it.It's sloppy, it's short. It's dull and it takes the the pride in being vague which in their language means artistic when in reality it's meaningless rubbish.I've never seen a game that costs five dollars but it's just as valuable as a crummy indie flash game you can find online for free. And even if it's on discount- I would say skip it...There are more interesting things to do in 15-20 minutes than to play this.","February 17, 2014","false","1.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","6"

They say it lets you figure out the story for yourself. Well, to that I say good luck. If you can find a coherent story in TFOL somewhere then I laud your truly magnificent gift of insight. I challenge anyone sitting on their pretentious thrones of higher criticism to tell me what the plot and story in this game are. My guess is no one really knows.\n\nThe world is kind of cute. And things like rushing through mobs of fast-moving people in an airport with a wounded team member slung over your shoulder to a soundtrack reminiscent of James Bond and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (a la Quentin Tarantino) are novel and a little exciting. But your actions affect nothing. It's basically a slide show. There was no purpose for several the key bindings (not kidding) and none of the objects you can pick up have any function whatsoever.\n\nThis should have been freeware for all the value it offers.

Surely the storytelling style in this game couldn't be applied to a fully featured game, though it would be interesting to see someone try.

It is ridiculously short and while it might be praised for fitting a lot into a short time period, I don't think it was necessary for the game to be so condensed, there was just something missing. I recommend downloading Gravity Bone (the previous game in the series, which is free) and trying that out to see if you enjoy it (if you can get it working on the correct resolution that is, the game is an ♥♥♥♥), then consider whether or not you'd pay for it because TFOL is the same length, essentially. Also, the game crashes no less than Gravity Bone for your money, the only upside of the duration of the game being that when it (inevitably) crashes, you don't have far to go to get back to where you were, though you will have to change all your settings again. One neat feature is that you'll never have to go to all the effort of pressing 'Esc' and exiting the game through the menu, as it will definitely crash before you do, buttonless game closing.. the future!\n\nUltimately I'd like to see some of these ideas put into a game of more worth and substance, whether in the Citizen Abel series or otherwise. My favourite part of the game was probably the developer commentary, which should never be the case in any form of entertainment, though nice to have it nonetheless. This game should be free, to garner interest in a much more substantial game based on it, unfortunately that was done with Gravity Bone and this is what we got. Perhaps there is hope for the future, kickstarter? Something real please and I'll pay money!","January 4, 2013","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game mainly consists of moving from one scene to the next with story unfolding through jumpcuts. Now if "short interactive story" hasn't put you off already than buy this game, granted for 5 euro it may seem steep, you'll get through it in about 15 minutes the first time.\n\nAs a story this is incredibly well put together, you'll play through it the first time and kind of know what's going on, and then you'll probably end up playing through it maybe 2 to 3 times more as you try to figure out the sequence of events. Plus the games wacky art style and music are more than worth the price of admission. I'm honestly a huge fan of this game.\n\nOn a side it comes with the prequel "Gravity Bone" which is also awesome and features the same type of style, so there's two reasons to buy it. However you can download "Gravity Bone" from the net for free and "test run" how you feel about this type of game if you're nervous about spending the 5 euro.

The items in the game give no gameplay benefit - you can drink alcohol but you don’t get drunk, you can pick up guns and ammo but you can’t use them. In a way Thirty Flights of Loving is like a roller coaster. You’re placed on a track that the developer crated for you, and you ride it until its completion.

I have put an absurd amount of hours into Atom Zombie Smash, and enjoyed my time in Flotilla.  I more recently discovered that another Blendo Game, Gravity Bone, was available on free from the studio's website, and after playing it, decided to throw down the $5 to play Thirty Flights of Loving.\n\nI'm not sure it was worth it.\n\nFirst thing's first: 30 Flights is really short.  I played through the game once normally and again with "developer commentary" on, and it took just a bit over a half hour combined.  I know it shouldn't be a factor, but as someone with a small amount of free money, I have to think about time value.  While I had fun with 30 Flights, I'm not sure I had $5 worth of fun.\n\nThat said, 30 Flights is fun.  It isn't a game, really...more of a short story told from a first person view.  It's a pretty wild ride, shifting from quiet moments to in-your-face intense moments with jarring smash cuts that fit the tone of the game well.\n\nIf you are curious about the game, I'd recommend giving Gravity Bone a spin first, which is available free at the Blendo Games site.  If you like it, go ahead and play 30 Flights...but I'd recommend waiting for a sale.  Even if I enjoyed it, $5 for 15 minutes is a hard sale.","March 29, 2013","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It uses that design limitation to its benefit with creative solutions consisting of disjointed gameplay events and visual cues. Blendo Games is a professional miniaturist at arranging an emotional narrative with a very tight design scope resulting in something spectacular that could rival some of the traditional storytelling used by AAA game studios.\n\nI’d recommend playing “Gravity Bone” if you can to get a taste of what both games have to offer; it takes about 15 minutes and is free at the developer’s website: http://blendogames.com/","June 23, 2014","true","0.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","4"

I think? It's kinda difficult to pin down exactly what this is given the minimalist nature of practically everything about it. You don't really play it as such, more like you move around to progress a story told through sparse fragments of interspersed scenes which suggest much but which never really outright state anything. Instead, it's largely left to the player to give context and meaning to everything, and therein lies its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. Some will breeze through the very brief experience with little thought, others might enjoy reading the world as they play through. A great curiosity without a massive amount of substance, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it outright as a must see, as even with the included, equally short prequel, Gravity Bone, there still isn't much here you couldn't really live without. But I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from checking it out if the price was low enough to justify your intrigue.","January 6, 2014","true","1.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

WHAT? Are you serious?"\n\nThere were such great ideas from a staging perspective (this is pretty much all this game has), messing with you with the story telling, until it just stops. The end. The game is done with you, nothing more to see. Good bye. The game just throws some interesting concepts/ideas at you through a short story and... that is it.

Keep in mind, however, that Gravity Bone was released as freeware, and while I do not recommend Thirty Flights of Loving at all, Gravity Bone is something that I recommend highly.\n\nGravity Bone is neat for a number of reasons. Despite being low-tech, the art style is quite striking, and it is used to great effect in a couple of set-pieces within the game. In fact, it is one of the few things that is retained in its sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving. Gravity Bone itself is quite short however, involving only a couple of missions with various objectives. All of this is done in the first-person perspective, but the game is not what you would call a first-person shooter. Now, I do wish that there was more to the game, as the missions themselves play out nicely, and they work as an excellent demonstration on how to engage the player without having them shoot at things constantly, which is often the case in the first-person games that it resembles. And the game comes together wonderfully at the end, with a fast-paced end sequence, and an ending that is on the good side of eccentric and confusing, which wraps up the tale very well. All taking place with full input of the player, save for the end sequence. But here this brief absence of control is justified perfectly within the contextual landscape the game has painted.\n\nSo while Gravity Bone is a demonstration of where first-person games could take us, Thirty Flights of Loving instead presents us with a few brief minutes of scarcely interactive slideshow, composed of random elements devoid of context, all taking place along a non-linear timeline. It is a mess of a presentation, and one which is just plain confusing, and there ends up being nothing thought provoking at all in the experience. What it does have are some references to Gravity Bone, but those come off as disconnected and pointless, as well as other similarly ineffective references to other things which have no bearing to what you are doing. However, there are some hidden environmental details that are revealed if you pay attention, but they have no real bearing within Loving's framework, given how non-interactive the experience is.\n\nNow, I would not normally be so harsh on a sequel for being different. However in this case, not only is it different, those new features only detract from the experience. All that Thiry Flights of Loving manages to be, is a slideshow of variously surreal and not-so-surreal scenes cobbled together, and which do not actually require the player to be present in the slightest, and the entire game is over in under ten minutes. Where Gravity Bone was an engaging and impressive demonstration of how you could tell a story in the first-person, Thirty Flights of Loving is just an incomplete set of narrative fragments which are left to the played to  struggle to reconstruct. Even then, without any real input from the player, one must wonder what motivation the player is meant to have to attempt this, when the fragments are so far-flung, and the reward for collecting them so unsatisfying.\n\nAs far as picking up this game goes, you could say that you picked it up in order to give some recognition to Gravity Bone. But by itself, there really is no reason whatsoever to play Thirty Flights of Loving.","November 25, 2013","false","0.9"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

It's non-linear, non-traditional, and very stylized -- what it does it does okay. It's interesting, but for me it was ultimately an unfulfilling experience. I didn't feel for the characters like the reviews said I was supposed to, and I didn't have any investment in the story or where it went. I appreciated the attempt to do something different, but I felt that it was all just too disjointed and unresolved. I played through a second time with the developer commentary enabled, and there was a lot of pretentious talk about the ambiguity of the storyline and characterization; I felt that it was all a failed attempt at justifying decisions that made little sense to me. There are weaknesses in the story, design and gameplay, and the developers are well aware of them. All told, however, I didn't hate it. What saved it for me was the inclusion of Gravity Bone in the copy I did purchase. It was longer, included puzzle elements, and offered the player more time as the character. I think this last point alone made me enjoy it more than Thirty Flights -- if only I had five more minutes to explore the heist and the relationship to the supporting characters, I might have enjoyed it more.","December 30, 2013","false","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I knew this prior to purchasing this title (which was on sale at the time), but I was intrigued when I heard how innovative it was with its narrative presentation. However, I discovered that the "innovation" was simply a non-linear story offering virtually no exposition. And here comes the counter argument: "Oh-no! The developer didn't hand you an explanation on a silver platter because you were too lazy and stupid to actually explore what the story had to offer!" Nope. I did a second playthrough with developer commentary enabled, played the prequel Gravity Bone, and was still none the wiser.\n\nNow I'm not saying that these types of narratives can't work, but here's the problem with a lot of these stories: when very little exposition is given about the characters and how they relate to the world around them, this strips away any humanity the characters would have had, which in turn makes it difficult for the audience to have any profound connection with them. Just because a story is intentionally confusing, does not make it good.","September 6, 2014","false","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gyrocop/recommended/214700/","gyrocop","Gyrocop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gyrocop/","870 products in account","For about the last decade or so, it has been very thoroughly debated whether or not video games are an art form. To me a type of media becomes an art form when there is a piece of that media that has its head up it's own ♥♥♥, and is filled with the pretentious "you just don't get" attitude. After playing Thirty Flights of Loving... I have now come to the conclusion that video games are an art form.\n\nThis game cannot physically last you longer than an hour. In 54 minutes I have accomplished to beat the game twice, beat the free game that has been included as an extra, tinker a bit in the options, and completed the game once more with developer commentary (and I listened to all of them). Now a short game in itself isn't a bad thing, but if you aren't going to deliver on length you have to deliver in memorability and quality, and Thirty Flights doesn't deliver in either.\n\n"But the story isn't linear" cries the proffessional critic. Wow, what an amazing feature to have. Movies have been doing this for decades, and when someone sloppily puts together an uniteresting "outlaws fighting the establishment" plot that has been bathed in Tarantino-influence (you know, without all of that pesky charm or character that Tarantino is great at implementing), but with the twist that it is a video game, I don't really feel like celebrating. I feel angry.\n\nYou know what other game had an unlinear story? Beyond: Two Souls. I am not saying that game is masterpiece (far from it), but it had more going for it than this. Beyond: Two Souls biggest fault in my opinion was to be too ambitious story-wise and not ambitious enough gameplay-wise. It tried to tackle more story than it could handle, and then cut off the gameplay to deal with it. Thirty Flights is like that, with the exception that it isn't amitious story-wise either. It is a very basic and bareboned plot, and no amount of jumping to and fro in time and place will conceal that. It's super simple. You don't even need a second playthrough to get the plot. Sure there might be small details, but that's it.\n\nThis game is an experiment and I can understand that. The problem here is that someone apparently thought that this overly artsy, simple story with no real gameplay and a bland atmosphere was apparently worth money, and five bucks at that. There are games on Steam for half of that price that will give you more and be more memorable in the end.\n\nWhat makes this really annoying to me is that I don't hate walking simulators. I don't hate art games. I don't hate sacrificing gameplay to tell a good story or trying to innovate. You just need to realize what your work is worth. And by putting meaningless slop like this on the forefront as great art is doing that media a disservice. It's pioneering and innovate, but it's not well made. The manner of jumping around in this simple cliché story, makes me feel like I'm playing a ♥♥♥♥ing demo.","October 10, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Then you can find it cool, just after you understand what it is.\n\nMy first experience was disappointing.\nBeing someone who usually enjoy art games or interactive experiences, i start it thinking about a cool, deep story-driven game, but i found me just watching disordered short scenes of a shallow and confusing story, instead of really playing something. It ended really fast, abruptly and letting me with a "wtf?!" in mind. The graphics, lights, colors and music are really cool, but it was not enough to make me enjoy.\n\nThen i try it again a few days later.\nKnowing what to expect, the experience was far better, and i used to enjoy it and understand it.

I gave it another go, powered through Gravity Bone (the prequel, included) in about 20 minutes, and finished Thirty Flights proper in another 15. I went to bed and spent the next hour laying awake, thinking about it. If that sounds like a good time to you, by all means pick it up right now. If you're skeptical, read on.\n\nTFoL is a very short narrative game about three people engaged in some less than legal dealings. The story is presented from first-person in a heavily stylized world that evokes the colorful spy thrillers of the late 60s and early 70s. There's little to do besides walk and trigger events, and the non-linear presentation of the tale makes it hard to follow exactly where you are and what is going on. It's an intense and confusing journey that's going to take more than a little digging on your part to make any sense of.\n\nThis is actually a pretty sharp contrast to Gravity Bone, which is a surreal vignette of the life of a spy. There's more interaction and actual gameplay there, with some exploration to do and simple inventory to use to accomplish your missions. A bizarre sense of humor that strays almost into Jazzpunk territory helps prop it up, and then it all ends quite suddenly, game and humor alike. I'm glad it's included with TFoL because it helps flesh out the strange world and its symbolism a bit, and finding the links between them is certainly interesting.\n\nWhat you're getting is a heavily-stylized walking sim with loads of meaning behind the short, staccato scenes. The overall feel of the game is unsettled and almost dreamlike, inviting you to read into every part of the presentation. This isn't something like a Tale of Tales game where it's congratulating itself on how clever and meaningful it is, mind you. Every part of Thirty Flights of Loving simply is, it just exists to be experienced, and waits for you to divine the meaning for yourself. There is seriously not much game here, and it's hard to really suggest a purchase, but I consider my time with it well-spent. I might even revisit it to puzzle out more meaning, or just experience the 30-minute fever dream again.\n\nAnd if nothing else, Thirty Flights of Loving presents one of the best explanations of the Bernoulli Principle I have ever seen. I don't think I've ever fully understood it until now, and I thank Blendo Games for that.","December 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Regardless of whatever headaches I have, may you enjoy the fruits of our labor.\n\nWe may never know who Citizen Abel truly is, but we do have stories about him." -- Brendon Chung,  Thirty Flights of Loving\n\nI'm not going to lie: This is a difficult game. It will anger you. It is meant to do so.\n\nBut if you pretend it doesn't have a story that is desperately trying to make its way to you, you are deluding yourself. And you are falling for the trap that Chung has so meticulously designed for the average player.\n\nI don't mean that this is a difficult game insofar that it's hard to complete. It's level design is agonizingly linear, and excruciatingly short in length. It's difficult because the most important events in the story don't happen on the screen. It's difficult like a jigsaw puzzle without a picture on the box -- difficult because you don't know what you're putting together, let alone how.\n\nIt's short because most of what it's trying to tell you, it tries to communicate by not telling you at all. Just leaving hints, out of order, tucked away in parts that don't seem important. That is not to say that Chung is lazy and expects you to make the story for him, simply that he respects the player enough to understand what's on the table and what that means is likely being dealt under it.\n\nThis isn't really much of a game in the usual sense of a game. It is a linear short-story, told in a fragmented non-linear fashion. It is so short a story, in fact, that it is really closer to a poem in that vein: its decided brevity poses more questions than it answers, and that is its main storytelling technique -- in typical crime-mystery fashion.\n\nThat is what I love about Thirty Flights of Loving, and what so many people hate: it gives you but a blink of an eye, from a view of limited scope, in a world promised to be much larger than it shows. A world that Chung has obviously given much thought, more thought than a passer-by might think he has given the game itself. And like a poem, agonizingly short, its parts are so few that they have been chosen with such care that they tell more than the pieces themselves ever could. Like in poetry, how sometimes the story resides as much in the silence between the words as the words themselves.\n\nThirty Flights of Loving isn't really so much a game, as it is a question. A series of questions, posed to the player, answers known by the characters, if they could only speak. And it sparks a rare kind of intense and frustrated curiosity that I have experienced but few times in my entire life.\n\nIt does so by being more than what it is: it is incredibly consciously constructed, made for consumption from the very beginning. And if you try to wolf it down and casually digest it like you would a hamburger and fries, it will tear through your gut like a box of nails. It is uncompromising, and it will make you angry.\n\nIt is difficult like that, it was made to be. That is what makes it so uniquely wonderful to me. Chung dares to ♥♥♥♥ you off, and asks you what you're going to do about it.\n\nThat part is up to you. That is the game.","February 15, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/martythecrow/recommended/214700/","martythecrow","Marty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/martythecrow/","405 products in account","As an artist and part-time indie game developer, I feel like I should be especially appreciative of so-called "art games" - those games which don't follow the rules of traditional game design, and instead focus on immersing the player in a story that doesn't necessarily reward the player for winning or losing, but by virtue of the experience itself. So I occasionally try out games like this, in hopes that I will find something moving, inspiring, and interesting - not always expecting something fun. I'm willing to forgo the fun if the experience is enough by itself.\n\nSo when Thirty Flights of Loving went on sale, I checked review sites to see what they said. Right away I noticed a strong discord between the scores of professional reviewers and the scores given by the players. Simply put, reviewers seemed to love it, and players seemed to hate it. I decided to try it out anyway, in case my sense of art might give me some insight which the lower-scoring players lacked.\n\nUnfortunately for Thirty Flights, after playing through the game, I have to side with the players on this one. This game isn't fun, and really just isn't that interesting.\n\nThe story is one you've seen many times in movies and on TV, but this time it's told via a cast of vaguely humanoid boxes. Reviewers called this game "lovingly crafted", but after the opening scene, it all felt incomplete to me. More like a sketch before the eventual painting.\n\nAt the end, which comes very quickly, you'll wonder what you just did for the last half hour. And then, like me, you'll probably wonder why you didn't do somethign else instead. You might even get mad that you spent money for this.\n\nDon't get me wrong here - I don't like insulting the work of people who are clearly forging ahead into new, wonderful territory with games. It's tough for me to write such a negative review. But I don't feel like Thirty Flights is worth the praise reviewers gave it, and I wish that more time had be spent making it coherent, thoughtful, and even fun. It could have been a lot more than it is, and I just don't feel like what is here is something I can recommend to others.","December 2, 2013","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

I'd say use caution if you're not into these type of storytelling games that are more about the story than gameplay.\n\nI'd like to say- great game. The graphics aren't complex, the controls are simple- and yet the way everything is pieced together makes it a charming and fun experience you could only find in an indie game. Note that it comes with two games: Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving. I guess you could play Gravity Bone first as it is the prequel, but it didn't seem to make a huge difference for me.\nThe playthroughs are very short- I'd say about 10-15 minutes each game. I recommend to buy it on sale if you're going to buy it.\n\nOverall, it's fun and short game. Recommended for the select taste, casual gamers.

Most people seem to make mention of either "Why would I pay $5 for a game this short?" or "This isn't even a game." Then they'd probably say "Don't waste your money." I am here to tell you otherwise.\n\nThe game functions much like a film though it isn't, there is little interactivity but that seems to be the point of the experiance. I classify it as a game because there is interactivity, you the player are a part of the stary and you can interact (however limited) with the world around you unlike a film. From what I understand the game seems to be an experiment to try to fit as much story into a limited time frame, and with no dialogue. And to that it succeeds, even without dialogue the game accurately portrays a story just from the very limited character models and it even makes it engaging. It's paced well and is just overall really well made, especially for a game running on the Quake engine.\n\nIt also comes with the game this is a successor to, Gravity Bone, which is a nice touch and is really great in it's own right. For $5 I still reccommend it, just for the experiance this game gives you.","January 13, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

There are 3 parts to this game. I really like the commentary portion of the game because it gave you a deeper understanding about the whole game and why they did what they did. The graphics were interesting and funny to look at when you got close, but it was well done. This game tells you stories which are well done and intriguing to follow. There isn't any puzzles in the game, you are just told a story. There is no really challenge in the game except to just enjoy it. Its a great game and I very much enjoyed it.

So before you spend that precious $1.24, let's evaluate if you will or will not love it:\n\n1. Do you like point and click games?\n2. Do you like heavily plot based games?\n3. Are you into cinematography, graphic arts, and/or innovative story telling?\n4. Do you value the EXPERIENCE of a game over what you can actually DO in a game?\n\nIf you answered "yes" to all 4, this is definitely the game for you. This kind of game is so different and wonderfully pieced together. I cannot believe how many emotions this game made me feel in under 10 minutes. It was heart-pounding and heart-felt. DO realize though that it's more of a visual novel and therefore your actions are chosen for you, you just are simply there to enjoy the ride. Which is exactly what I did, I enjoyed the ride.\n\nAS A BONUS: you also get their first game Gravity Bone (can't find it? hit esc and click careers) which unlike this sequal allows the player to move and figure out what they have to do, which is much more interactive but still as fun as Thirty Flights of Loving.","December 30, 2013","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now, one might argue that the game is still enjoyable for the "art" or "story", but the game has neither that are exceptional. You can try to dissect some hidden meanings or interpret the vague ending anyway you want, but there is NOTHING there. This is the type of game that's left ambiguously vague because the creator is just uncreative and is taking advantage of dumb people. The game has NO replay value. It isn't a short and quick game because there is no game at all. It's not like a quick arena game that's addicting and you want to replay, no, it's nothing of the sort. And as I mentioned before, it isn't even a game that you'd want to replay to see if you can interpret the deep and powerful meaning behind the game's story. I will now write out the entire game to you right now.\n\nYou walk down some stairs into a bar.\nTwo guys just stare at you. You can't talk to them.\nYou smash a few bottles to try and intice a response. The two guys continue to stare and not care.\nYou go into a "hidden" door to your secret base where you meet your two best companions.\nStaring female and staring male. Interacting with them shows two soundless cutscenes (approx 30 seconds long) of their "professions".\nTheir professions imply they are thieves and are about to make a heist of sorts with you.\nYou can pick up some guns and ammunition on the tables. This does nothing at all. You're essentially clicking them to make them disappear.\nYou go into a plane.\nScene changes instantly.\nOh no, your best friend, staring guy, is bleeding on the ground.\nYou push him around an airport in a cart because you're weak and can't carry him.\nThe airport is crowded with rejected minecraft characters that ignore your prescence and walk through you.\nFlashback to you and staring girl in an apartment. Implications you two are in love.\nYou walk up a stairwell. There are more staring people on the rooftop having drinks.\nYou sit with staring girl.\nScene changes instantly.\nYou go back to pushing your dying best friend, staring guy, around in the airport.\nYou get a gun suddenly and shoot birds(?) out of the air. (THIS IS THE ONLY GAMEPLAY IN THE GAME ASIDE FROM WALKING AND THERE IS NO CONSEQUENCE IF YOU DO NOT SHOOT THE WHITE BIRD THINGS. YOU HAVE NO AMMO. NOTHING MATTERS.)\nYou get into a car with staring guy. The car drives by itself.\n\nThe end.\n\nYou beat the game goodjob. Yes, it was 30 minutes even with taking your time. Yes, that was the whole game. Yes, you paid ten dollars. Yes, that's all you're getting. Yes, you didn't miss anything or unlock anything. You're still going to replay it out of disbelief of being ripped of so hard, aren't you? Okay, go for it. ...You back? Yes, that was indeed it. No, I agree.

I'd say use caution if you're not into these type of storytelling games that are more about the story than gameplay.\n\nI'd like to say- great game. The graphics aren't complex, the controls are simple- and yet the way everything is pieced together makes it a charming and fun experience you could only find in an indie game. Note that it comes with two games: Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving. I guess you could play Gravity Bone first as it is the prequel, but it didn't seem to make a huge difference for me.\nThe playthroughs are very short- I'd say about 10-15 minutes each game. I recommend to buy it on sale if you're going to buy it.\n\nOverall, it's fun and short game. Recommended for the select taste, casual gamers. Not recommended for hardcore FPS collectors.","December 27, 2013","true","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Most people seem to make mention of either "Why would I pay $5 for a game this short?" or "This isn't even a game." Then they'd probably say "Don't waste your money." I am here to tell you otherwise.\n\nThe game functions much like a film though it isn't, there is little interactivity but that seems to be the point of the experiance. I classify it as a game because there is interactivity, you the player are a part of the stary and you can interact (however limited) with the world around you unlike a film. From what I understand the game seems to be an experiment to try to fit as much story into a limited time frame, and with no dialogue. And to that it succeeds, even without dialogue the game accurately portrays a story just from the very limited character models and it even makes it engaging. It's paced well and is just overall really well made, especially for a game running on the Quake engine.\n\nIt also comes with the game this is a successor to, Gravity Bone, which is a nice touch and is really great in it's own right. For $5 I still reccommend it, just for the experiance this game gives you.","January 13, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

The designer's commentary is also worthwhile, but even then you're looking at an hour tops. The real value is in the many more questions it raises than it ever has any intention in answering.

You will have to play this game a couple times to understand the whole story of it. I really loved playing this game a couple times. The game takes 10 minutes to beat unless you look at everything. There are 3 parts to this game. I really like the commentary portion of the game because it gave you a deeper understanding about the whole game and why they did what they did. The graphics were interesting and funny to look at when you got close, but it was well done. This game tells you stories which are well done and intriguing to follow. There isn't any puzzles in the game, you are just told a story. There is no really challenge in the game except to just enjoy it. Its a great game and I very much enjoyed it. I would get this game on sale, then you will feel like you got your moneys worth. It was a great story to go through, just make sure to enjoy the whole game and go through all three parts of the game.","April 15, 2013","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now, one might argue that the game is still enjoyable for the "art" or "story", but the game has neither that are exceptional. You can try to dissect some hidden meanings or interpret the vague ending anyway you want, but there is NOTHING there. This is the type of game that's left ambiguously vague because the creator is just uncreative and is taking advantage of dumb people. The game has NO replay value. It isn't a short and quick game because there is no game at all. It's not like a quick arena game that's addicting and you want to replay, no, it's nothing of the sort. And as I mentioned before, it isn't even a game that you'd want to replay to see if you can interpret the deep and powerful meaning behind the game's story. I will now write out the entire game to you right now.\n\nYou walk down some stairs into a bar.\nTwo guys just stare at you. You can't talk to them.\nYou smash a few bottles to try and intice a response. The two guys continue to stare and not care.\nYou go into a "hidden" door to your secret base where you meet your two best companions.\nStaring female and staring male. Interacting with them shows two soundless cutscenes (approx 30 seconds long) of their "professions".\nTheir professions imply they are thieves and are about to make a heist of sorts with you.\nYou can pick up some guns and ammunition on the tables. This does nothing at all. You're essentially clicking them to make them disappear.\nYou go into a plane.\nScene changes instantly.\nOh no, your best friend, staring guy, is bleeding on the ground.\nYou push him around an airport in a cart because you're weak and can't carry him.\nThe airport is crowded with rejected minecraft characters that ignore your prescence and walk through you.\nFlashback to you and staring girl in an apartment. Implications you two are in love.\nYou walk up a stairwell. There are more staring people on the rooftop having drinks.\nYou sit with staring girl.\nScene changes instantly.\nYou go back to pushing your dying best friend, staring guy, around in the airport.\nYou get a gun suddenly and shoot birds(?) out of the air. (THIS IS THE ONLY GAMEPLAY IN THE GAME ASIDE FROM WALKING AND THERE IS NO CONSEQUENCE IF YOU DO NOT SHOOT THE WHITE BIRD THINGS. YOU HAVE NO AMMO. NOTHING MATTERS.)\nYou get into a car with staring guy. The car drives by itself.\n\nThe end.\n\nYou beat the game goodjob. Yes, it was 30 minutes even with taking your time. Yes, that was the whole game. Yes, you paid ten dollars. Yes, that's all you're getting. Yes, you didn't miss anything or unlock anything. You're still going to replay it out of disbelief of being ripped of so hard, aren't you? Okay, go for it. ...You back? Yes, that was indeed it. No, I agree. It wasn't profound and it didn't change your life. Yes, I'm upset with it too. Yes, it is odd how people are actually recommending this game. No, I don't think there is a coincidence that it is mostly tumblr beasts raving about how good the game is. Yes, I agree that we can only hope God gives them a quick and painless death and takes their blogs with their souls to hell.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\n\nPirate it if you're that curious for disappointment but\n\nDO\nNOT\nBUY\nTHIS\nGAME.","December 23, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are mininal amount of words that can describe the depth to what is game is carrying out do yourself a favor and buy it it's an emotional roller coaster that will leave you in tears and will also make you laugh at times , The only problem i have with this game is that there are not even close to thirty flights and the only loving in the game is when you ♥♥♥♥ the brains out of this chick. Although with the tragic ending there is i suppose it tells you that love is the only thing eternal and we only have a small amount of time before we die so live it up and never look back 5/5 must buy game of the century. This game will teach you what love truly is, what friendship truly is, and what courage truly is. out of the the 40 times i've played this game it has made me cry almost everytime i've played it is just such a good game i CANNOT stress this enough i need another one of these games.","August 8, 2014","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do know that it's a roughly 10-15 minute experience telling a story about spies... carrying out a heist? ...I think? What I do know is that it was created by Brendon Chung, the one-man team behind Blendo Games who is also responsible for Flotilla, Atom Zombie Smasher and the upcoming Quadrilateral Cowboy. Thirty Flights of Loving (TFOL) was created as part of a Kickstarter campaign to support the Idle Thumbs podcast, of which I am a frequent listener. According to Chung, TFOL was an excercise in creating a game that tells a story without any dialogue. TFOL is certinaly a realization of that concept, but I don't think it's very successful in telling a clear and understandable story\n\nPart of the problem here is that in order to get the whole picture of what's going on in TFOL, you had to have played some of Chung's previous games. TFOL opens by announcing that it's the sequel to a game called Gravity Bone, which is jarring to anyone (myself included) who wasn't aware of Gravity Bone and was expecting TFOL to be a standalone experience. I found TFOL to be a pretty hard and confusing game to parse through. Part of it is the lack of any dialogue, part of it is the smash cuts and non-linear presentation of the story, and part of it is the expectation that the audience has also played Gravity Bone. By doing a bit of research and also watching an excellent video by Errant Signal, I was able to find out that Gravity Bone is part of Chung's long running series of games called "Citizen Abel". Now I'm not sure if playing all of the other Citizen Abel games helps TFOL make more sense, but that's a lot to expect your audience to do espiecially considering some of the older Citizen Abel games are Quake II and Half Life II mods. And if having played those games doesn't contribute anything to the understanding of TFOL, why brand it as the sequel to Gravity Bone? I acknowledge that some my confusion with the story may be my own fault for not having played the other games, but this was one of several nits I had to pick with this game.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the story in TFOL is told non-linearly and without any dialogue at all. As you might guess, it makes the story a bit hard to follow. Even though I played through the game twice to try to piece it together, I still can't come up with a reading on this game that isn't jumbled nonsense. I'd love to hear someone else's interpretation of the story though, if someone can actually manage to follow it and come up with an understanding.\n\nI'm all for smaller games made for a specific audience, so I feel bad picking on the little guy here. Nevertheless, I found TFOL to be a short and confusing experiment in weird and nonsensical storytelling. I've now written quite a few words about a game that has none.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","March 25","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With cube heads, a simple linear path, essentially no words (okay, that's a lie, I guess I mean no dialogue), and about fifteen minutes, it manages to be something of a masterclass in game storytelling, communicating at a level of effectiveness that verbose, exposition-heavy "AAA" rollercoasters would kill for.\n\nFor me, the use of sharp cuts ahead in a scene, or between scenes, was worth the price of admission alone. It's a technique I've of course experienced in many many films, but I don't think I've ever seen it used in games before, and it's a wonderful way of both creating (or perhaps emulating) a certain style, and putting you in the headspace needed to make the most of each scene.\n\nYes, it's "only" fifteen minutes long, in the same way that, I don't know, Swift's seminal essay A Modest Proposal is only a few pages, or your favourite song only lasts three minutes thirty. If you're one of the people that (bizarrely, I maintain) measures experiences by dividing cost by length, this isn't for you. And I wasn't, you know, floored; blown away in amazement. But it is quietly amazing; a significant accomplishment content to sit and do its own thing while the world shows off noisily around it. I think people with an interest in the presentation of narrative in games - beyond mere text dumps - should really check this out.","February 15, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

When you start playing, you find a hidden passage in the wall and a gun behind the counter. Once you go through the door, you collect more guns and ammo for them. However, they are never used since the "game" is entirely about the story. From this point on, it feels like the game is rushing through its story. Key word on the rushing. One moment, you are riding on a plane. The next, you are walking down a busy hallway. What makes this strange is that there are no transitions from one scene to another. This often makes it feel less like real story and more like a random collection of clips from several movies. Add to it that the whole thing ends in 15 minutes, and it feels more like a test program. They included another game called "Gravity Bone" that feels more like a real game, but it still does not feel like it is enough to worth buying. If you can play this on a friend's computer, do it that way. My family got it because it was part of a bundle. As a standalone product, I would not recommend buying this one.","February 15, 2014","false","1.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I love The Path, I love Dear Easther, I love The Stanley Parable, I love The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.\nBUT THIS.

Is it an adventure game, an action game, an art game, or an elegiac love poem? Well, it’s all of these and none. 30 Flights is an indie gamer's indie game. It occupies the same experimental vein as Proteus, The Path, and Journey. I know that may scare some of you off, but it shouldn’t. TFOL is basically a slick crime caper gone awry. Like Reservoir Dogs? You’ll probably enjoy this.\n\nAs one comes to expect from indie indies, TFOL features simple graphics, quirky humor, an innovative yet enigmatic narrative structure, and great music. Despite its age, the Quake 2 engine has never looked this good. The blocky retro-visual style is utterly charming: think Minecraft meets No One Lives Forever.\n\nThirty Flights of Loving focuses its sharp satirical lens on the over-the-top cinematism rife in video games and their tendency to imitate big-budget Hollywood Action movies. But it is also a powerful and moving homage to the stylish, discontinuous narration of French New Wave films. The game has often been compared to the work of Tarantino, but both the plot and razor sharp editing owes more to the formal innovations of Jean-Luc Godard's seminal film, A bout de souffle.\n\nMuch of the central game experience involves trying to piece together its intricately crafted story. Temporal and spatial leaps await the player at every turn. Brendon Chung has a knack for capturing the gritty underworld vernacular that our anti-heroes inhabit. Interspersed throughout the game are moments of transcendent beauty. In one, Anita sits peeling oranges overlooking her vast apartment courtyard. The sound is particularly used to great effect here, realistically capturing the nocturnal soundscape of a large urban metropolis. In the climactic gunfight, the action recalls the poetic rhythm of Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka. Without relying on dialogue text, voiceover narration, or UI, Brendon Chung manages to convey an entire world and story through the environment.\n\nTo what degree any of this makes sense depends on the player’s perception. What exactly went down at Cugat airfield? Who is Winston Borges (a.k.a. Mo Golden, Moco Rococo, The Big Pai-Goo)? Is Bernoulli’s Principle the key to unlocking this puzzle? These are just some of the many questions you’ll ask yourself in 30 Flights of Loving.","February 5, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I recommend them as experiences but that is all they are. They hardly qualify as games so I wouldn't pay full price for them. Gravity Bone was originally available as a free download on the Blendo Games website. While it was short, it had some minor gameplay elements. It had the use of items and some minor platforming but ,overall, the game felt like a tech demo. It felt like it was only a sample of what was to come. So when Thirty Flights of Loving was released I assumed that it would be a full length game with more items, more locations, more vague Gravity Bone spy story, and more platforming, puzzle solving, etc. But Thirty Flights of Loving has even less gameplay.

It's basically 15 minutes of story time, in which the author(s) weaves together a quick series of flash shots together. The minimalistic method is interesting, and entertaining enough for a one-time playthrough.\n\nIt's not great by any stretch of the imagination, though. The story given does not provide much literary merit, and is not nearly long enough to provide substantial "proof" for its concept.

It works, but I would have liked an expansion on this idea beyond a 15-minute demo reel.\n\nYour impact as a player is nonexistent. There are no choices to be made. Failure is impossible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/petyrbearlish/recommended/214700/","petyrbearlish","Smokey Barrister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/petyrbearlish/","545 products in account","Thirty Flights of Loving is a game that, just like To the Moon and Kentucky Route Zero, proves how powerful the interactive medium of video games can be in telling a story. Played from a first-person view, there is virtually no traditional gameplay, aside from being able to interact with the environment and explore its nooks and crannies. The soundtrack and the sound design are great, as well as its graphical presentation. The blocky characters, the usage of color, and the varied environments all mesh together into a game that looks quite unlike any other.\n\nBut yes, there is nothing the player really does in the game, at least, not in the traditional sense. The real reason to play this game is for its story and, more specifically, the way the game presents its story. By employing the mechanics of film editing and cutting freely between events and scenes without any sort of input from the player, Thirty Flights of Loving spins the classic yarn of a heist gone horribly wrong in a wholly unique way. Its non-linearity and hectic pace is a refreshing change from the banality of most video game narratives, and the player truly has to work in order to understand everything that's happening. While the game can be completed in fifteen minutes or so, the scope and depth of the story told is one that far exceeds its actual runtime. Multiple playthroughs are not only necessary but also inevitable.\n\nThirty Flights of Loving is certainly not for everyone. Many players have expressed outrage or frustration at the fact that the "game" isn't really much of one at all. Brendon Chung, the creator of the game, has himself described it as "an interactive short story". Ultimately, it does not matter. Thirty Filghts of Loving is a very important game, because it makes a legitimate attempt to tap into the vast potential for video games as a narrative medium. If that sounds at all interesting to you, go play Thirty Flights of Loving. It's an experience that you won't soon forget.","May 23, 2013","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is around the same length or shorter, less interactive (no puzzles or skill involved) and with a couple more interesting presentation techniques.\n\nIf you love Gravity Bone and think it'd be worth paying a few dollars for a similar experience, go ahead. It's a short experimental piece that's not for everyone. Could potentially give you some ideas related to first-person storytelling if you're a developer, though, and if so that's worth considerably more than the price of entry.","January 12, 2013","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first couple play throughs will interest you to figure out some sort of plot but after numerous attempts you'll find there is no great plot. My best guess is that the entire game has a vague message or that it's attempting to be minimalist high art. It's not a bad experience but it's not really worth your 5$, and that's including that it comes with the game's prequel, Gravity Bone.

But unlike others, this one didnt includes mass amount of metaphors(Im not blaming the metaphors), the author messing up the normal lineal storyline right to the point. This game drives you to think, for the pleasure. Thats might not be a big deal, but, if taking all the people, including the ones who just dont like (or cant understand) the metaphors into the consideration, that makes sense.\n\nThinking is the highest level of entertainment.

The interaction/gameplay is minimal, as the entire game plays out like a movie.  The story itself is incredibly artistic and abstract with no narration, and will probably turn off a lot of traditional players of games (including a few PnC diehards).  The 'director's commentary' is very enlightening to bring a more mundane approach to the story, highlighting small details, to help gamers that found the story too confusing to begin with.  The game is sometimes so subtle in the story that smaller details can go completely unnoticed.\n\nI completed the entire game (seriously, everything the game offered), in 75 minutes.  This included time to hunt for bugs and glitches, do a little in game physics experimentation, watch all of the 'making of' movies in the commentary, commit suicide (wheeeee!) where possible, and of course explore every option in the option menu.  The average gamer will maybe get 45 minutes of entertainment out of it.\n\nI thought it was fun, but this game is better suited for aspiring game creators as a prototype to learn the art of storytelling than it is an actual game for most people.  If it was more fleshed out with back story and interaction/consequences, it would be more suitable for the PnC crowd.","January 15, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But since people are actually playing the game itself rather than the rating, here is the reason why I've spend 2 hours on it (long enough for this short game).\nLike many indie games, this game shares some great features like everyone else, simple mechanism, extraordinary storyline etc. Thats not important for me.\nThe point is the way the game telling the story is funny, its weird, its more like a interactive movie than a game (C'mon, dont reminds me of the real mess of game classification). But unlike others, this one didnt includes mass amount of metaphors(Im not blaming the metaphors), the author messing up the normal lineal storyline right to the point. This game drives you to think, for the pleasure. Thats might not be a big deal, but, if taking all the people, including the ones who just dont like (or cant understand) the metaphors into the consideration, that makes sense.\n\nThinking is the highest level of entertainment.

Yes and no. A very niche sector of gamers would like this. The player character does very little and the lack of action may rub some people the wrong way (well except maybe for Gravity Bone, the free to play prequel included in this release, which has some action).\n\nBut if you enjoy a good piece of fiction and like to piece togheter the events of the game and you don't mind the experience being about ten minutes short, by all means buy this thing!\n\nOn a personal note, I loved it and played it a few times with the developer commentary to gain a better insight of it.","January 24, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The entire experience takes about 10 minutes and there's a developer commentary option too which is text-based and is mostly about the game creator himself than the game but some of the facts are cool to read. The game itself has its moments and it gets pretty intense towards the end.\nAs an added bonus, the developer's previous game, Gravity Bone is also included in the package and can be played from the main menu. The irony here is that the main gem of this package is indeed the older one. Gravity bone is more interactive and has a much less bizarre narrative than 30 Flights of Loving.

I won't call it a game because like Dear Esther, it is an interactive story. The story in Thirty Flights is non-linear, meaning you're told the story in the incorrect order and you're essentially left to piece it all together. While this is a plus, as it helps you take the story as you're required to pay attention and really think about it, the story is nowhere near long enough to be worth the amount you pay.\n\nTypically, I would say that for every £1 (or $1) you spend, a game should give you one hour of gameplay. Now this game is £4, so following that system, you should get 4 hours of gameplay, but even with Gravity Bone included, you don't get that much gameplay, since there is very little replay value. I would say this is the kind of game you would find on a free games website, not something you would pay for. It's just not worth it.\n\nJust to clarify why I liked Dear Esther and not Thirty Flights, Dear Esther actually has some level of replay value, since each time you play, the script changes. So in order to fully understand the story within Dear Esther, you would need to play it multiple times to get all the dialogue.","January 30, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a first-person... adventure? game, and the point to it is in its story, and how it is presented.\n\nVideo game plots are, too often, very ham-fisted. A lot of writers and designers have their work fall flat when dealing with exposition, character relationships, among other things. TFoL is a demonstration of how those problems could be handled: The scenes go on fast, with no spoken words, and yet they manage to convey a lot more meaning and emotional impact than several games said to be "mature" and "visceral" do.\n\nOf course, it's only a demonstration. As such, it is very short and not very interesting to someone who's just looking for a game to have fun, so unless you're a designer, enthusiast, and/or are in the group I mentioned earlier, don't bother. If you are one of those, it's something you should look into.","January 22, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I won't call it a game because like Dear Esther, it is an interactive story. The story in Thirty Flights is non-linear, meaning you're told the story in the incorrect order and you're essentially left to piece it all together. While this is a plus, as it helps you take the story as you're required to pay attention and really think about it, the story is nowhere near long enough to be worth the amount you pay.\n\nTypically, I would say that for every £1 (or $1) you spend, a game should give you one hour of gameplay. Now this game is £4, so following that system, you should get 4 hours of gameplay, but even with Gravity Bone included, you don't get that much gameplay, since there is very little replay value. I would say this is the kind of game you would find on a free games website, not something you would pay for. It's just not worth it.\n\nJust to clarify why I liked Dear Esther and not Thirty Flights, Dear Esther actually has some level of replay value, since each time you play, the script changes. So in order to fully understand the story within Dear Esther, you would need to play it multiple times to get all the dialogue.","January 30, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Using the iceberg princible the story gives you bare minimun of details and setting, then you as the player must piece together what happened. And that's about the whole game, So if you love good story games and don't mind playing it over and over again to try and solve what happens, then this game is perfect for you and I highly recommend it.","February 16, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I recommend them as experiences but that is all they are. They hardly qualify as games so I wouldn't pay full price for them. Gravity Bone was originally available as a free download on the Blendo Games website. While it was short, it had some minor gameplay elements. It had the use of items and some minor platforming but ,overall, the game felt like a tech demo. It felt like it was only a sample of what was to come. So when Thirty Flights of Loving was released I assumed that it would be a full length game with more items, more locations, more vague Gravity Bone spy story, and more platforming, puzzle solving, etc. But Thirty Flights of Loving has even less gameplay. You more or less walk through the story with little to no interaction. While it was a fun experience, I don't believe that it is something that should be advertised and sold as a game. It should have been released for free alongside Gravity Bone on the Blendo Games website.","February 26, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, while the length did not disappoint,the game did. Compared to Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights Of Loving focuses more on trying to tell a story and ends up jumping around a lot in time and space and features more interactions with non-player characters. Unlike Gravity Bone, which had at least a few jumping puzzles, there is really no challenge at all to the game. The story also feels much less player-driven: as I mentioned before, it jumps around a lot in time instead of allowing the player to explore and experience the game at their own pace.\n\nNot worth $5.\n\nIf you haven't played Gravity Bone, the original game, I implore you to check it out. It's a really cool, mysterious game that does a lot in a short time. And it's free to download at the Blendo Games website.","May 10, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no open world, no dialog trees, and no dialog - plain and and simple..  It's short story told with narrative concision.\n\nA lot of the TFoL's story is subtley told through the environment or "mise en scene".  Even the disjointed narrative can slowly be pieced back into a chronological order when you assess your surroundings.  There's a difference between a game that smash-cuts to the past with an accompanying "3 days prior..." intertitle and one that lets the viewer/interactee figure it out on their own.\n\nThe director's commentary is also a great addition for anyone interested in the developers design choices.

However, while the length did not disappoint,the game did. Compared to Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights Of Loving focuses more on trying to tell a story and ends up jumping around a lot in time and space and features more interactions with non-player characters. Unlike Gravity Bone, which had at least a few jumping puzzles, there is really no challenge at all to the game. The story also feels much less player-driven: as I mentioned before, it jumps around a lot in time instead of allowing the player to explore and experience the game at their own pace.\n\nNot worth $5.\n\nIf you haven't played Gravity Bone, the original game, I implore you to check it out.

There is none of that here; You prep for a mission and then the games skips to the end before you even realize it. It does flashbacks, stylized shots, and vague narrative the same way Tarantino does movies, minus dialogue of course.

Even the disjointed narrative can slowly be pieced back into a chronological order when you assess your surroundings.  There's a difference between a game that smash-cuts to the past with an accompanying "3 days prior..." intertitle and one that lets the viewer/interactee figure it out on their own.\n\nThe director's commentary is also a great addition for anyone interested in the developers design choices.

I recommend this to anyone who's interested in video games as a storytelling medium. It's short but it's an experience you'll remember, even if you don't understand it (I'm not sure I did).","January 20","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes it is short and yes a lot of people feel that it is not worth the price of admittance. Yes you could go watch a lets play if you feel like that is good enough. But it does include Gravity Bone in case you have not played that as well as an interesting commentary mode which should be noted.\n\nIn regards to price, this game was offered as a reward for the Idle Thumbs Kickstarter, I do not believe it was intended to be a standalone title. I see the price more as a punishment for not contributing to the kickstarter. Whether you want to buy it and take the ride is up to you.\n\nAs another review notes, I've spent more time thinking about this game than I did playing it. To me that's a good thing, it's an interesting stylistic experience that someone put some heart and soul into and to me that's inspiring and motivating.","May 8","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you see people claiming this is a five minute game you know they paid zero attention, did not bother to engage their brain (assuming they've got one), and simply ran through it. Don't rush, think as you move through the space, and don't assume the game's going to change your life just because it got some good reviews. It--like its predecessor, Gravity Bone, which is included--is a trifle in the best possible.","December 22, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both Gravity Bone(included) and Thirty Flights are extremely short, but surreal experiences. Is it worth the money? eh. If you think you'd like to fully experience the game then sure, but you can really just watch a youtube video. Not to forget the game is dissapointingly short. The game has many interesting and inspiring ideas that should be the creativity of most other games today.","May 20","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a delightful artstyle. Slighty interseting, very confusing, and strange. If it's on sale for a dollar I'd reccommend it, otherwise hop on youtube and have yourself a watch. It's just a like a tech demo really.","May 13","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
