I like you kid.\nThis review will not contain any spoilers.\n\nKathy Rain is a point & click adventure game developed by Clifftop Games. You play as Kathy Rain, a third year journalism student who fancies herself as a bit of a detective. After the death of your grandfather, Joseph Rain, you decide to return to your hometown of Conwell Springs for the first time since you were a child to attend your grandfather’s funeral. After the funeral, Kathy begins investigating a local mystery which has been left unsolved for a decade, as you investigate you’ll learn more about Kathy’s past as well as the people in the town.\n\nWorth a mention: It took me just shy of five hours to complete the story but it seems like the average completion time is eight-ten hours, probably due to the achievements in the game that I didn’t get.\n\nWhen I first saw Kathy Rain (the game) I was unsure about the fact that the game is in a 4:3 aspect ratio. Thankfully KR is visually very good. The 4:3 aspect ratio works well (the window is automatically sized to your monitor with black bars on either side in fullscreen or you can just play in a 320x240 window) and the pixel art graphics are fantastic. There’s not a huge amount of detail in the characters (not really an issue) but the backgrounds for the different locations are absolutely fantastic. During dialogue a portrait for the character speaking is displayed on-screen, these are also fantastic and their facial expression changes so it’s appropriate for what they’re saying which is a nice touch.\n\nKR is, at its heart, a story-driven game and so it’s obviously incredibly important that KR has a solid, engaging plot. Luckily for those interested in playing the game, it does indeed have an excellent, well-written plot. What begins as a simple investigation into a decade-old incident quickly becomes something far more intriguing and sinister over the course of the five days the game takes place in. To uncover the truth you’ll find yourself speaking to many different residents of Conwell Springs which also means you’ll get to visit a fair few locations. I can’t really say much more than that without spoiling the game but it really is an enjoyable story, particularly if you’re a fan of detective stories like I am.\n\nThe actual gameplay consists of solving puzzles. I found them to be quite challenging as someone who doesn’t usually play point & click games but genre veterans may not find them too difficult (there are hints in the game for how to solve them anyway). The puzzles aren’t just thrown in for a bit of gameplay here and there, they are actually used to advance the plot which makes solving them far more enjoyable. Some puzzles will require the use of items you have previously collected from somewhere which are stored in your inventory. While it is possible to miss these items you can always go back to the location they are in later to collect them if you need them.\n\nAs well as a small bag which serves as your inventory, Kathy also carries around a notepad. The notepad is used by Kathy to note down anything which comes up when speaking to a character that needs some more information, i.e. something you’ll need to talk to another character about. As you uncover more information about certain things Kathy will automatically update her notes so she can ask the other characters for more relevant information. The notepad is also home to telephone numbers which you find in the phone book at your grandma’s house.\n\nSo, more about interacting with other characters. For the most part you don’t have any dialogue choices when interacting with other characters (apart from choosing when to ask them what from your notepad, though that doesn’t really have an effect) and when you are given the opportunity to choose what you want to say it doesn’t really make a difference to the overall outcome. Personally, I don’t think this is a problem, KR has a semi-linear story (I say semi because you have some control over what order you do things in) and the story is good enough so that it manages to be entertaining even with little player influence over the story.\n\nWhat’s super important when it comes to story-driven games? The voice acting! The voice acting in Kathy Rain is excellent. There were a few times in the game where I thought there was too much of a gap between one character’s line and then the next character’s line but that’s not a huge problem. The actors themselves did a fantastic job at bringing the game’s characters to life, they’re very compelling performances and they make the story feel real.\n\nCircling back to the whole semi-linear story thing, you can decide what locations to visit and when (you have to have unlocked the location before you can visit it mind you but you unlock new locations as you progress through the story). When Kathy leaves a location she hops on her customised Corley motorcycle and you’re then presented with a screen where you can choose from any of the locations you’ve unlocked. As you near the end of the game some locations will become greyed out (you can’t return to them) but this only happens for minor locations where you’ve already exhausted the location’s relevance to the plot. For the rest of the game you’re able to choose where to go when and since there is some wiggle room when it comes to what order you can do things in this does give you a tad bit of freedom.\n\nVerdict\nKathy Rain is an excellent point & click game with an intriguing story, compelling characters, fantastic voice acting and a great visual style. If you’re a fan of story-driven games then this is definitely worth checking out.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","May 5","true","6.5"," 60 of 74 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","60","74","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/370910/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","Kathy Rain takes place in 1995 and stars the titular character, a no-nonsense young woman who returns to her childhood hometown of Conwell Springs after many years after hearing news of her grandfather’s death. As Kathy explores her old hometown she begins to uncover a secret of the town’s past, one that her grandfather tried to uncover himself years ago which left him a broken shell of a man.\n\nIt’s not hard to see that Gabriel Knight was a major influence for Kathy Rain. The game opens up with Kathy catching up with her Grandma in the old family home just like Gabe did with Grandma Knight in GK1. The game is also separated in days just like the Gabriel Knight games. Kathy Rain does a good job taking GK’s influence and doing well with it. One could even say it’s a quality spiritual successor.\n\nKathy Rain has a really good atmosphere, channeling that sense of slow burn mystery that made GK1 such a great game as well getting across the feeling of a lived in small town. The art is of the same high quality as the recent WadjetEye games and its soundtrack of ambient guitar tracks also helps the feel. Writing wise it’s mostly quite good. Most of the primary main cast such as Kathy have depth and they mystery is an interesting one that will keep you engaged. I’ve seen some people here complain that the ending doesn’t solve anything, but I thought it was fine considering what road the narrative went down. Dave Gilbert, the head of WadjetEye, was the VA director and it shows. The voice-acting is some good stuff, namely Kathy’s VA who also did Max Lao in Technobabylon.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly pretty good. It’s more akin to the Blackwell series’ puzzles were the main focus is investigation, dialogue, and simple inventory puzzles. Kathy even has a notebook like Rosa does. There is only one puzzle that I say sucks because it’s this big riddle type of puzzle that due to some awkward wording is way harder than it should be. (Like for an example ignoring that the narrative has a given another meaning to a phrase in the riddle that seems like that it would be more relevant than the actual solution.)There is another puzzle that while not obtuse, rather falls into the sociopathic adventure game protagonist solution problem, which is a bit jarring for a game that’s trying to be more human and serious.\n\nOverall Kathy Rain is yet another addition to  the high-quality adventure games of recent years. I’m definitely up for more of it if that happens.","May 8","true","6.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aliceh/recommended/370910/","aliceh","Alice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aliceh/","66 products in account","What starts off as a intriguing mystery game soon turns a lot creepier and darker than you expect. There's also a huge amount of the game that can be interpreted in many ways, which I think really keeps the mystery going. Ultimately, it is more than about what happened to her grandfather, and a lot about Kathy struggling to put the past behind her.\n\nThe game itself, while a little shorter than some similar games (I initially found it remeniscent of games like The Longest Journey, and there's quite a similarity between the two protagonists), has a mostly strong story. There are a couple of things that could have been elaborated on, and some that seemed to go on for too long, but that's the same with any game like this. The way you do things is not completely rigid, but you don't get the same aspect of control over everything - for example, while you occasionally get the options for different responses to people, most of the time it seems to have no future effect.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are quite well thought-out, though at times they are not obvious, and you might find yourself reaching for a walkthrough once or twice. There's nothing that doesn't make sense once you've done it, but a few (such as getting the clinic receptionist away from her desk) aren't what most would think of doing.\n\nThere also seems to be a running theme of mental illness throughout the game, and it's great to see it dealt with outside of the usual serial killer/unintelligible rambler tropes. Kathy is clearly troubled by the difficulties of those around her, despite her attitude, and it's subtly played throughout the game as she turns from a feisty no-s**ts-given biker chick, to a vulnerable woman whose past is possibly leading her to the same fate as her mother.\n\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this game. It brings up more emotions than you'd initially expect, and while quite short, the story is fantastic and it's well worth the money.","May 7","true","4.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Designed with a classic low resolution look however the graphics are extremely crisp and detailed. The music fits the game very well and sets a nice tone for each of the scene. The voice acting is extremely well done, especially for a small indie studio. This was a coment noted a number of times in twitch chat.\n\nI will refrain from going to much into the story as it should be experienced however the game ended leaving some deep and dark thoughts in my head. The pace of the game is good, the obligatory puzzles werent incredibly tough. For times where I had to think Kathy was always on hand to offer her thoughts which usually pushed me in the direction I needed to go to proceed. It is somewhat linear as with most adventures however I was hooked from start to finish.\n\nAs noted at the start, if your an adventure aficionado you owe it to yourself to play this game.

Its storyline invokes the 90s as well, with magical mental illness and a Very Special Episode plotline tossed in for pure shock value. Like the television fantasy dramas it draws inspiration from it also promises more than it ever delivers on, wrapping up in a mundane, though not unsatisfying, ending.\n\nThat said, the above is what makes the difference between a reccommendation and an enthusiastic reccommendation. Whatever you go into Kathy Rain looking for you're probably going to find it. I forgot to turn off the voice acting when I started (an instinct learned from Blackwell games) and the experience was much the richer for it. I don't know if the developer has the desire to attempt more in their next game, but I'd trust them to achieve it.","May 15","true","5.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There really needs to be a midpoint grade on Steam. But, I can't quite go as far as definitively "not recommending" Kathy Rain.\n\nWhether or not it's worth playing is a matter of interpretation. There's been a real lack of old-school P+C adventure games for a while now, and this will scratch an itch, but have a luke warm after taste. If time is precious and you're looking for quality in the realms of the Broken Sword games, though, you certainly won't find it here.\n\nPros -\n\nNice retro art style. The pixelation may just be a tad too far, but it works for the most part.\n\nFull voice acting - really well done too.\n\nMostly logical path progression. None of the bizarre and nonsensical methods of furthering the story with certain puzzles found in games of its ilk are found here.\n\nCons -\n\nThe story as a whole is very frail and quite slipshod. It's no surprise that references to Jacob's Ladder and other psychological related themes are found here. The problem is the game never really builds the house with which to explore the psycho-babble that presents itself toward the end of the game. Very minor, one-shot flashbacks are the sole source of story-engineering in relation to the main character, and it all comes across as gibberish that you won't care to analyze, unlike, say, a Silent Hill game, where there is a lot more to delve into. A cardinal sin of story telling is to unleash these elements long after the second act has passed. You change the genre and nature of your story at that point, and you have clearly no grasp of your plot, and neither does your audience.\n\nThe puzzles range from the incredibly simple to the incredibly simple but vague. Because of the small game areas it's never too hard to guess what actions you need to progress the story. And the puzzles never provide any real brains, except from a few downright nonsensical ones that involve partial riddle-solving that most likely seemed a good idea to the writer at the time. All the difficulty is kind of snuffed out when you can just randomly enter solutions with little recourse, though.\n\n\nAll in all, Kathy Rain has some things going for it. The main character runs the show well. The plot for the first 2 acts has intrigue. However, the creator either lost track of the story he wanted to tell, or just didn't realize how half baked the execution of the final act was.","May 22","true","8.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Armed with her motorcycle, a pack of cigs, and a notepad, Kathy begins to delve into a local mystery surrounding her hometown that will take her on a harrowing journey full of emotional and personal turmoil.\nI gotta say that, at first, I was really digging the story: the characters were fun, the mystery was intriguing, and the twists were unexpected. But the more I played the game, the more paranormal things started to happen and that started ruining the whole experience. The ending was not good, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. The first three days are very good, but the last two are full of WTF moments.\n\nGRAPHICSThe pixelated art style is full of vibrant colors and rich of details. The character portraits are also well done, with different expressions depending on how they are talking.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe same old point-and-click formula: talk to people, pick up objects, solve puzzles. There are some interesting sequences, but it mostly feels like a "been there done that" situation. But it still is done very well, and there are many objects to interact with, without feeling too much like you are pixel-hunting.\n\nCHALLENGEOne early puzzle aside, there are plenty of clues both from the dialogues and from your in-game thoughts that will let you know what to do next without feeling like they are spilling the solution.\n\nSOUNDThe voice acting is mostly good, with a couple of actors being a bit over-the-top and the lead actress being pretty great. The soundtrack is also okay, but it never reaches a "memorable" level (except for the 45-seconds loop when you have to choose where to go next).\n\nREPLAYABILITYMy first gameplay run took me a little over 3 hours to complete. There are some instances in which you can choose what to say in dialogue without having any consequences for the future. There are some achievements that might be missed quite easily since they require you to use various objects in weird ways, but I won't probably play this again.\n\nOverall, this is a decent adventure game that delivers a compelling story with fun puzzles, that is almost ruined by its ending.\n\nStory: 6.5\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 6.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 3\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","May 9","true","4.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

She also humorously breaks the fourth wall when commenting certain commands and that's something that had me chuckle a few times. The plot, without spoiling anything, is solid and the mystery you're called to investigate goes down the rabbit hole a good way, sometimes giving eerie vibes that- for me- echoed shows like Twin Peaks.\n\nAs gameplay goes the puzzles are serviceable and straightforward, I think most of them will probably feel quite easy for most people so don't expect your brain to be majorly tested: while this keeps the adventure flowing smoothly it's a bit of a shame we didn't get more of a challenge.\n\nAs gripes go, having to click a bag and then use tiny arrows for the inventory feels a bit clunky in the long run, a more modern approach with a disappearing inventory'd have worked better. Animations when you enter/ exit a zone, especially those involving the motorcycle, can get dull as you revisit zones: call me spoiled but I'd have liked a "double click to quick navigate". Last but not least a few characters just seemed to be there to fill me with background information and/ or leads and were somewhat lacking in depth.\n\nAll things considered Kathy Rain is a well crafted adventure that I recommend to both seasoned players, who'd find a worthy detective story and captivating protagonist, and newcomers to the genre due to its straightforward puzzles.","May 5","true","7.5"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

Seven hours well spent! I did pick it up at full price, and can even recommend it at full price.

The art is beautiful, and the writing is very good. The gameplay is standard adventure game stuff, but that's not the main focus here. The puzzles make sense for the plot, and don't feel like they've been shoehorned in to give you something to do.\n\nMy only issues are:\n\n- The character of Kathy's mother is not not explored well enough. The game doesn't give you any reasons to care about her, or her place in Kathy's past and the story as a whole.\n\n- The plot shifts in tone a little to abrubtly when you start to find out what's actually happening. I feel like it could have transitioned into the weirdness that is the last act more gradually and gracefully.","May 11","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But i plan to buy and give away a key a soon i get some money together because i want to support the dev.\n\nKathy Rain is a point and click adventure game made with the AGS (Adventure Game Studio) engine. The game mechanics have it's own particularities but it is the similar to other game of this genre. You can think about, look and combine items in your inventory, and you also have a notebook where the important clues are wrote down, you will be able to use these to work out the next course of action and also as conversation topics.\n\nThe history unfolds in the great 90's, leaded by a independent girl that studies journalism. She learns about the dead of her grandfather a decides to pay the visit she hesitated doing for many years. Her rebellious and bold spirit will make her get involved in an old strange case and help her investigate using methods that will lead her further than any cop could do when the case was open. It will be a travel to the past.\n\nI honestly love everything about this game, the art and the setting is perfect, the characters are compelling and some of them lovable, the voice acting is superb, the story makes you want to keep playing and want more, the puzzles offer a very decent challenge, not very hard if you are used to this kind of games but not extremely easy either. Playing with all that 20 year old junk was a blast and made me feel nostalgic.\n\nI really hope the dev gets enough support, i can see enough similarities with blackwell here to see it could be a successful series if it's given a chance. The detective is born but she needs to grown, this game is screaming for a sequel.","June 3","true","30.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Is it a thrilling crime story? Is it a supernatural mystery? Is it just going to leave you standing there disappointed, ending with a giant cliffhanger? (The answers to those questions are "maybe?", "maybe?", and "hell no!", by the way.)\n\nIf you're a fan of the Wadjet Eye games in particular or just enjoy a good adventure in general, Kathy Rain won't disappoint.

Where do I begin?\n\nWell, for starters - the story is supposed to take place in 1995, but I hardly saw this reflected in game.\n\nKathy's style (as displayed thru the dialogue boxes, in the form of a portret) looked far too modern! (think, today's emo/punk scene).\n\nThe 90s punk & grunge style originally looked more simplistic and basic (the cuts, patterns & colours were different back then, and didn't seem as sophisticated, glamorous or expansive as today's style).\n\nThough Kathy's pixelated version reflected the 90s grunge style better, her body frame on the other hand, didn't corroborate with what she looked like through the dialogues (more petite & delicate in her portret, but a heck of a lot more curvaceous and fleshy in pixelated form - heck she even had these weird blue alien-like eyes that creeped me out, haha!).\n\nSo it felt like playing 2 different characters, instead of just one.\n\nAnd because of this lack of consistency, I didn't feel as immersed by the story, as I would have liked.\n\nAnother odd thing I noticed was, even though Kathy's journey takes place over a 5-day span (in-game), it sure didn't look or feel like it to me - especially day 2 was surprisingly short and seemed rushed.\n\nAlso, at some point, I was pretty grossed out by the fact the character didnt even bother to change clothes once, or wash up. There was no visual trace of a sink or bathroom/restroom (or mention of it!), even though at times she is specifically shown at her dorm, crashing in bed (WITH her clothes on, jacket included! - not even having the decency to remove her boots), arising the next morning and leaving.\n\nThis seemed very odd to me, because they put an emphasis on it, by showing her do this - not once, but *twice*.\n\nHad they done this only once, I would have considered it pretty human. I would've thought to myself: okay, let's give the girl a break - she's clearly exhausted from all that investigating and hopping back & forth.\n\nBut the second time; I thought to myself: "Ok, this is starting to look weird. What self-respecting student does that? It doesn't make any sense - especially for this girl!". So it seemed like something the developers either honestly overlooked, or just did for convenience.\n\nHowever.... these are the kind of details, when overlooked, that can break a character or harm their credibility.\n\nFortunately, Kathy's appearance, tone of voice & speech style really provided a good balance to her seemingly "odd" habit. Her character development was also well executed (she's the sassy independent type, honest & loyal, but somewhat rebellious, very blunt and not afraid to break some rules, but without causing harm to others ... or at least, almost ;) ).\n\nThanks to her tumultuous childhood, she's familiar with the principle of "tough love" and is not afraid to apply it!\n\nAs for the puzzles; I liked how they were graphically presented, but the solution to some of these felt surprisingly bland, so much that my first reflex was to overthink and not try the most obvious solution first (because I thought to myself - "nah there's no way they would have made it that easy, right?").\n\nThink again - d'oh! For seasoned players (such as myself), this might be quite disappointing.\n\nAs a consequence, I had very little patience with some of them, and was even baffled by one in particular where I totally didn't pick up on any leads or hints to proceed (near the end of the game).\n\nSo most of the puzzles took the fun out of playing for me.\n\nThere was also a lack of facial expressions as well. The game felt rather barren in that respect. I expected at least a bit more, but nope. The few ones were however pretty cute.\n\nThe music (per event) didn't always feel quite right, imo (as in, lacking suspense) - though I did like what little music there was (per area).\n\nThe addition of more thrilling sounds would have made a bigger impact, but the sound was definitely positive as is.\n\nAt times, the subcharacters' reactions seemed unnatural (especially their tone of voice didn't fit all situations).\n\nLike, one minute they sounded upset and in an instant they went back to normal like nothing happened (i.e. the sheriff).\n\nFinally, the plot was inspired by a 90s mystery/thriller show (which I've seen!) and to be honest, I felt like the developers relied too much on that and the story lacked greatly in originality, though I believe they have great potential.\n\nIn the end, I did enjoy the game (but I also believe this is because I actually liked the show it was based on, to begin with). If it wasn't for the show, I don't think I would have appreciated this game as much, as it seems rather nonsensical (but so did the show, so hey!).\n\nI can only hope that one day, the developers will have the (much needed) inspiration and courage to come up with something of their own, because all-in-all the game was of very decent quality and they could create something really neat!\n\nI consider this game an experiment :).\n\nAny lovers of the genre will probably like it though as the UI, dialogues, graphics & gameplay were all neatly executed (i.e. quality-wise it's very much like Gabriel Knight & Blackwell, which is why I didn't bother going into detail about this).\n\nThere was a lot of deja-vu in this game (unfortunately for me), but some may actually appreciate this.","May 7","true","12.1"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","12","22","2","1"

The story's good, nicely rooted and by turns off the wall in a pleasing way, and the voice acting - directed by Dave Gilbert of Wadjet Eye fame - is excellent.  Great use of the Adventure Game Studio engine as well, the notebook which keeps track of your investigation is really nicely implemented and there are some really fantastic bits of attention to detail (like in the aesthetic of the computer puzzles, this being 1995).  Truly impressive 5 hours from a tiny studio on their (his!) debut effort.  Hope Clifftop does well out of this and makes more.

However, the experience this title gave me changed my mind drastically. In a matter of minutes, the design, soundtrack, setting... They made me feel a love for this genre I don´t enjoy since I got absorbed by Silent Hill: Shattered Memories long ago.\n\nAs I mentioned, the atmosphere as a whole is great. Good enough to let the mouse untouched for a while and just stare at the scenery, turn up the volume of the ambient music and just tell yourself: this can´t be bad...\nKathy was a character of my taste and all of the others are interesting, well constructed and developed and everything had a more than decent background. Would also like toa add the fact the plot happens in the mid' 1990s is just an upturn for me. The effort put into this setting is something I appreciated as much as in Gone Home.\n\nSpoilers usually don´t feel good, so besides vaguely mentioning the period in which takes place, I won´t tell you anything else. Worth the price, worth the time, expecting a sequel.\n\nPS: don´t check the Metacritic score, the fact there´s only a single review (and positive for the matter, even recommending you too to avoid the web´s current score) is enough for heading back to Steam and check the vastly good reputation Kathy Rain is buliding up.","May 15","true","9.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For a start, it’s set in the year 1995, with all of that period's now-weird retro quirks intact. I suppose it’s quite a clever way to make players look stupid when they roll their eyes at a perplexing clue and yell “just Google it!” at the screen. And the title reminds you of its era in other ways, like when it has you hack computers with floppy disks and calls those bulbous CRT monitors you still hide in your loft "cutting edge." But, more than that, it’s a proper old-school adventure game in the same vein as classic fare such as Full Throttle and Gabriel Knight. It consists of pixel graphics and inventory puzzles and people who don't get annoyed after being asked the same question or shown the same item dozens of times as you seek out increasingly obscure solutions to problems you just can’t solve.\n\nThere’s not a lot of that last thing, to be fair. Kathy has increasingly bizarre discoveries to make, but the mystery she hopes to solve never requires ludicrous leaps of logic. Or, at least, it never ventures beyond that special Adventure Game Logic™ that insists all of the world’s complications can be solved with obscure lateral thinking and whatever junk we can cram into the infinite spaces that are our pockets.\n\nFull review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12972/pc/kathy-rain/review.html","May 5","true","10.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Many of the puzzles were closer akin to what a detective would do than your typical adventure game "pick up x object in one room to use on y object in another room" puzzles. But then the game starts getting deeper into supernatural elements, and once it does the puzzles start looking like typical adventure game puzzles that aren't as fun to solve. It doesn't help that the supernatural stuff is hinted at throughout, and you quickly get that frustrating feeling where the main character hasn't already figured out what's going on and you're yelling "just open your eyes! come on!"\n\nOverall, because I think the later portions of the game are so weak compared to the earlier ones, I can't recommend this game.","May 14","false","4.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Squee. An investigation of an intriguing slightly ominous mystery with cool characters, funny dialogues and neat puzzles? Yes, yes please! I want to rub my face in these things like a herd of cats on a field of valerian plants. It's been such a long time since Gray Matter got released. Don't mind that the face gets red and a bit flattened when you rub it over your computer screen, just give me these things nao.\n\nBut there's no escaping that this is a story-driven game, which ultimately can't evade being judged by its story. Which is a well-delivered, intriguing, suspenseful, at times brilliant pile of cat ♥♥♥♥ that entirely unsuspiciously appeared on the former field of the valerian plants. I mean, seriously, the resolution and the whole mystery by extention just... suck. And this, sadly, won't do at all. It could work if everything wasn't hinged on them, if they were there to add some flavour to the story about completely different things. Hell, it could work even if the focus was shifted a little and everything wasn't so convinient and fitting for the protagonist. But that is not the case. The whole plot relies on the mystery (and this is a huge part of the appeal in the cases when the mystery does get pulled off), but when the mystery sucks, you can't really do anything. The whole game just turns into a huge letdown. You just feel like being slapped in the face while you're too busy rubbing it in your computer screen to see it coming.\n\nI mean, seriously, if the resolution to the whole thing was Sam Fisher hiding in the woods, it'd still be better. Heck, it would be better if the resolution to the whole thing was the protagonist being hypnotized by a hallucinations-inducing wolf before being eaten. There's literally almost nothing worse than the explanation to the mystery we get. Maybe it being ripped off from Twin Peaks in a really bad way, without understanding of what made Twin Peaks so cool? Oh wait.\n\nWell, there's a good side to all this. Somewhere. Probably. Maybe?

The mature themes combined with engaging puzzles for the most part and a character type that I had not really played before was frankly a great experience.

There's some good mystery elements at the core here, as the build up to what has happened in the small town does do the job rather well. Good environmental storytelling and a cast of interesting characters help this, and the game sets a nice pace to tell jokes (or at least try to in some cases), as well hit some interesting topics that other games shy away from. Now it's not all sunshine and happiness, as some uneven plot threads hinder the main storyline, and a twist towards the middle can turn some people off. The puzzles are good, not to the point of pulling your hair out, but giving you a slight challenge that you'd expect for a game like this, without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t logic muking it up.  But for the 6-8 hours it'll take you to beat, you'll go on a reasonable ride that's got some emotional highs and lows.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nEnvironmental storytelling is done very well, giving characters good personality without directly saying it.\nHits some hard topics. This isn't a game that pulls punches, which is nice to see.\nGood intrigue build early on to get you hooked on what's going to happen later on.\nPuzzles are reasonable, not being too difficult, but having you scratch your head once in a while.\nCharacters reasonably likable after getting to know them. Seems like something that would have\nGood hints and clues are available around the environment in question, so that it's easy to pick up what to do.\n80s and 90s kids will appreciate some of the references in the game.\nThe whole character of Goober being basically a Rodney Dangerfield clone. The moves in particular are hilarious.\nYou won't get lost a lot.

Hard to describe without spoiling.\nSome plot threads don't end by the end of this story, which sucks as they were rather interesting. Sequel bait? Possibly.\nSome jokes early really miss the mark.\nScanners don't have the ability to scan audio. I'm sorry, they don't. You may wonder what this is referring to.

Her utterly routine life gets a rude awakening when she learns of her estranged Grandfather’s funeral. Like a good granddaughter, she heads back to her home town to see him laid to rest. She learns that her Grandfather was inexplicably discovered in a vegetative state not long after she left town. A simple query into his ailment leads her into a long mysterious journey.\n\nKathy Rain is very reminiscent of adventure titles like Gabriel Knight and shows like Twin Peaks. It follows Kathy through a grounded mystery with some supernatural elements thrown in. I played the game for five hours straight trying to understand where the story was heading.\n\nThere were areas when the game introduced supernatural elements, but the time surrounding these small moments often headed into muddy waters. Kathy obviously had a troubled life growing up with her mother after leaving Conwell Springs and has various bad dreams due to it.\n\nThe game touches on these dreams of her past so vaguely you might start to wonder why any of it was included. The dream events eventually flesh themselves out near the end but I had already forgotten most of the elements by that time.\n\nI’m not saying that the story itself isn’t compelling because it’ll keep you hungry for that next piece of the puzzle. But if you aren’t a patient person you could lose interest in the tale in just a few hours.  I’m trying not to spoil anything so I’ll just say that everything Kathy goes through is extremely mundane.\n\nFor instance, she’ll have to use a floppy disk to steal an IT Tech’s password. Make a Bloody Mary to gain a Motorcycle Gang Leader’s trust. Needless to say, Kathy spends a lot of her time in low risk situations trying to solve a mystery that tries its hardest to stay hidden.\n\nSpeaking of the puzzles, they are fairly appealing for the genre. Everything except for the damn briefcase puzzle is intuitive and engaging. Seriously, the briefcase brainteaser doesn’t make any damn sense compared to the rest of the riddles in the game. Every other puzzle gives us a logical idea of a problem and enough explanation on how to solve it.\nYou won’t have to do any pixel hunting in this game due to the reasonable puzzle structure.\n\nKathy Rain is very straightforward about what it wants out of us as players. It keeps the story moving which works wonders because of the obvious pacing issues with the story. The brainteasers are well thought out and a contain some out of the box thinking compared many adventure titles. One of my favorites involves ripping words out of an audio tape to use it to trick someone into helping Kathy get her way.\n\nStepping away from the gameplay, let’s talk about the visuals a bit. Kathy Rain is another game that harkens back to the good ol’ times of adventure gaming. Expect pixelated sprites surrounded by detailed and colorful backdrops.\n\nThere are quite a few idle animations but frames were saved when it comes to characters speaking. The character portraits are distinctly represent each actor on screen. Although they are devoid of animation, they do change moods during dialogue sequences.\n\nThe voiceover is overall pretty great but some of the character voices are too soft. The music is slightly basic with only a few tunes actually sticking in my mind.\n\nKathy Rain is an amusing adventure that takes a little too long to get off the ground. It’s not Final Fantasy XIII tutorial levels long but the overall mystery stays buried for far longer than it should. It’s a fascinating mystery on the level of a Murder She Wrote, but those looking for more twists and turns may want to look elsewhere. I recommend this to fans of the Mystery genre but if you have any problem with a story taking more than five hours to flesh out… you need not apply.","May 5","true","6.5"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

The story was well written, the game-play was easy to navigate, the art was great even in it's simplicity.

There was no warning that this wouldn't be realistic, so that put me off a bit.

Kathy Rain is the story of a budding journalist in college who has to come to terms with her troubled past as she investigates the death of her recently deceased grandfather. The journey will take Kathy to the town of Conwell Springs, where she’ll begin to dig into a local mystery surrounding her hometown, taking her on a road full of emotional rollercoasters along the way.\n\nKathy Rain is about as standard a click-and-point adventure game could get. You have an items menu, a motorcycle to travel around on (more on this later), a notepad where Kathy will write down those important notes to talk to those in the town with, and of course, you have the ability to combine item a with item b along with the ability to view items yourself and ask people about certain items. Truthfully, it’s fairly plain, but that’s not inherently a bad thing. You’ll play as Kathy, run around, talk to people, solve a mystery, have a crisis, it’s bordering an old, Hanna Barbara Scooby Doo plot level of ham, complete with a certain character getting kidnapped. Just don’t go looking into something unique in terms of gameplay, because that’s not the hook, and the game doesn’t pretend for it to be the hook. There is one thing that sets the gameplay apart, which is the motorcycle.\n\nThe motorcycle allows Kathy to ‘travel’ to certain points of significance in the story. Along the way, she’ll travel to places like lakeside cabins, the home of her grandmother, and a mysterious church. It’s a neat feature but really, it’s more a way to hide the fact that there’s no actual ‘overworld’ and instead, relies on the motorcycle traveling acting as a sort of hubworld for the game. It’s nice for the developers because it means you don’t have to build a huge, giant city or town to explore. It’s sad for the players because (in most cases) those overworlds are used to add personality and character to both the game itself, and the characters. Since that overworld really only exists metaphorically (I.E, the town of Conwell Springs) you lose a lot of that character and personality along the way. You also lose out on any other side-quests or adventures because the lack of an overworld. However, the gain is that the game can focus almost solely on Kathy and her story. The question is, how is the story?\n\nTo answer in the best way we can, it lacks a clear focus. We won’t spoil any huge plot points, but the game’s story is it’s central focus, and it seems rather off. The story starts off rather well, even complete with the cliché 90s things we know and love, but the focus on who’s story we’re trying to tell seems split between the dead grandfather, and the granddaughter Kathy. This wouldn’t be bad, but at the very end of the game, it’s heavily implied that Kathy was close to the grandfather, when in reality, it’s never really shown in game. As a matter of fact, towards the end, you’ll find a very important note, and she replies “ He did try to fight for me, up until the very end” and we had presumed she was talking about the father, who walked out on her and her mother when Kathy was six. But (without spoiling it) Kathy then has an epiphany, and says less than 30 minutes later that she’s over the father, and we just had this really bothered look. Turns out, it wasn’t the father who tried to fight for her [from the mother], but the grandfather, and we were just really dumbfounded. We presumed that the father was the one because Kathy mentions the mother constantly lying about people, and the fact that the father walked out combined gave us the impression it would have been the father that would have tried to fight for her.\n\nThe game constantly tries to imply that the grandfather and Kathy had this really great relationship, but there’s few times where we actually get hints of it. Like, everyone around Kathy talks about the relationship, but it’s only mentioned once of ever having one. When something happens involving these two at the end, we just felt sorely disconnected by it all. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and the story still isn’t awful, it’s just above average. The thing is, besides this lack of focus, everyone else is interesting. All the characters are (if a bit generic) defined and unique, and everyone has the traits to be really interesting. The only one that feels rather ‘token’ is the main character, Kathy Rain. She has some interesting things that go on around her, about her, and to her, but she herself is rather ‘meh’. She does have a defined personality, and she does have a character arc (which we can’t say about a lot of recent adventure games have) but the character arc feels really forced towards the end and without the punk, rebellious teen character traits, the game gives almost an impression of a character that could have easily been replaced. She’s not bad to play as or anything, she’s just rather ‘there’ rather than being ‘THERE’ .\n\nThere’s also the token puzzle elements filled with token. They’re there, they exist, and they’re not bad or good, rather than being simply there. Some work, some don’t. On the plus side, most of them are short, fairly obvious, avoid (for the most part) Sierra levels of stupid and ridiculous, and mostly work with the story. None of them are particularly fun to play, but they’re certainly not bad as they could be.\n\nVisually, the game looks well, and is fairly reminiscent of the Blackwell games. While Kathy Rain doesn’t have any particularly unique style, it does look nice and places well. It uses AGS (Adventure Game Studio) and plays in a weird resolution (thanks to AGS) . It works for the game, but modifying the engine to support other resolutions would be nice. Most of the sprites for the characters are actually pretty well done. Kathy looks off, but she’s the only one. The horizon on the backgrounds are also fairly low, and thus, makes characters moving far back or forward off.\n\nAs for audio, it’s actually fairly decent. The music is well done, and the ambient effects are okay. The voice acting was something that stood out to us, mainly because it’s really well done, and there’s not a whole lot of 2D click-and-point adventure games that bother with voice acting. While the voice acting is really well done, there is a very slight pause between each character speaking, and it makes conversations sound off.\n\nThe controls are also quite standard. You click on things, and you move around with the mouse. You have some basic options for the audio, but nothing in terms of visuals or resolution.\n\nAs for the entertainment factor, we enjoyed our time with the game. It’s rather short at 5ish hours, but it may be longer if you decide to get all the achievements.\n\nOverall, it’s a pretty standard click-and-point adventure game, with some nice voice acting and fairly fleshed out characters. The story while short and rather hit or miss at the end, still was enjoyable enough to playthrough, and the things we did have wrong with the game didn’t stop us from playing. The puzzles, meh story (towards the end) and lack of resolution options may turn off some players, but it certainly wasn’t a horrible experience. We’re not sure if we’d suggest Kathy Rain at $14.99, but we did enjoy our time with the game.\n\n\n\n- PROS -\n\nThe music, voice acting, and overall audio is well done.\nThe UI and controls have been simplified since the old days of click-and-points, making the game far more enjoyable to play overall\nside characters are fairly well developed, and have fairly distinct personalities\n\n- MEH -\n\nThe main character (and the story) are both fairly predicable\n\n- CONS -\n\nDifferent resolution options would be nice\nThe game's main story falls apart at the very end","May 13","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corpekata/recommended/370910/","Corpekata","Corpekata","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corpekata/","2463 products in account","Product received for free\n\nDisclosure: Key provided for review at: https://videogamerrob.wordpress.com/2016/05/06/pc-review-kathy-rain/\n\nKathy Rain is the debut game from Clifftop Games, a point-and-click adventure about a journalism student that may need to change her major given the tag-line is “A detective is born.” Does the debut stand out among the crowd of indie adventure titles, or does it stumble right out of the gate?\n\nCONTROLS (4/5)\n\nPoint-and-click titles aren’t known for very complex controls, and Kathy Rain doesn’t reinvent the wheel. Simply pick up everything you can find and combine the inventory on things that make sense (and some that don’t just for fun). There are a few minor issues with the interface once you have enough inventory items to require a second page, as combining items between the two pages feels like a slight hassle, but that’s only briefly annoying.\n\nGRAPHICS/SOUND (3.5/5)\n\nKathy Rain is a pixel art game, and like others designed at a specific resolution, playing it on modern monitors can cause the style to be harmed a bit. Thankfully it’s not too bad a translation, though some things stand out.\n\nPortraits are great, but the faces on character models make the titular character go from biker-punk chick to someone that would look at home hanging out with hair metal bands. It ends up faring better than some other Adventure Game Studios engine games thanks to scenes that are often smaller and less busy.\n\nUnder the direction of Wadjet Eye’s Dave Gilbert, Kathy Rain features full voice acting. Most of the cast is pretty good, and I particularly enjoyed the quick-witted voice and writing for Kathy as well as the creepy rhyming nature of the game’s villain. Music and sound effects are generally solid but don’t particularly stand out.\n\nGAMEPLAY (4/5)\n\nKathy Rain has returned to her dorm room after a rough night out to find that her grandfather has died thanks to a nosy roommate. The next day she returns to her sleepy hometown for his funeral, and like any small town it has loads of mysterious secrets to unravel.\n\nUnbeknownst to Kathy, her grandfather had entered a vegetative state years prior to his death that nobody could explain, and she sets out to understand what exactly happened to him, uncovering more than a few dark secrets along the way.\n\nOf course, unearthing those secrets means dealing with puzzles and uncooperative locals. The puzzles are sort of odd in Kathy Rain, bouncing between too simple and overly obtuse.\n\nThere are, for example, three instances where you need to distract a cop and use something near his desk, and the distraction is the same all three times. There’s no twist each time you return, and you can’t get it all done at once either as the story requires going back to follow up on leads.\n\nMeanwhile, the obtuse puzzles seem to all involve cryptic ways to figure out unlock codes and combinations to various safes and briefcases, though these at least offer up a decent challenge.\n\nStill, puzzles are not the strong suit of the game, the story and characters generally are. Kathy is a great lead, at times dark and mysterious while maintaining a charismatic quick wit about her. The game deals with themes rarely seen in games, like suicide and mental illness, and handles most of them well, though when tackling abortion it felt a little slight.\n\nTo get too deep into the story would spoil things, but it seems to have been influenced by things like Twin Peaks in that it starts off as just a general normal mystery but isn’t afraid to get a little weird with things, either.\n\nOne nice touch I liked about the game was Kathy seemingly really learning via the puzzles. While I harped on repeating the distraction for a puzzle, two separate puzzles involve learning the computer credentials of different people, and the game has a different twist on the puzzle the second time that relies on skills she learned earlier.\n\nKathy Rain also does well with actually feeling like a detective, with scouring phone books and pretending to be the police when out of leads. Many games star detectives or investigators, especially in the adventure genre, but Kathy and the player actually feel like one.\n\nThe story does end a little anticlimactically, but it does imply interest in exploring the character further, as while most mysteries are solved about her grandfather, more remain regarding the rest of her family.\n\nOVERALL (4/5)\n\nKathy Rain is a great debut from Clifftop Games with a compelling protagonist and interesting eerie plot I was hungry to get to the bottom of. The puzzles could use a little work (and perhaps be more character oriented), but I’m intrigued to see where the developers go in the future, and whether Kathy returns or not.","June 4","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I was weaned on the early Sierra and Lucasarts adventures a a kid in the 80s, and stuck with that genre until it petered out in the 90s (with some notable exceptions). The recent adventure game revival has been exciting for me in theory, but none of them have really engaged me like some of the games I cut my teeth on once did (granted, as a kid, it was easier to capture my attention than it is now). This game was a masterpiece of writing, art design and voice acting. It wasn't tough, in fact I played it through in one (six hour) sitting. But those hours passed quickly because I was so taken with the story and the characters. There are none of the absurdly difficult combine-every-item-you-have-in-every-possible-order style puzzles, and the puzzles you will face are generally easy (barring one insanely obtuse, but thematically appropriate, one toward the end), but this is a good thing. That is to say the puzzles won't make you pull your hair out and get sick of the game for a week, only to come back to it later and repeat the process.\n\nI think this succeeds so well because it is a game for adults, and given its setting in the 90s, probably for people who lived through that period (ie. former adventure game addicts like myself). There are 'adult themes' and colorful usage of swear words, etc. Even though it's a fairly quick game (I finished it in 6  hours, as I mentioned) it's absolutely worth the $15 price point, and I hope a lot of people buy this so more games of this caliber, within this style, will continue to be made.\n\nEnjoyed it far more than any of the other new, flashier and 'prettier' adventure games. This one provides a memorable thematic experience that will stick with you the way the Colonel's Bequest or Space Quest III (to name a couple) once did. I have intentionally not said anything about the plot, because it's better to come into this game with an open mind, not knowing what to expect next.
