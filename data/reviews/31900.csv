This one is a bit easier than some of them, but still has some good puzzles.  Same great story line, and I enjoyed the Hardy Boys crossover which made the game interesting.  You have to make necklaces and fish in this one to make money, which I prefer over some of the games with food service.  The story line is good, with a few nice twists, and science themes.  Big fan of Her Interactive games!","September 2, 2014","true","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game was very easy and it ended before I fully explored the island and the characters' personalities. Usually in Nancy Drew Games, you come to a part where it is pretty difficult. None of that was in this game. The plot was mild. The crime nor the criminal was very sinister. Many aspects of the game were fun, but it would bore all experts. I would rate this game a 2/10 for experts and an 9/10 for novices. I took off one point for novices because the plot is DEFINITELY not the best Nancy Drew has to offer.","November 28, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The games storyline is just fantastic just like the rest of the Nancy Drew game series. The graphics are just breathtaking, crisis-like graphics that just run so smoothly! The team of developers did a great job with the interactive parts of the game, being able to click so many different things gets you thinking whether to go one way or another. I would reccomend this game to any hardcore PC gamers that enjoy Carl on Duty: Black Cops II, Taint Show: The Turd, or GuyRim. You really do get your money's worth with this classic PC gem of the 2000s.","May 17, 2013","true","1.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I just finished it and already am waiting for the next game to download. It was fun, yet challenging. The puzzles weren't extremely hard, yet they weren't easy, either.","May 25, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles were fun and the fact that you can play the Hardy Boys is a fun twist.\n\nThe seashell collecting and the fishing was a little tedious, and the ending wasn't as satisfying as other Nancy Drew games, but it was still pretty interesting.\n\nI'd give this game a 7 out of 10.","February 5","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the Nancy Drew games but this is one of the worst games in the series. The plot is not well done, it's like 3 weak subplots smooshed together to make the 'mystery'. The characters were strange and unlikeable, the puzzles were lackluster, and the ending was awful.\n\nProbably the one fun thing about this game was being able to play as Frank and Joe Hardy. Plus the graphics were nice and I could appreciate the fact that when this game came out the graphics would have been fairly cutting edge for a ND game.\n\nOverall this game feels like the production of it was rushed and not a lot of effort was put into it. I'm really surprised that Her Interactive would release a game this bad. There are much, much better games in the series and I would reccomend pretty much any of them over this one. Unless you are a Nancy Drew fan and really want to play every title in the series, I would skip this one.","June 2","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed playing this one, I love the stories with the Hardy Boys involved.  I suppose I did end up playing it for about 4 and half hours, but it seemed a bit short to me.  The longest tasks were making the necklaces or catching the fish, which really didn't have much to do with the story at all.  Plus the "villian" wasn't really all that scary or bad.  So I suppose if you want a low key Nancy game this one is for you, otherwise if you want more of a scare I would try another one.","June 3","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
