I would play this game 24/7, and never get bored of it. It had no lag, great artstyle, and everyone was evenly matched. Ever since the game updated, it went straight down the drain, and now it's a Pay-2-Win game. I think that if this game had no overpowering DLC, even characters, and even weapons, then it would be a much more enjoyable game. If you could unlock every weapon and character with in-game money, that would also help, by giving everyone more variety, and an even chance to play. Some weapons and characters that are Payed For, are stronger than others, and that's not fair nor fun. If this is a Free-To-Play game, then don't make it a Pay-2-Win.\n\nNote: If these changes were made, the companies Rock-Hippo and NQ-Games would be making a lot more money, gain a lot more populatarity, and overall, have a happy community.\n\nOverall Rating | Should I Play This Game?\nYes: 15%\nNo: 85%","December 27, 2015","false","66.0"," 118 of 129 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","118","129","6","5"

Most of the time if you want something cool like a weapon, you're gonna have to pay for it in some way, and hell if you want to buy it with the in-game system of currency then you're out of luck because a lot of it's temporary (which...I admit is good because it means that people aren't over powered 24/7, unless they're willing to pay for it, which 90% of the time they are).\n\nUnfortunately a lot of the core elements to MicroVolts have purchasables embedded in them that limit your ability to fully customize and create your own character and loadout (if your wanting to stick to the "Free" model).\n\nIt's a fun game, I admit, I often return back once in a while and get a couple of good matches in because the gameplay can be very enetertaining. That being said there are many other good free to play shooters out there on steam which I'd recomend over this one because they don't heavily rely on the purchase model, if you want my honest advice get the game Hawken and you will see that it is possible to have a great Free to Play game where you feel obliged to pay for stuff rather than obligated to.\n\nMADE FOR: Fans of Anime who are looking for a decent shooter to kill time.\n\nNOT MADE FOR: Player's who've had experience with other (better) F2P games.\n\nMICRO VOLTS SURGE\n6.5/10","December 30, 2014","false","17.3"," 51 of 68 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","51","68","3","0"

Then they received an update for 'Surge'. Once this update went live, it set in motion their in-game shop.  Once you start playing you start to notice that everything thing can one shot you, which is never fun and causes raging. Instead of fixing the problem they exploited it. Did you want to have better guns then the enemy? Simply $10 will get you that one gun you always wanted. It doesn't stop there, no! Since virtually everything can one shot you in this game you start craving to get better weapons and armor. Meaning more money you spend. This game has turned into a Pay-2-Play game, which is disheartening.  Another problem is that the hacker prevention system that comes with the launcher, doesn't work. There are so many hackers in this game is stupid crazy.

The fact that all official tournaments outright BAN two incredibly problematic paid weapons states more than anything I could say in words. They KNOW it's a problem and they're not doing anything about it. On top of that, almost every all-weapon Team Deathmatch is simply won by whoever has the better explosives spam, which more often than not means "whichever team has more Hermes and Zeus users." Compile that onto what's probably the whiniest paid user base ("You can't nerf 'God Weapons' because I paid $200 for one"), incredibly poor balance (explosives spam & aforementioned 'God Weapons'), and infuriating design decisions (The Sherlock. That is all.) and you get a Quake-style shooter that is only fun if you're playing with friends, which means it will get stale rather quickly, especially since trying to find a good map is like trying to search for a diamond ring in a pit of quicksand.\n\nOn the flip side, this game probably has, visually, the best melee weapons of all time, though you'll never see them because all everyone ever uses is four weapons that are visually unappealing (two of which are bulky swords with ugly particle effects.), boring, and only see use because they are one-hit kill weapons, which is a shame because your other choices include a fork & sausage, a slappy hand toy, a pink lollipop, and a cocktail umbrella. This alone symbolizes the massive waste of pontential that is Microvolts. They had the potential for a quirky-Quakey shooter and instead opted to squeeze as much money out of it as possible while having massive balance issues that take years to resolve, if at all. This game isn't awful, it's mostly just disappointment. I liked it at some point, but now it's just a shell of it's former sel- BR? BR? BR? BR? BR? BR? BR? BR?\n\nEDIT: After the more recent updates to this game, I can certainly say my opinion has changed. I now hate this game with more passion than I had ever defended it with. I hope RockHippo and NQ Games go bankrupt. It appears they are going to soon. They just lost a massive chunk of their playerbase thanks to their removal of Daily Rewards and thanks to their shortsighted money grab - sorry, I mean "God Weapons That Can't Ever Be Nerfed Because By God I Spent $7000 On It",  trying to get new players will be incredibly difficult and making things easier for new players will cause their "loyal" players to ragequit. I have uninstalled Microvolts and implore any prospective players to play Team Fortress 2 instead. I now, with nary the shadow of a doubt, believe TF2 to be entirely superior in any way.","August 3, 2014","false","119.6"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","36","49","0","2"

I assume to keep cheaters out.  I never got that far.  The entire time you're trying to do anything the program will keep freezing up to the point Windows will regularly ask if you want to wait or kill the program.\n\nThe first thing you're asked to do after logging in to something other than Steam is select a character.

Awesome.\n\nI thought I'd give it a shot anyway and selected a free character.  I get a tutorial loading screen and am presented with a map and interface but can't actually do anything.  A couple seconds later I'm presented with a connection failed message.  The only option is to click ok.  Repeat for however long you feel.  Didn't even get to try the tutorial.

The pay to win is strong here; the best weapons (and kawaiiest clothes) can only be bought with actual dosh, the biggest offender being the one-shot kill sniper rifle at any range or body part hit. ♥♥♥♥ that. That said, unlike most other F2P-P2W games, you are able to "permanently" purchase stuff rather than leasing it for a week or so. Thats cool. Also you can upgrade them, so perhaps with enough time your "free" weapons could outperform bought ones. Maybe.\n\nGameplay is kinda slow but still quite frantic, the vast arsenal you have at hand lets you play in many different ways and certain ammo types are restricted in amount so you cannot simply spam rockets or whatever. It works on a risk/reward system in that ammo/health only drop from dead enemies so theres not much camping either.\n\n♥♥♥♥ing Korea.","August 8, 2012","false","2.7"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

In the start, all of the Cons listed above existed. The most notable differences that I've seen are the Playerbase and the P2W of MicroVolts. Over the time that MicroVolts has been out, many-many-many cheats and hacks have been released and continually swarm the game. Speed hacks, instant captures, auto-aim, infinite HP, one shot, free money...they've all been there.\n\nFor months, the company behind MicroVolts released nothing to fend off these hacks. The result? An overly defensive community and a reinforced focus on P2W...or H2W. Fremium players relying on MP are a lot better off now...mainly because they can now take part in the stat-based war. When I first started playing, fremium players were forced to grind heavily and play with the utmost skill in order to earn better items so that they could compete against RT players with unfair stats.\n\nAnd now, as I return to MicroVolts, all of these issues remain. And they have all appeared to worsen. You may enjoy the fast gameplay as you take down opponents...but save your wallets and enjoy something much more palettable and better coded!\n\n~ Recommendations ~\n- Loadout\n","April 20, 2014","false","83.4"," 42 of 63 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","42","63","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pengutheking/recommended/109400/","pengutheking","✾Cinna✾","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pengutheking/","59 products in account","Microvolts is a toy-themed, TPS MMO with terrible servers and people who use all of their money to buy OP in-game weapons. Needless to say, the game isn't all bad; however, there are several reasons why you should play and shouldn't.\n\nGAMEPLAY 7/10\n\nI honestly really liked Microvolts - it was unique, cute, and fun to play. However, the servers really messed up that experience, as you can get kicked out twenty seconds before the match ends - or kicked out at any time, for that matter. It also has many bugs, which a lot of people abuse (ex: glitching outside of map to kill people and not take DMG).\n\nAs all F2P games have, Microvolts has a cash shop with OP CS weapons and outfits to help those who have the money for the game, whereas ACTUAL F2P players get crushed - with or without skills.\n\nAside all of the bad things about the game, MV is actually pretty unique (and similar to TF2). You have 7 weapons you can use on one character, which are the melee, rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, gatling (heavy), bazooka (rocket), and grenade launcher. Not only that, but with the melee weapon, you can do so much more with these weapons. Such as, using it to fire faster, dodging while shooting, switching weapons faster, and etc.\n\nMicrovolts has a unique way of giving users a way to differentiate themselves from one another. They give you several characters (that are gender-locked), and a massive amount of accessories you can buy to customize them (some of which are only available by real money). Note, the charcters don't give you any advantage over anybody else (except for the outfits, which have stats), and they don't affect the way you maneuver around the map.\n\nEach accessory or article of clothing has a stat, such as extra health or bullets for a certain weapon. This gives users to customize how they want their weapons/whatevertheywantittobe. However, the only downside is, that the CS weapons and outfits/faces give better stats, giving people who play for free the disadvantage.\n\nGRAPHICS 7.5/10\n\nThe graphics are smooth in high settings; however, a cruddy computer can cause you to lag a lot. There are a lot of players from different countries, so your connection sometimes depends on where the hosts live.\n\n(A/N:I enjoyed the toy-theme MV has going on, it's actually one of my favorite things about the game).\n\nAUDIO 5/10\n\nThe soundtrack is mediocre, with the same happy-go-lucky tunes playing repeatedly. It does go well with the game's theme, though.\n\nOVERALL 6.5/10\n\nMicrovolts isn't bad, not at all. However, with their cruddy servers and P2W store, you can only really enjoy it if you have the money for it. This does not mean you can't play and win just using in-game money, though. I played MV without paying a single penny and still managed to get #1 in some matches. (A/N: Zombie mode is my favorite).\n\nNOTES\n\nIf you do want to play this game, I suggest timing when you buy new weapons/outfits, as there is a time-limit on them, unless you get them permanently.\n\nPROS\n\n+ Cute theme\n+ Unique customizing system\n+ Unique gameplay\n+ Melee gives users to expand on the other 6 weapons\n+ Good amount of modes/maps to choose from\n+ Good amount of characters to choose from\n\nCONS\n\n- Boots you off of the game frequently\n- Bugs are abused by users, and can sometimes get you stuck\n- P2W\n- Can be very laggy\n- Some hosts AFK ._.\n\n(You can say I'm NEUTRAL about this game. I don't recommend it, but then again, I do).","June 1, 2014","true","99.9"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

I recently went back to this, and was glad that they added an Assist Point feature in the game now, so now players are rewarded with Assists if they caused damage to the enemy, but another teammate makes the kill. The customization, has improved slightly, as now players can choose either "Bullet" or "Explosive" resistances when choosing parts. The game's cartoonishly violent feel is always enjoyable, with tons of weapons that compliments how you want to play.\n\nHOWEVER, I said it's enjoyable when you play with friends and the right kind of people, because this game has one of the worst online communities I have ever seen. Apparently you are the spawn of Satan himself if you happen to shoot an unsuspecting enemy player in the back, use the Minigun at all (even just holding it out), and you can be kicked for the stupidest f***ing reasons that I have seen players give out. Every now and then, you'll also cross paths with players who feel the need to use unnessecary hacks, such as aim bot, speed, rapid fire auto-shotgun (whatever the hell you call it), Infinite health, etc, that I really hope the Administrators fix soon.\n\nHonestly, I am torn at whether I should reccommend this game or not. The Community, like I said, is absolute s***, probably as bad as Heroes of Newarth and League of Legends (Shots fired), but the game itself is really damn fun when playing with your friends. It's such a shame to see such a fun game just get destroyed by how the various players act.","January 22, 2014","true","69.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

My favorites being Team Death Match, Zombie Mode, and Capture the battery to name a few. There is a total of 12 modes (If I remember correctly). When I started to play Microvolts it was just called Microvolts and there was only 4 characters available which would be Knox, Naomi, Pandora and Chip. Now there are 5 new characters which is awesome. There are more RT items then MP items. You can only get RT with real life currency and MP which is in game currency which you get by playing matches.\n\nI enjoy playing this game a bit to much but I will admit I havent been playing as much as I used to. The game is fun but it can be a hassle and bothersome when you get disconnected due to some unknown error?I still recommend playing the game.

The shooting is actually satisfying in this game, especially the Rocket Launcher and the Shotgun, but every weapon feels good in it's own right.\n\nBe warned, as the game is filled with some pretty bad maps that encourage sniper nests and spawn-camping.  The best maps I've found are the smaller maps, with the exception of the truck level.\n\nAlso of note, it took me nearly 24 hours game-time to earn enough points to keep a permanent outfit on my character.  That's WITH the Steam starter pack items which boosts your MP intake considerably.\n\nThe chief thing that people are afraid of when they hear about this game is pay-to-win.  It's there, but it's not quite as bad as you would think.  Nonono, hackers and glitch abusers are in far greater abundance than full sets of premium items and make a far greater impact.","August 4, 2012","true","53.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I haven't played it in a long time and steam may say I haven't played it for that long but I played on the launcher from the official website. I have logged many hours into this game and I am sad to say it was amazing. It had such potential and it grabbed that potential and it knew what to do. Then they added microtransactions and  then microvolts turned into a p2w. It's a sad story really I would reccomend this game and I feel bad not reccomending it.

It's an indie game made by amateurs who gave up the whole game to instead overprice everything to get money. It was going so good but they stopped adding more content and only removed a lot of it and added more events where you give them money instead. Some people say it's pay to win, but it's not very pay to win since I got banned so often for hacking because I was so skilled with the default weapons. Paying only gives random items and you'd have to be extremely lucky to get something useful, and the price of random capsules is incredibly high.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackcrowbar/recommended/109400/","blackcrowbar","Medic Kimino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackcrowbar/","65 products in account","Long Review, I'll probably put a tl;dr at the end.\n\nHonestly, I didn't want to put either I recommend or don't recommend. I'm kind of neutral towards recommending this game to anyone. Basically, try it out yourself, see if you like it, that's that and besides, it's free. I only put recommend because I feel as though there are too many negative reviews. Which is understandable. Everyone giving negative reviews are saying that this game turned pay2win. Which again, understandable because there are a ♥♥♥♥ ton of microtransactions in this game. There's your basic in-game shop with, "PAID WEAPONS ARE UPGRADED VERSIONS OF IN-GAME MONEY WEAPONS!" Then the capsule shop which is basically way to waste all of your money because you're basically opening up crates or cases like in TF2 or CS:GO. There's your standard, "WHAT'S IN THE BOX?" waste of money microtransaction. And lastly, the coupon shop. Coupons are racked up from capsules at random and then once you've gathered enough coupons, you can buy some of the best weapons in the game, which would mean pay2win, right? That would be the case. However, I've seen people run around with in-game money bought weapons and still dominate the match. Granted they did upgrade those weapons to its maximum potential. I've also seen people with paid weapons get demolished by said people. I will say that there is a certain amount of skill that can break through that "pay2win" barrier. But who has the time for that?\n\nNow as you can see, currently I have 145 hours wasted onto this game. Why the ♥♥♥♥ did I do that? While I do indeed think that this game is absolute garbage, I also enjoy it... A LOT. It's a casual game for me to play after I'm done raging over my friends and teammates in League or CS:GO or any other "competitive" games that I play. It's like why people play CoD (I mean I hate CoD with a burning passion but I understand why people like it) It's a nice casual time waster. The skill ceiling isn't too high, you can find matches rather quickly, can leave any time and if you have friends, an all around good time. Same goes for this game.\n\nFurthermore, something that I do appreciate in this game is the usage of your arsenal. You must take advantage of every single weapons that you are given. Being versatile and always swapping weapons mid fight will give you that upper hand in that fight. The is a set fire rate for each weapon; however, they can be increased by swapping to another weapon and back. Think of it as CS 1.6 with the awp or reloading mechanic. People would double tap Q to end the reload animation faster and be able to shoot again at a faster time. Utilizing your double jump is also important. A nice mechanic that is in this game is that you can only double jump when you have your melee out, but be careful because there's virtually no strafing once that first jump goes out. You're locked in that direction if you decide to jump a second time.\n\nHowever, there is a slight issue with other players in this game. Most of them seem to be of Spanish speaking descent (I don't speak Spanish so you can see how this is an issue for ME, if you do speak Spanish, then GREAT! It won't be an issue.)  and their pings are always over 100. I've met a few people with under 100 but it's quite rare to see. I have a constant 20 ping and it can be frustrating at times to dying to the same lagging person over and over and over again. Just be mindful of that fact if you decide to play this game.\n\nFurthermore, hackers exist in this game. I used to play this along with the people in the review sections who are saying, "I remember when this game was good, now it's just pay2win." (Basically 3 years ago) There were a lot more hackers then than there are now. I run into them here and there. There would be some days in which I wouldn't run into them at all. And other days maybe 2 or 3. So on average... 1. Which isn't all that bad. I mean, every games have their fair share of hackers... granted  this game is dying. FML man, why do I play this. There are also kick protection items that everyone can receive from daily missions; you can't buy those in the store. I personally think that these items are stupid. Who the hell thought of a kick protection. WHAT?! H-HELLO?! WHY?\n\nFinal thoughts:\nDid I spend money on this game? Hell yea. I am ashamed of it but at the same time I don't really give two ♥♥♥♥♥. I give three. Haha what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke. Anyways, Yes I did spend money on it, do I get kills because of the damage boost that comes from these weapons? Yea, I do think that I get some kills because of the paid weapons. However, I have some in-game money bought weapons in my list of weapons too. And I'm glad I use and have those weapons as well because they are on par with some of the paid weapons. Am I good at the game because of these paid weapons? Lol no, I suck balls. Is my waifu kawaii? Yes. I'm a weeb ♥♥♥♥ even though I don't even watch anime anymore. I enjoy the costumes and designs a lot in this game. There are some that I absolute adore.\n\nHoly ♥♥♥♥ this is long. I don't even write reviews for games.\n\nTL;DR:\nI would say it is a little pay2win but in game money weapons can be on par with paid weapons.\nI play it casually and enjoy the living hell out of it. (Why the hell would there be competitive MV anyways, dafuq.)\nThere are some advanced mechanics in this game that I like and appreciate, which would also help out against those darn pay2win players.\nMost players speak Spanish (And English, there are a few that I've met that don't speak English, unfortunately)\nHackers are present in this game, there are kick protections items (You get those from daily missions, calm down) which I think is just stupid.\nI suck at this game yet I have 145 hours logged onto it. This is my PayDay 2.\n\nWhy the hell did I write such a long review for such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edolii/recommended/109400/","edolii","Edori Mondo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edolii/","288 products in account","Talk about a surprise.\n\nMonths ago, I had forced my friends to find this game and download with me, all of us going in anticipating what would be a bad game. At first we scoffed at the bland anime-faces of the characters, the at-points earache-inducing voice acting, and the real money buy-out upgrades that could only spell game breaking.\n\nAnd then we actually played the game.\n\nNot even the first round, I became impressed with how easy it was to play. The mechanics simple to understand, the keyboard controls mapped out in a simple, easy-to-handle fashion, and not out of the gate, too sluggish nor oversensitive. The fact that you get a multitude of weapons off the bat allows for quick and varied gameplay, with a whole bunch of different results. The maps were all creative and impressive. My friends and I were quick to discover that the chess board for melee-only and the fooseball table for sniper-only were some of the best rounds of our gamenights. The maps can be on the small side, so keep that in mind when you play with a full room, as it can get chaotic quick. Even more so when you go zombie mode.\n\nAlso enjoyable was the good range of mini challenges and different modes to pair with the maps. Also 16 players is a good number on the higher end concerning these types of online games, especially when you already have a big group of friends to play with. However, if you don't have a large group of friends to play with, don't worry. Even with just 2-4 players, you can still have fun dicking around with each other. Setting up a room to play in is incredibly easy, and even easier to manage as well. I would suggest however, to stick with your own friends to play with, if you can. Online with strangers, and I found it easy to run into players level 60 and up with incredibly cheap weapons, so depending if you're a good sport or not, can slightly spoil your experience.\n\nWhile playing, we also found that actually buying the more advanced and powerful upgrades doesn't neccasrily break the game as you go. Skill can still win over money, and that was a plus to not have to feel the need to keep paying in in order to play. The timed ownership of items (while an incentive to keep playing to earn points in order to keep rebuying items you want), is still a bit of a drag, and harder to try out other items when you're limited.\n\nEven with my nitpicks listed, they're still just small nitpicks, and overall, I highly enjoy and reccommend this game to almost anyone. It's been a fun addiction that my friends and I find ourselves going back to. It's a solid Team Fortress 2, with it's own flavor to it. Not to mention, it's free to download and play, so there's not much to complain there. So, if this game's caught your interest at all, I say go for it already.","July 3, 2014","true","60.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes some people may be to OP but if you can do well with MP weapons then you will do great with the RT ones. The game has many modes such as Capture the Battery, Zombie mode, Team death match, Boss battle, Etc.. As well you may get kicked from the some matches due to people thinking your "hacking" when your good at the game or just plan better then the other players..or its because you are actually hacking.\nThe game includes 7 character modles, 3 girls 4 guys. Each one has there own type of outfits, voices, and taunts.\n\nNow there are capsules that you can spend RT/MP on they each have different things inside, some are unlimited meaning you can keep them forever ( They are hard to get and you will probably spend alot of money unless you VERY lucky ) and some are just for a few days, or a month. Now not every capsule you get will have a weapon or a piece of gear in it, they will probably most likely have little things such as MP or EXP boost, battery charges, MP and other little things that you could use in order to upgrade items.\nThe MP capsules do not have as many choices as the RT capsules for some reason- that I do not know - There are also events mainly in the mornings that grant extra MP/EXP for 1-2 hours (that iv seen for myself)\n\nYes there will be other people who are on a much higher level then you, but just because they are doesnt mean that you still cant kick their butts, now if you give TDM a try and you encounter a higher level, and say your level 5 and someone on the other team is around level 20-30 dont think just because their higher means there better, test your own skills out and see what you need to fix, such as sensitivity or acceleration, or emprove something such as aiming, or certain weapons you want to work on more.\nThere is a game mode/match mode (what ever) that is called a "Schrimmage" in which you can play with friends or random people, your not scored and you never die.\n\nNow than to the shopping area\n-MP items are the only items in the shop that can be bought as an unlimited ~ RT items can only last atleast a month depending on how much RT you spend on the item\n-MP accessories are not unlimited and can last aslong as a month as well\n\nThen again there is a Coupon Store\n-In order to buy things from this store you must first get 'coupons' now coupons can only be gotten from trying to get items from the capsule machine which give 1 per spin if your lucky, second way is to long on every day for a week, at the end of the week you sometimes get a box, they box has unlimited items and other things such as coins, MP. items that help upgrade and all them goodies, but you can on get one item from that box and its random, of course Microvolts changes the daily login items at some points but from what iv seen its between 1-2 months maybe longer depending on the items or when ever they wish to change it.\n\nOh yes, there are people who may not speak your language, now if your like me and can only speak English the NA server may not be the best although if you wish to not lag as much and dont really care about talking then that would be a good server to pick. The other server is the Europe server, they on the other hand have more people who speak english rather than another language.\n\nNow then, they added a new feature and if your new you may like it, everytime you level you get this little box with items inside - Though there isnt any gear inside id say its came in handy alot with upgrades and sometimes when I need MP its a big help instead of trying to farm MP.","December 20, 2014","true","583.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The low cost of MP (in game money) in the game made it easy for every frustrated player to start abusing the in-game-vote-kick system and kicking people out.  Even worse, those who got a jackpot of millions of MP can easily spend 50 MP for nearly an infinite amount of vote-kicks.\n\nAlso, when the game first came out, people were able to glitch through walls and shoot you from inside those walls, but you cannot shoot at them through walls.  Those glitches have survived for months and is still abused even after most glitches are being fixed.\n\nThe community further ruins the game with annoying words such as backer (term used if you kill someone behind them).  There's other terms like MG nub (because you can't spell the word "noob" as it is censored, you get this one.  This term refers to using the slow machine gun to kill other people).\n\nThe game would have been good, but the community really ruins your fun experience.  However, things have changed though, the vote kick costs 10x more than it originally did, minimizing abuse.  However, it's still abusable by those who win jackpots in their weapon gachapons.\n\nNow to talk about what I love about the game.  I like the characters in the game, mostly girl characters.  There are many ways to dress the characters and such.  Also, the game allows you to use seven weapons in a game!  You can switch to any of the seven while you are alive.  The graphics are nice up to this date (ignore Focusing Effect and Motion Blur, they look horrible in the game).  And even nice, there's usually content for free players every month or so, with newer maps and weapons both pay-to-win and free-to-play characters use.\n\nI recommend, it's worth a try.","July 14, 2014","true","66.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sadly, the game developers now also do not care about their devoted players anymore. They have been re-releasing old sets and weapons, without giving the original owners any compensation.

Not only are the leases still too expensive but the hacking has gotten out of control. When I first played it there were hackers, of course, but nothing aside from aimbotting and wallhacks, the usual stuff.

It's been slowly dying and it feels like the company itself has given up.\n\n\nPositive aspects:\n\n+ anime graphics\n+ moderate shooter difficulty (aiming, shooting)\n+ active forum\n+ many characters to choose and more costumes to come\n\n\nNegative:\n\n- difficult to master\n- toxic community (and no option to report toxic behavior)\n- hackers\n- bad moderators (some are too young for the job and, also, rarely online)\n- no compensation for beta/ and early players\n- new bugs with every update, and no fixing of old bugs\n- many unfixed glitches\n- huge gap between paid weapon and free weapon\n- in-game cash is expensive","August 16, 2014","false","195.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

This third-person shooter is quite unique as you run around as a tiny figure that has access to 8 weapons at once.  The game is fast-paced and can get really frantic (but in a fun way) and has a pretty good level of customization.  The only advice I need to give for having a good time in this game is to not die.  It just feels good when you are wrecking everyone else in a lobby.  And this game is free, so if you like things like anime girls and shooters I can most definitely recommend this game!","July 26, 2014","true","62.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I couldn't navigate any of the menus.  You're given a stock of points at the beginning which can only be used to purchase items for a few days.  The main appeal of this game I think for most people is going to be the character customization, which is also pretty poor.  If you want to skimp up your anime figurines, go for it, just remember you'll have to buy new outfits every week, which requires you to pay money or actually play the game.  And since the game is pretty much unplayable, I'd say you'll be paying out of pockets for those anime girl clothes/not clothes.  Play planetside or TF2, which have game balance and are actually fun to play.","June 1, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

MicroVolts is a MMO Third Person Shooter that also features real money in game purchases. Recently, the game has turned into a case of Pay To Win. Now then, someone can get along with skills alone, as I've seen in a recent match, but most low levels have Pay To Win items, so it's hard to outmatch them if you're like me, and not very good at the game. Also, from experience, MicroVolts seems very easy to hack. I've had a run in with several hackers and unless you can take an obvious screenshot of someone hacking, it's hard for the devs to put a stop to it. The in game community of MicroVolts also tends to be either rude, angry, racial, or overall annoying. You will be insulted for every little thing, be kicked for no reason at all, or will be accused of hacking if you're a very good player.\nAnother thing is, if you do pay for Rock Tokens, the real money currency, the game features a gambling system of acquiring items, which means, you'll have a chance to get a good item or not. For me, the gambling process is very addicting, and based on certain characters, you're mostly trying to get individual items, such as leggings, tops, pants, hairs, ect. and not a full set.","April 13, 2015","false","363.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well to start, this game is a HUGE rip off of Team Fortress 2. The classes are the same, the chat box is the same, some even have similar voice files!\n\nYou can be a female or male. But why be a male? The male models are HIDEOUS and don't look ANYWHERE similar to the females.

I mainly play melee only because it is the most balanced I feel. Even if someone is full tank its still only 2 shots to the face with a tracker head. The maps are beautiful with lense flares for the sund and they really submerge you into this beautiful toy world. The character roster (as of today) inclue the figures Knox, Kai, C.H.I.P, Simon, $harkill, Naomi, Pandora, Amelia, and Sophitia in which each has their own default stats that can be changed by buying mp clothes, or spending your money to get amazing outfits (which is kind of an addiction of mine). They have a capsule machine that you can spend al your money in and its so much fun to do, but leaves you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you didnt get the part you wanted.

The game was fun and addictive. When Surge came however, I lost ALL OF MY ITEMS, and had to rent them for a week. (These items were still the same price as before, so I ended up renting a sniper at 20,000 free currency for a WEEK!) The good things in the update (New items and characters) have been overshadowed by the Paid Currency driven rental system. Want to keep an item pernamently? Pay the equivalent of £5 paid currency. For ONE ITEM! I no longer play this game because now I find myself being beaten by the people who can pay more.

It all started to go down hill when they started to limit what the players could do. An example of this is  that they remove some things that you could climb on for safety from the zombies( which the zombies can get to if the players DON'T work together). This was essential for camping since the zombies have  (on a good match) about 50k hp making them verylong lived. Then the game began to loose players due to the fact that they kept making the maps less and less camp friendly. They even made the zombies jump higher to easily infect others. Now, as it stands it is very hard to find a decent zombie match with an acceptable number of players. Many times you woun't even find servers with zombie matches. The few servers that still have people are slowly taking a turn for the worse.","February 4, 2015","false","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"10/10", "Great Game". Pegi 14, but who's Pegi and why is she 14?\n\n1: Honestly it's fun, but ruined due to the host settings and high ping activity; one would say...this game carries a lot of Spanish speaking players and Brazilians. No hate, but get your own server.\n2: Microvolts is a very pay to win game seen my experience with the playing it, since I have played the game when it came out.\n2.5: Though it is possible to upgrade guns you permanently buy to level 5: maxing power, accuracy, etc, etc; it's not as strong as a gun that is bought through Capsules.\n3: I would say this game milks your money like a cow and a bucket. Buy capsules! More capsules! Waste money and more money, that is if you truly want better equipment.\n4: You can't get certain equipment without using capsules, which I feel it's a ripoff. There's a small chance of getting anything "rare" and usually rare items are not permanent. Some can be permanent, but there is a slight chance of ganing it (It's like winning the lottery. The more you put into it, the small greater outcome comes back.)\n4: Slowly the game makes up for their lack of Micropoints or MP by giving the player daily missions and extra bonuses like MP Bottle caps.\n4.5: Even with extra MP, the player isn't fully able to become "Powerful" unless they put time into the game.\n5: Lastly and the biggest why I came to dislike the game very much, is due to the Rocket Launcher they ripped me off of.","December 29, 2014","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do advise you look at the tutorial videos in the stem forums to learn how to play 'efectivly' or you may not live to see many kills.  Other then the constant need to log back in at first, both steam and non steam it has a very good setup.  It is more a Pay to Improve vs a Pay to Win, everything can be gotten via 'mystery capsules' it's just chance to get what you want.  The capsule option also allows free to play players to also gain what they need/want.\n\nThere are a few random crashes, but when the game plays fine it is worth the time and effort.  It's a 3/5 in my book, and rather adicting once you actualy get into it.","July 24, 2014","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too get it to work you have to download lots of parts, and other things the game makers didn't put in. It made me look for hours just to get the parts of the game witch guess what? The game does not even have most of the 'game" in it. It use to be a well working, and MOSTY FREE but moar, and moar updates made it bad. Also the outfits are really just ways to pay to win, and you get then for only for a short time. There are so much better shooters out there just play them. There are still anime girls in it that you can make so if you like that then play it, but they are toys in this game so yeah, fap if you like toys then!

I do advise you look at the tutorial videos in the stem forums to learn how to play 'efectivly' or you may not live to see many kills.  Other then the constant need to log back in at first, both steam and non steam it has a very good setup.  It is more a Pay to Improve vs a Pay to Win, everything can be gotten via 'mystery capsules' it's just chance to get what you want.  The capsule option also allows free to play players to also gain what they need/want.\n\nThere are a few random crashes, but when the game plays fine it is worth the time and effort.  It's a 3/5 in my book, and rather adicting once you actualy get into it.","July 24, 2014","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't even class-based! Yeah you might see some things that seem to be inspired by TF2, but gameplay-wise it's just a standard two-team shooter. Hell with that description you can say they ripped off Halo's big team battle mode.\n\nAlso, the servers have seperate server listings for noobs and bad players (Like me!).\n\nAlso being a massive weeb, starting out as a cute schoolgirl with a school uniform and striped pantsu is a big plus for me. All she needs is glasses, a ribbed sweater, thighhighs, and long hair and she'll be set.\n\nThough what annoyed me is that it doesn't use steam credentials like Spiral Knights did. I had to create an account, which would have normally turned me away, but after hearing about this a long ago (when it was called H.A.V.E. Online), I've been anticipating this for a while, so I'll have to deal with it.","July 21, 2012","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a pretty solid game with a bunch of different game modes, it runs well on lower-end PCs, and it's genuinely fun. It's like playing with a handful of toys when you were a kid and having them shoot at each other. I love the different maps and the sense of scale.\n\nWhat I don't like is that the game is pretty microtransaction heavy. You can play for free, but you miss out on a lot of weapons that give clear advantages.\n\nIt's pretty fun, though. I'd definitely say give it a try.","July 12, 2012","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

One of the things I loved about the games I grew up with were esoteric gameplay mechanics (sometimes in the form of glitches that were never patched out) which went on to become part of competitive gameplay, like BXR and double shots in Halo 2, wavedashing in SSBM, and roll-canceling in CvS2.\n\nMicroVolts brings me back to those days. Join a server and you'll people switching to their melee weapon between firing shots in mid-air to gain extra jumps, and switching between firing shotgun shots because weapon cycling actually increases the rate of fire on the pump shotgun and bazooka.\n\nModern games often seem to be designed to avoid these kinds of "exploits." MicroVolts embraces them. (The devs have promised to leave in certain "exploits" which have become an accepted part of normal gameplay.) And I love it for that. Some people don't like this kind of game, but I find it rewarding and fun to play.","July 14, 2012","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I only played the large map with flower pots or whatever. But This game has long distance to close combat fun.. Many of the AAA titels forgot this basic style of FPS play because they try to make their shooters so realistic with all the perks of todays weapons that whenever they make a big map it's NO FUN because someone has some crazy scope that can take you out with 1 shot clear accross any large map.. Give this player some sort of aim-cheat and the games fun is over in a heart beat...\n\nThis game gives you weapons for up close battel but let's you see your incoming enemies across a big map and have some fun battling from a distance (pulling in some frags) as you try to be stealthy (or not) while you move closer and closer to get to the close combat play..\n\nDefinitely fun for all, I guess you can say It's a slow paced arena style fps in 3rd person.\nJust wish you could edit the control config/keybindings\n\nI give it a thumbs up!","July 21, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its riveld by few but realy needs to solve the match making.","May 26, 2014","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
