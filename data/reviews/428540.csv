If you understand watching my play will be a HUGE SPOILER for you, you can search it up under my same name on Youtube, Zaxtor99.  It came in at just about 2.5 hours with my playthough of it and I added plenty of commentary and what I thought as the story developed.\n\nThere isn't a lot of other games exactly like this one, and I did enjoy it as it really did a good job of developing the main characters and showing different points of view.  The voice acting is really well done, the graphics are nice, and the music  masterfully fits the moods in the story of the game.\n\nI can certainly see how this game could break any person who has dealt with the loss of loved ones into a mess grasping for endless tissues.  While it doesn't spend a ton of time with ech character, the time it does spend is masterfully done and makes you empathize with them all.\n\nPricewise, I feel that this game is somewhat overpriced, especially comparing it to other games like Life Is Strang which gives the player a story about five times the length and many, many more choices over five episodes for the same price.  However, it is still certainly less expensive then taking the family to the movies, and it tells a somewhat predictable but never-the-less well crafted story.\n\nI recommend it to anyone who enjoys a casual paced visual story where you don't make many choices but rather get to experience a good story about true love, sacrifice, and loss of those we love the most.\n\nTwo thumbs up to the game... but a little disappointment in a game that I honestly believe "should" be about half the current price of $19.99 USD..  ($10-$12 would be a much more fair price tag IMO)  In the end however, it's the story that this game tells that is where the value is, and to many, I'm sure the price tag is a small price to pay for the emotions it will stir.\n\nI want to say "thanks" again to the developers for offering me the key and allowing me to experience this well done visual novel.","May 22","true","6.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

It was different compared to Dear Esther or similar games, because you are more active within the story then "walking" the story.\n\nGameplay\nThe main gameplay is to experience the fragments which your are able to gain by clicking on the specific marked objects, the movement while playing the game is smooth and the cinematic scenes are nice and used well.\n\nStoryline\nThis game is totally different compared to other games and thats his strength. The game does focus ofcourse on Will's death, but has several scenes/stories were you will find (maybe) yourself, and yes thats pretty neat.\nThe story is told from several characters and thats good, because that will enrich your abillity to create a great picture of Will as person.\n\nGraphics\nOne of the things you will notice while playing the game, is the minimal use of colors. At first i was a little bit skeptical but it worked perfectly fine, its a nice way to give even more strenght to the experience.\nThe different rooms and places you will walk through are very detailed and designed well, the only little point for improved could made into the garden because of the "dark areas". It was a little bit too "dark" for my taste.\n\nSound\nThe sounds were good and the voice-actors were great, definitely they used the best voice-actors for this kind of story.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, a pretty good game which is definitely different to the games i have played through the years like Dear Esther, Gone Home etc. beside that, finished the game in less then 2,5 hours and was worth the money in my opinion.\nI would recommend this game to everyone who likes story-based games and fully want an experience instead of high scores.","May 4","true","2.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

But I could not have predicted the overwhelming emotions that struck me during my time playing this game. I have literally cried for a good 20 minutes, trying desperately to proceed with the story.\n\nThe art is beautiful, the story grasping, immersive and loaded with emotion.

There's no running around shooting things. No Sims to build houses for and no nations to conquer.\n\nInstead Fragments of Him tells a story. The story it tells is of a man and the stories that revolve around him. Stories attached to everyday objects like memories of old.\n\nAt roughly 2 hours long the game may sound short for the price but it is worth it. The raw emotion in the story alone makes it so. The characters are recognisable and relatable. I could easily see this being my life. Maybe this is my life, could explain why it resonated with me so well. It shows the importance of family, of understanding and of how different people can have different views on something. They try their hardest for you.\n\nI'm not the same person who started playing this game earier.  Go play this game.

Getting fragmented accounts of a person through his closest is not entirely the best way to portray a human being. Intense love seem to be accompanied  by tolerance for mundaneness, rendering the relationship itself interesting to the persons in question, but making the other's perspective one of pointlessness. Fragmented stories of everyday circumstances: first kisses, brushing of legs and the awkward stumbling towards falling in love is in this game made out to be profound in and by themselves. Fragments of Him attempts to escape the mundane through the mundane, the only difference being that one of the two are accompanied by a veil of love, a veneer of love. But this love, that is vital for a story like this, is not understood by the player. Therein lies the issue of this game.\n\nWe are told there is love, we are told there is longing and profoundness, we are told there are reasons for acting and a will that is profound, but never with reason. It is never concrete, it is merely uttered as if there explication of profundity would the situation so. Within the game, we see connections, but where is our connection to them? What could have been done to formalize a bond, or a deeper relationship or connection to these characters other than simply being a ghostlike presence rummaging through their memories? Am I the only one feeling this lack of connection? Am I too cynical for a story like this, or can we say there is a more solid reason for my lack of connection? Why do I not care?\n\nI did not feel like I understood the characters, I did not know why they said the things they said. Why did one think everyday life, the patterns and routines, to be imprisonment? Why was the love between one of the couples in the love triangle not as strong as the other? What change did Will want? Why did any of this matter?\n\nIn fact, we are all human. But not all humans are alike, we are not One in any sense. Loss is understandable as a theme, but told as a story it is not understood in its concrete representation unless it connects with us as persons. I understand what loss is about, but simply portraying it in a game does not make it interesting. I've killed plenty of people in games without feeling a thing. It has to do with how you build around this deeply human occurrence. How do people react to this loss, how do they accept it and why? That Dragon, Cancer portrayed a similarly dark and hurtful story, in a similarly fragmented manner, and that hit me a lot harder than this did. Perhaps the looming threat of cancer is heavier than a shining light with the sound of a car crash cut into it. Perhaps the idea of a parent losing their child is heavier. But really I think it all has to do with execution. With the little things, not in the mundane sense, but in the way they all add up to the experience of an atmosphere, of a tone. The music, for example, was underwhelming. It was subdued by the voices, by the excessive talking.\n\nAnd this felt like the crutch of the game. They had a whole lot of writing, but not enough game, or environment, to fill it with, so they let it take the lead. To me the writing did not warrant this treatment, however. Nothing was bad about it, really, but I did not think it accomplished much on its own. It was talking about the mundane in a mundane manner. It was the voice of everyday people, saying everyday things, in the presence of the everyday death. With everyday acceptance, with everyday sadness, with everyday item-association coupled with the lost one triggering breakdown.\n\nWhy are people afraid to condemn death? Why do we have to be okay with what life is? Why should we be happy that we once got to know somebody that is no longer here? Why should a fragmented memory be a happy trace from a former existence, and not absolute torture, a taunting gesture? History is virtual, it is mere memory, it is a trace of warped anteriority, it does not retain its vividness nor its Whole, it does not retain its ability to interrogate, to know, to truly experience. It is gray. It is a diminution of power, it is death-oblivion. The only proper response is fear. But we accept with the mindset of progress so that we can move on, so that we can live our lives with neither hitch nor hindrance. None of our duties are existential, and it is perhaps a mistake to think that it ever should take priority. But at least in our supposed art, can we not express something beyond the everyday necessities? Or do we have to autistically turn in on ourselves and posit our inability to reach profundity as the epitome of the profound? Do we have to accept death? Anything in the name of functionality, yes!\n\nThis game is lacking indulgence, true indulgence. Extreme sadness, weeping and screaming in absolute panic, it lacks frustration; it lacks anger and an assault at the mundane, it lacks radicalism. It lacks color, it lacks composition and direction. Being true to humanity is not really an excuse for lack of beauty, the world is not without its texture, without its structural beauty, without its vibrant colors and warmth. The world is not expressionless, and it definitely have eyes. People are fleshed out, even strangers communicate with a certain depth as to who they might be, want to be or not to be. Fragments of Him is withholding information, among many things, and it is difficult to truly feel satisfied with my experience with this game.\n\nAt the same time I do not think the experience was worthless by any means. I value this game in some sense in what it was trying to do. I am seeing more and more games pop up that try this sort of thing, all with their own novelty and problems, but they are moving games into a direction that I think can be very special. I'd like to see some more gameplay elements, I'd like to see more than pointing and clicking that only serve to mess with the pace of the game. I'd like to see more care put into details, into fully fleshing out the important aspects of the game, such as the characters and their expressions, the writing, the music and the aesthetics that make up the atmosphere of the game. Because that is what will be remembered more so than each sentence, or the items you click on to progress; it is the entirety of the game which is remembered. Unless the game is well crafted in its entirety, it will be remembered for its fragmented, partial, positives removed from their whole, from their world, and will surely face oblivion faster than may have been hoped. Amovable positives do not last, only the actual subsist with perceived immutability. With people, as with detached positive traits, death-oblivion will infinitely encapsulate eventually, forever looming, taunting and gesticulating the actual with virtual presence. Acceptance of this fact is through your own volition.\n\nI think without cynicism, without expectation and without monetary limitations you can enjoy this experience for what it is. It has momentary beauty visually, hints at it sonically and has almost interesting things going on with its writing. The writing, however, or the theme of the game, is not something I can determine whether or not it will connect with other people. In terms of what it tries to be, known by what it claims to be, it succeeds. But does it try very hard? Is this game ambitious? That is also relative to ability, which is not something I can comment on. Basically, it is what it is, I am who I am, and in this case the parts did not mix very well, albeit not terribly. But I could not assume this to be true of anyone but myself, neither can I claim that it couldn't be true for anyone but myself. In the end I am just confessing to the pointlessness of my writing of this review. Fantastic.\n","May 3","true","2.0"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","18","31","0","0"

Don't expect much 'gameplay', it's a interactive story, not a action game. Think of it as of movie. A movie in which You are a part of, but only as a ghost following the characters. The storyline is very solid, but starts a little slow. Nevertheless, the issues are important - love, family, life, meaning, coping with loss. It resonates with everyone and gets really touching, especially in the end. You definitly can shed a few tears.\n\nMy one problem with Fragments of Him is... it's nothing new to the genre. Also - the story is 100% linear, you won't feel a need to play it again. It takes You around 2h to finish the whole game, so maybe wait on sale if you're not really sure about it.\n\nIt's a perfect game for a rainy sunday, when You just have 2h to spare. A cup of coffea. You can play it with one finger, resting on laptops touchpad. And you won't regret that 2 hours, but it's also nothing that will shake your world.\nI would call it a 7/10.\n\nDisclaimer: Fragments of Him is a story cointaing homosexual elements - I'm aware that some people can't relate to it or find it not amusing.

Led by the memories of three individuals, the narrative gently undulates through despair, hope, regret, and happiness, all triggered by objects, places, or moments in time. The dialogue is spoken with beautiful sincerity throughout, and it is a testament to both the script and the voice-acting that the player connects so quickly with the characters. The art-design is purposely muted and minimal, evoking a sense of time past as well as an existence within memory, and each of the environments succeed in creating an atmosphere which fits perfectly within each tale: from the choice of titles on bookshelves, to the comfortable familiarity of a suburban bungalow's back-garden.\n\nAllow yourself a couple of uninterrupted hours to immerse yourself in 'Fragments Of Him'. It is a stand-out example of how engaging and poignant a precisely-crafted story can be, and a lesson in what else can be offered and expressed within the incredibly broad world of gaming.","May 8","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's emotional, meaningful and profoundly tragic with characters seeming so real that they can pull you into the story and make you feel like you're a part of their lives. If you're interested in playing a calm, relaxing game with a deep, thought-provoking message that truly reflects humanity and reality, then I highly recommend "Fragments of Him".","May 3","true","2.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

When a young man suddenly dies, the three people closest to him share their memories of his life, and describe the process by which they have come to terms with his death. The player explores the different memories of the three people, discovering the regret and anger which surrounds their sudden berevement, but also the happiness they share of a cherished life.\n\nThis is where Fragments of Him excells; it manages to capture a piece of truly human drama, and the voice acting is superb in conveying the different ranges and levels of emotions which envelop grief. It may not be for everyone, it is indeed a slowly-paced narrative experience with little focus on gameplay, but it is nevertheless a powerful dramatic experience akin to a stage play. The art style as well is also fantastic in underpinning its central theme: this is an experience which we will all inevitabely take.\n\nOverall, Fragments of Him is an fantastically engaging piece of human drama which held me for its admitidly short running time. However, for the price, it was two and a half hours well spent, and I would recommend it for gamers out there who love narrative-focused adventures.","May 31","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a heartwarming story about love and hope, but also a heartbreaking story about loss and pain. I found myself fully immersed in the game and I suggest that anyone playing this game does so when you have 2-3 hours of free time. It is absolutely worth playing all the way through in a single session.\n\nThe developers did an excellent job on creating an emotional narrative, beautiful graphics and wonderful music. Everything helps build the connection with Will and his family, which you get to know quite well. In the end I felt like I truly knew the characters as if they were real. They share their thoughts, their silly little memories, their doubts and their pain. But what touched me the most, was that they all share their vulnerable moments with you. Everyone will recognise pieces of themselves in the characters of this game. I really hope that the next game from Sassybot is another great emotional narrative experience, because I have never played anything like this before and I'd like to play a lot more.","June 3","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am also going thru a difficult emotional time in my life. I "lost" someone recently and still getting past it. I'm still sorting thru the emotions and the memories; good and bad. This game will have you thinking about how you lived your life, what you've said and what you've done. I've looked back and taken a different perspective from those memories and emotions. I'm not saying this game will help or hurt anyone. I'm just saying that it can be an intense story for some people where that it may shift your thinking a little bit, if not totally impact you with so many emotions when you try to relate to the stories.","May 7","true","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
